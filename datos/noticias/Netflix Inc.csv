0;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-19T21:00:56Z;Netflix roars ahead thanks to captive audience;Streaming service reaches new highs ahead of earnings report as investors ignore its ‘junk’ rating;"Residents of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago woke up on March 20 to life under lockdown: for the first time in the coronavirus crisis, millions of Americans were ordered to stay home. That same morning, Netflix added seven new programmes to its platform — among them a docuseries about the lurid life of a zoo operator named Joe Exotic. In the next 10 days, Tiger King went on to become a smash hit, with more than 34m Americans tuning in, according to Nielsen.In results next Tuesday, Netflix will kick off an earnings season for media companies, giving investors the first comprehensive look at how the global pandemic has affected the entertainment business. For much of the past year, investors and Wall Street analysts had grown increasingly worried about Netflix’s negative cash flow, slowing US subscriber growth and lavish spending on content.Meanwhile, Disney soared, as chief executive Bob Iger pushed into Netflix’s territory with the launch of its own streaming service, called Disney+. Over the course of 2019, Disney’s stock price increased 35 per cent while Netflix shares gained 20 per cent, underperforming the broader stock market. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and this dynamic — like many others across the business world — has been flipped upside down. Three out of Disney’s four businesses are in peril, as theme parks and cinemas are shut and a slump in advertising hurts television. But Netflix, which does not run adverts, is benefiting from a surge in online streaming. Netflix has become one of the rare businesses that are not only surviving, but thriving, in the stay-at-home era. The group’s shares reached record highs this week as its market capitalisation jumped to $192bn, above that of corporate giants such as ExxonMobil and Cisco and neck-and-neck with Disney.The same pattern is playing out in bond markets. Netflix’s bonds are junk-rated, while Disney enjoys an A credit rating. But in the crisis, Disney’s borrowing costs have risen while Netflix’s have fallen. A 10.5 year Netflix bond now yields 3.6 per cent, down from a peak of almost 5 per cent last October. Remarkably, this is in the same range as the 10-year bond Disney clinched last month with a coupon of 3.8 per cent, despite the two companies’ wide disparity in credit rating.“I would rather be in Netflix [bonds] all day long at 4 per cent or sub-4 per cent,” than in traditional media, said Jack Parker, senior fixed income associate at asset manager Diamond Hill. “One of the backstops of this bond is the equity. The market cap on top of you is astronomical. And if you believe the debt is the first in the capital structure, which it is, it gives you a massive margin of safety.”Mr Parker said he believes “the stay at home demand is crazy . . . particularly for Netflix, which is the most popular thing in pop culture”.Bernstein analysts also argued the credit agencies “have got it backwards”, noting that they rate Netflix bonds at BB-, or “junk” level, while the struggling media group ViacomCBS is rated at BBB, giving it investment-grade status. But public markets are signalling ViacomCBS debt is riskier than Netflix. Recently issued ViacomCBS 10.5 year notes were priced at a 5.1 per cent yield, above the 4.5 per cent that Netflix’s equivalent bonds are trading. Netflix sceptics have always pointed to the frothy-seeming multiple of its shares and high debt load, neither of which have gone away. Despite trading about the same market value, Netflix made $20bn in annual revenue last year compared with Disney’s $70bn. A valuation of nine times sales is well above even other internet stocks. Amazon, for instance trades at four times its $280bn revenues. While Nielsen and other data providers have released figures depicting a skyrocketing in streaming during quarantine, Netflix is not immune to the economic destruction. As part of the lockdown, Hollywood lots went dark in March, delaying production of Netflix shows such as Stranger Things and The Witcher.In a prolonged shutdown, Netflix could run out of new programming, a problem the company has not previously had to cope with. Viewers might cancel their subscription and try another service. There is no shortage of alternatives, with two more streaming services, Comcast’s Peacock and Quibi, launched this month and another new rival — HBO Max — arriving next month. So far, Netflix has shown no signs of slowing its voracious release schedule. This week alone the company added 13 new shows and films, with another dozen scheduled for the rest of the month. Netflix may also be able to snap up other content on the cheap. Many Hollywood directors have previously clung to releasing their movies in theatres over streaming; but now, with cinemas shut indefinitely and theatre owners headed for bankruptcy, studios are scrambling to sell their movies to Netflix.The streaming company has seen an influx of pitches from movie studios in recent weeks, said people familiar with the matter, as producers look to at least make some return on their investment. On Tuesday, Netflix is expected to report it added 7.4m new subscribers in the three months ending in March. The company is also likely to reveal more details about its content pipeline during an analyst call with senior management. While Reed Hastings and other Netflix top brass typically pre-tape a video Q&A from the company’s offices, this time around they will dial in from home through Google Hangouts. Netflix typically taps the high-yield bond markets to fill its coffers in April and October, after first quarter and third-quarter earnings. To keep up that cadence, it is due for an issuance this month.Netflix ended 2019 with about $5bn on its balance sheet, and also holds a $750m credit line, which it has not drawn. Analysts expect that these backstops could get Netflix through the next six months to a year, if needed. Despite its cash pile, “Netflix may want to take advantage of [favourable yields] and access the market now”, said Neil Begley, senior analyst at Moody’s. “Who knows what’s around the corner?” "
1;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-08T16:26:36Z;Crip Camp uncovers a retreat for disabled teenagers with a potent legacy;New Netflix documentary revisits the American teens who summered together in 1971;How strange — and how telling — that despite the wealth of big-screen documentaries released in the past 20 years, the story behind the remarkable Crip Camp has gone so long untold. The style of the film is not so revelatory, a standard-issue mix of archive and talking heads. The subject matter is: Camp Jened, an oasis amid the pine trees of the Catskills mountains, where disabled teenagers from across America gathered to summer together in long-haired 1971.In fact, the camp had been running since the 1950s, but by now had blossomed under the leadership of hippie wisecracker Larry Allison into a festival of acceptance and self-expression. On one level, the only revolutionary thing going on was utter normality, a loose-fit schedule of swimming and dance nights. But something else was happening too, a spirit of the times more meaningful than army surplus and acoustic guitars, grounding camp-goers in grassroots democracy to leave a potent legacy long after the scent of patchouli faded.★★★★☆Available on Netflix
2;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-07T04:00:27Z;Netflix prison horror The Platform rings uncannily true today;Spanish director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia talks about his debut, which has gained resonance at a time of confinement and food shortages;"When I met Spanish film-maker Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia at the Macau International Film Festival in December, the world was a different place. An hour’s ferry ride across the water, a crackdown on mass demonstrations in Hong Kong was under way, and the UK and Europe were still convulsed with conflict over Brexit. However, neither of us could have guessed how the nightmare vision of his debut feature The Platform would take on such pointed relevance when it hit Netflix during the coronavirus outbreak.In the film, a young man Goreng (Iván Massagué) awakes to find himself on the 47th level of a vertical prison. Each cell has a hole in the floor and every day a food platform is lowered. The inmate on each successive level eats what they can before the table moves on, so the higher levels gorge themselves before the lower levels scrabble for leftovers. At first Goreng is incredulous and hopes for civility, but as each month he finds himself positioned at a different random level, barbarity and even cannibalism soon become the norm.The intended political message is all too clear, as the director confirms. “The biggest problem we have today is the sharing of wealth,” Gaztelu-Urrutia says. “It’s a problem we’ve had for 500 years. And it is a problem we will have 500 years in the future. It is not a film against one political or economic system, but more about the behaviour of individuals within that world. The movie is not out to change the world, but to change how you behave as an individual. If you were in this world, how would you behave? What would you do on level 6? Or what would you do if you were on level 200?”This great “what if” of the film feels far less abstract today than when we met. I am in northern Italy, having lived in lockdown for weeks while Gaztelu-Urrutia in Spain is likewise secluded. On the news, we see different reactions to the crisis: from the panic buying of provisions to singing from the balconies, and The Platform’s portrayal of confinement feels very close to home.The food in the film begins as a sumptuous feast, worthy of a Flemish still life or a MasterChef final. “We wanted to make an idealisation of the food,” the director says. “We wanted to show decadent opulence. It is completely different from the rest of the prison, which is grey and geometric and not very human. The food is the opposite. The food is the only thing that has colour in the movie.”That, and the blood that begins to flow. But although the film has gruesome similarities with high-concept horror films such as Saw and The Cube, Gaztelu-Urrutia looked closer to home for his chief inspiration, The Exterminating Angel. In Buñuel’s 1962 surrealist masterpiece, a dinner party becomes an endless ordeal when the guests discover they are unable to leave. The sense of isolation and social distance is all too potent in both films. It also sets up a test of values that resembles the ethical issues surrounding panic-buying. Goreng works out that if everyone takes only their fair share, there will be enough food to reach the lowest levels. His mission to enforce his scheme comes to resemble a gory Quixotic crusade.Yet for all its brutality the film ends on a note that is not entirely bleak. “You go down, down, down and there’s no hope, so we had to show some hope at the end,” Gaztelu-Urrutia tells me. “But the most important thing is not to change the world but to change yourself. That is the real victory of the movie.” It is a lesson that we are now learning in reality.

3;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;US society needs a broadband big dig to get out of its hole;Overhauling the internet’s infrastructure would create jobs and reduce poverty;Almost nothing is growing these days, with one exception: internet use.Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen the sort of uptick in broadband usage that you’d expect to see over the course of years.Italy, Spain and the UK have all had high double-digit increases in traffic. In the US, data usage via the cable company Comcast is up 32 per cent nationwide, and by over 60 per cent in locked-down cities. Verizon had a 75 per cent increase in gaming traffic in just one week in mid-March.No wonder network latency, or the time it takes for data to travel, is a major issue. New York, San Diego, San Jose and Houston are all experiencing declines in download speeds. Just try watching a Netflix or Amazon video after dinner and you’ll see what I mean.With bricks and mortar businesses closed, and ecommerce booming, there’s little doubt that the transition to a digital economy will be dramatically sped up by coronavirus. The richest and most powerful tech companies, from Amazon to Google, will undoubtedly be even stronger post-crisis than before.Meanwhile, entire sectors of the economy, including retail, commercial real estate, and many parts of the travel and tourism sector, won’t come back anytime soon — if they come back at all.These areas were among the strongest job creators in recent years. In the last US jobs report, issued before the virus hit, restaurants were the second fastest growing category. But now we’ve come through a second record week of unemployment claims, and Congress is busy trying to craft yet another multitrillion dollar stimulus package.Legislators are rightly discussing support for everything from greener forms of transport such as passenger rail, to highway and bridge repair. As everyone knows, America’s infrastructure is woefully inadequate, and money for major public spending programmes has never been cheaper. But there’s also a case to be made for a public works programme that would make high-speed fixed broadband an essential infrastructure, just like water or electricity.Let me be very clear: a major infrastructure spending programme isn’t a substitute for short-term emergency aid. Millions of individuals and small businesses will need debt write-offs (and not just loans), as well as grants and other cash infusions over the next few weeks and months.Even so, unemployment is likely to remain elevated for a year or more, until a vaccine can be developed and normal travel and labour patterns resumed.A broadband infrastructure programme would kill several birds with one stone.For starters, a “big dig” to install broadband fibre, the most robust and resilient kind of broadband connectivity, would focus on the kind of work that can be done soonest in the midst of a pandemic, namely large scale, protected, outdoor projects.It could employ and deliver needed services to some of the most vulnerable Americans. Only about half of those with incomes of $30,000 or less have broadband at home. Nearly 68 per cent of those live in rural areas. Others include urban poor who can’t afford the $72 national average cost for the internet (it’s more than $100 in many cities).Many people who cannot work from home are falling into poverty, and children who cannot access virtual curricula are falling behind in school. This is nothing less than a national security issue. The internet is almost the only thing that has kept the economy and society functioning over the past few weeks. Imagine if it went down the next time around.There are several challenges to installing universal broadband in the US. Coverage is currently provided via a patchwork of local monopolies.In addition, a dysfunctional political economy is at work: state politicians in hock to large companies can prevent cities or rural areas from accessing public funds to hire competitors to build out networks. In recent years, private companies in the telecoms and tech sectors have also opted to do share buybacks rather than invest in costly infrastructure.But money shouldn’t be an issue here. Even before the coronavirus crisis, the Federal Communications Commission had allocated $20bn to broadband expansion, on top of hundreds of millions from the Department of Agriculture. More cash will very likely be allotted in a future stimulus bill. This could be used to prompt telecoms providers to keep workers on the job and employ more to build new services and improve existing ones.Money could also be given to local municipalities to build their own systems, like the 1935 Rural Electrification Administration programme that transformed America’s heartland and increased productivity for decades.Costs should be shouldered by the private sector too. Public debt may seem not to matter now, but it will someday. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — the so-called “FAANG” companies — are the heaviest generators of internet traffic, and have far higher profit margins than telecoms. Already brimming with cash, they will emerge from the crisis even richer and more dominant than before.If there was ever a time for a digital tax on the data wealth that these companies currently harvest for free, it’s now.If we allow another financial crisis to pass without forcing the richest companies to do their part for the national interest — and that means more than delivering toilet paper — we will see a further erosion of trust in both the public and private sector. That is something that we truly cannot afford.rana.foroohar@ft.comFollow Rana Foroohar with myFT and on Twitter
4;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-03T10:41:01Z;Tiger King: a human zoo for all the family;Facing an amorphous viral threat, we flock to a bizarre show offering the more tangible terror of tooth and claw;The great solace of this period of enforced quarantine, or so we are told, has been the opportunity to “reconnect with loved ones”. I can’t speak for families everywhere, but I suspect that for many in the UK, at least, “reconnecting” is code for long nights spent in front of the television.Much has been written about how on-demand streaming services have killed off old-fashioned “appointment to view” TV — the kind where the nation sat down as one to watch the same show at the same time, flicking on our kettles in unison to make tea during the ad breaks and causing surges in electricity demand.It seems quaint now to think back to 1996, when 24m people tuned in for the denouement of the Only Fools and Horses Christmas trilogy, a record for a single showing of a non-documentary programme. These days it is basically only sport, royal weddings and televised talent shows that lure us to watch live, and even then in smaller numbers. The final of The Great British Bake Off gets a fraction of the audiences drawn in the day that Del Boy and Rodney finally become millionaires.But now here we are: the whole country stuck at home with nothing to do but make toast and fight over the remote. Maybe it’s no shock that cult TV is even more compelling.As usual, we are taking our lead from the Americans. Still, it’s a bit surprising that the show which has captured imaginations is a seven-part documentary about rivalries between wild animal enthusiasts in the US.Since its release two weeks ago, at about the time many countries were imposing stricter social distancing measures, Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness has shot to number one on Netflix’s “most-watched” chart on both sides of the Atlantic. The streaming service sells the show as a “murder-for-hire story from the underworld of big cat breeding” — or, as one of its directors put it, “Imagine Breaking Bad, but instead of dealing meth, they’re dealing exotic animals.” Perfect family viewing, then.Having recently moved to live at my parents’ farm, I was eager to do my bit to boost morale. In this spirit, I suggested to my mother, my stepfather (the farmer) and two of my brothers that we give Tiger King a go, along with hordes of fellow self-isolators. It will be like watching the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, I thought to myself. Bringing us all together. It wasn’t.I texted my 25-year-old sister. Did she want to join remotely from her London flat? The reply was swift and scornful: “I’m surprised you haven’t seen it already,” she told the family WhatsApp group. “It’s all anyone is talking about. So hot right now.”Social media suggests this is true. Even Britain’s venerable Royal Academy of Arts is in on the craze, Photoshopping the show’s anti-hero, Joe Exotic, into Henri Rousseau’s painting of a tiger in a tropical storm.Tiger King follows the travails of Mr Exotic, a big cat breeder from Oklahoma, described by one rival as a “completely insane, gay, gun-toting, drug addict fanatic”. His mortal enemy, Carole Baskin, dressed in leopard print, runs a dodgy-looking rescue centre that doesn’t seem a million miles away from the establishments she is dedicated to closing down.The show sets out to be an exposé of unregulated roadside zoos, in the style of Blackfish, the 2013 film about captive orcas. But somewhere along the line, a lurid cast of characters (they make Succession’s sociopathic Roy family look like the Brady Bunch) took over the narrative. Mr Exotic is now serving a 22-year jail sentence after hiring a hit man to kill Ms Baskin. He, in turn, accuses her of feeding her missing millionaire ex-husband to his own tigers.Conservationists have mixed emotions. Tiger King has won praise for bringing to light the horrific conditions in which wild creatures are kept in makeshift zoos. Anyone buying a tiger cub from the back of a van, can start their own. And many do fuel the trade — there are more captive tigers in the US than there are wild ones globally.But animal welfare is hardly the show’s motivating force, says Lucy Cooke, a zoologist, writer and documentary maker. One reason it is hard to get films made about conservation, she says, is the stories are depressing. “There’s a huge amount of drama in them. It’s a war out there.” Tiger King finds a way around that: “It’s a freak show, which is why it’s so popular. It’s a human zoo that you are watching.”Perhaps, as the world faces an amorphous viral threat, it is natural to crave the more visceral terror of tooth and claw.Not everyone agrees. After 88 minutes my stepdad gets up. “I can’t watch any more, it’s too horrible,” says the man who earlier the same day, with his bare hands, tore open the amniotic sac of a calf as it slithered from the birth canal.I know what he means.cordelia.jenkins@ft.com
5;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Netflix or Amazon? Fashion TV goes head to head;Streaming leaders are competing for the ultimate in ‘quarantine TV’ with rival series;"Christian Siriano, the American designer whose career was launched by reality show Project Runway, and who now serves as the show’s on-screen mentor, is currently sewing surgical face masks in bulk for the governor of New York.This sentence would have been unthinkable just a few weeks ago. But as Covid-19 has swept the world, the unthinkable has become a daily reality.While Siriano has diverted his attention from red carpet gowns to masks, fans of the show that kick-started his career will find themselves with plenty of television to while away their hours at home. Project Runway, the 15-year-old, mass-market show in which fashion moguls such as Michael Kors and Zac Posen judge the work of aspiring designers through a series of contests, has now spawned two streaming service copycats — including a new series on Amazon that Entertainment Weekly described as “first rate quarantine TV”.Even as Hollywood productions have halted, streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ have enough feel-good content to dole out for months. The amount of time people spend streaming surged 20 per cent globally from March 9-23, with daytime watching up nearly 40 per cent, according to analytics company Conviva.Among our quarantined television options is the 18th season of Project Runway, this time anchored by supermodel Karlie Kloss; Next in Fashion, a Netflix reimagining of it starring Queer Eye’s Tan France and model Alexa Chung; and finally Amazon’s version, Making the Cut, which is led by former Project Runway stars Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn.I asked the original creator of Project Runway why fashion is having a television moment now, nearly two decades after his idea debuted on US cable channel Bravo and became a cult favourite.Eli Holzman recalls that demand for his initial concept — a reality show in which aspiring fashion designers compete — was not met with enthusiasm.“When we were booking Project Runway initially, most designers turned us down. Reality TV was a bad word and they didn’t want to be associated with it,” says Holzman.But now, as we are at the all-time peak of television production, that dynamic has changed. Project Runway is a “proven franchise” Holzman points out, making it a safer bet for streaming companies as they splash out billions of dollars on programming in a frenetic industry-wide battle for subscribers.The new generation of fashion TV is looking to revive an ailing format as Project Runway’s ratings have deteriorated. This season’s March finale drew 1.4m viewers, ranking it the 12th most watched US cable telecast that day — trailing Fox News’ Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson.Project Runway has a mostly refreshed cast. But even the newcomers are beholden to a surprisingly rigid format. Kloss studiously recites the same script that her predecessor Klum did 16 years ago. “In fashion, you are in, or you are out,” she pronounces in the first minutes of every episode.The repetition can be stale. But at a time like this, the familiarity is also oddly comforting, like curling up in a worn blanket with a time capsule to the 2000s.In contrast, Netflix’s Next in Fashion might be a bit too modern. From the first few minutes of episode one, there is a premium placed on anything to do with fame or social media.Netflix’s competition is more cheerful than Project Runway, which is often laced with dramatic infighting and tearful breakdowns. Producer Yasmin Shackleton has said her goal was for the show to be “accessible and relatable”, and indeed, Next In Fashion is more like a TV version of the “positive vibes” posts that still proliferate across Instagram.We speak to Ira Glass, host of the hit podcast ‘This American Life’, about reporting during Covid-19. How do you tell the stories of ordinary people without leaving home? What does American life look like today? Listen hereDesigners are given professional seamstresses, and the contestants are more experienced than their Project Runway counterparts, with several having already worked on high-profile lines such as Stella McCartney and Jay-Z’s Rocawear. The designers often prove more capable than the hosts. In the most widely followed episode, a streetwear challenge, Chung came under fire for telling black designers that their work was “not her cup of tea”. Guest judge Kerby Jean-Raymond, of Pyer Moss, walks off set as France and Chung pushed for the elimination of Kiki Kitty and Farai Simoyi, two black women who have designed streetwear for decades.Amazon’s Making the Cut, which debuted on March 27, strikes a more similar tone to Project Runway — albeit with a much bigger budget. When Project Runway, which Gunn and Klum hosted for 16 seasons, changed cable networks in 2018, the two stars decided to jump ship, choosing Amazon as their new home, where they were offered more freedom — and money.Amazon’s deep pockets are evident in every aspect of the show. The prize pot of $1m is quadruple that of its rivals’. The very first episode features a lavish runway show for contestants, set against the Eiffel Tower in Paris’s night sky — a level of extravagance that Project Runway could not have managed.Both Amazon and Netflix are trying to catapult these designers into real commercial success — a feat that Project Runway, apart from Siriano, has failed to achieve. As part of Netflix’s prize, the winner, designer Minju Kim, is selling her clothes on Net-a-Porter.Amazon has taken this a step further. As with most things Jeff Bezos, Making the Cut goes beyond simply a TV show — it looks to envelop us further into the Amazon machine. Prime members can watch the show on Amazon.com, and then buy the winning pieces and have them shipped home for free.But behind the glamour, all this begs the question: does it make sense for Amazon and Netflix to make these shows at all? There is almost definitely not enough demand to justify three near-identical series; such is the nature of the current streaming wars.But it ultimately does not matter as much how many people watch these programmes; streaming companies are not beholden to the same business model of selling advertising based on ratings. Rather, they care about giving their subscribers fresh content.Amazon and Netflix are trying to catapult these designers into real commercial successIn the current environment “everybody is just throwing stuff against the wall, hoping to see how it will work,” says Cyma Zarghami, the former head of Nickelodeon.Netflix has barrelled into reality TV in recent months, with dating shows such as The Circle and Love is Blind. Fashion was another logical step, and unscripted TV is much cheaper to produce.For Amazon, which makes most of its $280bn in annual revenues from online retail, the lavish push into reality TV may help buy its way into the proper fashion business. Luxury fashion has much higher margins than the plain socks and underwear that Amazon hawks through its online store.We don’t know yet if either of these new shows will achieve what Project Runway has failed to do consistently: launch the next great fashion label. And we may never know how many people even watched these programmes, because streaming companies rarely reveal viewership data.Nonetheless it helped me pass the time during a bizarre moment in history. The same can be said for millions of other people, who are being tethered even more to the companies serving bingeable programming.For Amazon and Netflix, that is probably enough.Follow @financialtimesfashion on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first.

6;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-03-20T15:00:28Z;YouTube, Amazon and Netflix cut picture quality in Europe;Move comes in response to calls to reduce strain on internet links as tens of millions work and take classes from home;Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime, three of the world’s largest online video services, are taking the unprecedented step of reducing picture quality in Europe to ease pressure on broadband networks.The internet groups are responding to calls by the European Commission and some European telecoms companies to prevent internet congestion, as more people work and take classes at home during the coronavirus pandemic.YouTube is the world’s most popular video site with more than 2bn users tuning in every month, while Netflix had more than 160m viewers worldwide at the end of last year, including tens of millions across Europe.“We are making a commitment to temporarily default all traffic in the EU to standard definition,” YouTube said on Friday. It later added that traffic in the UK would also be curtailed, pointing to “ongoing conversations” with regulators including Ofcom. Hours earlier, Netflix said that “given the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus”, it would temporarily throttle its data throughput too, meaning that some viewers would see a degradation in picture quality, in the hopes of reducing its traffic by a quarter.Amazon on Friday added that it had “already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates whilst maintaining a quality streaming experience for our customers” in Europe. The unprecedented demand for streaming services to curtail their bandwidth usage is a sign of how concerned the authorities are that broadband networks will quickly become overloaded, as millions of office workers and school children turn to live video streaming at home.Last week, Telecom Italia reported a 70 per cent surge in internet traffic over its landline network as Italy went into lockdown, saying a “big contribution” came from online games such as Fortnite. Spanish telecoms operators have warned of a “traffic explosion”. However, in the UK, BT has insisted that its network will be able to cope with the increased demand. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said this week that WhatsApp was seeing a sustained surge in usage that went “well beyond” seasonal peaks such as New Year’s Day. European Commissioner Thierry Breton met this week with Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, Alphabets chief Sundar Pichai and Susan Wojcicki, who runs Google-owned YouTube.Mr Breton welcomed their responses. “Millions of Europeans are adapting to social distancing measures thanks to digital platforms, helping them to telework, e-learn and entertain themselves,” he said.“People are coming to YouTube to find authoritative news, learning content and make connections during these uncertain times. While we have seen only a few usage peaks, we have measures in place to automatically adjust our system to use less network capacity,” YouTube said. “We will continue our work to minimise stress on the system, while also delivering a good user experience.”Defaulting to standard definition, rather than the high definition that most viewers with good internet connections have become used to in recent years, could cut the data required to watch a video by more than half. However, YouTube viewers can still opt for HD quality. “Netflix has decided to begin reducing bit rates across all our streams in Europe for 30 days,” the company said. “We estimate that this will reduce Netflix traffic on European networks by around 25 per cent while also ensuring a good quality service for our members.”Amazon said: “We support the need for careful management of telecom services to ensure they can handle the increased internet demand with so many people now at home full-time due to COVID-19. Prime Video is working with local authorities and Internet Service Providers where needed to help mitigate any network congestion.” 
7;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-02-27T20:27:40Z;Few winners emerge after brutal stock sell-off;Netflix, Clorox and drugmakers weather market rout sparked by coronavirus;Netflix, Clorox and Gilead Sciences are among the mere handful of winners in the S&P 500 during a market rout this week, as investors back companies most likely to weather economic fallout from a potential pandemic.The S&P 500 has dipped into correction territory just six days after securing a record high, reflecting mounting worries over the spread of coronavirus. The latest sell-off extended the benchmark index’s decline this week to more than 8 per cent, which would mark its steepest drop since the financial crisis.Only five companies have managed to post a week-to-date gain by Thursday afternoon.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has been the top performer with a 10.4 per cent rise, as the company races to develop treatments for coronavirus. In early February, Regeneron said it was expanding a partnership with the US Department of Health and Human Services and treatments could be made available for testing or “compassionate use” within a few months.Shares in Gilead, whose antiviral drug remdesivir is the subject of a clinical trial for the treatment of Covid-19, have jumped 5.9 per cent.Clorox, known for its disinfecting wipes and other cleaning products, and CME Group are each up more than 3 per cent.Netflix is another unsurprising member of the winners’ circle, with the streaming video giant positioned to remain a fixture on consumers’ screens if offices or schools are forced to close. Shares are up 0.8 per cent this week and about 18 per cent year-to-date.Although they are down for the week, Steris and Quest Diagnostics have notably outperformed the broader market. Steris, which makes sterilisation equipment and other products for medical providers, is down just 0.6 per cent. Quest, a clinical lab, has fallen by the same margin.The utilities sector, considered a defensive play in equities, has recorded the slimmest decline this week at minus 7 per cent. Consumer staples, healthcare and real estate have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500, while energy has registered the steepest decline at 15 per cent.

This week, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, a South Korean masterpiece, became the first foreign language film to earn the industry’s top prize. And William Wellman’s 1927 aviation epic Wings, the last of the great silent movies, won the first ever Oscars. These two films, separated by more than 90 years, both emerged at a time of convulsive change brought on by disruptive technology, shifts in consumer behaviour and a reassessment of how to value creative intellectual property.The year Wings was released, new recording technology ushered in the talkies, changing Hollywood forever. Parasite is a bellwether of an arguably greater change, propelled by translation algorithms and an unsustainable war among rival TV streaming services. Each media earnings announcement from Hollywood and Silicon Valley highlights the ferocious competition among Disney+, Hulu, Alphabet’s YouTube TV and AT&T’s WarnerMedia; the investment needed to compete with Netflix (167m global subscribers) and Amazon Prime (150m subscribers) also becomes evident. Netflix alone expects to burn through $2.5bn this year.For content producers worldwide, it has become at once more difficult to bet on a winning production and, theoretically, easier to put content in front of new audiences. Parasite’s triumph belongs indisputably to Mr Bong, but he shares some credit with the new power of the globalised sofa. Content has never been so kingly. That is why Totoro and Spirited Away creator Studio Ghibli has embraced HBO and Netflix and why Colombian production companies with 72-part telenovelas are reassessing their newly global potential. Thousands of content companies are scrambling to find a place. Asian groups could find themselves especially well positioned given their massive output and, in Japan’s case, under-exploited back catalogue.In the analysis of Parasite’s success, much will be made of the forces harnessed under the Netflix umbrella. Justifiably so. The Californian media company, its role as a studio, its new habit of exposing people to unfamiliar television and the way it has normalised the “pull” model of content delivery are all critical. US and worldwide audiences can browse and consume Belgian detective drama, Spanish biopics, Chinese reality shows and German cyber-thrillers with increasing indifference to origin. Language has become a surmountable barrier; subtitles are irrelevant. This audience consumes everything — from commentary on Instagram food pics to WeChat updates on the Oscar ceremony — as a jostling assault of images and words. Script along the bottom of a screen is nothing.Mr Bong — and South Korean films more broadly — clearly understood this and directly benefited from Netflix’s expanding ambitions. In 2017, his Netflix-backed adventure Okja competed for the Palme d’Or at Cannes. The film industry-heavy audience booed when the Netflix logo appeared, but gave the film a four-minute standing ovation. Parasite is also part of a highly successful “Korean wave” of exports centred on music and drama and on the success of media giants CJ E&M and SM Entertainment. Even without Netflix, Korean soap operas have resonated famously well in China, Japan and much of south-east Asia. BTS, the world’s most lucrative touring band of 2019 with revenues of $196m and the current flag-bearers of Korean pop, has sold out Los Angeles’ Rose Bowl, London’s Twickenham and Barcelona’s Olympic stadium as part of a world tour that begins in April.Underlying this has been a double recognition by South Korean producers: their entertainment IP can be tweaked to have a distinct, rising value overseas and technology now allows them to pump it cheaply and accessibly to couch potatoes worldwide. It is too early to project how far this might go. The export revenues of South Korea’s “cultural contents” industry (including games, film, animation, drama and music) nearly reached $9bn in 2017 (the most recent government figures). That is almost the same as the global sales of Japan’s Nintendo in the financial year that ended in March 2019.South Korea’s relatively small domestic market imbues its export efforts with greater vigour, says one agent who works closely with Asian music acts around the world. As Japan’s population shrinks, a similar shift of mindset may take hold across its games, music and animation industries.That in turn could awaken a giant with even greater potential if the Netflix-Amazon-Disney streaming wars continue to spray around financial ordnance. Nintendo’s portfolio of characters is regarded as the most valuable that Disney does not already own. The Japanese group said this month that it was readying a Mario movie for the global market as it prepared to abandon its insistence on limiting its most valuable character to games.Japan as a whole — along with everyone else — may need to get a bit more Korean if it wants to maximise profits from the globalised sofa.leo.lewis@ft.com"
9;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hinted darkly at a shake-up. Should the BBC try to move to Netflix-style subscriptions, as some pundits suggest? Anyone looking at Netflix’s cash flow would say no. It is easy to get swept up in the glamour of the US streaming service. Netflix has won Oscars, bagged 150m subscribers and has an equity value of $148bn. The UK public service broadcaster is an equally well-known brand name. But it has been hurt by scandals and has lost viewers to Netflix. In theory it could try to become the next advert-free global streaming service. In practice, this would be a disasterThe BBC, sometimes known as “Auntie” in the UK, funds television shows, films, news and radio through a £154.50 annual licence that is mandatory for UK households with a TV. Last year it made £3.7bn from this plus another £1.2bn from commercial and other activities. Netflix charges subscriptions and issues debt. Last year revenues hit $20bn. But Netflix’s strategy of outspending rivals is expensive. It expects to report negative cash flow of $2.5bn this year in spite of a fee rise. In addition to $10bn in long-term debt, Netflix has $19bn in content obligations and up to $5bn in off-balance sheet debt.The BBC does not have access to such financing. In the short term it is more likely to lose revenue. More than 13m households in the UK are signed up to a streaming service, according to Ofcom. Almost 26m households pay for a TV licence. If the BBC had 13m subscribing households it would lose £1.7bn in annual fees.Raising fees to make up for the loss would be tricky when rivals are offering cut-price deals. To compete the BBC would need to concentrate on overseas customers, cutting back on services such as news, music, Radio 4 and BBC 2 in favour of flagship shows like Doctor Who. There would be technical obstacles, too. A Netflix-like online log-in would not work because the majority of British households do not watch TV online.Ending the licence fee would free the BBC from the incessant criticism of commercial rivals and the hostility of politicians irked by its tough interviewers and objective reporting. But there is no merit in switching to a new funding model that is not even sustainable for its disruptive rival.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

Just not in the right area.Apparently I was one of 76m people who watched the fantasy show The Witcher in the first four weeks of its release, which would make it the biggest debut for a Netflix TV series ever. I don't know how many people felt like me — that this was a pale imitation of Game of Thrones — and stopped streaming just as I did in the first half hour, but it may have been many millions as well. Netflix's new metrics count you as a viewer of a series even if you have only watched two minutes of a single episode.Anyway, what was more concerning for investors was US subscriber numbers. Netflix added only 420,000 in the fourth quarter — below its guidance for 600,000 and well behind the 1.5m it added in the same period a year ago. It blamed price increases and competition from other streaming services.The rivalry in its home market is intensifying all the time, with AppleTV+ and Disney+ launching and Peacock due in the summer. Analysts at Wedbush expect subscriber growth to “stall to a very slow crawl”, with only 1.5m added in the whole of 2020 in the US and Canada, compared to 23m additions internationally. If the US video streaming saga is getting more interesting, so too is the music one. Anna Nicolaou's scoop reveals Amazon Music has passed 55m users, nearly all of them paying subscribers. This makes it a serious contender in a market historically dominated by Spotify and Apple. Apple last summer said it had 60m subscribers to Apple Music, while Spotify remains the market leader with 113m paying subscribers. Analysts says Amazon has been appealing to a different segment of the market, opening up new, older households to streaming. 1. Saudi Arabia implicated in Jeff Bezos phone hack
From extraordinary numbers to extraordinary tales. After the Amazon boss and Washington Post owner exchanged mobile phone numbers at a dinner with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman's WhatsApp account was used to hack Jeff Bezos's handset. That's according to a forensic report seen by the FT, which says the hack allowed troves of data to be uploaded from the phone. Saudi Arabia says this is “absurd”. The journalist Jamal Khashoggi, murdered by Saudi operatives, was a columnist for the Washington Post, whose proprietor had commissioned an investigation into how the National Inquirer tabloid got details of his extramarital affair with former TV presenter Lauren Sanchez. The UN says this looks like “an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post’s reporting on Saudi Arabia”.2. Vodafone hangs up on Libra
The mobile phone operator has becomethe eighth backer to abandon Libra, Facebook’s digital currency initiative, saying it would focus on its own mobile money payments service, M-Pesa as a means to extending financial inclusion. It said it would not rule out the possibility of future co-operation with Libra.3. Deliveroo hanging on over funding
Deliveroo is facing a funding squeeze at the same time as its biggest British rival in online food apps, Just Eat, has been strengthened by its Takeaway.com merger. Tim Bradshaw reports investors are worried it may start to run low on capital later this year if it cannot close a funding deal with Amazon that has been held up by a competition investigation.

Davos digital disputes
The US threatened to put “arbitrary” tariffs on UK car exports as the war of words between the two countries over digital services taxes heated up on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum's meeting. Rana Foroohar is there and reports that 2020 will be a year when the EU tries to bring the big US tech companies to heel.5. The indisputably important world of digital twins
Digital twins — virtual copies of the real world that help with simulations — are one of the biggest trends in technology and the subject of John Thornhill's latest column. He cites examples such as UK retailer Marks and Spencer, which is increasingly using in-store sensors to create digital twins of its retail space. It can then use those data models to optimise its stores’ physical layout, monitor the temperature of its meat coolers and keep an eye on queues at its checkouts.What fundraising chill? The thirst for unicorns remains strong. SoftBank-backed Tokopedia, an Indonesian ecommerce start-up, has swerved the WeWork debacle prompting a global reset in investor thinking about fast-growing tech groups. Read the FT’s scoop about its $1.5bn pre-IPO fundraising in this week’s Tech Scroll Asia.Cruise, the self-driving unit of General Motors, unveiled its first autonomous electric vehicle on Tuesday, claiming it could be built “at roughly half the cost” of a conventional car. The minivan-like Origin was unveiled in San Francisco, reports Patrick McGee, and lacks pedals or a steering wheel and is designed for ride-pooling. The company has not set a timeline for commercial deployment or disclosed how many it plans to build. Cruise’s launch event focused on the design of the shuttle-like vehicle, including its significant interior space and the “superhuman sensing performance” that enables its sensors to see in the dark and through fog.

13;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-01-21T21:36:38Z;Netflix’s US subscriber growth slows amid heightened sector competition;Non-US viewers help streaming service top analyst forecasts, but domestic market drags;"A slowdown in the US continues to weigh on Netflix’s subscriber growth as it faces an onslaught of new competition. Netflix added 8.8m subscribers in the final three months of 2019, eclipsing its guidance for 7.6m and analyst forecasts for 7.9m. This was welcome news for the first quarter that the streaming group competed head-on with Disney and Apple, which launched rival services in November. However in the US, its largest market, Netflix added only 420,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter — below its guidance for 600,000 and well behind the 1.5m it added in the same period a year ago. Netflix blamed the US weakness on price increases last year and new competition from rival streaming launches. The company also warned that this softening in its home market would weigh on results for the current quarter. Netflix shares were little changed in after-hours trading. As the entertainment industry looks to streaming as the future of its business, the largest media companies are battling for market share in this new landscape. Traditional media groups Disney, Comcast’s NBCUniversal and AT&T’s WarnerMedia are all launching their own streaming services, bringing new competition to the market that Netflix pioneered. Investors are concerned about Netflix losing steam in America amid the sea of new streaming options. Blistering subscriber growth has been a crucial part of Netflix’s pitch to investors, who have driven up its share price in recent years. But sentiment cooled on the company last summer after it lost quarterly subscribers in the US for the first time since 2011.Tuesday’s results did little to allay those fears. Netflix said it expects to add 7m new subscribers through the end of March this year; a slowdown from the 9.6m new subscribers in the first quarter of 2019 as more US customers cancel their subscriptions.While analysts have fretted, Netflix executives have downplayed the impact of the “streaming wars”. In a letter to shareholders on Tuesday, the company said that Netflix has “a big head start in streaming”, while noting that despite the debut of Disney+ and Apple TV+, Netflix subscribers continue to watch more hours of programming. More than 76m subscribers watched the fantasy show The Witcher in the first four weeks of its release, Netflix claims, which would make it the biggest debut for a Netflix TV series ever. Netflix has looked to compensate for its US slowdown by emphasising faster growth elsewhere, such as Asia and Latin America. However profit margins are slimmer in these countries, where Netflix charges lower prices. On average, subscribers in the US and Canada bring Netflix $13.22 in revenue, while that number drops to $8.18 in Latin America and $9.07 in Asia-Pacific. “International subscription growth will not support Netflix valuations,” said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham. She predicts that Netflix will lose 4m US subscribers this year, as it faces competition from cheaper new streaming services. Netflix uses debt to help pay for its heavy spending on content as it races to build an enticing catalogue of TV shows and films. Long-term debt stood at $14.8bn at the end of December, up from $10.4bn at the end of 2018. Netflix expects it will burn $2.5bn in cash this year, an improvement from negative cash flow of $3.3bn in 2019. Revenues in the quarter jumped 31 per cent to $5.5bn, just above consensus forecasts for $5.45bn. Net income rose to $587m, boosted by a tax benefit."
14;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-01-21T16:50:18Z;UK to push on with digital tax in face of US anger;Trump officials threaten tariffs if London does not back down;The UK and US were on a collision course over digital tax after Washington threatened retaliatory tariffs if the British government did not back down on plans to impose the levy from April.A spokesperson for prime minister Boris Johnson said the British government, which is set to start talks with Washington over a post-Brexit trade deal next month, would go ahead with plans to introduce the new tax. The US claims the levy unfairly discriminates against technology companies including Google and Amazon.“We have consulted extensively on our digital services tax and have sought to design it in a proportionate way,” the spokesperson said.The UK’s stance contrasted with that of France which this week appeared to have struck a compromise with the US over plans by Paris to introduce a similar tax. Washington has threatened to place tariffs on $2.4bn of French goods such as wine as early as this month if Paris did not back down.Steven Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, warned in Davos that plans by other European countries, including the UK and Italy, would have serious repercussions if they did not back down.“They’ll find themselves faced with President Trump’s tariffs. We’ll be having similar conversations with them,” he said.The UK government has repeatedly said it would introduce such a tax in April. It hopes this will raise almost £500m a year and has included the revenues in public finance projections.It comes as Mr Johnson’s new government prepares to start trade negotiations with Washington next month after the UK has left the EU in the hope of securing a fast-track deal.Mr Trump made an oblique reference to further trade wars to threaten other countries in his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking about his phase one trade deal with China, which left tariffs in place but ended the escalation of the trade war, he said: “These achievements would not have been possible without the implementation of tariffs, which we had to use. We’ll be using them on others too.”The UK has drafted the legislation for the tax which will be levied at 2 per cent of revenues from UK users for companies that have more than £500m in digital revenues worldwide and over £25m from UK activities.Similar to France, Britain has said repeatedly that it would prefer an international agreement at the OECD to change the way corporate taxes work on a global level and would remove the UK digital services tax once that agreement was in force.Mr Johnson was set to hold talks on Tuesday afternoon in Number 10 with Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, ostensibly about the company’s plans to hire 1,000 more people in the UK by the end of 2020.A Downing Street spokesperson said the pair were due to discuss the new jobs as well as attempts to prevent harmful content online. He was unable to say whether Mr Johnson was going to raise the issue of the looming digital sales tax.Implementing digital taxes has been seen as an attempt in many countries to put greater pressure on striking an international accord. Those talks, however, hit an impasse in December when Mr Mnuchin wrote to the OECD saying he wanted the new rules to be optional, something that would effectively kill the proposals as it could exempt the US tech giants such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.The French have insisted the global agreement must be mandatory. A view that has the support of the IMF.“We believe it’s important for this to be a multilateral agreement that is multilaterally enforced,” said Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist.Although there is no sign of any breakthrough in the OECD talks, the sentiment around the negotiations improved at the start of this week with a renewed attempt between the US and France to avoid a trade dispute.France agreed to suspend plans to collect its 3 per cent digital services tax while talks were ongoing. In return, the US postponed the implementation of $2.4bn in punitive tariffs on goods of French origin, such as champagne.This article has been amended to correct Sheryl Sandberg’s job title
15;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-01-18T11:00:27Z;Hollywood holds ‘vigil’ as cinema feels the squeeze;Industry says unusually strong 2019 releases concealed the wretched state of business;When Lulu Wang turned down a streaming platform’s eight-digit bid last year for her Sundance hit The Farewell, agreeing instead to an offer half the size from prestigious independent studio A24, her backers protested. “The producers and financiers were like, are you crazy? We have to take this bigger deal,” the film-maker said this month. “I know for a fact that if I took the bigger money, [the streaming company] wouldn’t have the energy to put behind someone like me, to build my brand.”Ms Wang’s dilemma is increasingly familiar as streamers such as Netflix snap up hundreds of films to boost their vast catalogues, often with no intention of screening the movies in cinemas or using much marketing muscle to promote them.That has left the cinema business in transition, and Hollywood executives are bracing for a brutal year ahead. North American box-office sales dropped nearly 4 per cent last year to $11.4bn, the steepest decline since 2014, with ticket volumes at their second-lowest level in 25 years. That was despite Disney releasing blockbuster after blockbuster, beating its own record for the biggest US box office take by a single studio.Now concerns are rowing over the prospects for this year, when the company has no Star Wars, The Lion King or Avengers sequels to offer. “2020 is going to look like a nightmare compared to 2019,” said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations. Disney released seven movies with global box office takes surpassing $1bn last year and captured almost 40 cents of every dollar spent on US cinema tickets. It was “Disney’s greatest hits album — everything was firing”, said Mr Bock. “We haven’t seen a monopoly like this at the box office, ever.”But with a weaker slate in 2020, “there’s going to be a huge downtick”. Cowen & Co’s Doug Creutz expects Disney’s movie sales to decline by about 30 per cent from last year. “You could be looking at over a billion-dollar drop in Disney’s box office [sales],” he said. “Some of that will go to other studios. But not all of it. It will be a tough year for theatres.”One former head of a major film studio made an even grimmer assessment. “Give it two years and the exhibition business will be over,” he said. “It is like a vigil. And it is all down to Disney to decide when it ends. Right now the business is propped up by Disney and the four big movies they bring out a year.”Cinema owners have taken a hit as pessimism surrounds their future. Cineworld shares have dropped more than 25 per cent in the past six months, Cinemark has lost more than 15 per cent and AMC Entertainment more than 20 per cent.The industry is responding to the streaming threat by consolidating. Cineworld last month agreed to buy Canada’s Cineplex after acquiring US chain Regal Cinemas in 2018. Adding to the tension is Netflix, which made a name for itself through its TV shows but has now stormed into film. The streaming company released almost 60 feature films in 2019, dwarfing other studios and earning it more Oscar nominations than any other thanks to hits such as The Irishman and Marriage Story. But Netflix is in a years-long stand-off with the large cinema owners, who refuse to show its movies because the company typically releases its films online at the same time — in the rare instances when they get big-screen projections at all. Netflix has made concessions, leaving The Irishman in small cinemas for nearly a month before streaming it, for example, but that timeframe was not lengthy enough to appease chains such as AMC. Directors are increasingly facing the choice of either taking a chance on releasing their movie in theatres, where more and more midsized films languish, or accepting cash from a streamer, where their film could get lost in a sea of options.“I can’t count more than 10 filmmakers who walk out of Netflix and say: I had an amazing experience,” said the chief executive of one indie film studio.Other filmmakers have noted that Netflix is funding films that otherwise would not be made, however, as other studios seek safety in superhero fare.Director Martin Scorsese has said that traditional studios would not have afforded him the same budget or creative control as Netflix did for The Irishman. “Having the backing of a company that says that you will have no interference, you can make the picture as you want,” Mr Scorsese explained at the London Film Festival last year. “The trade-off being: it streams, with theatrical distribution prior to that. I figure, that’s a chance we take, on this particular project.”Some observers say the industry pessimism is overblown and that it has always been volatile. “What everyone is pegging their dim outlook for 2020 on is the fact that there aren’t as many readily apparent sequels, franchises, reboots and familiar IP,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst at ComScore. “That doesn’t mean we can’t be surprised.” Mr Dergarabedian cites Joker, Warner Bros’s dark take on the Batman villain, which made more than $1bn at the box office to become the highest-selling R-rated film in history. “I don’t think anyone could have predicted Joker was going to be the mega hit that it was,” he said. He predicts that North American movie ticket sales will still reach $11bn this year. Jason Cloth, founder of Bron Studios, which co-financed Joker, said “most films nowadays should never be shown in theatres”. But every so often, a surprise like Joker comes along.“Film is hit-based. Loss, loss, loss, loss and then you hit it out of the stratosphere,” Mr Cloth said. “Get Out cost $5m to make and did $300m in the box office. Imagine if you had sold it to Netflix for $10m?”Additional reporting by Alex BarkerCinema is putting in a miraculous performance / From Phil Clapp, Chief Executive, UK Cinema Associations
16;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-01-15T04:00:32Z;It’s a strange new world where tech stocks are safe havens;Investors are drawn to Fangs’ rich balance sheets and deep liquidity in the market;In global capital markets, a “flight to quality” was traditionally regarded as a change of sentiment, where investors tried to minimise the risk of a loss of principal rather than chasing high returns. That normally meant retreating into government bonds yielding a safe income. US Treasuries were seen as the ultimate bolt hole.Yet the flight to quality that came and went with the American killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani did not square with that description. Investors who fled into the Swiss franc or Japanese yen, both longstanding havens, were exposing themselves to negative interest rates. To call this “quality” borders on the oxymoronic, given that holding Swiss franc or yen government bonds to maturity would guarantee a loss of principal.In reality, though, flights to quality have never been exclusively about trying to avoid capital loss because another favourite refuge in geopolitical, economic or financial crises is gold — a purely speculative asset yielding no income. Any dollar-based investor who bought the yellow metal in a funk at the time of the second oil crisis in 1980 would have sustained heavy immediate losses, and would have to wait more than two-and-a-half decades before their investment was back in the black. Gold was also a terrible protection against the eurozone debt crisis. Investors who bought gold as a hedge before the Greek government’s partial default on its debts in March 2012 would have been showing persistent mark-to-market losses in euro terms until late last year.That makes it all the more surprising that bitcoin surged on the Soleimani killing, prompting market talk of a new “crypto gold”. For bitcoin is even more volatile and unpredictable than the yellow metal. While it is independent, decentralised and not under governmental control, which some see as important advantages, it satisfies very poorly the traditional criteria that define money, namely being a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value. And it lacks the trust that is generated for conventional money through independent and accountable central banks. Nor is there the regulatory apparatus, supervision and deposit insurance that are provided for conventional money by the state.As Hyun Song Shin, head of research at the Bank for International Settlements, has pointed out, trust in bitcoin can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralised consensus through which transactions are recorded. This means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning, resulting in a complete loss of value.Returning to old-fashioned securities, it is clear that flights to quality and liquidity are different in the context of post-crisis, ultra-loose monetary policy. For a start, because of the yield compression brought about by central banks’ asset buying programmes, the flight is much shorter than in the past. By the same token, investors buying into havens need to recognise that they are fighting the central banks whose quantitative easing was designed precisely to push investors to take on more risk. That is not a policy that invariably ends well.At the same time, the central banks’ own buying of government bonds causes a shrinking supply of paper, leading to an increased liquidity premium in bond prices — and vice versa when they stop buying or start selling. Dimitri Vayanos of the London School of Economics points out that such a liquidity premium is also affected by the behaviour of fund managers who may suffer withdrawals of funds if they underperform, as often happens in periods of heightened volatility. That vulnerability reduces managers’ willingness to hold illiquid assets and raises liquidity premia.The extreme example of such behaviour came in 2007-08, when the problem became chronic. Even money market funds were regarded by investors as unsafe. The resulting flight to quality caused Treasury yields to collapse and created severe disruption in credit markets and other parts of the financial system. At the same time gold and oil experienced record spikes. Because of the dollar’s role as the world’s pre-eminent reserve currency and the centrality of Wall Street in the global financial system, the flight to quality was magnified by huge capital inflows.These days, though, the allure of Treasuries is dimmed by the paltry yields they offer, by historic standards. It is not surprising, then, that investors now appear to see the “Fangs” — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent Alphabet — as more attractive havens thanks to their cash-generating capacity, rich balance sheets and deep liquidity in the marketplace. All bar Amazon are up sharply this year, having already rallied strongly in 2019.There could be no better indication of how ultra-loose monetary policy has turned longstanding conventions of the financial world upside down, than when equity comes to be seen as a natural repository for nervous money.john.plender@ft.com
17;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;‘Intrapreneurs’ are the people driving corporate change;Wise companies are encouraging creative staff to generate new and profitable ideas;Innovation. It is a business buzzword that just won’t go away. I have sat in on many a “year ahead” planning meeting and seen that word plastered in a presentation as a priority for the upcoming year.Many companies talk a good game about using innovation to drive commercial growth but what a lot of these strategies get wrong is forgetting to cultivate a real culture of innovation among their staff and creating an appetite for “intrapreneurs”.An intrapreneur is defined as a person within an existing organisation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation. The term was coined in 1978 by business school founder Gifford Pinchot III, defined as the “dreamer who figures how to turn an idea into a profitable reality”.It was then popularised by Steve Jobs in a 1985 Newsweek article in which he said the Macintosh team “was what is commonly known as intrapreneurship. A group of people going, in essence, back to the garage, but in a large company”.Essentially the goal of an intrapreneur is to create something new that does not exist. They have many of the same characteristics as successful entrepreneurs, they think outside the box, problem-solve and are idea generators who take calculated risks when they approach business challenges.The truth is that huge corporates typically struggle to create a truly innovative culture. What they have in resources, they lack in agility. If you go to work and say to your boss: “Hey, I have this idea. What do you think?” — it is likely that even if it is a great idea, you (and your boss) won’t be able to cut through layers of approvals, get the idea tested quickly, and then execute it.To succeed in today’s fast-paced business landscape, marked by industry disrupters such as Netflix and Airbnb, the old corporates are feeling the pressure more than ever to invest time in developing new products and services through technology and creativity.The past five years have seen fintech brands such as Monzo and Revolut creating products that have disrupted the industry, forcing established banks to match it or offer something better. The beauty industry has also experienced a wave of disruption over the past few years with new brands such as Fenty Beauty and Glossier. In 2018, Estée Lauder announced a “Tech hub” to look at ways new technology can help it stay competitive, and this year L’Oréal launched a Intrapreneurship Award, offering students a chance to bring ideas to life.This is why I see intrapreneurs as the next big trend in corporate innovation, becoming a vital component in the future of any workplace that has ambitions to create optimal value for its customers beyond traditional products and services.Big businesses are attempting to empower employees to create and innovate with initiatives such as dedicated research and development departments, internal incubators allowing employees to work on passion projects during work hours and even special events: Shutterstock, the photo agency, hosts an annual 24-hour hackathon which lets employees pursue ideas that will benefit the company.Entrepreneurs have become the rock stars of business culture. The danger is that this is seen as the only way to make a large impact. Not everyone can or should be an entrepreneur, but you wouldn’t guess that from the mass of articles encouraging you to “leave your 9-5 and get that idea off the ground”.For those who do not want to go off on their own, intrapreneurship could offer an alternative creative outlet, like entrepreneurship but with the stability of a traditional corporate career.There are now five generations in the workforce, the latest being Gen Z (born after the late 1990s). This range of age and experience offers an unparalleled scope for creativity and imaginative thinking, but companies first need to create an environment that fosters collaboration — as well as giving staff the tools to put great ideas into practice.Workplaces that still harbour a strong culture of “this is the way it’s always been done” will lose out in the talent race. An increasing number of job descriptions are looking for employees with entrepreneurial skills.Companies that become complacent and fail to create cultures where employees can be creative are going to be left behind and go out of business.And the benefits of intrapreneurial projects are not just to the corporate bottom line. They generate energy and opportunities for people to step outside their comfort zone and work on the front lines of change.
18;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-12-16T22:55:04Z;Netflix regional numbers reveal challenge of overseas streaming;Subscriber boom outside US driven partly by lower revenue per user, data show;Netflix has lifted the veil on its pace of expansion in different regions, revealing how rapid subscriber growth outside the US has partly been driven by lower revenues per user.To address investor concerns over its business losing steam in America, Netflix disclosed on Monday a fuller picture of operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia, which account for more than half its subscribers and most of its growth.The data underline both the promise and challenges facing Netflix as the first mover in relatively untapped international markets, where users are moving to streaming but are expecting to pay significantly lower subscription rates for the service than in the US.More than a quarter of the California-based company’s revenues were generated in Europe, Middle East and Africa in the first three quarters of 2019, according to the numbers released on Monday.The subscriber base has grown by 25 per cent in the first three quarters of 2019 alone. But the average revenue raised for each of the 47.4m users stood at $10.26, compared with $12.36 in the US and Canada, where Netflix has been more aggressive in pricing.The differences are even more stark in Latin America, the company’s first international market outside the US. Subscriptions have almost doubled to 29.4m since the first quarter of 2017. But revenues per user stand at roughly $8.21, increasing by a modest 10 per cent since the first quarter of 2017 against a 25 per cent rise in the US over the same period.Netflix’s disclosure indicates that the gap with US revenues per user is partly reduced when foreign exchange movements are taken into account, particularly in Latin America.Asia is a smaller but faster-growing market for the subscription streaming service. The number of paying customers has increased 210 per cent since the first quarter of 2017, rising from 4.6m to 14.5m in the third quarter of 2019.Average revenue per user is $9.31, which is higher than Latin America but lower than in Europe and the US. Some analysts expect Netflix’s decision to launch a $3 mobile-only subscription in India to weigh on per-user income.The fast-paced growth in Netflix’s subscriber base has been a crucial part of its pitch to investors, who have driven up its share price in recent years. But sentiment began to cool on the company this summer after it lost US subscribers in the second quarter for the first time since 2011. Netflix shares are down about 15 per cent since July.Netflix said it would “only provide membership guidance for global paid memberships” in future quarterly reports, an approach aiming to both show its international ambitions and avoid an expectations game with Wall Street over US targets.Expansion outside the US will become ever more important for Netflix as it begins to feel the heat of competition from other streaming services, with Apple and Disney launching rival services in November.But Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham, warned last week that Netflix might not be able to compensate for a slowdown in its biggest market with faster growth outside the US. She calculated $5.50 of monthly profit per US subscriber, 2.9 times higher than the $1.90 per subscriber in its international businesses. “International subscription growth will not support Netflix valuations,” she wrote in a note to clients.Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis argues that while free trial offers were the entrance point for most subscribers to Netflix, the streaming service is finding it harder to convert users into paying customers.This is proving true not just for the US, but in some international markets where Netflix is relatively more expensive because of the lower cost of living. In a paper released on Monday, Mr Harrington noted increasing free-trial abuse — where one person signs up to multiple offers with different email addresses — had prompted a rethink. Netflix has ended free trial offers across much of Latin America, and India early this year, and had since extended the policy to parts of Europe and Canada.
19;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-12-13T05:00:45Z;Why Netflix’s The Witcher fails to steal the Game of Thrones crown;The new fantasy series has the violence and unpronounceable names but not the swagger;Considering he goes around killing monsters on request, the improbably chiselled and gruff Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) gets no thanks. Some of the ladies give this black-leather-clad hunk with the long silver hair the glad eye, but the more usual greeting is a curt “We don’t want your kind around here!” Even after he’s rid the village of a giant, pond-lurking spider. With its medieval stylings, sprawling narrative and liberal dusting of magic, Netflix’s The Witcher is presumably intended to fill the Game of Thrones-sized hole in viewers’ lives. Not forgetting the daft names. Fringilla. Stregobor. Jaskier.It’s certainly violent enough. Why stab someone in the back or punch them in the face once, when you could do it a dozen times? Street fights, where ne’er-do-wells obligingly assail our hero one by one, throb to the whop-whop and ktsss of blade slicing flesh. There’s also the sudden-death protocol. Any character who shows the slightest spark one minute is liable to get snuffed out the next. The Witcher himself has a basic ethical code: don’t hit women. Unless you really have to, that is.The plot gestures to the labyrinthine complexity of GoT with its triple narrative — fugitive princess, apprentice sorceress and our travelling beast-slayer. After a battle scene that is less about strategy and deployment than a thousand separate incidents of hand-to-hand combat, Ciri (Freya Allan) escapes the conflagration of her city with a loyal bodyguard. You feel for poor Anya Chalotra as misshapen Yennefer, having to go around with one shoulder hoisted up, a head permanently tilted and a wodge of cotton wool in her mouth. She will be beautiful one day, and it can’t come soon enough.“Magic is organising chaos,” says her inscrutable instructress, which is no help at all when you’re told to move rocks with your mind. Sets and costumes (apart from Geralt’s) have a perfunctory air. The grubby-looking elves have sad little pointed ears and an aggrieved manner that suggests they can’t wait to get off the set. The horned, goat-eyed “Sylvan” is such a prosthetic fail it’s almost cute.What on earth is going on? Jodhi May as the Queen delivers an indecipherable crib on current events before heading off to battle. Reticent Geralt attracts a tiresomely chatty follower, a lute-toting bard (Joey Batey). “There I go again, just delivering exposition,” he blabs, scratching desperately at the fourth wall. Characters in GoT were very sure of themselves. This lot look confused, and Cavill is like a rock in a stream, letting it all flow past him.★★☆☆☆Follow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

20;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-11-10T17:00:26Z;The BBC needs to adapt to the new media world;The public service broadcaster’s model depends on young audiences;The BBC’s mission to “inform, educate and entertain” has been unchanged since it was formed in 1922. In an era of fragmented audiences, however, questions over the corporation’s purpose are getting louder. A recent report from Ofcom, the UK media regulator, was grim reading. It found that young audiences were tuning out. The BBC, it said, risked losing “a generation of viewers” — and might not be sustainable in its current form.The BBC not only occupies a unique place in the nation’s democratic and cultural life, but is one of the UK’s most recognised brands and strongest exports. Its news channels are trusted globally. Its funding model, a licence fee paid by anyone who watches or records any live TV programmes or any BBC programmes on its online iPlayer service, has been vital to its success. Preserving it has never been easy. The current Royal Charter, which guarantees licence fee funding,still has eight years to run. But the pace and scale of change in the global media industry means consideration of the corporation’s future must start now.There have been inevitable tensions between the demands of the BBC’s mission to serve “all audiences” as well as producing “high-quality and distinctive output”. In recent years the strains have shown in a deterioration of the quality of some content. The media landscape has also changed radically since the charter was last renewed. The BBC was built for the time when TV was consumed through linear channels.A part of its future funding base is already being eroded. Ofcom’s report found that less than half of 16- to 24-year-olds watched any BBC TV channels in an average week last year. Streaming services such as Netflix reached more young viewers each week than the iPlayer. Some younger viewers are watching BBC shows on demand on Netflix, which requires no licence. BritBox, the BBC’s subscription streaming service launched last week with ITV, will be a test of UK broadcasters’ ability to take on US rivals.Negotiations between the BBC and the government on the charter will not start for some time. Public service broadcasters have a role to play in the new media landscape but the current funding model may prove unsustainable. Policymakers should start exploring alternative mechanisms now. Sweden recently abandoned a licence fee model, moving to charging individuals a TV levy through income tax. A recent report for the rightwing think-tank the Institute of Economic Affairs proposed transforming the BBC into a National Trust-style membership model, owned and financed by its subscribers. But that would undermine its universality.As a House of Lords committee found last week, public service broadcasting remains vital to British democracy and culture. The rise of fake news makes objective reporting and analysis of events even more important. There should be broad agreement that for core public service functions such as news and current affairs it is essential to preserve the BBC’s universality. Beyond these functions it will be necessary to look at other funding sources.The government will need to tread carefully. Ofcom’s report made clear the corporation was “broadly delivering on its remit”. The BBC’s role as an ambassador — both through the World Service and more intangibly as a beacon for UK creative industries — should also not be underestimated. The BBC will fight to remain a large monolithic organisation, big enough to take on commercial rivals. But the digital world is moving too fast to assume structures that worked in the past are right for the future. Reform is needed in order to preserve.
21;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-11-10T05:00:29Z;Online streaming: Television’s looming car crash;In the media arms race to take on Netflix not all new services can survive;"Deepti Kapoor was pushing 40 and her writing career had struggled to rise above the ordinary. Her first novel, A Bad Character, was published in 2014 and sold fewer than 2,000 copies. Ms Kapoor freelanced for websites like HuffPost, writing blog posts such as “I was a party girl, but yoga saved me from myself”. Years later, she pitched Age of Vice, the first novel of a crime trilogy set in Delhi. In October, her agents submitted the manuscript to publishing houses in New York and producers in LA. What happened next was indicative of the spend-to-win mania gripping the entertainment industry. Within weeks, offers came rolling in from most of the big studios, with more than 20 bidders — a number that one publishing executive described as “unprecedented”.Amazon wanted to make a TV series out of it, as did HBO. Michael Ellenberg’s Media Res bid; so did Fox’s FX Networks, via a partnership with Nina Jacobson’s Color Force, the studio behind Crazy Rich Asians. WarnerMedia separately pitched a feature film with producer David Heyman, who made the Harry Potter films.FX won the auction, which closed last week, paying about $2m to option Kapoor’s books for a television series, according to people familiar with the deal. In comparison Hidden Figures, the book about three African American women who worked at Nasa and which was the basis for the hit film of the same name, sold for less than $100,000 in 2014. The high pricetag for Age of Vice comes as media groups scour for ideas that can be packaged into streamable content: last week, Disney chief Bob Iger announced that FX will make shows for Hulu, the streaming service in which Disney owns a controlling stake.Hollywood is in the midst of a costly land-grab. America’s traditional media empires are spending tens of billions of dollars as they fight back against technology groups that have ravaged their business. As the distribution model for entertainment is remade, a revolutionary ardour has seized the industry: the choice is to win the streaming battle against the likes of Netflix, or face commercial oblivion. The immediate result has been clear: more television than ever before. There were 496 scripted TV shows made in the US last year, more than double the 216 series released in 2010. In the past eight years the number of shows grew by 129 per cent, while the US population rose only 6 per cent. The trend is set to deepen, as groups like AT&T’s WarnerMedia commission dozens of new series to convince people to sign up for their streaming services. “This isn’t a gold rush, it’s an arms race. We don’t know if there is any pot of gold,” warns an executive at a big media group. “Once the music stops, there will be carnage. It might take three to five years, but there has to come a point when we come to our senses.”In recent years, Netflix has spent tens of billions of dollars bankrolling its own content to build up an independent library, in anticipation that traditional media groups would eventually become rivals, rather than partners willing to license films and television series. That moment has arrived. In the span of about six months, Disney, Apple, AT&T and Comcast are launching new streaming services, asking people to pay nothing for some services or up to $15 a month to watch their libraries of films and shows.The goal, says Discovery Inc chief executive David Zaslav, is to attract 150m subscribers and become “the third man standing with Netflix and Amazon”. Netflix already has 160m paid global subscribers. “It’s fear-driven frenzy over the same pie,” says Mr Zaslav. The battle over scripted entertainment is “going to be a mess”, he adds, “and in the end it’s not clear anyone will make money”. The boom has awarded big Hollywood names, such as JJ Abrams, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, with nine-figure deals to make shows for streaming. But it has also trickled down to artists like Ms Kapoor, who is due for an estimated $80,000 pay cheque per episode to write and produce the upcoming series. Nearly everyone the FT interviewed warned that this pace of spending is unsustainable, and that not all the new streaming services would survive. Tom Ara, co-chair of entertainment law practice at DLA Piper, predicts some “softening” on the content boom when the streaming battle shakes out. However, he does not expect it to return to pre-streaming levels because “streaming platforms have rewired our brains” to expect bingeable, movie-quality fresh content all the time.After watching Wall Street reward Netflix for its boldness, the older media groups are under pressure to respond with new streaming services. “Time is of the essence,” says a senior film executive. “Every quarter if you are not saying you are going to do something that will compete with the streamers . . . you’re going to be punished for it by the street”.Most executives trace the start of this high spending era to 2013, when Netflix paid a premium to snatch political drama House of Cards from HBO. It set the tone for Netflix for years to come: outspending traditional studios to attract the most sought-after scripts. Years later, the studios are now mimicking the strategy, resulting in fierce bidding wars and soaring content prices. Netflix is regularly being outbid: earlier this year WarnerMedia bought the streaming rights to Friends, the 1990s sitcom, while NBCUniversal secured those to The Office — removing two of Netflix’s most-watched shows from its platform in 2020 and 2021. Netflix executives say the price of the most popular content has jumped by a third from a year ago. Reed Hastings, chief executive, told investors last month the $100m Netflix paid for House of Cards would today be “a bargain”.Mr Hastings continues to tell colleagues this is “no time to pull back”, arguing that “the best defence is a good offence”. But some in the industry see even this technology-based company reaching its limits after missing its subscriber targets for two consecutive quarters. “How many more [pricey films like] The Irishman can they viably make?” asked the chief executive of a film financing group. “When you make a mediocre [heist] movie like Triple Frontier for $125m . . . no conventional film financier would ever do that.”One senior Netflix executive says the sentiment internally is that: “We already bulked up . . . Obviously we will still bid on things if they are exciting, but the sense is we got ahead of it.”The streaming wars are expensive. Netflix is set to spend $15bn on content this year, and has $12bn in long-term debt, and more than $20bn in commitments for future shows in off-balance sheet liabilities. Analysts at Wells Fargo noted that for every dollar consumers spend on a monthly Netflix account, they receive almost $1bn of content. Disney and HBO Max are not far behind, with plans to each spend around $11bn in 2019 as they commission new series.Apple has committed more than $6bn to its streaming push, according to people familiar with its plans. Last month it hosted a lavish premiere at New York’s Lincoln Center for The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Apple paid around $250m for two seasons of the talk show drama, beating Netflix for the coveted programme, according to people familiar with the negotiations. That equates to about $12m per hourly episode, higher than the $8m-$10m for HBO’s Game of Thrones. And a sixfold increase on the $2m cost per episode of Friends, in which Ms Aniston starred. Even nostalgic fare has soared in value. Netflix in September agreed to pay $500m over five years for the global rights to Seinfeld, the 1990s sitcom. In 2015 Hulu bought the US rights for about $20m a year. Casey Bloys, head of programming for HBO, told investors last week that the network is “dealing with [price inflation] on a case-by-case basis”. “There’s more competition than ever, and more platforms and services doing more and more, and prices are going up,” he says. “We’ve seen nothing like this since the golden age of the studios in the late 1930s. It’s a rush,” says Michael Ellenberg of Media Res, the producer behind The Morning Show. But he cautions that “like any period of fast innovation there will be winners and losers”.Investors have cheered the spending splurge, propelling Disney’s share price to historic highs, despite an expectation that the company’s profits will suffer for years to come as it spends heavily on streaming and loses a good part of around $6bn of revenues from selling content to streaming services. This comes even as Disney, Apple and AT&T price their services cheaply, pushing for rapid US expansion. AT&T, for example, doubled the volume of content that comes with an HBO streaming subscription for the same price: $15 a month. Apple is giving away its streaming service to the 200m people who buy its devices each year. Disney has priced its service at $7 a month — less than half that of a standard Netflix subscription — and will give it away for free to customers of Verizon’s unlimited phone plans.These deals are great news for consumers, but questionable financial strategies for publicly traded companies. “We are looking at a multibillion-dollar car crash coming, funded by US capital markets,” says Claire Enders of Enders Analysis.Underpinning the boom is an assumption that streaming services will relentlessly eat into the market for traditional TV customers who switch from or supplement their existing deals. Morgan Stanley estimates that in five years, Americans could pay for 305m subscriptions to streaming services, rising from around 180m today. Meanwhile, Disney and its peers have little choice but to adapt. In the third quarter of this year another 1.7m Americans ditched their traditional television packages from providers AT&T, Comcast, Charter and Verizon.Research group MoffettNathanson predicts Disney’s streaming business will be lossmaking for five years, but that by 2024, streaming will bring it $23bn in annual revenues — nearly half of total sales.The appeal of streaming was always to offer more choice, at cheaper rates. But the explosion of services — there are more than two dozen in the US — may change the cost calculus. “The consumer will be left in the exact same position that they didn’t want to be in,” says Jason Cloth, founder of Creative Wealth Media, which co-financed hit movie The Joker. “You will be paying as much, maybe more, for all these speciality streaming services.”There might also be parallels with the profusion of niche cable television channels in the 1990s — and the bout of consolidation that followed. Mr Cloth noted that “it would be interesting” if an aggregator, such as a cable company, packaged all these streaming services together into a cheaper bundle.John Stankey, the AT&T executive who runs WarnerMedia, expects demand to start to drop off soon. “Three years from now, we see maybe a moderating in the demand hours for production,” he told investors, as he pitched WarnerMedia’s streaming service from the historic Warner Bros studio lot where Casablanca was filmed. Few confidently predict how this will play out, but the reckoning is likely to be unsparing. Some big ventures are expected to fail, or retreat. Smaller and midsized studios may take a more limited role as suppliers to the dominant platforms. Discovery and other groups are banking on consumers opting for niche offerings, from cooking to sport.Among Hollywood executives the talk is ultimately of a wave of consolidation, with successful streamers or tech groups such as Apple buying up media groups and movie studios lacking the scale to compete. “When the dust settles there may only be four or five big guys left,” says one. The immediate loser may be Netflix’s stock price. Its valuation is “just getting increasingly hard to defend,’’ analyst Michael Nathanson warned last month, while questioning whether Netflix can hit its US subscriber expectations. MoffettNathanson estimates that Netflix’s valuation should be “less than $200 a share” — a steep cut from the $290 it currently trades at. For the sector, the question is who will be burnt the most. “What happens when they can’t sustain it?” says the chief executive of an independent film studio. “All of a sudden you will have this very bloated machine, that can’t pay for its overextended self. I think the industry is afraid to call it for what it is.”"
22;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;The Queen’s new clothes: behind the scenes of ‘The Crown’ season three;Jo Ellison gets a sneak peek at a fabulously Technicolor Windsor wardrobe;"It’s an unusually bitter day at Elstree, the vast studio complex that serves as base camp for the cast and crew of the Netflix entertainment sensation The Crown. The temperature is biting, and the air is lit with frost.On a frigid set, the actor Josh O’Connor, dressed as Prince Charles in a tweed suit and a spivvy cowlick, lights a joss stick in a room designed to ape his royal quarters. To his rear, a phalanx of cameramen and stylists hover over screens.The room, scrambled underfoot with cables, feels more bike shed than Buckingham Palace. But then the cameras start rolling. Erin Doherty strides in as Princess Anne. Her hair is long, centre parted and shaped in the 1970s bouffant style familiar to us from pictures of that era. She’s wearing Go-Go boots and a short A-line skirt.She speaks in a prim RP that could slice an apple. In the scene, Anne is teasing her older brother for his clumsy efforts at courtship. Who is he courting? We don’t know. But we suspect her name is Camilla.O’Connor, perfectly awkward as the young prince, blushes. Take after take. Doherty delivers the same sneer on cue. The crew shift quietly in their quilted parkas, woolly hats and gloves. The artifice of our surroundings notwithstanding, I am transfixed. I’ve got a front-row seat to the world’s most popular drama.Whether delivered in prime-time interviews or parcelled out in fictions, the trials of the Windsor family continue to enthrall us. The British royal family still commands the devotion of millions, and for ardent monarchists — and the odd republican — The Crown is an indulgent manifestation of what has become an international fetish.Since writing the screenplay for The Queen, in 2006, the writer Peter Morgan has built a multimillion-dollar career based on his imagined adaptations of real-life Windsor dramas; and his intimate portrait of life inside the palace has become an unofficial record of the Queen’s six-decade reign.The Crown will commence its third season on Netflix next weekend with a major recast of the main characters and a significant shift in perspective. This time around, Elizabeth II is played by the 45-year-old actress Olivia Colman, doughty heroine of the Oscar podium and the embodiment of a cheeky-Charlie charm that is considered deeply endearing by the British public.In the role of her sister Princess Margaret is the more regal, quixotic Helena Bonham Carter, while Emerald Fennell plays Camilla Shand, later Camilla Parker Bowles.Focusing on the period between 1964 and 1976, this series will find the monarch in the summer of her reign. But while the drama could take in anything from England’s World Cup win to Enoch Powell to Watergate, all I can glean from my brief on-set visit is that Prince Charles is definitely dating. And that everyone looks uncannily good.The woman in charge of dressing The Crown this season is Amy Roberts, a 70-year-old costume director whose previous television credits include Prime Suspect, Call the Midwife and Jamaica Inn.She arrived alongside the new cast and estimates she has dressed about 8,000 extras for this series — outfitting scenes designed to take us from flashbacks of the 1930s depression through to 1960s Beatlemania. She has also created about 600 costumes from scratch.A small but punchy character in a mannish overcoat, Roberts presides over a vast hangar of a warehouse adjacent to the sound stages. Downstairs, racks of soldiers’ uniforms and suiting hang ready for extras. Upstairs, a workshop, staffed by Roberts’ team of seamstresses, cutters and tailors, is tasked with making everything the Windsors wear.Everything? “Everything for the Queen,” says Roberts, as she leads me towards a group of female mannequins in full regalia. “All the Queen’s outfits, all Margaret’s, all Princess Anne’s, all the Queen Mother’s. All the principal royal family, all the men, all made. All new from scratch.”We stand before the dummies and she asks me to identify who’s who. I’m struck by how outlandish the looks are: acid bright in colour and often accessorised with rather ridiculous bits of millinery.I’m used to thinking of the royals as a fairly sober bunch but these looks are highly theatrical, and while it’s relatively easy to pick out the slightly older, frumpier style of the Queen Mother, or the form-skimming 1970s silhouette preferred by Princess Anne, I get stuck trying to tell the difference between the Queen and Princess Margaret.“Tsk,” says Roberts, as she bustles towards a collage of picture references. “You don’t remember the crazy hat worn by the Queen to the investiture,” she scolds me. “That’s appalling.”Of all the duties on The Crown, costumes is a tricky one. While almost none of us has any significant personal relationship with the Windsors, or any real clue what they do in their leisure time, or any insights as to their actual beliefs, we all know what they look like.They are some of the most photographed people ever to walk the world stage, and the royal wardrobe is one of the few details we can claim to know. Peter Morgan might imagine exchanges and encounters, and we are none the wiser. The dresses and jackets and uniforms are a matter of record.But Roberts was reluctant to make facsimiles on set. If the first two seasons of The Crown focused on sartorial propriety, this time Roberts has loosened the seams. The Queen of those series was buttoned up in pearls. Under Roberts’ watch, she’s going to hit the 1970s in full Technicolor.“There are key moments, I think, where you have to adhere to the facts,” says Roberts of her attempts at historical fidelity. “The last two series were very twinset. There was a formality about it, I think, beautifully realised by the first designer. But there was an absolute accuracy,” she says. “I just felt with this series, you could blow it apart.”Fortunately, it turns out, what the royals chose to wear in the late 1960s and 1970s was often more bizarro than anything Roberts could come up with anyway.Take the Queen Mother, who this season is played by Marion Bailey, a 68-year-old actress known for her work with the director Mike Leigh. Roberts ran up a near replica of the acid-chartreuse number she wore to the aforementioned investiture of the Prince of Wales, in 1969, at Caernarfon Castle, replete with a halo hat encircled with osprey feathers.“The director almost wet himself when she walked on set in Wales,” says Roberts of the shoot, for which she also dressed some 800 extras.I do find the royal family fascinating in how untasteful they can be . . . But in a great wayNot to be outdone, the Queen’s hat, in pale yellow silk, was based on a Tudor-era French hood, embroidered with seed pearls; the teenage Princess Anne wore an aqua mini coatdress, and Margaret wore a coat and hat in raspberry-sorbet pink.“I’d never dream of doing that, putting those tones together,” says Roberts of their combined ensembles. “But it’s thrilling. I do find the royal family fascinating in how untasteful they can be . . . But in a great way,” Roberts grins. “She adds hastily.”Roberts has a deeply irreverent humour. About the royals, and about acting. Of the cast, she notes that Olivia Colman is the least interested in what she wears.“And I don’t mean that in a rude way,” says Robert. “She’s not that sort of actor. She’s completely instinctive. In fittings, she wouldn’t want to know particularly what an outfit might be worn for, or what scene it was destined for. That doesn’t mean to say she doesn’t care; of course, she cares. It’s just absolutely not her process.”Helena Bonham Carter, on the other hand, was very much involved. “But for all the conversations I couldn’t really say whether the interest was about Margaret, or about Helena,” says Roberts.“In my experience of working with actors there are people who are instinctive, who don’t really want to think about the clothing at all. And there are other people who are far more visually aware about their body, what suits them and what doesn’t, and the character they’re playing.“Apparently, it was very similar when Claire Foy and Vanessa Kirby were playing the roles [of the Queen and Margaret, respectively]. Olivia and Claire are very alike, and Vanessa was very similar to Helena. I think that’s part of why they were the right person for the job.”Nevertheless, the roles have shifted. While previous seasons found Princess Margaret at her most vigorous and voluptuous, the new series will depict a woman well beyond the bloom of youth, and living in the shadow of her sister. The Queen, meanwhile, has grown in confidence. How did Roberts try and track the changes in deportment?“I thought about the fact she’s been on the throne for 20-odd years,” says Roberts of finding the Queen’s character through clothes. “And that she is settled into being the Queen. And that the marriage has settled down as well. And she’s got children. You feel she’s on an even keel. More confident. So I thought about pure, clean, sugar-almond colours.”Margaret’s look brought to mind quite different attributions: “More victimy, but more stylish. More wayward,” says Roberts. “Margaret was the great beauty. She’s now married. And the marriage has turned toxic. I felt she was bruised, bitter, lost . . . So, in my head, I saw Margaret dressed in a palette of aubergines, olive greens, petrol blues.” Quite literally, she dressed her in the colours of a bruise.And what about the boys? “Often they’re the ones that care the most,” admits Roberts. “Some of the male actors are much more vain than women. Any hint of a tummy? Oh, golly.”Even so, she adored dressing Prince Philip. “He’s so elegant, isn’t he, beautifully tailored, and [the actor Tobias Menzies] is easy to dress. He’s always stylish, and he looks good.”Charles was less easy to unpick. “He’s very old-fashioned,” says Roberts of where we find him in season three, not quite an adult and trying valiantly to make his mark on the world. “He’s flexing his muscles a little, yet is beaten back. Everything has been planned for him. He’s like he is now, as he was as a child. He’s much nicer-looking than one imagines. But he’s suited all the time.”Despite her commitment to capturing the pageantry of history, or recreating those ceremonial moments in which the world (or, the UK at least) would stop and look, Roberts’ favourite moments on The Crown were working on those scenes where the Windsors meet real life.These include the off-duty moments at Balmoral, for example, or when the Queen goes riding with Lord Carnarvon, better known as “Porchey”, in which she shakes off the sugar-almond shades and becomes “the woman she really wants to be, in her lovely Burberry mac, fabulous skirt and suits”, says Roberts. “She looks knockout in that scene. Olivia looked knockout.”Likewise, the scenes when Charles plays polo. Roberts relished the real-life interruptions: “The crowd scenes, where you get to see real people, and pull in to the reality of the time. Doing those scenes was an absolute joy to me.”For Roberts, dressing the characters of The Crown was also a reminder of the curious theatre of being a Windsor in the first place. And how each member of the cast had to inhabit a role within a role. “This job to me has been like doing the costumes for a great, big opera, with your crazy family, and all the ups and downs of any family, in this sea of real life. That’s absolutely what it is.“The Windsors are more vivid, and the Queen’s colours are more vivid, and Margaret’s odd, sort of weird, Prada-esque colour mixes within the real world in their very strange way. That was the only way I could do it, to see it as an opera. But it’s terribly exciting.”Most exciting of all, this series we get to pry into Charles’s beleaguered love life. “Eurgh,” sighs Roberts. “Dressing Camilla was the hardest of all.” Why? “Because all I felt about her was that she’s a posh girl with no taste,” says Roberts. “I know the type of girls, but achieving it was massively hard.”Camilla is introduced in The Crown earlier than Diana, whom we are expected only to get a glimpse of in season four. “We meet Camilla in 1971,” continues Roberts. “She’s just a teenager, really, a child. But super-confident. The kind of girl who isn’t beautiful, but who men love.“I dressed her in very short skirts. We also tried her look with no bra — you know that 1970s no-bra look, and how posh boys love their nannies and all that. Well, we went for that. And everybody had a fit.”Roberts may have been encouraged to blow things apart but, in some instances it seems, real life did intrude too much on protocols. “They did leave me alone on this,” says Roberts, of the very few times in which the director sent back word about the costumes. “But sometimes there’s a no. This time, the bra had to go back on.”Jo Ellison is the editor of How To Spend It.

23;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-11-01T22:00:29Z;Netflix threatens to blunt auteurs’ ‘scalpel of boredom’;Drive for more efficient viewing on the streaming service prompted an outcry from directors;This week, streaming service Netflix announced that it had been testing new “player controls” that allow customers to vary the speed at which they watch its content on Android smartphones. Users can choose speeds ranging from a stately 0.5x the normal rate to a positively dizzying 1.5x. Keela Robison, Netflix vice-president, said this was a feature that had been “frequently requested by our members”.These people presumably included the proprietor of Efficiency in Everything, an American website that applies the principles of “industrial engineering” to all facets of domestic life. In 2016, the site published an article entitled, “Watch a three-hour movie in two hours + you get more time”. Saving four minutes a day on a given task, whether it’s doing the laundry or watching a film, will save you 1,200 hours over the course of a lifetime, the author Michael Kirk enthused. Just think of it: “More drama, more laughs, more drama, more suspense — same time.” What’s not to like?Mr Kirk said he prefers to watch films and television programmes at 1.3x, but confessed to having watched “really long movies at 1.5x”. As if to reassure those who might balk at the thought of making the car chase in The French Connection, say, even more stomach-churning than it already is (think “Popeye” Doyle on speed), he suggested watching things at 1.1x. Even then, the gains are not negligible. Watching an hour-long episode of British Royal drama The Crown on Netflix at 1.1x, for example, would save you six minutes (as well as attenuating some of the series’ longueurs). Over the entire first season, you’d get back a whole hour — time you could use to shave off yet more minutes and hours of screen time, in a vicious or virtuous circle, depending on your point of view.In 2016, when Mr Kirk wrote his piece, to do this on Netflix you had to download a special plug-in. One assumes the time spent doing that would have had to be subtracted from the time gained over the course of a season. Now, however, the Android feature delivers the ability to speed up or slow down with much less hassle. (There are currently no plans, Netflix says, to roll out the function to other devices.)As Ms Robison acknowledged, not everyone regards this as a welcome innovation. There have, she admitted, been some “creator concerns”. That’s one way of describing the howls of anguish from aggrieved filmmakers that greeted the news. Brad Bird, director of Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol, denounced the new function as “another spectacularly bad idea”. And Judd Apatow tweeted: “No @Netflix no. Don’t make me have to call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this. Save me the time. I will win, but it will take a ton of time. Don’t f**k with our timing.”This was a useful reminder that f**king with a film’s timing can do as much damage as doctoring its images. If fairly mainstream directors like Messrs Apatow and Bird felt moved to take up arms against Netflix, imagine how the Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky, regarded by many as the godfather of the so-called slow film movement, would have reacted. His 1979 film Stalker, loosely based on a Soviet-era science fiction novel, received a chilly response from the State Committee for Cinematography, which thought it dragged a bit. For Tarkovsky, this was a category error. “What a person normally goes to the cinema for is time,” he said. “Whether for time wasted, time lost, or time that is yet to be gained.”The greatest directors, argues the American film-maker and screenwriter Paul Schrader, know how to wield the “scalpel of boredom”. It’s an insight Ms Robison and her colleagues at Netflix might care to reflect upon.jonathan.derbyshire@ft.comSpeeding up the action / From Tom Hayhoe, London W6, UK

25;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-10-16T21:56:51Z;Netflix misses subscriber forecast for second straight quarter;Shares rally in after-hours trading after investors expected wider miss;Netflix missed its forecast for subscribers for the second quarter in a row, as weakness in the US weighed on its results just before new competitors Apple and Disney arrive in the video streaming market.The California-based company added 6.8m subscribers in the three months ending in September, below its guidance for 7m.Netflix shares rallied more than 8 per cent in after-hours trading despite the weaker-than-forecast results, suggesting that investors had feared a bigger miss. The pressure was on Netflix after it fell short of its guidance for subscribers in the previous quarter. The July misfire has depressed the stock more than 20 per cent over the past three months.In the US, Netflix added 520,000 subscribers in the third quarter, below its forecast for 800,000, which the company blamed on a price increase earlier this year. But this was a recovery from the previous quarter, when the company lost subscribers in its biggest market for the first time since 2011. Outside the US, results were brighter: the company reported 6.3m new subscribers, above analyst forecasts for 6.05m. This was the last quarter before Netflix faces an influx of competition in the streaming market it pioneered, beginning with Apple and Disney in November. Netflix on Wednesday pared back projections for the year, citing factors including “new forthcoming competition”. The company now expects to add 26.7m subscribers in 2019, fewer than last year’s 28.6m.Wednesday’s results “clearly illustrate a deceleration” in growth, said Patrice Cucinello, director at Fitch. Eric Haggstrom, an emarketer analyst, warned that “the fact that Netflix has shown disappointing growth without the new competition present is a negative omen for Netflix in 2020 and beyond”.While analysts have fretted, Netflix’s top brass including chief Reed Hastings have largely brushed off the threat. In a letter to shareholders on Wednesday, the company said the new entrants presented a “modest headwind’ but that “we’ve been preparing for this new wave of competition for a long time”. Netflix’s guidance for the third quarter had been ambitious because the period included the return of Stranger Things, one of its marquee original television shows, which was thought to boost sign-ups. The company is expected to spend $15bn on content this year as it races to build out an enticing catalogue of shows and films. The cost of content has inflated as the streaming battle ratchets up. Netflix last month won a bidding war for the rights to Seinfeld starting in 2021, paying $500m over five years for the popular TV sitcom that originally aired from 1989 to 1998.On an earnings call, Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, said that the most sought after shows now cost 30 per cent more than this time a year ago, while Reed Hastings, chief executive, quipped that the $100m Netflix spent on House of Cards seven years ago would now “be a bargain”. Netflix told shareholders on Wednesday that “amazing content can be expensive” and that “we don’t shy away from taking bold swings”. It has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth, helping its stock soar in recent years. However, sentiment has soured after the second-quarter stumble. For the year Netflix stock has gained 7 per cent, compared to a 19 per cent rise for the S&P 500 index.Netflix uses debt to help pay for its heavy content spending. Long-term debt stood at $12.4bn at the end of September, up from $10.4bn a year ago. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3.5bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that.Revenues in the quarter jumped to $5.25bn, in line with expectations and up 31 per cent from a year ago. Net income climbed to $665m, from $403m a year ago.
26;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-09-23T20:58:30Z;Netflix erases 2019 gains as competition gears up;Stock fell another 1.8% as Barclays noted ‘expensive’ valuation;Netflix saw its shares erase their gains for 2019 as Barclays analysts wondered if its valuation was too high, extending a recent slide amid growing competition in the battle for streaming video viewers.Shares recorded their fourth consecutive day in the red, down 1.8 per cent Monday and hitting their lowest level in nearly nine months, after Barclays suggested Netflix’s base of subscribers would need to grow at least five- to eight-times its current level “in order to justify its present valuation”.Barclays estimated Netflix has a total addressable market of approximately 700m subscribers. However, the company’s current valuation implies that Netflix would have 750m to 1.3bn subscribers by its “end state” in 2026, the bank’s analysts wrote in a note to clients, using a new framework for valuating subscription businesses.“Overall, our methodology does suggest that if Netflix’s present business model is held constant, the stock is very expensive relative to its [total addressable market],” analysts led by Kannan Venkateshwar said. “While this could be the case, what is more likely in our view is that valuations are more reflective of pricing power and churn declines in the coming years along with additional monetisation options.”Barclays rates the stock “overweight”, the equivalent of a “buy”, with a price target of $375.Wall Street’s average price target for Netflix’s shares is $401.21, and out of 39 analysts tracked by FactSet, 28 have “buy” ratings while just two rate Netflix a “sell”. The stock closed at $265.92 Monday after trading as much as 3.3 per cent lower, at $261.89.Netflix’s shares have struggled in recent weeks as investors reacted to subscriber growth that came up well short of forecasts and braced for new competition from the likes of Apple and Walt Disney.The company added 2.7m global subscribers in the second quarter. It expected to add 5m users, and analysts forecast 5.1m new subscribers. The quarter marked the first time Netflix had lost subscribers in the US since 2011, after it raised prices as much as 18 per cent earlier this year.Netflix’s shares are now down less than 1 per cent on the year, having sunk almost 27 per cent since its second-quarter results. At their highest close this year, in May, they were up almost 44 per cent since the end of December.Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings made note of the encroaching competition at the Royal Television Society conference Friday, saying it would be “a whole new world” beginning in November.“It’ll be tough competition,” he said, adding he was “a little surprised” it had taken so long for other big media groups to join the fray. Netflix’s stock dropped 5.5 per cent Friday, capping a week in which it lost about 8 per cent of its value.Apple announced earlier this month its long-awaited subscription video service, Apple TV+, would launch November 1 and cost $4.99 per month. Disney’s service, called Disney+, is set to launch November 12 with a price of $6.99 per month. The least expensive Netflix plan is available for a monthly rate of $8.99.As it looks to keep pace with rivals, Netflix is spending on new programming and original content. It announced last Monday it acquired exclusive global streaming rights to the iconic sitcom Seinfeld. Also last week, Netflix said it would ramp up its £400m investment in British television programmes.
27;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-09-20T13:14:04Z;Netflix to boost £400m UK spending as streaming wars intensify;Chief executive expects rivalry will spark ‘very large increase’ in British-made content;Netflix is to ramp up its £400m investment in British television programmes such as The Crown and Sex Education as spending on the streaming wars creates an “amazing” boomtime for producers.Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said the UK sector would be a big beneficiary of “a whole new world” of streaming competition in November when big-spending rivals such as Apple and Disney launch their own platforms.Admitting Netflix had been too secretive about its data in the past, Mr Hastings for the first time revealed this year’s investment figure in the UK, promising a further “big increase” to a budget second only to that of the US in size.“The possibilities the internet brings for growing entertainment is phenomenal, and over the next several years with all of the expansion I think we are going to see a very large increase in how much content is produced here in the UK,” he told the Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge.The streaming service has made about 50 television shows and films in the UK.Netflix is ploughing more of its $8bn programming budget into markets outside the US, spending $1bn in Europe. This month it established a production hub at Pinewood’s Shepperton Studios outside London, where Mary Poppins Returns was shot.Disney, which launches its Disney+ streaming platform in November, has also leased prized production space in a deal with Pinewood Studios.“For your producers, it is going to be amazing,” Mr Hastings told the industry audience, predicting fierce bidding wars between buyers that would drive up prices for shows. “Some day The Crown will look like a bargain.”The Netflix founder said his company had been bracing for other big media groups to go toe-to-toe with it over subscription streaming since 2012 and said he was “a little surprised” it had taken so long.“It’ll be tough competition,” he added, saying viewers “will have a lot of choice”.Asked whether there was one show he wished was on Netflix’s roster, Mr Hastings admitted he had been outgunned in the auction for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag, whose rights were won by Amazon in the UK and US.Netflix is notoriously guarded about releasing information about its viewing figures and operations. Mr Hastings admitted the company had been too defensive in the past and was “trying to grow up a little”.
28;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-09-20T12:34:52Z;The war for the world’s eyeballs will end in tears;YouTube and ByteDance may be the only winners as other streaming services go head to head;"Tech and media giants are going to war, pouring billions into competing streaming services. Apple and Disney are both about to enter the market, taking on established players such as Netflix and Amazon.Next year will see even more new entrants. In the clamour and confusion, viewers may rue the day their traditional television and cable packages were “unbundled”.The spending is immense. Apple has committed more than $6bn for original content, including movies and series such as The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell. In this expensive pivot to video, the iPhone maker is racing to catch up with Netflix, which already spends $15bn a year on content, including the $500m it just dropped on Seinfeld, a 30-year-old sitcom.Some investors are already concerned. Netflix has been playing this game for 12 years and secured an impressive slice of the world’s population — but still fails to generate positive free cash flow. Now the market leader is losing some of its best content, as new rivals such as Disney hoard it for their own services. Meanwhile, Apple can afford to outspend anyone and undercut them on price; the Apple TV Plus service is only $4.99 a month. Everyone has the potential to lose lots of money.The most obvious investor backlash in the sector is at AT&T, where Elliott Management has taken a stake in the venerable telecoms group and told it to stop wasting money on deals in a vain effort to rejuvenate itself. Included in AT&T’s $80bn takeover of TimeWarner last year was HBO, which is, inevitably, launching its own new streaming service next year.But even the sceptics might not be worrying enough. The danger is not only that the competing efforts cancel each other out. It is that younger audiences have zero interest in the stars from the 1990s, whom executives are so keen to sign up.Many younger viewers barely care about premium content at all. Instead they are fixated on short clips of home-made material consumed on the likes of YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok.Netflix boasts 152m subscribers. On YouTube a single personality, PewDiePie, has 101m subscribers for his cheap and controversial content.Some think this is a passing fad. Even Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap, a beneficiary of the boom in user-generated content, is betting on its decline.He said this week that “some of the content that people are consuming today on social media may actually be less interesting than more premium content going forward”.But he also thought we would all be wearing computerised glasses by now.Equally short-sighted is Twitter, which acquired Vine, an early leader in short user-generated videos, in 2012. As then-chief financial officer Anthony Noto put it with breathless enthusiasm: “It’s a great experience . . . It really hits a younger demographic. And we couldn’t be more happy to have that brand, that asset and that user experience in video.” Four years after the acquisition, Twitter shut it down in a cost drive.This all plays into the hands of China’s ByteDance, which owns TikTok, and Alphabet in the US, which owns YouTube. The two user-generated content kings can sit back and watch their premium rivals torch money in a vain effort to win the streaming wars.tom.braithwaite@ft.comThis article has been changed to remove an incorrect reference to YouTube. Although more of YouTube’s premium content has been made free, it retains a subscription service."

30;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;The tech that changes everything;Netflix under attack, Airbnb IPO in 2020, Huawei Mate30 unveiled;"FT subscribers can click here to receive tech news daily by email in the #techFT newsletterThe past can sometimes feel futuristic when you look back at Concorde and the moon landing of 50 years ago, while James Burke, the BBC reporter who led coverage of the Apollo missions, is currently trying to debunk “faster, better, cheaper” expectations for what is to come for a scarcity-driven society over the next few decades.Now 82, he was at the FT today for a talk — “The future isn't what it used to be” — that was as thought-provoking as his Apollo commentaries and reports on the Tomorrow's World programme I remember watching and being inspired by as a child. What's exciting the science historian at the moment is nanotechnology and the ability to move atoms and molecules around that “will change absolutely everything for everybody everywhere”. The machine that will change our future, he says, is a nanofabricator sitting in everyone's home, which can shape molecules to make anything instantly, from any food and liquid to clothing, construction materials, electronics or even a gold bar. The first nanofabricator production-line robot was produced last year at the University of Manchester, he said.Some argue such a device for everyone would mean us eating the whole planet and its energy, but James Burke sees it as putting an end to scarcity, while our current social, economic and political systems will become pointless.There would also be no further need for educational training, but his other interest at the moment is the Knowledge Web, an educational tool that encourages us to be inter-disciplinary in exploring how great inventions and artistic creations have come about. It's a web-powered visualisation that mirrors his wonderful Connections documentary series in the 70s. Take a “six degrees of Kevin Bacon”-type trip here or allow him to demonstrate how you can get from Mozart to the invention of helicopters.1. How will Netflix's story end?
Netflix subscriptions fell in the US in the second quarter for the first time since 2011 and the streaming company is beginning to look vulnerable as it faces competition from Apple, Disney and others this autumn. Today's Big Read looks at whether Netflix’s business model is sustainable.2. How to protect old media, part 122
Sharon White, the outgoing head of the UK media regulator Ofcom, has suggested Netflix, YouTube and other online media platforms should contribute towards funding public service broadcasting provision, if necessary through a levy. Meanwhile, Google is investing “several million dollars” in a joint venture with a British local newspaper publisher, its first such project outside the US. Project Neon will set up digital news sites in three regions that will experiment with “different commercial approaches” such as building direct relationships with local businesses with the aim of attracting both advertising and philanthropy.3. Airbnb to IPO in 2020
The accommodation platform has been more cautious than its peers in pursuing an IPO, but Airbnb now says it plans to go public next year, without offering any further details. It was valued at $31bn in its most recent funding round and made more than $1bn in revenues in the second quarter. Airbnb hosts have made more than $80bn from renting their properties as of this month, according to the company.4. Microsoft's Smith on Big Tech's battle
A veteran of antitrust battles, Microsoft's president Brad Smith has been talking to Richard Waters about the current pressures on the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Google. Big Tech is facing the prospect of broad sectoral regulation that goes well beyond the narrow antitrust focus that has defined government interest in the industry in recent decades, he says, but a break-up of today’s dominant online platforms seems unlikely.5. Taking the temperature of the tech cold war
Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, has told the FT that the technology of the future will be built by American, European and Chinese providers — rejecting the idea of a “decoupling” or separation between the western and Chinese digital economies. He was also optimistic about the prospects for an agreement to resolve trade tensions. On Capitol Hill, US senators have launched a bill that would stop the federal government buying drones from China, on security grounds.London-based challenger bank Revolut is breaking ranks with rivals by targeting 7-18-year-olds for the first time, with the launch of “Revolut Youth” later this year. Parents will be able to control children’s cards via their Revolut current accounts and a child-friendly app interface will follow in early 2020. Most importantly, Revolut Youth users will be absorbed on to its main platform once they hit 18, making it a potential source of long-term customers for the bank. But can the company win the new battleground for the young? And who are its competitors?

The Chinese telecoms company has just unveiled its next-generation flagship Mate30 handsets in Munich. They look gorgeous and the specifications seem way ahead of the competition, but they are hamstrung by Google denying Huawei access to its main apps and services, due to Trump administration restrictions in the trade war with China.Compared to the iPhone 11 series, which goes on sale on Friday, the new Mate30 and 30 Pro have bigger screens that flow over the edge of the phone, they have larger batteries and 5G connectivity, but are still lighter than the iPhone, and a four-element “Halo Ring” circular rear camera array looks more elegant than Apple's three-camera rounded square.Huawei showed its latest EMUI 10 blend of Android, with features such as an always-on display and a dark mode. But there was no sign of apps such as Gmail, Google Maps and YouTube or the Google Play store. Huawei did emphasise an “ecosystem incentive programme” to encourage developers to create apps for it, but that will take time and the company will be handicapped in marketing the phone outside China. It starts at €799 in Europe, but significantly, no release date nor country availability was given at the news conference."

Signify is changing this city and many others after dark, and even in daytime, in the multifarious ways that lighting is becoming a platform through the LEDification of the world.The advantages of LEDs over conventional lighting, in terms of their long life and energy and cost savings, have been understood for years, but the ability to control them and add sensors and other chips to the mix, connected through the Internet of Things, has vastly enhanced the possibilities of technology that already has a huge installed base of light sockets and lampposts.Joao Pola, chief executive of Signify in the UK, gave me examples such as the local council here which controls street lights so they show a pathway for crowds exiting a stadium, while another hands over control of street lighting levels to restaurants and shops to help create an ambience. In Los Angeles, there are audio sensors in lighting that can detect disturbances in the middle of the night and are used by police to literally shine a light on what's happening. Street lamps elsewhere enable levels of pollution, salt on the roads and any flooding to be monitored.Signify is also mimicking natural light in windowless offices to improve working conditions and providing 150Mb/s local connectivity inside workplaces with LiFi technology. Vertical farms, where lighting can make growing crops more efficient, and light shows in stadiums are other expanding areas, and Signify is best known to consumers as Philips Hue, the lighting system for smart homes (see Tech Tools below for its latest product).“It's technology that can enhance people's lives at home, as citizens seeing monuments and bridges lit up, it can make them more productive and feel better in the office, we're taking things to the next level of experience,” says Mr Pola.1. Netflix watching you watching Netflix
The smart TVs in our homes are leaking sensitive user data to companies including Netflix, Google and Facebook even when some devices are idle, according to this scoop from Madhumita Murgia. Researchers from Northeastern University and Imperial College London found that a number of smart TVs, including those made by Samsung and LG, and the streaming dongles Roku and Amazon’s FireTV, were sending out data such as location and IP address to Netflix and third-party advertisers.2. Huawei says it will share 5G tech
Chinese technology group Huawei is spending $1.5bn to recruit software developers for its computing platforms and offering to share its 5G technology through licensing, as it seeks new partners in the face of US sanctions that cut it off from suppliers including Google. Huawei’s search for more developers is made urgent by the fact that its new Mate smartphones, to be launched in Munich on Thursday, will not have licensed access to Google’s apps.3. WeWork founder 'humbled'
WeWork’s chief executive Adam Neumann has told employees he had been “humbled” by the aborted initial public offering of his lossmaking property group, admitting he needed to learn lessons about running a public company. John Gapper comments that it is a touchy moment for founders who convince venture capitalists that technology and a new business model can change the world.4. US antitrust overlap
Are there too many overlapping US antitrust investigations of Big Tech, with the Federal Trade Commission, Justice department and state attorneys-general all getting involved. The FTC's chairman Joseph Simons and Makan Delrahim, head of the justice department’s antitrust division, both conceded at a Senate judiciary committee hearing that the overlap in their investigations into the tech industry was inefficient and caused confusion.5.

32;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-09-18T03:00:30Z;Smart TVs sending private data to Netflix and Facebook;Two studies find devices share information on location and usage with advertisers;The smart TVs in our homes are leaking sensitive user data to companies including Netflix, Google and Facebook even when some devices are idle, according to two large-scale analyses.Researchers from Northeastern University and Imperial College London found that a number of smart TVs, including those made by Samsung and LG, and the streaming dongles Roku and Amazon’s FireTV were sending out data such as location and IP address to Netflix and third-party advertisers.The data were being sent whether or not the user had a Netflix account. The researchers also found that other smart devices including speakers and cameras were sending user data to dozens of third parties including Spotify and Microsoft.The findings are likely to heighten concerns about the privacy of user data on the internet just as smart devices, including televisions, are flooding homes.In a separate study of smart TVs by Princeton University, researchers found that some apps supported by Roku and FireTV were sending data such as specific user identifiers to third parties including Google.Roughly 68 per cent of US households had a connected TV device, including external hardware such as Roku and Apple TV, at the end of 2018, according to a Nielsen report from March. Tens of millions of these devices use content recognition technology that tracks everything you watch, to be able to target you better with TV advertising, which now accounts for about half of all digital ads.The Northeastern University study, conducted on 81 different devices, both in the UK and the US, is the largest published experiment of its kind, and found “notable cases of information exposure”. Amazon, Google, Akamai and Microsoft were the most frequently contacted companies, partly because these companies provide cloud and networking services for smart devices to operate on, the researchers said.“Amazon is contacted by almost half the devices in our tests, which stands out because [this means] Amazon can infer a lot of information about what you’re doing with different devices in your home, including those they don’t manufacture,” said David Choffnes, computer scientist at Northeastern University and one of the paper’s authors. “They also can have a lot of visibility into what their competitors are doing.”By analysing network traffic, the Northeastern team concluded that third parties receive, at the very least, information about the device people are using, their locations, and possibly even when they are interacting with it. “So they might know when you’re home and when you’re not,” said Professor Choffnes. Because much of the data being sent out by device manufacturers was encrypted, the academics were not aware of exactly what additional data were being transmitted. “They can definitely see some [viewing] is taking place, but what they can exactly see depends on what the manufacturer is sending, which we have not made an attempt to re-engineer,” said Hamed Haddadi, computer scientist at Imperial College and another paper author.Netflix said: “Information Netflix receives from smart TVs that are not signed in is confined to how Netflix performs and appears on screen. We do not receive any information about other applications or activity on smart TVs.”Facebook said: “It’s common for devices and apps to send data to the third-party services that are integrated into them. This could, for example, include an app sending data to Facebook to create a login interface, or provide a Like button.”Google said: “Like other publishers, smart TV app developers can use Google’s ad services to show ads against their content or measure the performance of ads. Depending on the user’s chosen preferences on the device and consents, the publisher may share data with Google’s that’s similar to data used for ads in apps or on the web.” Depending on the device manufacturer or the app owner, data sent to Google could include user location, device type and what the user is watching within a specific app so they can be targeted with personalised advertising. Experts warn minimal oversight exists of how smart devices store and share personal data. “People are spending more and more time on these devices, and they are placed in such critical places in people’s homes, so we need to hold them to account,” said Max Van Kleek, computer scientist at the University of Oxford, who works on smart devices and was not involved with either research paper. “The situation is dire.”

The Big Bang Theory, one of the most popular television shows of the past decade, was one of these crown jewels. Bob Greenblatt, the former NBCUniversal executive who AT&T hired to lead its streaming push, called the deal “a coup for our new offering”.The prices of classic shows have soared as bidding wars emerged, even for programmes that have not aired live in decades. Netflix on Monday said it had won the global rights to Seinfeld beginning in 2021. The company is paying more than $500m over five years. In comparison, Hulu had bought the rights to Seinfeld in 2015 for about $20m a year. The Big Bang Theory, a comedy produced by Chuck Lorre, ended its 12-year run on CBS in May. TBS, the cable network owned by WarnerMedia, currently airs reruns of the show, and has extended that contract to the end of 2028, the company said on Tuesday. Earlier this year WarnerMedia inked the streaming rights to Friends, while NBCUniversal secured the rights to The Office — which will remove two of the most-watched shows on Netflix from the platform in 2020 and 2021. Friends and The Big Bang Theory will sit alongside HBO’s full library on HBO Max, WarnerMedia’s upcoming streaming service, which is set to debut next spring. The service will also include new films produced by Hollywood’s Greg Berlanti and Reese Witherspoon.NBCUniversal on Tuesday announced that its upcoming streaming service would be named Peacock and launch in April.But as media companies prepare to do battle with Netflix, they must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services, and what to make available on other platforms where hundreds of millions of people might watch it. This will not only determine how valuable their streaming services might be — it will also directly impact revenues due to lost licensing revenue. MoffettNathanson analysts predict Disney’s streaming push will slice revenues for its film studio and media networks units by $1.4bn in financial 2020.
34;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-09-13T12:19:01Z;Superheroes and streaming crowd out indy cinema;String of box office flops leaves distributors wary of buying anything but sure-fire hits;The new Jennifer Lopez movie Hustlers received a standing ovation at its glitzy Toronto premier last weekend, as fans yelled “Jenny from the block!” at the yellow-gowned star. Based on a true story of strippers swindling Wall Street bankers after the financial crisis, the film has also impressed critics and is now showing in cinemas.But it is the type of independent release that is threatened with extinction as superheroes and sequels dominate the box office and streaming diminishes the big screen’s appeal. A string of flops has left the North American box office down 6 per cent in the year to date. That is despite the release of Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film in history that allowed Disney to claim record takings for a single studio in a calendar year as early as July. “This past year was a wake-up call to a lot of people who were still holding on,” said Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at entertainment research company Exhibitor Relations. “People still thought that if you make a really good film with the right actors, audiences will show up in theatres. That ship has sailed.” Streaming has made it harder than ever to make a profit at the cinema, with the exception of superhero and other big franchises whose hyped releases still lure people to theatres. Even Disney, which reaped billions from the traditional movie business this year, is betting its future on a shift to streaming.That has made the companies that would normally buy independent movies — from industry titans such as Amazon and Comcast-owned Universal to relative minnows such as the distributor Neon — wary of taking chances on films, after seeing critically esteemed fare such as Booksmart bomb at the box office despite a promising reception at Sundance. The kind of indie films that used to get picked up on the festival circuit, like 2006 breakout hit Little Miss Sunshine, once assured both prestige and profits for their buyers. The Toronto film festival has traditionally been a hotbed for dealmaking on the sidelines of the glamorous parties and celebrity hobnobbing that kicks off six months of Oscars posturing. Even deep-pocketed companies such as Amazon have been burnt recently as highly rated films bombed in the cinema. The ecommerce giant’s film studio stormed the Sundance film festival this year, spending more than $40m on a handful of well-received flicks. They included Late Night starring Mindy Kaling and Emma Thompson, but having paid a reported $13m for the film and another $30m to market it, it has only made $15m in cinemas.The tone in Toronto this year is sombre and deals have been smaller and more sparse than in previous years. While last year LD Entertainment picked up Teen Spirit for $8m and Focus Features bought Greta for $4m, this year’s dealmaking has been characterised by cheaper purchases of films that seem set for more limited releases.“I would be surprised if even 20 films get picked up here,” said the chief executive of one large film financing company. “Out of 50,000 films made each year, 900 make it to theatres and maybe 200 or 300 actually make money. After Sundance, no one wants to take on the risk.”With $43bn in global sales last year, the box office is still big business. However, ticket sales have slowly dwindled over the past decade as streaming has kept film fans at home.“The options are so plentiful for entertainment that movies in theatres are now held to an even higher standard to get people to get off the couch and go to the theatre,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at ComScore. Filmmakers had hoped the streaming groups would open their wallets in Toronto, as they gobble up content to build their catalogues amid an industry-wide war for subscribers. But no spending spree has materialised.Apple bought one film, a fatherhood documentary called Dads, for its upcoming streaming service. Amazon has toned down its efforts after its outlay at Sundance, buying two small films a few weeks before they screened at Toronto. “That’s what happens when you have a year like you did last year,” said Mr Bock, who expects an end to the “exorbitant prices” Netflix and Amazon have paid for films. “Amazon isn’t going to buy films for $13m again . . . a few million is more worth it”. The streaming companies’ strategies are still evolving. Netflix has sparred with the large cinema chains because it refuses to leave three months between theatrical and streaming releases. Even Martin Scorsese’s upcoming film The Irishman will only show in theatres for 26 days before hitting Netflix. Meanwhile, increasingly cautious studios are doubling down on established franchises and sequels, which have dominated the box office. Disney has kept the box office afloat this year with hits such as Avengers, The Lion King and Toy Story 4. Taking more than $2.8bn at the box office, the company has captured 35 per cent of the market, dwarfing rivals. But a weaker film slate next year leaves uncertainty about the 2020 box office. In the shorter term, the industry is looking to films such as Hustlers for guidance on the future. While it has generated buzz in Toronto, it also shares characteristics with many of the films that have recently faltered in cinemas: character-driven dramas with some star power but no superheroes.“It’s very important that a movie like Hustlers does well,” said Mr Dergarabedian. “Because it isn’t branded to some big franchise or known commodity. It’s just a good story.”
35;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-09-06T11:00:27Z;British TV producers enjoy Netflix bonanza;UK production houses enjoy record revenues as streaming groups step up commissions;British television producers are reaping the rewards of the streaming wars as US platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime splash out on original programming.Independent UK producers made record revenues of more than £3bn in 2018, up 10 per cent from the previous year, according to industry body Pact.The boom was largely driven by an increase in commissions from foreign media groups, which over the five years to 2018 almost doubled their spending with British producers.Netflix shows commissioned in the UK in recent years include The Crown, Sex Education and Black Mirror. Streaming companies were behind 40 per cent of the £962m spent on UK-made content by foreign companies in 2018.“There is an insatiable demand for great content and people who can make it to the quality that audiences want,” said John McVay, chief executive of Pact. Within roughly five years he expects foreign buyers to spend as much on UK-made content as domestic broadcasters.The rapid growth of Netflix has pushed media groups from Disney and Apple to the BBC and ITV to launch their own streaming services, further ramping up demand for original programming to attract audiences that have an ever-growing supply of entertainment options.Jane Root, founder and chief executive of British producer Nutopia, said the changing media landscape was “incredibly good for independent producers”. She said her company, which a few years ago was mainly working for public service broadcasters and US cable networks, was now making shows for Netflix, Amazon and Disney+, “so we are right in the heart of this transition”.The BBC needs to think carefully as we have a growing number of buyers across the globe and we can take our best projects elsewhereTax relief for UK-made film and television shows introduced in 2016 has also contributed to the production boom that has transformed Britain into a global hub of filmed entertainment, according to a report commissioned last year by the British Film Institute.Britain’s creative industries are braced for new costs after Brexit. The UK’s plan to end free movement of EU nationals means the sector, like others, is expected to have to apply for visas to bring skilled European workers to Britain.However, “the pound-to-dollar exchange is very beneficial to our American partners”, said Ms Root. “It is not a good moment for Britain but it is for our clients.”Mr McVay said his biggest concern was the conflict between British independent producers and the BBC over the broadcaster’s move to extend the programming window of its iPlayer online service from 30 days to one year.The publicly funded broadcaster is in talks with producers over compensation for keeping shows and films in their online catalogue for longer, while also trying to push through rules that would give BritBox, its joint streaming service with ITV, first rights to BBC programmes once they come off iPlayer.“The BBC needs to think carefully as we have a growing number of buyers across the globe and we can take our best projects elsewhere,” said Mr McVay.However, the broadcaster dismissed suggestions it might lose out, insisting “there are plenty of good ideas out there and there is no shortage of them being pitched to the BBC”.The public service broadcasters — the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 — dominate domestic spending on UK-made content but their spending has fallen and their share fell 10 percentage points to 80 per cent in the decade to 2018, with groups such as Sky investing more. Total domestic expenditure remained flat over the past year despite the BBC spending an extra £240m on original programmes.
36;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-08-26T11:00:26Z;Do not adjust your set: there really is too much television;The new Apple TV Plus streaming service only adds to the overload;Fatigue drained through my internal organs while watching the trailer for the upcoming newsroom drama, The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Not because the television show looked boring or tired. Far from it. The series from Apple’s new TV Plus streaming service looks tantalising — and at a reported cost of more than $15m per episode, it damn well should be.No, it was the prospect of fitting yet another quality TV programme to my already crowded schedule. Pity the TV addict. I’m already struggling. I’ve enjoyed The Handmaid’s Tale, Russian Doll and Fleabag but am woefully behind on Atlanta, Years and Years and (whispers) The Americans. Don’t get me started on those I haven’t started — Chernobyl and Succession.This abundance of programmes means that critics are counting down until the bubble pops.The transformation of TV’s image began 20 years ago with HBO’s The Sopranos. The high production values, the big budgets, the slow storylines reversed the old snobbishness over TV. The expansive stories and complicated characters of The Sopranos, The Wire and Breaking Bad have frequently been described as Shakespearean. And Mad Men has been compared to American writers John Cheever and Raymond Carver.As New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum pointed out, comparing programmes to other artforms to demonstrate gravitas shows a resistance to the media being judged on its own merits.The proliferation of computers and smartphones also dismantled the TV barriers. When I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, high-minded parents would ban television from their homes. Now that streaming services are on smartphones and devices, it’s everywhere. Even the most performative of TV refuseniks turn out to have watched all five series of Breaking Bad.People say that no one on their deathbed regrets not watching more TV. They say that about attending meetings too. But just as work is more than meetings — so TV is more than mindless watching (not that there’s anything wrong with that anyway).It can be an opportunity to bond with family: cue teens slouching in front of television on the sofa alongside their parents. It can provide a refuge from the bleak world beyond the front door, as with the Great British Bake Off. It can inspire bonding through water-cooler chats, most recently about Fleabag’s priest and H’s identity in The Line of Duty. It can also be profound. Earlier this year, I sobbed huge gulpy tears over Stephen Graham’s moving performance in Shane Meadows’ dark drama, The Virtues. Sometimes it is all those things.With even more TV looming, I have to find ways to fit it in.The first option is to watch it at work. This is only viable if you have a private office — and apparently people in possession of those didn’t get where they are by watching TV at their desk. Anyway, as shown by recent legal proceedings by Robert De Niro’s production company against a former employee who not only allegedly embezzled funds but also watched episodes of Friends and Schitt’s Creek in the office, this is a risky strategy. I can just about get away with mindless scrolling through Twitter as “work” but it would be hard to justify Big Little Lies.Pre-work is another option. This strategy is deployed by writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner, who recently told an interviewer that every fifth morning she watches Sharp Objects or The Affair. As I barely make it out of the door on time, this would be too stressful. I walk to work so the commute is out.Then there is speed-watching. One advocate of fast-forwarding through TV told the Sun newspaper that doubling the speed enabled him to “finish an entire Game of Thrones in one 40-minute sitting, giving him 20 minutes extra to watch “more Game of Thrones”.This could be counterproductive. One Reddit poster revealed that after doing this himself, he was unable to focus on any visual media whatsoever.The fourth, is to stay up late. A couple of years ago, Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, shrugged off competition, arguing that the company was instead, “competing with sleep”. This is a battle I already seem to be losing.emma.jacobs@ft.comIndulge your guilty TV pleasure as you exercise / From Tiffany Jolowicz, Lucerne, Switzerland
37;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-08-25T16:49:18Z;Netflix hooked on reality TV in battle with broadcasters;Streaming providers bet ‘Love Island’-style shows will attract younger viewers;Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have beefed up their UK offerings of reality shows, moving in on a genre that traditionally has acted as a battleground for broadcasters targeting younger viewers.The total number of hours of game, lifestyle and other types of unscripted shows on the British platforms of the two entertainment giants has quadrupled over the past two years, according to data from Ampere Analysis.Reality shows accounted for 5 per cent of Amazon’s UK programmes in June 2019, up from one per cent in the summer of 2017. Netflix, meanwhile, increased its reality content by one percentage point to four per cent, according to Ampere.The trend could prove a blow to terrestrial broadcasters that increasingly view reality TV — which include the likes of Netflix’s Queer Eye and Amazon’s The Grand Tour, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson — as a crucial weapon in the fight to keep younger viewers from switching to global on-demand platforms.ITV, for instance, said last month it would add a winter edition of its hit show Love Island, which garnered average audience figures of 5.5m, and had helped the broadcaster limit sliding advertising revenues. The BBC, which has said younger viewers are increasingly difficult to reach, this year launched The Reality Tea, a podcast that discusses gossip from reality shows.Daniel Gadher, research manager at Ampere Analysis, said streaming platforms’ growing focus on reality shows indicated they were trying to take on traditional broadcasters for a specific audience group.“Platforms have been broadening their mix of programmes as they look to appeal to different demographics,” he said.Almost half of all British homes now subscribe to online streaming services, which contrasts with what the UK’s media regulator Ofcom has called the “accelerating” decline of interest in traditional television.Two in five British adults with a streaming subscription said they “can imagine not watching broadcast TV at all” in five years, according to an Ofcom report on the country’s viewing habits published earlier this month.But viewers have diverging appetites for reality TV. Roughly a quarter of Brits surveyed by Ofcom said the quality of television had worsened over the past year, with almost half of those citing “too many reality shows” as a reason. However, alongside thrillers, the genre was nevertheless the most viewed on Amazon Prime this year, according to data cited by the regulator.Newer short-form streaming platforms such as Snapchat and the soon-to-launch Quibi — the latest venture from DreamWorks Animation co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg — have also been investing in the genre.Figures from Ampere on reality shows currently in production revealed that the BBC and Channel 4 are the top commissioners. But Snapchat and Netflix follow, with Quibi, which is set to launch in 2020, close behind.“They are capitalising on a boom in interest among youth audiences, perhaps driven by shows such as Love Island,” said Mr Gadher.
38;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-08-21T10:50:02Z;Apple/Disney/streaming: bundles of joy;Heavyweights’ battle to upstage each other provides gripping drama;US streaming services are as good at upstaging one another as the big-name actors they increasingly employ. Apple’s trailer for a flagship series featuring Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell this week trumped Disney’s plan to launch a new online video service in November.At first glance, both services are contenders to defeat Netflix. But Apple is not in quite the same fight as Disney. Its plan is closer to that of Amazon. Both groups hope to lure customers to sign up to bundled offers. The smartphone giant is adding video to payments and music. The ecommerce titan will provide streaming alongside music and online shopping delivery.Apple’s per-episode budget for courtroom drama The Morning Show might seem overblown — it is in line with Game of Thrones, without a single CGI dragon in sight. However, it makes sense for Apple to invest in content.Apple needs a few eye-catching shows to add to its mix of other services. Netflix and Disney only have content. Topping up spending from $1bn to $6bn is not much of a stretch for a company with free cash flow of $64bn last year. There is no reason to expect Apple to match Netflix’s projected $15bn spend this year.This may come as a relief to Netflix, which recently missed subscriber growth expectations. Disney will be the real contender when it launches. Its firepower of Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars is impressive. Netflix has a mix of old licensed shows and new content but Disney has a vast back catalogue. In five years it expects to win up to 135m subscribers and make money on its streaming app. Netflix has 151m subscribers and has yet to break even. Disney’s plan to undercut Netflix’s $8.99 per month rates will not help. Apple would do well to steer clear of price rivalry. Its aim is to top up revenue lost from users failing to upgrade their phones — a saving that costs Apple from $37 per month. Apple needs to convince users that Apple videos plus music, gaming and news are worth a similar sum.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.

The deal for a holding in one of the UK’s largest independent producers comes as streaming services battle to win subscribers through more original content.“It’s widely acknowledged that demand for wildlife and natural history documentaries is higher than ever before,” said Andy Lyndon, head of LDC in the south-west and Wales. The growth of Netflix has pushed companies from Disney and Apple to the BBC and ITV to launch their own streaming services, which in turn has ramped up demand for original programmes to attract subscribers.“We are seeing a lot of smaller production companies benefit from growing demand for original content,” said Daniel Gadher, research manager at Ampere Analysis.Documentaries and natural history programmes have proved lucrative for companies that broadcast internationally, Mr Gadher said, as they are often cheaper to produce, encounter fewer cultural barriers and are easier to dub in different languages.Grant Mansfield, chief executive and founder of Bristol-based Plimsoll, said that while it was unusual for an independent producer to partner with a private equity firm rather than seek a full takeover, “it serves our growth strategy in what is a very exciting global TV production market”.“The rise of [digital streaming platforms] has been extraordinary over the past few years,” Mr Mansfield added. He worked in Los Angeles before launching Plimsoll in 2013 and said Netflix would at that time still deliver DVDs to his doorstep. “Now Netflix spends more on content than the entire UK TV market,” he said.Natural history programmes are particularly valuable to streaming platforms as they attract families to subscribe, according to Mr Mansfield. Both Netflix and Amazon Prime have increased their documentary output significantly over the past three years in response. In June 2019, Netflix UK had more than 600 hours of original documentary programmes available on its platform, more than 10 times the volume in 2016, while Amazon Prime more than tripled its documentary offering in the UK over the same period, reaching 71 hours, according to Ampere.This year, the BBC secured its “largest ever” programme sales deal when Discovery agreed to pay £300m over 10 years for the rights to the broadcaster’s entire library of natural history programming, as the US pay-TV group prepares to launch its own subscription streaming service by next year. Julian Hector, head of BBC Studios’ natural history unit, said that in the past year it had been commissioned to create original programmes for Apple and National Geographic, as well as media mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg’s streaming service Quibi. “Over a billion people have watched Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II in the last three years, and we see more demand from audiences today than at any point in the NHU’s six-decade history,” he said.

Go here and use the league code: tw24av The streaming universe has become vast. US media and telecoms groups have hurtled towards consolidation in recent years to defend their business against one common enemy: Netflix. Rupert Murdoch sold his treasured television and film studios to Disney for $71bn while America’s biggest phone company paid $80bn to buy Time Warner’s Hollywood empire. They’ve all got one thing on their minds: producing more content. The latest entrants to the race are Viacom and CBS. They’re in the process of negotiating a merger 13 years after they were split by controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone. It was a different time then. Most people were still renting movies from their local Blockbusters. Now the industry’s minnows are looking for scale to compete with media mammoths. A deal between Viacom and CBS, the channel behind the wildly popular Big Bang Theory, could be the catalyst for a second explosion in media mergers and acquisitions. The two companies are yet to settle on a price but the boards seem to agree that there are “a lot of reasons” to pursue a deal. The Hollywood landscape is dominated by a handful of large companies that have cast out their smaller competitors. CBS and Viacom have a combined market value of about $30bn, so even with a deal, they’re eclipsed by the likes of Netflix and Disney, which are worth $135bn and $250bn respectively. The question now is, who is ready to sell: Sony Pictures Entertainment has long been viewed as a target, but its parent company in Japan has resisted it. Discovery Communications, Lions Gate and Imagination Entertainment were also named as potential targets but they’re not without complications. For now it’s difficult to see anyone competing with Disney, AT&T, Apple and NBCUniversal, all of whom are in the process of launching their own streaming services. As Bill Gates once famously declared, “Content is King”, and the pressure is on to produce plenty of it. If you’re going to save humanity by “elevating the world’s consciousness”, you need an apt superpower to help you along the way. Meet the “supercharged IPO”. Better known as an umbrella partnership corporation, or Up-C, the structure has become increasingly popular over the past decade. Why? Tax benefits, of course.The latest company to turn to the complex corporate structure is none other than WeWork, which is racing to complete one of the most hotly anticipated initial public offerings in years. Traditionally, private companies will offer new shares on a stock exchange and investors in the IPO buy shares directly in the company with cash. Supercharged IPOs, on the other hand, are complex and have raised controversy. The conversion to an Up-C allows corporate insiders and early investors to have their stake of income taxed at their individual income tax rate. By contrast, investors in the IPO, who technically buy shares in a holding company that owns a stake in the business, face the double taxation imposed on corporate structures. First the holding company pays its corporate taxes on income, and then its investors will pay taxes on any dividends they receive.WeWork prepared for the manoeuvre last month by changing from a corporation to a limited liability company, called the We Company MC LLC. As a result, Adam Neumann, the company’s founder, and other insiders with a stake in the underlying LLC will receive tax benefits once the IPO is complete.The structure could raise further questions about WeWork’s governance. Neumann is expected to retain a majority of the voting rights in the company despite holding a minority economic interest.Usually, company founders will wait until their company has gone public before a large cash-out. Not Neumann. The long-haired surfer has raised at least $700m from the company in recent years, which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, sources have told DD. The 40-year-old was also, until recently, WeWork’s landlord, raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest among investors and analysts. Read the full story from DD’s Eric Platt, James Fontanella-Khan and Miles Kruppa. Go deeper with Lex. The prolific activist investor, Paul Singer, has taken a real liking to Germany. His hedge fund Elliott Management has disclosed a stake in the software company SAP, the troubled healthcare and agriculture conglomerate Bayer and the online classifieds group Scout24, this year alone. Singer has recently taken aim at the board of Scout24 for accepting a takeover approach, which failed to win the support of a majority of shareholders, complaining that the bid was too low.There are few better illustrations of how buyout firms and activist investors have become powerful forces in corporate Germany. The country’s past hostility to private equity — once labelled a “plague of locusts” by a German politician — has eroded. Private equity buyout volumes in Germany have surged to pre-crisis levels with the help of KKR’s acquisition of a minority stake in Axel Springer and Carlyle and Bain’s €3.4bn offer to buy lighting company Osram. In the mid-2000s, Grohe, one of the world’s biggest makers of taps and showers, marked a watershed in private equity’s participation in the German economy. There have been more difficult episodes since then but the pick-up in activity suggests that the damage was not permanent. The landscape of corporate Germany has also changed. The country’s conglomerates are facing more pressure to sharpen their focus and shedding assets in the process, which are being picked up by private equity firms. But it’s not as easy as they make it look. Germany still puts up unique hurdles for the industry, one being a so-called domination agreement that doesn’t exist anywhere else in Europe. It makes deals tougher to complete. While the agreement allows buyers to issue legally binding instructions to a target’s management and get direct control of the company’s cash flows, it also confers rights to remaining minority investors that allows them to push for a better offer. And that’s when Elliott comes in. The FT’s Javier Espinoza, Arash Massoudi and Olaf Storbeck have the full story. UniCredit chairman Fabrizio Saccomanni has died at the age of 76. Saccomanni, a former deputy governor of the Bank of Italy and the country’s economy and finance minister, became the top director of Italy’s largest bank in April last year.

41;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;TV islands in the stream;Kik kicks back, Mastercard nets Nets, SoftBank record, Instagramification;"FT subscribers can click here to receive tech news daily by email in the #techFT newsletterApologies if this newsletter reads like a retread of yesterday's, with “TV companies” substituted for “newspapers”, but today there are some striking similarities of consolidation and dramatic changes being forced on an industry threatened by internet competition.As Anna Nicolaou in New York writes, when the billionaire Sumner Redstone decided to split Viacom and CBS in 2006, Netflix was a DVD-by-mail business. Now the sister companies are dwarfed by the streaming giant, and are looking to reunite to remain competitive. A deal was hoped for by Thursday, when they both report quarterly results, but there are differences over price. A combination of CBS, with a market value of about $19bn, and Viacom at $12bn would still be small compared with Netflix and Disney, worth $135bn and $250bn respectively. “This business is getting harder, requiring more capital, more global distribution and ultimately more consolidation,” warns one analyst.Disney's earnings overnight confirm the biggest year at the box office for any film studio in history, as blockbusters like Avengers: Endgame raked in billions. Yet there was no earnings beat, with its income statement weighed down by the performance of just-acquired Fox assets and big costs ahead for the promotion of its new streaming offering, launching in November. It said three streaming services — Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ would be bundled together for $13 a month, while Disney+ alone would cost $7 a month. This compares to $13 a month for Netflix’s most popular plan.The same trends are apparent on this side of the Atlantic, with the BBC and ITV teaming up to create the BritBox streaming service to combat Netflix and a new report showing almost half of British homes now subscribe to online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime in contrast to the “accelerating” decline of interest in traditional television.I have to admit to not being much of a streamer myself, only finding time for live “appointment TV” or catching up with recent recordings. So Tim Bradshaw's idea in his latest column for an “anti-binge watching” approach by streaming companies, which delays access to subsequent episodes, has some appeal. On the other hand, I'm not ready for innovations like the BBC's latest — detailed in Tech Tools below — which requires taking a survey before you watch.1. Dual-purpose Chinese hackers unveiled
A newly identified team of Chinese hackers is spying for Beijing while simultaneously attacking businesses for personal financial gain, in an example of how the lines are blurring between state-sponsored and commercial cyber criminals. Advanced Persistent Threat 41 (APT41), the hybrid group identified on Wednesday by US cyber security group FireEye, is described as a “creative and well-resourced” outfit that has been operating since 2012.2. Kik kicks back at SEC lawsuit
Messaging app Kik has filed a stinging rebuttal to a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit that claims its $100m initial coin offering was illegal, accusing the US regulator of “repeatedly twisting” the facts of the case. Lex comments the SEC's definition of a security is exceedingly broad and rests on a 1946 case linked to oranges. 3. Mastercard nets Nets
In another big number for European fintech, Mastercard has announced the $3.2bn purchase of the real-time payments unit of Denmark-based Nets Group. It follows Klarna's funding round this week, which valued the Swedish payments group at $5.5bn ahead of a potential stock market flotation. Richard Milne asks in his Inside Business column whether Klarna can escape the fate of other Swedish unicorns Spotify, Mojang, King and iZettle, which were wrested from their homegrown roots. 4. SoftBank's record profits as Vision Fund II is readied
SoftBank’s new $108bn investment fund is expected to deploy capital within the next three months, its billionaire founder said, following a blockbuster first quarter of record profits. Preparations for the Vision Fund II are under way, with Masayoshi Son telling a news conference: “The future of our company will basically be the Vision Fund.” His comments came as SoftBank said its first-quarter net profit increased to a record ¥1.12tn ($10.6bn), a 3.6-fold increase from a year earlier. 5. Noting the Android revolution 
Ahead of Samsung's unveiling of the Galaxy Note 10 in New York (9pm London time), Bloomberg has been looking back at the decade that has passed since the first major Android phone, the Samsung Galaxy, hit store shelves. Though Apple may have sparked the modern smartphone craze, Android was essential to making devices ubiquitous and bringing the world online. BBC Research & Development launched a “personalised” documentary called Instagramification on its experimental BBC Taster this week. The programme investigates the social network’s success and looks into the criticism it’s seen lately. What's unusual is that the viewer has to complete a short survey before the video rolls, expressing their particular interests and preferences. This then affects how the documentary is played out, with a different version of the story and even a different presenter. It could mean more personalised programming in the future, but the BBC will have to tread carefully in its collection of user data and preferences with this and other experiments such as the BBC Box."
42;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Chernobyl and why some TV shows should be unbingeable;What if some shows came with a 24-hour time limit between episodes?;"Few television shows in recent years have been as compelling, yet as difficult to watch, as Chernobyl. The story of the hours and days following the 1986 nuclear reactor meltdown, and the many awful ways that radiation can kill, was expertly told.But it was the antithesis of one of the prevailing objectives of today’s TV producers: to make a programme viewers love so much that they binge it all in one go. Chernobyl’s horrors were so richly realised that it was unbingeable.Even though I was watching the show on Sky’s streaming service, Now TV, I found that watching in nightly instalments rather than rushing through it served only to heighten my appreciation of it.The internet has been built on instant gratification, but Chernobyl got me wondering whether we occasionally need something to hold us back.Netflix has built its business on bingeing. Being able to devour the latest series of House of Cards or Stranger Things as soon as it lands is immersive and indulgent, and has come to epitomise the freedom from the broadcast schedules that online streaming provides.It’s also something the platform’s set-up actively encourages. Few subscribers realise that it is possible to turn off the auto-binge feature that starts playing the next episode of a series a few seconds after the credits of the last one begin to roll.Netflix buries that option in the settings on its website and does not make it accessible from the smartphone and TV apps that most of us use to watch it.Despite all the technology at the streaming services’ disposal, however, there has been relatively little innovation from them in exactly how we consume content. There is the daily or weekly cadence of broadcast “linear” TV at one extreme, bingeing at the other, and not much in the middle.In “legacy” media, the pace of publication is dictated by the format. Digital delivery brings the luxury of choice. Viewers can watch whatever they want, wherever they want.Few platforms have dared to tailor the user experience to a particular piece of content, forcing the audience to watch a TV show or film in the ideal environment — on a screen of a particular size, say — as going to the cinema once did.Apple’s forthcoming Netflix rival, TV+, boasts an impressive roster of Hollywood talent but the content being produced by the Silicon Valley giant looks pretty similar to the output of traditional broadcasters such as HBO or the BBC.Yet recent history suggests that making even the smallest tweaks to the user experience can pay big dividends. Snapchat may have become popular for its disappearing messages, but its greater contribution is replacing the 100-year-old widescreen format with vertical videos.It turns out that saving hundreds of millions of people the tiny chore of rotating their smartphone screen by 90 degrees to watch a clip can be a multibillion-dollar idea.Meanwhile, film industry veteran Jeffrey Katzenberg has raised $1bn for his new venture Quibi, based on the simple concept of bringing Hollywood production values to video in shorter, more digestible episodes that he hopes will match the way we already “snack” on content on our phones.Adding “friction” to any user experience is heresy in the tech industry but making something impossible to binge could have its own rewards. What if Chernobyl or Black Mirror — the Netflix hit whose dystopian yarns likewise resist bingeing — came programmed with a 24-hour time limit between episodes?A new approach to scheduling could crank up anticipation for the next instalment or build the loyalty that comes with habit. Chernobyl had a brilliant podcast commentary that delineated the boundary between fact and fiction; I wished I had listened to it between episodes rather than at the end of the series.There are billions of smartphones in the world today. While Silicon Valley is obsessing over what comes next — whether that is augmented reality headsets or smart speakers — the versatility and ubiquity of the smartphone still provide plenty of room to experiment.From instant streaming to next-day deliveries, technology has broken the idea that good things come to those who wait. But with a little imagination, making something unbingeable could be a feature, not a bug.Tim Bradshaw is the FT’s global technology correspondentFollow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

43;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-08-06T23:01:05Z;Streaming services now in nearly half of British homes;Rise of Netflix and Amazon Prime increases pressure on traditional TV and its declining audiences;Almost half of British homes now subscribe to online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime in contrast to the “accelerating” decline of interest in traditional television, according to a report on viewing habits by the UK’s media regulator.Ofcom said the proportion of people signed up to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sky’s Now TV and Disney Life “leapt” to 47 per cent this year, compared to 39 per cent last year, with many subscribed to more than one service.Live programmes still took up the majority of viewers TV time but its share has been declining fast, the regulator said. Two in five of British adults with an online streaming subscription said they might not watch traditional television at all in five years.“The way we watch TV is changing faster than ever before. In the space of seven years, streaming services have grown from nothing to reach nearly half of British homes,” said Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research director at Ofcom.The decline ramps up pressure on UK broadcasters as they scramble to compete for viewers following the aggressive push into the country by US tech companies such as Netflix.Aside from the race to produce hit programmes, broadcasters have been revamping their own streaming services.ITV and the BBC are launching a joint service, BritBox, before the end of the year. The BBC has also won approval to make programmes available for longer on its iPlayer after Ofcom said the move would help ensure it “remains relevant”.“More people watch the BBC than US streaming services, as millions view both live broadcasts and watch on iPlayer,” the BBC said, adding the new iPlayer rules would make it better placed to battle slipping broadcast figures.Julian Aquilina, researcher at Enders Analysis, said services like Netflix and Amazon were complementary to the traditional TV viewing habit of many viewers, adding that around half of UK homes still subscribe to pay-TV from companies such as Sky and Virgin Media.“But the non-UK services are less regulated than the UK broadcasters — a significant factor behind their success, particularly among younger audiences,” he said.While Enders estimated the amount of time spent watching TV by older people would maintain broadcasters’ overall share of viewing in the next few years, it added that people aged 16-34 would spend only about 40 per cent of their viewing time watching traditional TV by 2023.Younger people would instead turn to ad-funded platforms, such as YouTube, an estimate backed up by Ofcom that found the average young Briton spends more than an hour a day on the Google-owned video platform.The story is similar in the US, where a fifth of homes will have abandoned the hefty costs and advertising breaks of cable television by the end of next year, according to forecasts by eMarketer.
44;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-07-24T10:27:10Z;The streaming market is heading for saturation;Many new services will struggle to secure subscribers on their own;"There are tremors rippling through the world of video on demand. Streaming giant Netflix revealed last week that it lost 130,000 US subscribers in the previous quarter; its shares have since fallen almost 15 per cent. Its slate of competitors is rapidly expanding. Disney+ and the BBC-ITV joint service BritBox are set to launch this year, with others to follow. Their owners are clawing back their most popular content, with Netflix set to lose both The Office and Friends by 2021. Expenditure on original content, already in the billions of dollars, will only grow as Netflix and others battle to keep customers paying their monthly dues.For traditional media companies, the opportunity of connecting directly with the global mass of binge watchers seems too good to pass up. Netflix, the dominant service, faces a serious challenge from the wealth of options now opening up for their viewers. It is not the only service that will struggle, however. Analyst reports suggest that while significant numbers of customers may pay for two video streaming services, the proportion falls considerably for three or more. As the contest heats up, co-operation could be the only way for many services to survive.Netflix’s triumph in France, where it turfed out the established local competitor Canal Play, is evidence that consumers are willing to switch subscriptions if new arrivals offer sufficiently appealing content. Disney has one of the best chances to make a bid for the crown. Its mixture of family-friendly movies and blockbuster science-fiction series have a strong appeal across age groups, thanks to a string of purchases including Marvel and Star Wars. The company owns the two highest-grossing movies in box office history and has shown a long-term vision for expanding its most popular franchises.Many efforts are likely to flounder, however. The closure of Yahoo View and NBC’s comedy-focused Seeso show that success in the sector is not guaranteed. Original content alone is not enough to keep subscribers coming: it has to be of sufficient quality. That brings with it threats to the diversity of material. The glut of high fantasy epics in production, on the tail of the runaway success of Game of Thrones, points to a focus on emulating tried and tested formulas. Executives may balk at supporting more avant-garde projects which risk failing to appeal to mass audiences.Partnerships between media companies would be a more efficient use of resources. This approach is being trialled on a small scale with BritBox, a joint venture between ITV and the BBC combining a wide back catalogue with new releases. Apple is experimenting with Channels, allowing access to third-party material from HBO, Showtime and others through its TV app. Traditional television groups have already moved into the space, with US cable operator Comcast offering Netflix and Amazon Prime alongside traditional channels. Streaming services undercut clunky and expensive television bundles. But the number of new entrants to the streaming market may force such services to rethink the merits of being bundled with traditional TV.Customers’ time is finite, with free distractions such as YouTube and Fortnite competing for attention along with nascent forms of entertainment such as augmented and virtual reality. Customers’ money is limited, too; beyond video streaming, music, video games and news media are all increasingly subscription-based. Media groups should realise that their slice of the video-on-demand pie may be smaller, and more expensive, than they think. Heavy casualties can be expected in the streaming wars to come."
45;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-07-19T07:34:09Z;BBC and ITV outline UK launch plan for BritBox streaming service;Broadcasters hail ‘milestone moment’ in battle to compete with Netflix and Amazon;ITV and the BBC have laid out launch plans for their joint streaming subscription service in the UK, as Britain’s biggest broadcasters club together in the face of mounting competition from online rivals such as Netflix.The television groups said on Friday that BritBox would launch in the last quarter of this year and cost £5.99 a month. Tony Hall, director-general of the BBC, said the platform would be “truly British, showcasing our culture and telling distinctive British stories”.The long-anticipated service has been seen as crucial to commercial broadcaster ITV, which has suffered as viewers shift from traditional TV services towards online streaming offered by US tech groups including Netflix and Amazon. Negotiations had grown tense, with the publicly funded BBC at times appearing to prioritise its own iPlayer service.Carolyn McCall, ITV chief executive, said on Friday that the deal marked a “milestone moment”.“Subscription video on demand is increasingly popular with consumers who love being able to watch what they want when they want to watch it,” she said, adding that the broadcasters had enjoyed success together with BritBox in the US and Canada, where it was launched last yearHowever, observers have expressed doubts that the service can help ITV compete with the dominant US streaming services. Paolo Pescatore, an independent analyst, said it was “too little too late” given the “huge head start” Netflix and other services have had.But Ms McCall insisted BritBox would be “totally complementary” to other subscription services. “What is on Netflix will not be on BritBox . . . they will be unique, they will be distinctive,” she said.“We’re not in competition with other streaming services,” she added. “You’re in competition over subscriptions, but there will often be multiple subscriptions.”BritBox will feature both broadcasters’ content archives. It will focus on “multi-series drama box sets, and from launch thousands of hours of much-loved British television will be available,” the two said.The provision of this archive material “serves as a way to monetise the backlog of content that would previously have been locked”, said Harry Read, an analyst at Liberum, adding that he felt “overall quite positive” about the joint venture.The BBC and ITV also plan to spend “tens of millions” on original content for BritBox in addition to a “new and regular flow of fresh programmes as soon as they come out of their broadcast and catch-up windows”.The original commissions will have “a remit for being daring and different,” Mr Hall said.This strategy has been deployed successfully by the likes of Netflix, with its popular straight-to-streaming shows such as House of Cards, and Amazon with titles including The Marvelous Mrs Maisel.David Sidebottom, principal analyst at FutureSource, said that clearly differentiating BritBox from the two networks’ existing on-demand services would be “key to success”.ITV will hold a 90 per cent stake in the service, with the BBC able to increase its stake up to 25 per cent in the future. The BBC has not invested in BritBox, instead sharing its brand, archives and new commissions. Any investment beyond its current 10 per cent would be financial.ITV shares rose 0.7 per cent on Friday.
46;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-07-18T20:36:48Z;Netflix strategy looks shakier after US subscriber defections;Analyst recants a forecast for customer growth he says now looks ‘downright psychedelic’;Netflix borrowed billions of dollars to rise from movies-by-mail start-up to global streaming giant, splurging on content to tempt ever more viewers to its platform and reporting breakneck growth that sent its stock price soaring.Now the strategy that has taken it to the commanding heights of Hollywood is starting to look more shaky.The company has posted the first drop in subscribers in its core US market since 2011, when the company split off its DVD business and prepared the transition to online video. Its shares closed 10.3 per cent lower on Thursday after it revealed it had lost 130,000 US customers in the second quarter. It was the worst day for the stock price in three years, wiping more than $15bn from Netflix’s market value.The weak subscriber numbers could not have come at a worse time for the California-based company, stoking fears that Netflix is losing momentum just as Disney, Apple, HBO and NBCUniversal are ready to pounce with their own streaming services, which will launch in the coming months. “Does it make us more nervous? Of course — especially given the timing of the Disney+ launch,” said Todd Juenger, analyst at Bernstein. “If Netflix misses subs in the quarters after Disney+ launches . . . we expect the downside effect on Netflix stock will be several times more than usual.”The results also prod at the heart of Netflix’s business model. The company has delighted investors despite burning $3bn in cash a year, promising that margins would improve as it hooked more customers and raised subscription prices, meaning it would no longer need to keep raising high-yield debt to fund its shows. This week’s results have thrown that thesis into question. Netflix raised prices in the US this year by as much as 18 per cent, a move cheered by investors. But the subscriber defections suggest demand is more elastic than executives thought. The price of a standard Netflix subscription now costs $13 a month — a dollar higher than for rival Hulu. While Netflix already has a strong grip in its home country, with more than 60m Americans paying for a subscription, analysts have predicted that number could keep rising to as many as 90m. As recently as last month, media research group MoffettNathanson estimated the company would reach 88.4m US subscribers by 2025. But on Thursday it warned “that scenario looks downright psychedelic”. “This one quarter calls into question many of those 2025 endpoints,” said partner Michael Nathanson, adding that the results bring into question “Netflix’s ultimate pricing power”.Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant oneNetflix blamed the miss on a weak content offering during the quarter, without elaborating, and Reed Hastings, chief executive, had little in the way of explanation.“It wasn’t just one thing,” Mr Hastings said on an earnings call. “It's easy to over-interpret the quarterly [subscriber] adds, which are a bit noisy.”Netflix says the picture will improve as its flagship shows return with new seasons. The second quarter is usually Netflix’s weakest, and the third brings the return of worldwide hits Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things, with The Crown to follow later in the year. But the business is likely to become more challenging as the new wave of rival services looms. From November, Disney’s streaming service will offer thousands of shows and films from popular franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel — at about half the price of a Netflix subscription.In the next two years, Netflix is also losing fan favourites Friends and The Office, to WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal, respectively. The sitcoms are the number one and two most-watched shows on the platform, according to Nielsen. Netflix has brushed off the issue, arguing the losses would “free up budget for more original content”. The global numbers also disappointed. The 2.7m subscribers added worldwide in the second quarter fell well short of Wall Street forecasts for 5.1m new users.Netflix’s long-term debt stood at $12.6bn at the end of June, up from $10.3bn in March. It has forecast a free cash burn of more than $3bn this year, although it expects an improvement after that.“In the meantime, our plan is still to use high-yield debt to fund our content investments,” the company said, doubling down on its strategy to pump money into its own shows and films to further expand its 152m global subscriber base. Analysts expect the company to invest $15bn in content this year alone.Until now the company has remained a darling of investors. Although the threat of competition and the recent price rises amount to what JPMorgan analysts called a “wall of worry” around the stock, Netflix shares gained more than 35 per cent this year before peaking in May, compared with a 20 per cent rise for the benchmark S&P 500.But observers are now wondering whether the golden age of Netflix is losing its sheen.“Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Missing expectations just when competition for viewers is hotting up is doubly worrying and doubly painful.”
47;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-07-18T14:31:53Z;Netflix stumbles as competitors prepare to swoop;Shares down more than 11% in midday trading after streaming service loses US customers;Netflix has fallen far short of its own forecasts for new subscribers, raising concerns about the streaming giant just as rivals Disney and Apple are set to swoop into its market.The company added 2.7m subscribers globally in the three months ending in June — well below its guidance for 5m additions and Wall Street forecasts for 5.1m new users. Netflix also revealed that it had lost subscribers in the US for the first time since 2011, as customers defected after price rises of as much as 18 per cent earlier this year. “There was no one thing” to explain the decline, said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, adding that “if investors believe in internet TV . . . our position in the market is very strong”. Investors showed their disappointment with the results on Wall Street, sending shares down more than 11 per cent in midday trading. “Misses in subscriber numbers hurt Netflix shares more than just about any other metric, and this is a significant one,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Missing expectations just when competition for viewers is hotting up is doubly worrying and doubly painful.”In the US, its largest market, Netflix lost 130,000 subscribers in the quarter. The company in January raised prices for all US customers. The price of a standard Netflix subscription now costs $13 a month — a dollar higher than rival Hulu. California-based Netflix already has a strong grip in its home country, with more than 60m Americans paying for a Netflix subscription. But the latest results “could point to potential saturation in the [US] market,” said Patrice Cucinello, director at Fitch.Netflix blamed its content slate for the large miss, while adding that its forecasts “strive for accuracy (not conservatism)”.The company said that it expected the US to return to “more typical growth” in the third quarter, during which two of its biggest original hits, Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black, return with new seasons. Netflix expects to add 800,000 US subscribers in the period.Netflix has continued to pump billions of dollars into its own shows and films. Analysts expect the company to invest $15bn in content this year. It has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth: at the end of June, Netflix had 152m subscribers across the globe.However Netflix’s disappointing quarter comes as the company faces looming competition in the streaming market it pioneered. Disney, Apple, AT&T and Comcast’s NBCUniversal are preparing to unveil rival services in the coming months. The threat of competition and the recent price rises amounted to what JPMorgan analysts called a “wall of worry” around the stock. But its shares gained more than 35 per cent this year, before peaking at $385 a share in May, compared with a 20 per cent rise for the benchmark S&P 500.As the streaming battle heats up, some fan favourites will be pulled from Netflix as media companies claw their content away from the service. NBCUniversal last month announced it had taken the rights back for The Office, starting in 2021, while WarnerMedia is pulling Friends from Netflix next year. Netflix on Wednesday brushed off the threat, instead arguing that the losses of these shows would “free up budget for more original content”. It reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 60 cents a share, on revenue of $4.9bn. Analysts were looking for 56 cents a share on sales of $4.9bn. The company uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $12.6bn at the end of June, up from $10.3bn in March. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that. “In the meantime, our plan is still to use high yield debt to fund our content investments,” the company said.

A humdrum collection of television shows and movies has been blamed for a drop in US paying viewers in the second quarter of the year. The unexpected loss of 126,000 subscribers is the first since Netflix began pumping billions of dollars into making its own original content.Losing subscribers punches a hole in Netflix’s debt-driven business model. Expansion at all costs is still the official message but the company was expecting a reduction in cash-leakage next year as more subscribers and higher prices improved margins. The message to debt investors was to get in while they had the chance because soon liabilities would be paid down and high-yield bond sales would dwindle.That will not happen if subscribers head for the exit. Overall, Netflix has more than 151m members paying subscriptions every month but the cost of finding and retaining viewers is rising. Last year the company spent $12bn on content, up more than a third from the $9bn spent in 2017. Even as revenue grows, the cost of content means that negative cash flow is expected to rise from $3bn in 2018 to $3.5bn this year.Making original content means higher upfront costs than licensing existing TV shows and films. But binge watching is also to blame. Netflix encouraged the habit of swallowing entire seasons of TV in one go but such consumption drives a punishing pace of demand for new things to watch. Not all of it is high calibre.Despite a concerted effort to produce more international content there was a slowdown in subscriber growth across all regions. The total 2.7m increase in subscribers was half the number Netflix expected, which is why its shares fell 11 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.Revenues have jumped 26 per cent to just under $5bn but finding the balance between higher prices and higher subscriber numbers is clearly tricky.One missed quarter of subscriber growth is not the end of the world. What is worrying is that the drop came before big hitters Apple and Disney launch their own streaming services and AT&T and Comcast take back Friends and The Office, two of Netflix’s most popular shows. If adding subscribers is still the main goal, Netflix is either going to need a monster smash show or lower prices.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex published twice weekly.

The three-minute scene shows high school student Hannah taking her own life in a bathtub.13 Reasons Why is based on a best-selling novel of the same name, in which Hannah creates 13 tapes for classmates explaining why she ended her life. The series garnered critical praise but also drew backlash over its treatment of its controversial subject matter, with mental health experts and school administrators arguing that it romanticises suicide and could trigger vulnerable teenagers. Netflix’s move to delete the scene follows a study in April funded by the National Institute of Health, the US government agency, which found a 29 per cent spike in US teen suicides in the month following the show’s debut.At the time, Netflix said that the company was “looking into the research” and working to “handle this sensitive issue responsibly”. Netflix consulted mental health groups including the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, which informed Tuesday’s decision to edit out the scene. Changing a television show years later is a rare move. Netflix’s decision illustrates the different viewing habits of streaming versus traditional television, said people familiar with the plan. With a new season of 13 Reasons Why coming this summer, Netflix executives were mindful that some people may watch the show from the start for the first time on the streaming platform, which is why they changed a scene that debuted years ago, these people said.In March, Netflix retroactively removed a scene from its hit film, Bird Box, which used stock footage from a real-life Canadian train explosion that had killed 47 people in 2013. The use of footage of the tragedy had sparked outrage from Canadians, with parliament condemning Netflix.The creators of 13 Reasons Why have previously argued that their aim was to push a discussion around the difficult subject. Two weeks after the show debuted in 2017, seven Colorado students killed themselves, and the school district asked librarians to ban the book. Brian Yorkey, the show’s creator, at the time said that “many people are accusing the show of glamorising suicide and I feel strongly . . . that we did the exact opposite”.13 Reasons Why is co-produced by Anonymous Content and Viacom-owned Paramount Television. Pop star Selena Gomez was an executive producer and heavily promoted the show at its start; she has defended the series, telling a radio show in 2017 that it is “honest” and “stays true to the book”."
51;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-07-12T09:00:44Z;Netflix hires BBC Studios’ Jackie Lee-Joe as marketing chief;Appointment is latest in overhaul of media group’s management;Netflix has poached Jackie Lee-Joe from BBC Studios to run its marketing operations as part of an overhaul at the top of the company.The Australian has spent four years in charge of marketing high-profile BBC television shows across the world, including Doctor Who, Sherlock, Top Gear and Planet Earth, as well as developing the broadcaster’s social media strategy.She will move to Los Angeles for the Netflix role, focusing on the company’s international strategy. The US company produces TV in 30 countries and wants to unearth more shows that can have an international reach, such as the German thriller Dark and the British comedy Sex Education.She is the latest new face at Netflix after Rachel Whetstone joined from Facebook last August to head up its global communications operations and Spencer Neumann was appointed chief financial officer in January after he left video games company Activision Blizzard.Ms Lee-Joe replaces Kelly Bennett who said in March that he would retire after six years at Netflix. She will report to Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer.“Jackie is a truly original thinker with a wealth of global experience — making her the perfect fit as our next chief marketing officer,” said Mr Sarandos.Netflix’s marketing budget is forecast to increase to almost $3bn this year as it continues to push its international growth strategy. The media company is devoting more of its $8bn programming budget outside of the US, including $1bn in Europe, and this month established a production hub at Pinewood’s Shepperton studios outside London.Ms Lee-Joe is the second executive to leave BBC Studios, the commercial arm of the government-funded UK broadcaster, in recent weeks after Ann Sarnoff joined movie studio Warner Bros as chief executive.She joined BBC Studios as chief marketing officer in 2015 from Skype.Ms Lee-Joe, a graduate of the University of Sydney, started her career in Australia with the airline Ansett and Virgin Mobile. She later worked for Carphone Warehouse and Orange before joining Skype.
52;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-07-09T18:04:14Z;The one where WarnerMedia takes ‘Friends’ back from Netflix;Popular sitcom to move to newly-created HBO Max streaming service next year;The popular 1990s sitcom Friends will move from Netflix to WarnerMedia’s upcoming streaming service next year, in the latest move by legacy media companies to fight back against the tech group that has ravaged their business.AT&T-owned WarnerMedia on Tuesday revealed details about its own streaming service, which aims to win back customers from Netflix.The service, called HBO Max, is set to launch in the spring of 2020 with the exclusive rights to HBO’s full library, Time Warner’s television classics such as Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, as well as new films produced by Hollywood heavyweights Greg Berlanti and Reese Witherspoon.After years of watching consumers shift their attention away from traditional television and towards Netflix, traditional media companies are fighting back. Walt Disney and AT&T have between them spent more than $150bn on megadeals to build up their arsenals of content, and are working to launch their own streaming services within the next year.Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services, and what to keep available on platforms like Netflix where hundreds of millions of people might watch it. This will not only determine how valuable their streaming services might be — it will also directly impact revenues. MoffettNathanson analysts predict Disney’s streaming push will slice revenues for its film studio and media networks units by $1.4bn in fiscal 2020.As the streaming battle heats up, some fan favourites will be pulled from Netflix. Last month Comcast-owned NBCUniversal announced it had taken the rights back for The Office starting in 2021. The Office and Friends are the two most-watched programmes on Netflix, according to Nielsen.Last year Netflix warned customers Friends could be taken down from its platform soon, sparking fury among fans. However Netflix struck a deal with AT&T to extend its rights to the sitcom for another year, paying nearly $100m for it.Netflix said in a tweet it was “sorry to see Friends go to Warner’s streaming service at the beginning of 2020 (in The US)”.
53;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-06-18T04:01:07Z;New media brands thrive on user experience;Online businesses looking to grow are competing for modern customers’ hearts;The rise of the internet has upset the balance of power in media, handing it to those brands with a laser focus on user experience. Seemingly impregnable staples which relied on their monopoly of distribution to retain customers — such as Blockbuster, Kodak and Yahoo — have disappeared from view, ceding territory to brands which have made their customer king.This year’s list reflects that trend as the biggest risers up the ranking include Netflix whose brand value blossomed by 65 per cent, boosting it by 27 places, and Instagram which nearly doubled in value as it was propelled 47 places higher into the top 50.That would come as little surprise to the consumers that not only use those services but struggle to live without them. The success of those big names reveals that the way companies are building successful brands has changed dramatically to suit the modern digital consumer.Daniel Gilbert, chief executive of advertising analytics company Brainlabs, says: “Those brands that are decreasing in value have been built through the old advertising model using linear television in the Coca-Cola, McDonald's kind of way. You repeatedly hit people with messages until they feel something about the brand. But a range of new brands may never even do advertising or if they do, they will wait 10 or 15 years before they spend a single penny.”He says that both new media brands and a new generation of service companies are using direct contact with consumers to grow. “They are creating huge super fans. Companies like Netflix have built a brand through user experience. In an age where people crave an honest open relationship, it has proved an effective way to build a brand rapidly.”Distribution has also been key to the rapid success of new media brands. Ian Maude of the consultancy Ikaa says that the smartphone — which acts as the best billboard in the world as it is in a user’s hands — has been key to a changing of the guard in media.“The brands we think about most and that have created the most value are those on the screen. Those icons are the ones we see on our smartphone screen which is incredibly valuable real estate. By definition those are the brands the customer values the most and billions of people are checking in on them every day. It has changed how brands connect with people. How we behave, how we shop, how we communicate has changed,” he says.Yet the rise of Netflix and Instagram is not necessarily a zero-sum game. Disney’s brand value is also on the rise as it prepares to fight back with its own streaming service which can capitalise on the huge popularity of its content.NBCUniversal is also launching its own streaming service, while Sky has taken the decision to forge ahead with its own Now TV app to take the fight to Netflix in the UK. That proves that content aggregation and distribution are playing a big role in brand promotion.For Instagram, the results of intense user focus are staggering. It has 1bn monthly active users and more than 500m of them use the platform every day. According to the Facebook-owned company, almost three quarters of its users are under the age of 35 and those below the age of 25 use Instagram 32 minutes a day, which is valuable for its advertising-driven business model.Josh Krichefski, chief executive of MediaCom UK, said that Instagram’s potential could be even bigger as it moves more into the shopping realm and commands a similar level of engagement as Asian mobile commerce sites.He argued however that the public debate around the influence of technology companies that has surrounded YouTube and Facebook could pose a problem for Instagram in the future. “There is the issue of the rise in mistrust of influencers because of damaging stories around fake reviews and influencers being paid to trash other companies’ products. You can’t argue with the usage stats but brands will increasingly be pushed to consider ethical and moral issues around the platform as much as they have done for other social channels,” he said.Others have questioned whether the appeal of new media brands can hold. As Benedict Evans of Andreessen Horowitz puts it: “Technology monopolies tend not to fall like Rome, they fall like Venice. They’re still there, and no one actually invades them, but the trade routes moved, the things that gave them power and wealth stop mattering, and they become just another city, and then a backwater.”He points to names like Olivetti and Sun Microsystems that have ended up as footnotes on someone else’s balance sheet.
54;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Curated viewing aims to solve our TV overwhelm;New services aggregate the best programmes to reduce the indecision of too much choice;My daughter in the US tells me to watch something called Barry. I locate it on Netflix — a mediocre biopic of Barack Obama. Then I discover I found the wrong show. The one she meant, also Barry, is a funny HBO series.Someone else had told me to look out for an Amazon show, The Widow. As there were many productions with almost the same name, I failed to find it — until I saw a roadside hoarding that explained it was about to air on ITV. I watched one episode and thought it was tripe.I acknowledge this is a first world problem, but with the mushrooming of catch-up and streaming services, many of the latter producing original material, there is too much to watch, and a lot of it excellent. The “problem”, if I may call it that, is getting worse.I have written previously about how we might manage this abundance of entertainment. Since then, we have learnt still more providers, including Disney and Apple, will be adding to the flood of new productions.A London researcher, Ampere Analysis, calculates there is already 85,970 hours of viewing available to UK viewers on the most popular services — enough for ten years of 24/7 bingeing before one new show has been added.When last year I flagged up the difficulty of keeping up with the results of this onslaught of creative endeavour, readers had some good thoughts. Many argued that new TV was not worth keeping up with because none will have any lasting effect on the viewer. One commented: “I find declaring bankruptcy occasionally is a good way to do things. Just delete all your bookmarks.”But I enjoy late night Netflix-a-thons and would find it hard to run such a scorched content policy.And a new form of entertainment management is developing — streaming aggregators, which aim to select the best material from a variety of suppliers and guide you towards it in a clean, user-friendly format.Some aggregation is already happening. Deep within Amazon Prime is a service called Channels. For a payment on top of your Prime subscription you can stream TV from dozens of sources. The coming Apple TV+ will offer something similar.But Amazon Channels looks to be confusing and visually noisy. I find the offering from a (so far) free Stockholm-based service, arriving imminently in the UK, more attractive and manageable. Playpilot — motto, “Search Less, Watch More” — is edited not by algorithm but by humans.From the look of the Scandinavian site, their choices are judicious. Similar, curated offerings to Playpilot have appeared lately in the US, Spain and Argentina. At least ten others, it should be noted, have tried and failed since 2015 .Adam Chrigström, Playpilot’s founder, explains: “Almost as soon as the big streaming services started in Sweden, we found consumers increasingly frustrated that content was fragmented, you couldn’t search across services. More importantly, when you sat down on the couch wanting to watch a good movie, you’d have to go into several different services.”“We were waiting for somebody to come along and do a Spotify for video, and everyone tried. So we thought instead of trying to host and stream everything in a single service, why not just add a layer of search and navigation on top of the existing ecosystem?” he says.The result could be seen as an updated version of old-world magazines such as Radio Times and TV Guide. You can click through direct from Playpilot to a stream — or it just advises on what is out there and on which services to subscribe. “Or,” says Mr Chrigström, “you can search for something specific, and perhaps be told it’s on a service you don’t have.” Playpilot will send a notification to you if something you are interested in comes online.“If you’re a busy, stressed working person with kids, you want to be sure the thing you’re watching is great. You don’t want to end up in some mediocre movie.” Agreed. But will there ultimately need to be an aggregator of aggregators?jonathan.margolis@ft.com@TheFutureCritic
55;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-05-31T17:38:52Z;Netflix’s cash burn is painful viewing for investors;Company made noble intervention this week, but its business model deserves more scrutiny;"Netflix is one of the big tech companies it is still possible to feel good about.Streaming old episodes of Friends is not going to trigger an existential crisis about privacy, misinformation and the dangers of the digital world. While governments wonder how to tackle the fraught issues thrown up by our online lives, Netflix has stayed under the radar.That lack of political heat puts the company in a position to speak out on polarising issues. This week, Netflix declared that it would rethink its investment in Georgia if the US state’s anti-abortion law takes effect. “We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer. As the first of only a handful of companies to take a stand, Netflix is due praise.Such interventions only carry weight because, in the space of just two decades, Netflix has transformed from a start-up into a company with a $150bn market capitalisation. And yet, while Netflix has not been dragged into the debates over data and privacy, there are reasons for investors not be so forgiving of its business model.The company is burning through colossal amounts of cash to amass the TV shows and movies needed to hook viewers. It is not unusual to see a new, fast-growing Silicon Valley company with costs exceeding the cash it generates — but Netflix has outgrown that camp.Negative cash flow from large, established companies has re-emerged as a sensitive issue on the West Coast thanks to Uber’s unhappy debut on the stock market. When the car-booking company tried to justify its cash burn by comparing itself to Amazon it was shouted down. Amazon may have delivered years of losses but, unlike Uber, it was generating the cash to help maintain its giddy growth.Netflix does not throw off the cash required to support a business model whose ambition has taken it from scrappy DVD rental business to the world’s most successful streaming service.Yet the unwelcome third act for Netflix has been the arrival of the likes of Disney, Amazon and Apple each intent on building rival streaming services with their own content. What’s more, Mediaset, the Italian broadcaster controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, this week announced a stake in ProSiebenSat.1, Germany’s largest commercial broadcaster, in what was seen as the first step in an effort to create a pan-European competitor. As threats grow, Netflix is paying billions of dollars to build a catalogue of original programmes such as The Crown, the hugely popular royal drama.But big cheques do not guarantee pop culture hits: a new glossy, yet boring, neo-noir starring Renée Zellweger is proof of that. Helpfully for Netflix, the sheer volume of shows it makes mean that its fortunes do not rest on a single series.Churning out content requires a supply of fresh funding from debt markets — bond investors coughed up $2bn in April — and deals with programme makers. Mention this to Netflix and you will hear that all entertainment companies are run in the same way. Disney, though, funds its own expansion. Netflix hopes to do so soon, but that will require subscribers to resist the temptation of rival streaming services.Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive and co-founder, appears untroubled. Rivals such as Apple and Disney are “awesome companies,” he says; Netflix’s debt is an opportunity for investors who “better get in soon because there’s not going to be that much more to go”. Rising subscriber numbers have equalled a rising share price. It is up more than 30 per cent this year.Yet this cushion offers only an illusion of security. Market capitalisation is not an asset to draw on when times are tough. Netflix is old enough to stand on its own two feet. Cash flow, not further share price gains, would provide the real feelgood factor.Republicans have no interest in a vibrant film industry in Georgia / From Walter Jospin, Atlanta, GA, US"
56;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-05-09T04:00:27Z;Netflix v Cannes: inside the battle for the future of cinema;An ongoing dispute between the film festival and the streaming giant could forever reshape the movie business;"The scene is set for Cannes 2019. A star-studded jury featuring Alejandro González Iñárritu, Elle Fanning and Yorgos Lanthimos is ready to ascend the red-carpeted stairway of the Palais des Festivals. The yachts are moored in the harbour; the deck chairs are lined up at the Cinéma de la Plage. But as for this year’s film line-up, there’s one notable absence: Netflix.Steven Soderbergh’s The Laundromat and Martin Scorsese’s crime drama The Irishman are two of the most notable no-shows at this year’s event. And though both were reportedly not ready in time, their absence has raised eyebrows in the film world. The lack of Netflix-financed films such as these on the Croisette this year is emblematic of an ongoing dispute between the festival and the streaming giant, one that is likely to have ramifications for the future of cinema — and, in particular, who can make money from it.The central sticking point is the so-called theatrical window. Since 2018, a rule has been in place stating that for films to compete at Cannes, they must be shown in cinemas in France. French law, meanwhile, mandates that films can’t be shown on a streaming platform until three years after their cinematic release. Indeed, Cannes announced the new rule before its 2017 edition had even ended, a response to the vocal outcry from French exhibitors about the inclusion of the Netflix films The Meyerowitz Stories and Okja in the competition that year.Perhaps the most contentious outcome of the negotiations so far was the absence from last year’s Cannes of Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, a film whose rich aesthetic was particularly well suited to the big screen. With a three-year wait for on-demand streaming out of the question for Netflix, Cannes would only permit it to show out of competition. In response, Netflix removed all of its films from the festival that year, and took Roma to the Venice Film Festival instead, where it won the Golden Lion. It then went on to win three Oscars, as well as Best Film at the Baftas.It’s easy to see why Netflix is continuing to refuse to comply with Cannes’ rules. What’s the point of subscribing to the service if you don’t get instant access to its content? Both the streamer and the festival declined to comment for this article, but Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said at Cannes in 2015: “We live in an age where the internet has attuned us to want whatever we want, wherever we want. Movies have been uniquely immune from that.”Though it’s the most prominent, Netflix isn’t the only streaming platform grappling with the implications of the theatrical window in the internet age. Amazon has in previous years taken a more cinema-friendly approach, giving its acquisitions Manchester by the Sea and The Big Sick a 90-day theatrical release before allowing its Prime customers to stream them online. However, new Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke has hinted that the company’s strategy might be about to change, and that more future Amazon Studios films will be exclusively available to subscribers without showing in theatres at all.Many French cinema owners, who are putting pressure on Cannes to resist Netflix et al, see the streamers’ disruptive attitude as an incursion into their territory. “We have nothing against Netflix or new platforms,” says Marc-Olivier Sebbag, chief executive of the Fédération Nationale des Cinémas Français. “The problem is that Netflix wants to have the benefits of the cinema industry without contributing to it.”There have also been protests elsewhere against Netflix films’ inclusion in festivals. At this year’s Berlin Film Festival, the premiere of the Netflix-backed Elisa y Marcela was picketed by cinema owners. And in the UK, cinema chains expressed outrage that Roma won the top prize at the Baftas. J Timothy Richards, chief executive of Vue International, wrote an open letter to the Academy to express his concern at their decision-making process. “No director grows up dreaming of making a movie for the small screen,” says Richards.But supporters of Netflix point out that cinemas — particularly large chains — have not always been eager to champion non-English-language films. As Cuarón told journalists at the Golden Globes this year: “How many theatres [would show] a Mexican film in black and white, in Spanish and Mixteco, a drama without stars — how big did you think it would be as a conventional theatrical release?”If Netflix is to continue to support diverse and novel film-making, its competitors might not be so much mainstream cinemas as independent ones. But Philip Knatchbull, chief executive of Curzon Cinemas, responded to Richards’ letter with his own, which acknowledged the benefits of the streaming era. “The theatrical window may well serve ‘tent-pole’ studio films but many smaller independent and foreign language films need a bespoke approach . . . There is room for more flexibility,” he wrote.After all, there are still plenty of directors who are more than happy to work with Netflix. As Amelia King, a documentary producer who has experience of working with the streaming platform, tells me: “Film-makers love Netflix. The general consensus is: ‘This is what we’ve all been waiting for’.”The problem is that Netflix wants to have the benefits of the cinema industry without contributing to itMeanwhile film-maker Ava DuVernay recently tweeted in appreciation of Netflix’s distribution of her upcoming series When They See Us, which centres on the “Central Park Five” rape case of 1989: “One of the things I value about Netflix is that it distributes black work far/wide.”However strong the feeling against Netflix at Cannes, there will be an opportunity to watch one film that will be distributed by the streamer: Wounds by Babak Anvari, a thriller that stars Armie Hammer and Dakota Johnson. It will be playing at Directors’ Fortnight, a parallel programme that doesn’t offer prizes but is nonetheless one of the key spaces outside the official selection.Here, it’s the French Directors’ Guild that makes the decisions. “It’s a good example of the priority we give to the director’s work,” says Paolo Moretti, artistic director of the programme.A bigger problem lurks just around the corner for Netflix: the rise of other streaming platforms. Amazon’s new attitude might help them, but Apple, Warner and Disney are all about to launch their own equivalents, which, depending on the strategy each chooses to take, could further reshape the relationship between streaming services and film festivals. What is today a tense negotiation between Cannes and Netflix could turn out very differently once there are more players in the field. As Vue’s Richards puts it: “No industry can ever afford to be complacent.”Follow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

Including free trials, it has 28m customers, it said.This remains a far cry from rival Netflix, which dominates video streaming with 149m subscribers globally. Hulu operates in the US only.But in the US, Hulu’s growth has been rapid while Netflix has slowed. Netflix added 1.7m subscribers in the US in the first three months of 2019, according to its most recent earnings report. Hulu added 3.8m in the first four months of the year.The event for advertisers on Wednesday was part of a season of glitzy presentations known as upfronts in which the major US media companies vie to lure ad dollars to their TV channels and streaming services.Hulu brought out stars including George Clooney, Reese Witherspoon, Kate McKinnon, Margot Robbie, Mindy Kaling and Chrissy Teigen, underscoring the growing clout of streaming companies in Hollywood.Mr Clooney joked it was his first upfront in 25 years, alluding to his role on the hit show ER in the Nineties, while thanking Hulu for running reruns of the show.Hulu unveiled new shows that it hopes will convince advertisers of its cultural cachet and relevance with younger viewers.It has commissioned two television series based on Disney’s Marvel characters. It is also working with Vox Media’s production studio to make cooking shows with David Chang and Chrissy Teigen. And it gave the green light to a series starring Kate McKinnon as Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos.Hulu, which was conceived as a joint venture among traditional media companies getting into the streaming business for the first time, now has only two owners: Disney, with a 60 per cent stake, and Comcast, with 30 per cent. Disney chief Bob Iger has said he may be interested in taking full control of the company.AT&T sold its 10 per cent stake in Hulu back to the company last month in a deal that pegged the value of Hulu at $15bn. Netflix’s market capitalisation is over $160bn.Disney executives said at an investor day last month that they expect Hulu to grow to between 40m and 60m subscribers by 2024. Hulu is lossmaking, and Disney does not expect it to become profitable until 2023 or 2024.

There will also be a €1.2bn bond at 3.88 per cent. Both slugs of debt are expected to have a maturity of 10.5 years.In a statement, Netflix said it would use the money in part to buy and make content as it seeks to fend off looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered. Disney, Apple, AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Comcast are all plotting streaming services to debut in the coming year.The headline was amended to say Netflix hopes to sell $900m of bonds.

Both slugs of debt are expected to have a maturity of 10.5 years. The fundraising is expected to be finalised on Wednesday.In a statement, Netflix said it would use the money in part to buy and make content. The fundraising comes as Netflix faces looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered. Disney, Apple, AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Comcast are all plotting streaming services to debut in the coming year.Netflix’s long-term debt stood at $10.3bn at the end of March, versus $6.5bn a year ago, and the company has forecast a free cash burn of $3.5bn in 2019. It has told analysts it expects the burn to decline significantly in subsequent years as subscriber growth accelerates. The new debt is rated BB- by two rating agencies, three notches below investment grade.The fresh bond issuance has already garnered support, as investors look past the negative cash flow to focus on the company’s powerful brand, strong growth and chunky equity market capitalisation of $168bn.“I think people look at the market cap of the business,” said one investor. “It gives people an enormous comfort. The company is spending a large amount of money to build a library of content and there is a cost associated with that.”Over time the company has said it will reduce its reliance on bond markets. During an earnings call last week, Netflix executives flagged plans to slow debt issuance in 2020 as it looks to become “self-funded”. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said: “I think the message to debt investors is, you better [get] in soon, because there’s not going to be that much more to go.”S&P analyst Jawad Hussein expects that Netflix’s cash flow deficit will shrink to between $2bn and $2.5bn next year, but that the company will still have to issue “at least $3bn” in debt to cover its costs and provide a cushion of cash.“They’re balancing growth versus investment, and we understand that. It’s quite expensive to create so much content,” Mr Hussein said. “However, in 2020, if we don’t see a material improvement in cash flow deficit, that would be a worrying sign. That would point to either slow growth because of more competition from Disney and others, or [Netflix] having to spend more to grow internationally and spend more on content.”The new debt is likely to be priced with a coupon of around 5.63 per cent in the US and a slightly lower coupon in Europe due to the lower level of benchmark interest rates there, according to initial discussions with investors. That is slightly above the average yield on BB-rated bonds in the US at the moment, which stands at around 4.75 per cent.Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo are running the bond sale.
60;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-04-16T21:50:37Z;Netflix subscriber outlook disappoints;After its strongest quarter ever, video streaming service guides lower for the next one;Price rises did little to dent the rapid customer growth at Netflix, which posted its strongest quarter for new subscriptions in results announced on Tuesday, but it warned that Wall Street forecasts for the next few months might be overheated.The video streaming service signed up 9.6m subscribers in the first three months of the year, ahead of forecasts and coming within a whisker of 150m customers around the world.Its expectation for the second quarter, though, was a net addition of 5m subscribers, lower than the 6m analysts had predicted. Netflix shares were modestly lower in after-hours trading. The lighter forecast comes as Netflix faces looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered.Disney last week unveiled plans for a new streaming service for about half the price of a standard Netflix subscription, sending Disney’s shares soaring. Apple last month made a similarly splashy announcement for its own streaming service. Disney, Apple, WarnerMedia and Comcast are all planning to launch services in the coming year. That was not the reason for the lighter guidance, however. Addressing Disney and Apple’s move on to its turf in a letter to investors, Netflix said: “We don’t anticipate that these new entrants will materially affect our growth . . . We believe there is vast demand for watching great TV and movies and Netflix only satisfies a small portion of that demand.”Netflix raised prices for all customers in the US, its largest market, in a move that was cheered by investors at the time. For its most popular tier, which offers video in high-definition, prices rose by $2 a month to $13 — a dollar more than rival Hulu’s ad-free subscription. Netflix said that the response to the price changes in the US was “as we expected”. More than 1.7m of the 9.6m new customers in the first quarter came from the US, where prices rose up to 18 per cent.Revenue in the first three months of the year jumped 22 per cent to $4.52bn, versus consensus forecasts for $4.5bn. Net income climbed 19 per cent to $344m for the quarter, or 76 cents a share on a diluted basis.As Netflix spend billions to make shows and films, routinely outbidding traditional Hollywood studios, it has justified the splurge with fast subscriber growth. The strategy has paid off: as of the end of March, Netflix had 149m subscribers across the globe, giving it a big head-start on Disney and Apple. Netflix uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $10.3bn at the end of March. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that. The company highlighted some of the fruits of this investment in the quarter including Triple Frontier, an original Netflix film starring Ben Affleck. Netflix claims the action movie was watched in more than 52m households in its first four weeks on the service.Shares in Netflix were down about 1 per cent in after-hours trading following the results. Netflix shares have soared more than 30 per cent this year, while the S&P 500 index has climbed 15 per cent.

62;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-04-16T03:00:33Z;Netflix changes the way TV production is paid for;Streaming service will drip-feed $19.3bn to producers over the next five years;The rise of streaming has changed the way people watch television. Now companies such as Netflix are reshaping how TV production is financed.As the company snaps up the most sought-after scripts and ideas, it is signing longer-lasting rights deals than traditional broadcasters and staggering payments for shows over several years, according to people familiar with the strategy.Regulatory filings show that over the next five years Netflix will drip-feed a total of $19.3bn to producers for new shows and to license TV that has already been made.For producers, this is a departure from old norms of accounts being settled in full on delivery, and it means having to take out longer-term loans to finance new shows. For the banks providing that financing, this is also new territory: longer-term loans are inherently riskier than short-term ones and Netflix, as the ultimate payer, is a riskier proposition than traditional broadcasters. Its credit rating, double-B, deems it below investment grade — but banks are proving enthusiastic about getting exposure to the streaming revolution.“Historically we have lent against the likes of ITV or BBC, where we were lending on a shorter term and with a counterparty that had a strong credit rating,” said Lorraine Ruckstuhl, head of media at Barclays Corporate Banking. “When you are dealing with a growing but levered business like Netflix the external ratings are not as strong, so you need to really understand the strategy of the business and manage the risk. Which we do.”Barclays in London is one of the banks stepping up to provide this longer-term credit, often between three and four years in duration versus a few months under the old model. Its biggest public loan was £17.5m to Forgiving Earth Ltd, a co-producer of Black Earth Rising, a legal drama series that takes place during the Rwandan genocide.JPMorgan and City National Bank of Los Angeles are also among the willing lenders to producers of streamed content.Typically, loans have been for between £3m and £30m, bankers said, and syndicates of banks have combined for larger financings. Smaller productions are rarely financed by banks because the legal fees, interest payments and other associated costs become prohibitive.Neil Begley, vice-president at Moody’s, says Netflix is “strong-arming” producers to avoid adding more debt to its own balance sheet. “One way to do that is to say: we’ll pay you, but we want you to do the financing until it’s ready.”Netflix declined to comment, but a person close to the company said: “Netflix pays market, and often top of market, to work with the best producers. This is a seller’s market for them with more competition than ever before.” Last year there were 495 original scripted series released, compared to just 288 in 2012 — and the vast majority of these new shows were made for streaming services. For lenders to production companies, a central concern is the creditworthiness of Netflix and the other streaming businesses that are buying all this content. The terms on offer suggest optimism about the sector despite the fast-shifting media landscape. Loans for shows produced for Netflix have interest rates of 5 to 6 per cent, bankers said, only a nudge more than Netflix’s corporate bonds, adjusted for relative maturities.“The risk is if they were to lose subscribers and go downhill, they’ve locked themselves into a certain amount of expenditure for years to come,” said Mr Begley. “Can they let that burn off fast enough before destroying their margins? I’m not as concerned about it today as I was three or four years ago.”Producers say the staggered payment system suits them just fine when financing is available at relatively modest interest rates. Mick Pilsworth, a veteran TV executive who commissioned programmes such as Midsomer Murders and a Jeremy Clarkson chat show, said that “increasingly now there is a market for lending for productions . . . It is ramping up because of Netflix”.
63;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-04-12T04:00:49Z;How Game of Thrones changed television;The much-anticipated final season arrives this weekend — but can the show’s formula be repeated?;"One balmy evening two summers ago, I stepped into a London pub in the hope of a quiet drink. It was 9pm on a Monday, but the Three Compasses was already jammed. A chorus was being led by a group waving their beers like conductors’ batons. Couples were clinging to one another. At one point a young man stood up, pointed at a projector screen and yelled: “Get a grip, Theon!” Monday nights, it transpired, were Game of Thrones nights.If similar scenes have played out in homes and bars around the world in recent years, this weekend they will be even bigger. The final season of HBO’s fantasy epic arrives on a tide of cultural anticipation unseen since the climax of Harry Potter. So far, the trailer has been viewed more than 50m times on YouTube. Over seven juggernaut seasons, the most ambitious TV show of our era has become a phenomenon that is casually referenced by politicians and novelists as a byword for the most brutal and cynical way of wielding power.At the centre of the Game of Thrones universe are two questions: one, how a strange work of fiction — which features, among other exotica, dragons, eunuch warriors and the living dead — came to have such a hold on our culture; and two, how it’s all going to end. For as the show careers towards its finale on May 19, we are heading for one of those once-in-a-decade events in which it is almost unseemly not to take an interest.“I plan to be very drunk,” the show’s co-creator David Benioff told Entertainment Weekly last month, referring to the night of the final broadcast, “and very far from the internet.”Depending on how you look at it, Game of Thrones is either a very good TV show or a very bad one. The premise, for anyone who has somehow yet managed to escape watching, is that the land of Westeros is divided into seven kingdoms run by seven dysfunctional families that have for centuries existed in a state of on-again-off-again civil war, the result being that the entire show is orientated around a protracted battle for overall dominion — and one rather garish Iron Throne.Adapted for TV by Benioff and DB Weiss, based on an unfinished series of novels by the American fantasy writer George RR Martin, the show exhausted its source material in 2016; since then Benioff and Weiss have been following a blueprint provided exclusively to them by the novelist, so even the most ardent fans still have no idea where the narrative is headed.The case against the show rests largely on its preoccupation with the lowest forms of entertainment. The first episode includes three beheadings, four instances of borderline non-consensual sex and six full-frontal shots of naked female bodies. There’s also a scene in which a character is slit with a sword so that his digestive system falls out on to the floor; another then remarks: “A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.”‘I stopped watching when a 15-year-old despot was encouraging two prostitutes to beat each other to death’The show’s willingness to revel in sex and violence feels particularly out of kilter in our era of heightened sensitivity to gender politics. Some of its most transgressive moments would surely never have happened in the #MeToo era. The camera frequently lingers on the female body — it’s worth noting that in the first seven series of Game of Thrones, only one of its 19 directors was a woman — while rape occurs with what feels like unreasonable regularity and in often ludicrous scenarios (at one point a major character, Jaime Lannister, rapes his twin sister while she mourns at their dead son’s tomb).“I stopped watching around the point in season three when Joffrey, a 15-year-old despot, was encouraging two prostitutes to beat each other to death,” says the writer Will Self, referring to a preposterously villainous boy king, whom his almost equally vindictive mother Cersei (who was also, incidentally, the rape victim) installs on Westeros’ Iron Throne in the hope of pulling the strings behind the scenes. “I’d been watching it with my teenage son, and I suddenly thought: Really? Is this the sort of thing I want him to experience as entertainment?”But all the things that make Westeros squalid and disturbing are also the things that make it such rich dramatic terrain. Drawing on JRR Tolkien and the 15th-century Wars of the Roses, among other fictional and historical touchstones, it conjures a pre-bureaucratic world in which politics operates primarily through subterfuge and force, a formula that has only taken on greater resonance in our new age of strongman politics. A drama of personalities — from the tyrannical Ramsay Bolton, who feeds his enemies to his dogs, to the cerebral Tyrion Lannister, the cheerful strategist behind much of the show’s chicanery, played to much acclaim by the actor Peter Dinklage — its early seasons were a slow but often richly satisfying exercise in political manoeuvring.As the show has progressed, its audience has outgrown the original core fan base (the 2011 pilot was watched by a relatively niche audience of 2.2m in the US; the most recent season finale reached 12.2m American viewers, and that year the show also held the dubious honour of being the most pirated series ever), its tenor has shifted. Once a complex playground for hardened devotees, it has since simplified its politics and narrowed its focus, transitioning almost imperceptibly over the course of the latter seasons into a more straightforward battle of good versus evil. “As the budgets have increased, the scope, the panorama of the drama, has become huge,” says Cambridge historian Helen Castor. “But at the same time, the story has become less historical and more mythical . . . it feels much more, in a sense, Arthurian.”One of the show’s most notable early features was its tendency to dispatch beloved characters at a moment’s notice, the most divisive example being the first-season beheading of Sean Bean’s Ned Stark, who until that point had been the moral heart of the show and was therefore presumed indispensable. “If I watch [the US TV series] 24,” co-creator DB Weiss told the Oxford Union in 2014, in reference to the dramatic benefits of the show’s seemingly indiscriminate killings, “I never wonder whether Jack Bauer’s going to live or die, I’m just wondering how he’s going to get out of this situation.”But as Game of Thrones draws to a close, it is less concerned with the fate of individual characters than with that of Westeros as a whole. At the end of the penultimate season, a maniacal army of undead “white walkers” who have been threatening to descend on the seven kingdoms since the pilot, were on the brink of doing just that. Our last moments in Westeros were spent in the presence of a fire-breathing dragon that was destroying the 700ft wall that had been keeping the walkers at bay — a feat of lavish computerised imagery unlike anything seen before on the show.“It appears that Tyrion’s assessment was correct,” Jon Snow, the show’s ostensible hero, says to his new ally Daenerys Targaryen, upon appraising Westeros’s predicament. “We’re f***ed.”A parallel is often drawn between the “New Hollywood” of the 1970s, the artistic heyday in which filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman made their most celebrated and challenging works, and the recent “golden age” of television. In this analogy, Game of Thrones is Star Wars — the blockbuster that changed everything.Arriving in 2011 into a richly creative landscape whose prized assets were challenging, insular psychodramas like Mad Men, it showed audiences that a TV show could provide not only sophisticated dramatic arcs but also spectacle. Importing a model that had proven hugely successful in cinema, it repurposed an existing fictional world with a dedicated fan base into a high-budget visual experience, in the manner of The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and early Marvel film franchises of the 2000s.But since Game of Thrones first aired, the TV landscape has shifted dramatically. The arrival of Netflix and Amazon — and latterly Facebook, Snapchat and Apple, among others — coupled with a marked increase in the amount of content being commissioned by each (Netflix is expected to spend $15bn on programming this year), has resulted in a diverse but fractured landscape, widely dubbed “Peak TV”. In it, networks are competing for ever-dwindling shares of the available audience; each is desperately trying to find a tent-pole production that will set it apart from the rest.“There’s so much more content now than there was when The Sopranos or even Breaking Bad debuted,” says Alan Sepinwall, author of The Revolution Was Televised, “and we all watch on different schedules. So it’s much harder for any show to become a water-cooler phenomenon in the Peak TV era. Game of Thrones may be the last of its kind.”Nevertheless, networks are still trying to replicate its success. In November 2017, Amazon announced that it had bought the rights to adapt The Lord of the Rings into a TV series that will reportedly cost $1bn, part of a broader strategy that involved a shift towards higher-budget productions with “global appeal”. “The mandate from [Amazon chief] Jeff Bezos is clear,” reported the industry publication Variety two months before the deal was announced. “Bring me Game of Thrones.”For Benioff and Weiss, the road ahead has not been entirely smooth. In July 2017, they announced plans for their next epic, a controversial work of alternate history called Confederate that imagined a world in which the American civil war ended in a stalemate and slavery remained legal. “Confederate is the kind of provocative thought experiment that can be engaged in when someone else’s lived reality really is fantasy to you,” American author Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in The Atlantic, in response to the announcement. The hashtag #NoConfederate trended at number one in the US on Twitter.The best analogy for the ‘Game of Thrones’ experience might be found not in drama but in sport: the post-match analysis, the passionate allegiancesFor now the project is delayed indefinitely — though not, the network says, due to the controversy. But HBO’s appetite for the epic remains: an adaptation of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials, co-produced with the BBC, is due to air this year, while Damon Lindelof, the creator of Lost, is working on an adaptation of the DC comic Watchmen. The cultural capital accrued by the Game of Thrones universe, meanwhile, is to be invested further: a prequel series has been commissioned, with Naomi Watts in the lead role. Four more spin-offs have also been discussed.Somehow, though, it feels unlikely that any of these will capture the zeitgeist quite like the original. “The next Game of Thrones is probably not going to be a fantasy epic,” says Sepinwall, “in the same way that the next Sopranos wasn’t another gangster story. That’s never how this works.”David Simon, the creator of The Wire, once said: “The audience is like a child. ‘Come to the table,’ you say. ‘Here’s your meal.’ You’ve got potatoes, you’ve got vegetables, and they want the ice cream.”Perhaps all Game of Thrones has ever been is ice cream — the guilty pleasure of an infantilised generation who can no longer be bothered to put themselves through the rigours of serious works of art; a show that, in the words of the novelist Adam Foulds, has a “spray-on tan of classiness”. But for many who love it, it doesn’t feel that way.A few weeks before the final season airs, I return to the Three Compasses, the site of my own Game of Thrones awakening. Today, the pub is bustling with exactly the sort of millennial punters one thinks of as the show’s target demographic. At a small outside table I find three young women laughing and chatting under a warm heat lamp. “Oh my God, I love Game of Thrones,” one of them, Eliza, tells me when I ask if they’ve been following the show. “It’s been so long since the last season I’d almost forgotten about it.”Life & Arts this week explores the small screen universe.

Literature as lifebloodExplore the series here.“I just don’t like it,” interjects her friend Flo. “I’m sorry, but it’s the sex, the violence, the whole thing. The way the show treats women, it just doesn’t sit right with me.”“But loads of the women are really powerful!” shoots back Eliza.A back and forth ensues: the pros, the cons, the dragons. “OK, fine,” says Flo eventually. “Maybe I’ll try it again.”It strikes me that perhaps some of the appeal of Game of Thrones lies in exactly these kinds of exchanges — in the endless discussions invited by the show’s many contentious features. In fact, a better analogy for the experience might be found not in serialised drama but in sport: the post-match analysis, the passionate allegiances the show inspires, even its tournament-style structure, which tapers satisfyingly towards the unveiling of an eventual “winner”. These all feel more reminiscent of the football World Cup than The Sopranos.But there’s also something more to it than this. In the fractured landscape of the streaming era, where consumption is hyper-individualised, there is a rare pleasure in being part of a cultural collective. The evening I visit the Three Compasses, a slim young man, James, tells me he had resisted Game of Thrones for years but finally crumbled last season. “The thing is,” he says, “it might be a load of old shit.

64;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-04-10T10:26:49Z;The race to make the next ‘Game of Thrones’;As the fantasy phenomenon reaches its conclusion, broadcasters bid to create TV’s new blockbuster;"Much has changed in Hollywood in the eight years since HBO first brought the war between the Starks, the Lannisters and the White Walkers to US television screens. Today, tech giants including Apple, Netflix and Amazon are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to create what they hope will be the next global hit. So what’s the best way to make it happen?The Wire, Mad Men and Breaking Bad ushered in a golden age of television. Yet compared to the shows in the works at Apple, Amazon and Netflix, those award-winning US dramas start to seem parochial.“After Game of Thrones, anything that smells or looks like Game of Thrones is something that people are excited about,” says Mark Gordon, a veteran Hollywood producer who last year sold an adaptation of CS Lewis’s The Chronicles of Narnia to Netflix.It’s only one of dozens of fantasy epics now in production, among them Amazon’s adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, Netflix’s version of cult novel series The Witcher, and Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories, based on tales from the groundbreaking science-fiction magazine.“Brilliant stories within the sci-fi, fantasy and adventure genres tend to more easily transcend cultural norms,” says Jesse Sisgold, chief operating officer at Skydance Media, which is producing an adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series for Apple’s new TV+ service. Asimov’s story of a galactic empire, which first appeared in the 1940s and 1950s, was a huge influence on the creators of Star Wars and Star Trek. “They take you to a world you could not otherwise experience,” says Sisgold, “and thus more easily reward a global audience.”In cinemas, superheroes still dominate, thanks to the enduring box office draw of Iron Man, Spider-Man and Batman. The Avengers films and their spin-offs including Black Panther and Captain Marvel have together taken more than $15bn in global ticket sales for Walt Disney.But because most of the Marvel and DC franchises are locked up inside their parent companies of Disney and AT&T, other producers are looking to build their own “universes” elsewhere. Well-established brands, of which there are many in the fantasy genre, are viewed as safer bets.When Gordon, who is president at eOne, a film and TV production company, brokered the deal to bring Narnia to Netflix: “The pitch was that we would be selling not just one movie or one book as a series. There were 3,000 characters in Narnia. So there was this very ripe opportunity.”But demand for such stories may already be outstripping supply. “The fact is there is very little intellectual property available,” says Gordon. “So when you have a worldwide gigantic brand, like these books or The Lord of the Rings, people are running to it.”At the end of March 2011, Netflix had 23.6m subscribers and its streaming service was only available in the US and Canada. Its audience is now six times as large and spent $12bn in cash last year on content that can play across its 190 markets. In the process, it has transformed the way Hollywood does business.In the past, broadcasters such as the BBC or cable companies such as HBO would screen a show in their home markets before trying to sell it abroad, one country or region at a time. Now, tech platforms are buying up worldwide rights. To justify that spend, though, they must also seek global hits. The two dynamics feed off each other, inflating prices in the process.“The more the content resonates worldwide, the more justified the extra spend is for the platform,” says Sisgold. But that kind of budgeting is causing problems, even for the likes of Netflix. “It is definitely getting more expensive to source content,” the streaming service’s chief executive Reed Hastings admitted at a press event in Los Angeles last month.Among the most extreme examples came in November 2017, when Amazon outbid Netflix for the rights to adapt JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings for a reported $250m over five series. The Hollywood Reporter has estimated that the full cost of production, including casting and special effects, could exceed $1bn.Netflix says that its original shows bring in a disproportionate number of new subscribers, bringing revenues that in turn fuel more investment in exclusive content. But some investors worry that as it keeps increasing its content budget in line with subscriber growth, the model only works if its audience continues to expand.That is why, when Netflix delivered subscriber figures below Wall Street’s expectations last July, its stock fell by more than 10 per cent in a single day. While Netflix describes itself as more media company than tech these days, Amazon and Apple are funding their TV projects from a much larger business — meaning they can afford to stomach losses for longer, as long as it keeps people buying iPhones or subscribing to Prime.Steven Spielberg railed against Netflix for failing to give its Oscar-nominated films such as Roma a full theatrical release. Yet he does not seem to share the same concerns about Apple’s new TV+ streaming service, appearing on stage at its launch event last month alongside fellow sci-fi director JJ Abrams, actors Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, former Game of Thrones star Jason Momoa, and Oprah Winfrey.As the battle lines are drawn between Apple, Amazon and Netflix, Hollywood talent is being encouraged to pick sides. Netflix has signed up showrunners including Shonda Rhimes (the creator of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy) and Ryan Murphy (the man behind the American Horror Story franchise), poaching them from traditional US broadcasters with nine-figure deals. Amazon has signed a similar deal with Get Out and Us director Jordan Peele.Traditional broadcasters had to rely on billboards and chat shows to build awareness of their new releases. But as Oprah pointed out at the Apple event last month, the iPhone is in “a billion pockets, y’all — a billion pockets”.The global scale and direct relationship with audiences that Netflix, Amazon and Apple can offer content creators is an entirely new phenomenon in the entertainment industry.Crucially, they have control over their home screens, which gives them a huge advantage over producers who must rely on local or regional broadcasters for distribution. In this way Netflix was able to power past the poor reviews given to its Sandra Bullock-starring horror film Bird Box, encouraging some 45m viewers to watch it.“If you are global and you can get people to watch the first episode on a global distribution network, you can give it massive prominence,” says Tom Harrington, a media analyst at Enders Analysis. “If they want to make it a hit they can probably make it a hit . . . They can put it at the top of the user interface and force it down your throat.”Even though Apple, Netflix and Amazon can draw on viewing data from their vast audiences to inform their multimillion-dollar commissioning, nobody can really predict what will become the next Game of Thrones. “Nobody knows what will be successful,” says Harrington. “It’s an alchemy.”Life & Arts this week examines the small screen universe.

65;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-04-10T04:00:32Z;Can Amazon and Netflix succeed in India?;The streaming giants are investing in the continent’s television — creating gritty dramas with global appeal;"Two weary policemen — an experienced detective and his eager-to-learn junior inspector — drive through the night-time cityscape. Almost lost for words, they begin discussing the horrifying murder they’re charged with solving, struggling to comprehend how such evil erupted into their world. It feels like any other gritty Netflix detective drama but for one crucial difference: it’s Indian.This year has seen an acceleration in foreign competition for the country’s TV market, with both Amazon and Netflix launching big-budget original series, and each announcing a broad slate of future content that, while rooted in India, has clear appeal across a world in which geography and language are no longer barriers to enjoyment. Following the international success of shows such as Narcos, the 2015 crime series set in Colombia and Mexico, and the Israeli spy drama Fauda, came Amazon’s 2018 Indian mobster epic Mirzapur and Netflix’s Mumbai-noir series, Sacred Games — further proof of the global appetite for stories with a local flavour.Before the arrival of online streaming platforms, Indian television was already a smorgasbord of channels, from regional local-language stations to Hindi-language pay channels, including the Disney-owned StarPlus, Sony Entertainment and Zee, and the public broadcaster Doordarshan. The appetite for these services remains ravenous. The biggest shows of recent decades have been soapy family melodramas such as Kasautii Zindagii Kay (The Trials Of Life) (2001) and domestic sitcoms such as Hum Paanch (We Five) (1995). There was no western-style “golden era” of Indian television — no incisively written dramas such as Mad Men or The Sopranos.Last month, though, both Amazon and Netflix launched shows created and produced by Indians that address the country’s contemporary reality — if from opposite ends of the societal spectrum. Amazon’s Made In Heaven is a high-gloss, mostly English-language production that tells stories from the creamiest layer of Indian society through the lens of an upscale wedding-planning business. Not unlike Sex and the City, it explores relationships, sexuality — including homosexuality — and conspicuous consumption, with a sassy cast of strong and sharp-tongued female characters and a lot of carnal intrigue.Meanwhile Delhi Crime, Netflix’s big new Indian show, is, like True Detective, a hard-boiled cop series that peers into the dark heart of society through the investigations of a jaded police officer. It was inspired by the 2012 gang rape and murder of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh Pandey, who was kidnapped and tortured aboard a private bus, a crime that led to a national and international outcry.Though the new arrivals mostly target the small but exploding young urban audience, and so are not in direct competition with the biggest existing Indian broadcasters and on-demand services such as Hotstar and ZEE5, the competition for subscribers is intense. Amazon Prime Video costs 129 rupees (about £1.42) per month, cheaper even than Hotstar, whose plans begin at 199 rupees. Netflix charges substantially more at 500 rupees per month. (Last year India’s per capita income was 113,000 rupees, or about £1,245.)While neither company will divulge subscriber numbers or viewing figures for individual shows, both have seen their Indian content avidly consumed overseas. Gaurav Gandhi, Amazon Prime’s director and country manager for India, says of Breathe, a serial-killer series released last January, “one-third of the viewers came from outside India. And we’re getting a lot of love abroad for Made in Heaven. It’s there in the reviews and the chatter. The growth in interest has been very organic.”Despite being substantially in English, Made in Heaven hasn’t compromised on authenticity. “It’s the language of that class of society,” Zoya Akhtar, one of the series’ creators, tells me. “And the appeal is universal, because wedding planning is pure theatre . . . It’s a great scenario for drama.”Gandhi, who was previously the head of Voot, the on-demand arm of Viacom’s Indian joint venture Viacom18, joined Amazon last year as part of a wave of new hires in the region by US streamers. Last year, Netflix recruited Simran Sethi as its creative director for India.It is not only English-language Indian shows that have enjoyed wider success. Netflix’s Hindi-language horror series Ghoul found a strong non-Hindi-speaking audience in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, where “45 per cent of viewers watched it with English subtitles, and 37 per cent with English dubbing,” according to Sethi. The numbers and reviews point to a growing worldwide taste for Indian content beyond the country’s large expat communities.Sethi also points to Netflix’s algorithms, which suggest new shows to subscribers based on their past viewing habits, but which can also steer viewers towards more international material. “The curation within the platform brings the right content to the right viewer,” she says. “If you watched a horror show like [the US-made] The Haunting of Hill House, Netflix will offer you Ghoul as another show in that genre. Viewers can enjoy the genres they like with new settings . . . The platform allows you to discover these. My mum is a big fan of Korean family dramas that are now hugely popular in India and the US.”One thing that separates the new streaming shows from traditional Indian TV is that, being internet-delivered, they are exempt from the control of India’s Central Board of Film Classification, which bans bad language and candid portrayals of sex and violence. The country’s TV (like its big-screen counterpart, Bollywood) has often shied away from challenging portrayals of Indian life — especially of women. In the new context, though, directors such as Zoya Akhtar are able to tell authentic female stories.“We wanted to talk about things that affect women. And with Amazon we don’t have censorship. We have a very long format with which we can really delve into things. We can have lovemaking, sex and real language. And there’s no pressure of the box office.”Where terrestrial TV had to cater for a broad multigenerational viewership, now, with internet access, younger people increasingly watch TV away from their parents and grandparents. “Three hundred million people here now have smartphones. Online video is as mainstream as traditional television,” says Vikram Malhotra, chief executive of Abundantia Entertainment, which produced Amazon’s Breathe. “It’s been brilliant to work with progressive-minded talent, who are nonconformist and in tune with the younger demographic.” Buoyed by its successes in the region, Netflix has announced six original Indian series, including Baahubali, a fantasy epic not unlike Game of Thrones, and the ghost story Typewriter. Meanwhile, Amazon is casting A-list Bollywood stars with global profiles: Abhishek Bachchan will be joining season two of Breathe; action hero Akshay Kumar will front The End, a series in development with Abundantia, also for Amazon.For now, Netflix and Amazon’s venture in India remains an experiment, but it’s one that looks promising. It helps that the country’s top names are jumping into the TV arena, just like their counterparts in Hollywood. And also that the country has a rich history of bringing stories to the screen. “There has always been such amazing storytelling talent in India,” says Sethi, “and people can now tell their stories on their own terms to the whole world.”Life & Arts this week explores the small screen universe.

66;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-04-02T21:28:17Z;Push to ban Netflix from Oscars may violate antitrust laws;DoJ issues warning as Steven Spielberg prepares to push a rules change at the Academy;The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences could be in violation of competition law if it excludes movies that debut on Netflix from the Oscars, according to the Department of Justice.Makan Delrahim, the justice department’s antitrust chief, last month wrote to Dawn Hudson, the Academy’s chief executive, warning that any changes to Oscar eligibility rules could spark antitrust concerns, according to a person familiar with the letter.The move by Mr Delrahim came ahead of the Academy’s board of governors meeting later this month, where Steven Spielberg, the film-maker and Academy board member, is expected to try and change the rules on what films are eligible for consideration at the Oscars.Mr Spielberg has criticised the inclusion of movies that largely play on streaming sites like Netflix, rather than primarily in theatres.In the March 21 letter, first reported by Variety and confirmed by a person familiar with its contents, Mr Delrahim said any eligibility requirements that did not have a “procompetitive justification” could “raise antitrust concerns”.He noted that the Academy’s membership included several competitors, and said an agreement to exclude other rivals could violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which deals with illegal restraints on trade.“If the Academy adopts a new rule to exclude certain types of films, such as films distributed via online streaming services, from eligibility for the Oscars, and that exclusion tends to diminish the excluded films’ sales, that rule could therefore violate Section 1,” said Mr Delrahim in the letter, according to the person familiar.An Academy spokesperson confirmed the letter and said it had responded, without offering further details.“The Academy’s Board of Governors will meet on April 23 for its annual awards rules meeting, where all branches submit possible updates for consideration,” the spokesperson added.“The Antitrust Division regularly expresses its views when it learns of potential practices that may violate the antitrust laws,” said a justice department spokesperson. “Many organizations also seek the Division’s guidance on proposed practices through Business Review Letters and other means.”
67;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-03-22T18:19:34Z;Big Tech competes to be the Netflix of gaming;Google, Apple and Microsoft want to use the cloud to let people play any game at any time on any device;In common with tens of millions of people around the world, Fortnite keeps Netflix boss Reed Hastings up at night. Unlike everyone else, he is not enjoying the experience.Netflix was the troublemaker that barged into Hollywood with a Silicon Valley formula for creating new content, distributing existing TV shows and movies, stealing eyeballs and dominating our leisure time.Now, Mr Hastings frets that Netflix is itself being disrupted by Fortnite — an addictive, multiplayer, online “battle royale” shooting game that has evolved into a social media platform and is so explosively popular that, if its roughly 250m global user base were a country, it would be the fifth largest in the world.“We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO,” the Netflix chief executive said in a letter to shareholders in January. “Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose.”If games are already luring Netflix’s audience away, Mr Hastings may be unnerved to learn that the interactive entertainment industry is now looking to steal his business model, too. A heavyweight army of tech groups is jostling to position itself as the “Netflix of games”, made up of individual developers and publishers such as Electronic Arts and Rovio spin-off Hatch to some of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, including Google, Microsoft and Apple.The land grab is making video games one of the most dynamic and competitive markets in the tech industry. Over the coming 18 months, according to bankers across three continents, it is also likely to be a battleground for mergers and acquisition activity as the competition heats up for control of content.“Gaming is far more than just a game — it is a new media format,” says Bruce Stein, chief executive of aXiomatic, an investor in Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games, and Niantic, the creator of Pokémon Go. “Anybody who looks at gaming has to be aware of the amount of time it’s consuming, with each generation now growing. If they don’t put it into their mix, they are likely to be victimised by it.”As well as being the entertainment industry’s biggest disrupter, the games market — which is worth nearly $140bn a year in sales — is entering its own period of seismic change.Google this week unveiled a new cloud gaming platform, Stadia, which is formidable in scale and ambition, promising the ability to play any game, any time, anywhere. While some analysts warned about the dearth of content announced for Stadia, which will launch this year, some in the video games press have breathlessly compared it to Sony’s launch of the first PlayStation in 1994. Amazon, Microsoft and China’s Tencent are all expected to reveal their own cloud gaming platforms, capitalising on their investments in data centres and connectivity around the world.The “death of the console” has been prematurely declared many times before. But after surviving the huge growth of mobile gaming, many in the industry believe this time it will come true now that expansive and graphically rich games can be streamed from the cloud to any device.“Probably what we all got wrong on the death of the console was the timing,” says Paul Murphy, a tech investor at Northzone Ventures and former chief of mobile gaming company Dots. “But I don’t think any of us got the idea wrong.”The tech industry loves to hype its latest big idea as the “next Uber” or “next Google” but in this case, the Netflix-for-gaming label fits the future of the games industry in several ways.Many players will take advantage of a similar kind of streaming technology that gives audiences instant access to a vast library of content. Today, gamers can sometimes wait hours to download a new title to their PC or console. Google has promised Stadia users will be able to launch a new game within just five seconds of clicking a link, delivered through its own internet infrastructure.Second, many of the tech industry’s platform companies dream of building the kind of huge and loyal subscriber base that has made Netflix a global media company on a scale never before seen. As iPhone sales have slowed, subscriptions have become a particular priority for Apple, which is said to be courting games creators for a new service that would sit alongside its renewed push into video and news.All the many companies engaged in a ‘Battle Royale’ for gamers’ attention want to be the first destination their audience turns to for a form of entertainment that is already far more lucrative than movies or music. “The future of gaming is a fight for a direct relationship with the end user,” says Nicholas Lovell, game director at Brighton-based studio Electric Square and author of The Curve, a book about digital distribution.Only relatively recently has Silicon Valley realised just how important that relationship might be. Apple and Google came to dominate distribution of mobile games through their app stores for iPhones and Android devices almost by accident, as video games quickly became the most popular and lucrative form of mobile apps.“This is a very different market to what it was five years ago and 10 years ago,” says Alexis Bonte, a venture partner at tech investor Atomico and chief executive of games studio eRepublik Labs. “It’s much bigger. We are talking about a $140bn market, which means that it attracts the attention of new players in different ways.”The success of titles such as Fortnite, which first launched on mobile devices a year ago, forced the tech platforms to recognise just how much bigger the gaming demographic has become in the smartphone era.“People are not going to be calling themselves ‘gamers’ any more. You don’t call yourself a ‘TV watcher’,” says Roberta Lucca, co-founder of UK-based game developer and publisher Bossa Studios. “Games are just so pervasive.”Gaming used to be written off as something for kids and nerds, but the generation born in the 1980s never grew out of them — and is now raising their own children on the principle that gaming sits as an equal alongside books, music and movies.“I would go as far as to say [gaming] is the single most important thing happening right now in our culture,” says Herman Narula, chief executive of Improbable, a London-based start-up which makes simulation technology to create “virtual worlds” both in games and other applications. “It’s going to change the way we make money and relate to each other and form our most important relationships.”That is one of the reasons why Apple has spent several months offering generous multimillion-dollar advances to developers to secure exclusive content for a planned games subscription service that could launch this year, according to several people with knowledge of the deals. (Apple declined to comment.)Google’s Stadia launch is in part a recognition of how important videos of people playing games are to YouTube, which will be tightly integrated into the cloud service, and the risk of losing that audience to Amazon’s rival video platform, Twitch, which it bought in 2014.While Google can exploit its huge head start in cloud computing, it announced only a couple of titles that would be available when Stadia launches. Like movies and music, gaming remains a hit-driven business. Many people play only the most popular games where they can find their friends for online battles, such as Fortnite or EA’s fast-growing rival, Apex Legends. Free-to-play titles like these create winner-takes-all dynamics for their creators.But guessing which content will be the next Fortnite will become ever more complicated as the very concept of a game begins to morph.At a first glance, Fortnite might look like just another online shoot-’em-up, as 100 players battle across an island until only one winner survives. But traditional shooting games such as Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty series — a franchise whose lifetime sales have surpassed $17bn — do not tend to put on in-game dance parties.When Fortnite did just that, hosting superstar DJ Marshmello in concert last month, some 10.7m people joined the game to attend, with many more watching on Twitch and YouTube.As well as creating a place for friends to hang out (when they aren’t trying to kill each other virtually), Fortnite has also established in gamers’ minds the principle that they can play the same game on any device — be that console, PC, smartphone or tablet — against the same group of friends.For many years, Sony has recognised the potentially huge financial rewards of building a huge in-house studio, which created two of 2018’s biggest hits, Spider-Man and God of War.Microsoft’s efforts to emulate that has seen a flurry of deals in which it has bought a string of midsized studios around the world. Of the 17 acquisitions Microsoft made in 2018, seven were games-related in a bid to augment its Xbox console offering.Astris Advisory analyst David Gibson says the possibility of a multibillion-dollar games studio acquisition has grown. “We could be looking at a situation where you have a number of big competing streaming services with deep pockets all saying that they need content and looking to buy studios,” he says.That is just one reason why the arrival of big tech groups makes companies such as Nintendo and the wider games industry nervous as well as excited.“What we are seeing with the evolution of this technology is gaming is getting more and more fragmented,” says Andy Kleinman, founder of Wonder, a start-up developing a gaming platform that works across different devices. While lucrative for developers, that is “worse for the user” because they will need too many apps, logins and subscriptions, he says. “Companies who are focused on building games should build games and companies focused on building platforms should build platforms.”Just as the arrival of Netflix, Apple and Amazon has driven up the price of Hollywood’s top talent, in the near term games developers are likely to see a windfall as tech companies vie for content. But developers should remember that after buying up Hollywood’s archives, Netflix turned itself into the studios’ biggest competitor, warns Mr Lovell, the author and game director.“Content makers love the idea of a ‘Netflix for games’ and a new way of getting paid,” he says. “I worry a lot of them are not realising the deal with the devil they are doing.”Netflix, your smokers are setting a terrible example / From Prof Dr Leonard Hofstra, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsMixing the message on deadly weapons / From Wendy Pridie, Leominster, Herefordshire, UK
68;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-03-22T18:06:44Z;Fox/streaming wars: fort worth;The news channel is the jewel in the crown of the media group;The streaming wars between Netflix, Apple, Disney and AT&T promise to be expensive and bitter. Mr Murdoch, by selling his studio assets to Disney for $55bn, signalled he simply did not have the scale to compete with the mega tech and media platforms. What he has kept will do him just fine.Earlier this week, the part of 21st Century Fox that Disney did not buy began to trade. But do not call Fox Corporation (“New Fox”) a rump. You might hurt its feelings.It would also be unfair. The group has an enterprise value of $23bn and owns attractive pay TV and broadcast networks focused on news and sports. This kind of live content competes gamely against the pricey movies and TV shows would-be streaming giants persistently promote.The crown jewel is Fox News. Its allegiance to President Trump means he is rarely interviewed elsewhere. He sources much of his tweet content from the channel’s programming.Question the network’s ethics or political stance, but not its ratings power. Fox News charges among the highest affiliate fees for pay-TV distributors. Fox’s pay-TV division earned around $2.3bn in ebitda in 2018. Research firm MoffettNathanson estimates 90 per cent of that comes from Fox News brands alone — the group also has the Fox Sports network. Fox News alone should then have an enterprise value of perhaps $20bn.Fox also has an over-the-air television division with rights to broadcast National Football League games. Though smaller and less profitable than Fox News, its terrestrial TV unit earns a steady return. Disney announced earlier this year that its streaming initiatives had lost more than $1bn in 2018. Netflix continues to burn billions annually in cash. Apple plans to announce its streaming splash next week probably costing it billions.Most traditional pay TV networks will get crushed in this scale game of thrones. But Mr Murdoch has shaped his portfolio uniquely well to survive.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
69;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-03-12T17:44:29Z;Lords committee launches review into future of public broadcasting;;A cross-party House of Lords committee has launched a new inquiry into whether public services broadcasters, such as the BBC and ITV, can survive the rise of on-demand video services — and whether they are “worth saving”.The Communications Committee on Tuesday said streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have made available thousands of hours of content for “less than half” the cost of a TV license.“There are concerns that the popularity of video on demand services has made PSBs redundant,” it said in a statement.“The Committee will investigate if the concept of public service broadcasting retains some value, what form it should take in future and how it could be financially viable.”Stephen Gilbert, the Conservative chair of the committee, said on-demand service companies, which do not have public service obligations, risked pricing public service broadcasters out of the production market by inflating costs.“Public service broadcasters must fulfil a range of obligations, including on the volume and type of adverts they show, programming in specific genres, the way they commission content, the audiences they serve and the watershed,” he said.The concern was also shared by Ofcom, the UK communications watchdog. In a report published last May, it said big budgets of online players like Netflix — which spent an estimated $13bn on content in 2018 — were driving a rise in production costs at a time when commercial public service broadcasters faced falling advertising revenues.Tony Hall, the BBC director-general, last week complained about the unlevel playing field between the heavily regulated public service broadcasters and international video-on-demand companies.“Ofcom themselves have pointed out that a programme can be regulated in numerous ways depending on who hosts it,” Lord Hall said at a conference in London, adding that a company like Netflix can update its app weekly with no need for regulatory approval.The committee has invited written evidence from interested parties by Friday 26 April 2019.
70;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-03-11T18:25:49Z;Facebook, Amazon among Goldman’s top bets as earnings growth cools;Analysts say investors should focus on S&P 500 companies with the best sales growth;In an ageing bull market, sales growth might be key to picking winners in the S&P 500, according to Goldman Sachs.Earnings growth accounted for 73 per cent of the S&P 500’s rally during its 10-year bull run, Goldman noted, and just 10 stocks — led by Apple, Microsoft and Amazon — were responsible for nearly 25 per cent of the index’s rise. But Wall Street analysts have warned that US earnings growth will cool off in 2019, pressuring equities.At a time when economic growth is slowing and companies are struggling to maintain profit margins, investors should focus on 50 groups that are projected to record the fastest sales growth this year, Goldman advised.“In a market characterized by modest, sales-driven EPS growth, investors typically reward firms with the fastest expected top-line growth,” Goldman analysts led by David Kostin, chief US equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Friday night.They added that earnings growth will be “driven entirely by top-line sales” as wage inflation and other cost increases take a bite out of US companies’ profits.Netflix tops the list of stocks in Goldman’s high revenue growth basket, which is comprised of the 50 S&P 500 members with the highest forecasted sales growth. The video streaming giant is expected to deliver a 28 per cent increase in revenue year-over-year, according to consensus estimates, better than any other company on the list.Facebook, at 23 per cent, and Alphabet, at 20 per cent, also rank among the companies with the strongest anticipated sales growth. Amazon, Monster Beverage, SVB Financial Group, Invisalign maker Align Technology, Autodesk, Adobe, Salesforce.com and JB Hunt Transport Services are among the other notable names highlighted by Goldman.Its list of 50 companies has a median sales growth estimate of 10 per cent, as opposed to 4 per cent for the broader index. Goldman also said its basket of stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, 14 per cent versus 10 per cent, as the outlook for growth across the index has soured.However, the analysts cautioned that relatively steady US real GDP growth and high relative valuations pose headwinds to the group of 50’s performance.The investment bank expects the S&P 500 to close the year at 3,000, implying a gain of more than 8 per cent from levels seen during midday trading on Monday.
71;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-03-06T21:00:03Z;Netflix picks Bela Bajaria to lead push into non-English language programming;Streaming company aims to add subscribers outside its core US market;Netflix has appointed Bela Bajaria to lead its push into non-English language programming as the streaming service steps up its efforts to add subscribers from countries outside its core US market.Most of the company’s subscriber growth now comes from international markets while non-English language series produced by Netflix, such as Protector, from Turkey, and Casa de Flores, from Mexico, have proven popular outside the countries where they were made.The company is ramping up the number of series, documentaries and movies it produces across Europe in 2019 and is on course to make 221 new projects this year, including 153 originals.“We have an amazing opportunity to bring stories from different cultures and in different languages to audiences all around the world, said Ms Bajaria. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said she would “bring the world’s stories to the world whatever the language.”Ms Bajaria replaces Erik Barmack, who is leaving to start his own production company. She joined Netflix in October 2016 and has led scripted and unscripted programming of series such as You, Bodyguard, and Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.Before coming to Netflix she was president of Universal Television where she made hit series such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Master of None.
72;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-25T06:28:41Z;Oscars triumphs for ‘Green Book’ and Olivia Colman;Film about pianist Don Shirley wins top gong and Briton is crowned best actress;Green Book, a biopic about the black pianist Don Shirley, scooped the Oscar for best picture, thwarting Netflix’s aggressive push to win Hollywood’s top prize.The film also won best original screenplay and a best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali, during a briefer than usual ceremony in Los Angeles.The result will be seen as an upset for Netflix, which spent tens of millions promoting Roma, a critically acclaimed drama about a maid in 1970s Mexico, as it sought to win the highest honour in Hollywood for the first time.Netflix still walked away from Tinsel Town’s biggest night with several accolades and momentum. Alfonso Cuarón won best director for Roma, while the film also clinched best cinematography and best foreign language film.But Roma had been a favourite for best picture, raising fresh questions about whether the academy was willing to fully embrace a film from a technology company.Bohemian Rhapsody, the biopic of rock band Queen and its late lead singer Freddie Mercury, was another big winner on Sunday night. The movie led the ceremony with four awards including best actor for Rami Malek and film editing.Olivia Colman fended off Glenn Close to win the best actress award for her portrayal of Queen Anne in The Favourite. It was the only award for the film, which had entered the night tied with Roma for the most nominations with 10 each.The event also marked a first for Spike Lee, with the African-American director winning his inaugural non-honorary Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlansman.Black Panther, the Walt Disney blockbuster that featured a black superhero, walked away with three Oscars for best costume design, production design and best original score.Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed their hit song Shallow from the film A Star Is Born, which won the Oscar for best song.The star-studded ceremony did not have a host for the first time in 30 years, after the comedian Kevin Hart pulled out of the event following controversy over historic remarks that had been deemed homophobic. Without a host and the usual accompanying monologues, the entire ceremony clocked in at just over three hours, compared with nearly four hours last year.Netflix has spent the past year throwing its weight behind Roma as it looks to become a force in film production in the same way it has in television. Netflix stormed film festivals in the past year and plastered billboards across Los Angeles to drum up excitement for the movie.However, the streaming giant has ruffled feathers in the film industry because it prefers to release its movies on its streaming app at the same time as the cinema. The company made a compromise for Roma, releasing it in a limited number of cinemas nearly a month before it was available to stream. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release.While accepting the award for best director, Mr Cuarón thanked Netflix executives by name, including Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, and Scott Stuber, the producer who joined Netflix two years ago to lead its push into film.Keeping filmmakers happy is important as Netflix competes for scripts and talent with traditional film studios and other tech groups such as Amazon. As Netflix is secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators.In a sign of the unusual times, Roma, which won four Academy Awards, has registered no official box-office sales because Netflix does not disclose the figures.
73;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-22T16:43:03Z;Hollywood faces sweeping changes on eve of Oscars showcase;Netflix challenges traditional studios while deals and mergers shake up industry;With the race for the Oscars reaching a climax on Sunday night, the US film industry looks in good shape with money rolling into the box office as big names vie for the annual prizes.But that is just the surface. Under the glamorous veneer of blockbusters and multibillion sales figures, the industry is being unsettled by big changes.Netflix is challenging the traditional studios while deals and mergers shift the Hollywood landscape. The online streaming service has outspent the major studios in what could be a significant turning point in the way Hollywood films are produced.But Disney, the media giant, is not going to make it easy for its new rival in a year when North American box-office sales rose 7 per cent to $11.9bn, according to ComScore.It shelled out $70bn to buy the Fox studio, which owns the 20th Century Fox brand, gaining the rights of the Avatar, X-Men and Deadpool films that have done consistently well at the box office. The group is racing to build a content war-chest to compete with Netflix’s debt-financed catalogue.“The movie business is going from physical goods to streaming faster than anybody is cognisant of,” said Jonathan Taplin, an Oscar-nominated film producer and author of Move Fast and Break Things, about internet entrepreneurs and disrupters in the 1990s.“There is going to be a war to see which aggregator can get to 400m worldwide streaming subscribers first. At that point everybody else in the movie and TV business will have to distribute through Disney or Netflix,” he added.With technology and deals driving change, pundits say it makes sense that the Oscars’ field is open with one of the most telling races between Netflix’s Roma, a Spanish language drama, and Disney’s Black Panther for Best Picture.Black Panther is the first superhero film to be nominated for Hollywood’s top award, but it may be edged out by Roma after Netflix spent millions in a campaign to win over Academy voters.Roma is tied with The Favourite for most nominations with 10 each. The Favourite, a dark comedy from Fox Searchlight, the Murdoch-owned studio known for its edgy sensibility, is also in the running for Best Picture.In a sign of the unusual times, Roma has registered no official box-office sales as Netflix will not disclose them.Another interesting contest will be between Britain’s Olivia Colman and America’s Glenn Close who are vying for Best Actress. Ms Close could pick up her first Oscar for her role in The Wife, while a victory for Ms Colman on Sunday night for her performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite would add to her success in the British Bafta awards.Green Book, a biopic about the black pianist Don Shirley distributed by Comcast’s Universal Pictures, is also tipped as a strong contender for Best Picture.“They talk about peak oil. This is peak content,” said Marty Kaplan, a former vice-president at Disney’s film studio and now the Norman Lear professor of entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California.Mr Kaplan said film studios were essentially running franchise businesses for big films, as opposed to “what studios did in ancient history” — make a wide-ranging slate of films across genres to appeal to frequent movie-goers.“The only people taking a risk on smaller or mid-list pictures tend to be the independents, or more recently, Netflix and Amazon,” he said.Disney’s pending integration of Fox will consolidate the industry further. The merger shrinks the number of Hollywood’s major studios from six to five, with thousands likely to be laid off.Film executives are also questioning what this will mean for the creative future of Fox, one of the world’s largest and most storied studios.The consolidation comes as Netflix, and to a lesser degree Amazon, continues to push into cinema. Netflix is making about 55 films a year now. In comparison, Universal released 36 films last year, according to Box Office Mojo, the industry site.While online services have already upended the music and television businesses, the film industry has remained comparatively untouched. Going to the cinema is viewed as a fundamentally different experience from watching a movie on the sofa at home.But as tech companies pour money into film, some analysts expect it is a matter of when, not if, this will change.“While we are still in the early days of Netflix’s entry into the movie business . . . there will be a dramatic ramp up over the coming year,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG.He likens Netflix’s film frenzy with its leap into TV with House of Cards in 2013. “Whether or not Roma wins Best Picture at Sunday’s Academy Awards, it is hard not to think about how Hollywood is repeating itself.”
74;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-15T02:35:29Z;Netflix: licence to bill  ;The streaming service has had no trouble raising debt. But it is in a delicate position;Netflix has put down a far bigger bet for viewer attention than its balance sheet might suggest.The streaming service is already notorious for financing rapid growth with debt. Prestige Oscar-nominated films and Friends reruns do not come cheap. At the end of 2018 long-term debt exceeded $10bn.But this debt is not the whole story. Netflix has agreed to pay $19.3bn for television shows and films it wants to stream in the future. There are also agreements that have not yet priced — so-called unknown obligations. These could add up to $5bn to the total over the next three years. All told, Netflix is on the hook for some $24bn.Given the company is free cash flow negative and expects to remain so in the foreseeable future, that suggests it will need to raise more debt soon.The rise in content obligations is a neat illustration of Netflix’s new business model: a shift from content aggregator to content creator and expansion overseas. New markets want their own content and rivals are moving to stream their own shows, so it makes sense for Netflix to create original programmes. But competition for content means higher prices. Netflix is not only trying to outrun rivals such as Apple and Disney, it is paying more to do so.Only $8.5bn of Netflix’s content liabilities appears on the balance sheet. It is not alone in recording agreements for content this way. Broadcasters tend to pay for sports programming via content obligations — recognising costs when games are shown.And Netflix has had no trouble raising the debt required to amass a huge store of content so far. But it is in a delicate position. The company added close to 9m new subscribers in the fourth quarter of last year — more than expected. But that increase was led by international subscribers, many of whom pay lower subscriptions than US customers. It has raised rates. In the last quarter of 2018 revenue growth was 27 per cent — down from 33 per cent the previous year. Remove the impact of foreign exchange and growth would have been 33 per cent.But more international subscribers means more FX exposure.

75;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-04T18:38:33Z;Apple should buy Netflix, Sonos or Activision Blizzard, JPMorgan says;;If Apple’s $245bn cash pile is burning a hole in its pocket, it could do worse than buy Netflix, according to analysts at JPMorgan.The investment bank speculated that Netflix, video-game developer Activision Blizzard and speaker maker Sonos are the best strategic fits should Apple seek large acquisitions to drive growth, particularly in its services business.“While investors hardly seem to be complaining about the massive buyback pace, including ~$73bn last year, we believe they do hope the firm uses its balance sheet strength to insulate the business against often-seen disruptions in the technology landscape, some of which Apple itself has driven in the past,” JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Apple shocked Wall Street last month when it unveiled a rare downgrade to its guidance, saying revenue would fall short of its expectations as sales in China weakened and customers wait longer to upgrade their iPhones. Last week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reported $84.3bn in revenue for the quarter ending in December, down 5 per cent year-over-year. Sales in the current quarter are forecast to drop as much as 10 per cent.With many technology names trading below 52-week highs, Mr Chatterjee called it an “opportune time” for Apple to use its strong balance sheet to refocus on growth potential in services, a segment that includes Apple Music and the App Store, and whose sales jumped 19 per cent in the most recent quarter.Netflix represents the best strategic fit for Apple in the video content space, although a tie-up with the popular streaming service would be expensive, he said. Mr Chatterjee believes Netflix would command a “much higher premium” than 20 per cent, which would give the company an enterprise value of $189bn. Netflix had a market value of $148bn as of Friday’s close, in addition to $7bn in net debt.But scooping up Netflix would accelerate Apple’s plans to create original video content, according to JPMorgan.“Video streaming, including original video content, is a highly competitive market with established traditional media houses as well new entrants fighting aggressively for incremental subscribers, which is likely to make it difficult to scale any new platform to compete effectively,” Mr Chatterjee said, noting that Netflix had 139m global paid subscribers by the end of 2018.He added: “With media/video consumption expected to increasingly move to mobile devices, Apple could fortify its ecosystem with the acquisition of one of the largest on-demand content providers.”In video gaming, JPMorgan suggested Activision Blizzard would be a strategic fit given the market’s shift towards mobile gaming. A hypothetical Sonos acquisition would help enhance the value of Apple Music and bolster the company’s smart home products, the note said.Spokespeople for Sonos and Activision Blizzard declined to comment. Apple and Netflix didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Apple were trading 2.6 per cent higher at $170.83 on Monday afternoon. Netflix rallied 2.7 per cent, while Sonos surged 7 per cent. Activision Blizzard shares rose 1.5 per cent.Electronic Arts, which JPMorgan said was a less ideal merger partner than Activision Blizzard, was one of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100. Shares were down 2.7 per cent.
76;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-04T16:00:00Z;UK broadcasters/Netflix: shriek show;US streaming giant’s success is frighteningly real;Netflix has started to excel at horror. Post-apocalyptic thriller Bird Box was a smash hit. Increasingly, the business model of the US streaming giant is also terrifying broadcasters.Netflix is revving up its production of local content. In Britain, it is trying to compete with local broadcasters, says research group Enders Analysis. One reason is that the UK is Netflix’s most valuable market outside the US. Another is that it makes sense to spend on British content, given worldwide appetite for costume dramas and the likes of Planet Earth. Netflix was able to spend almost $8bn globally on content last year, significantly more than the non-sport budget of UK broadcasters. By 2022, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Apple could together be outspending them by a factor of four.The BBC says there is no evidence that viewers are deserting it in favour of services such as Netflix. But licence fee cancellations rose for the first time in five years last year. The growth of streaming services underlines the challenge of defending the £150.50 licence fee in its current form. ITV is also threatened by changes in viewing habits, particularly of young people. Although the World Cup and Love Island helped it attract more viewers in 2018, its business faces disruption. Its share price has fallen by a fifth in the past six months, more than twice the decline of the FTSE 100.UK broadcasters are responding by drawing up plans for a joint streaming service. Subscribers will get access to archives and some dramas. Foreign groups are floating similar proposals. Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport, is joining forces with ProSiebenSat. 1, for example. More dramatically, Walt Disney and AT&T are both launching their own streaming services this year in a challenge to Netflix’s dominance.But there are difficult trade-offs. Netflix is a valuable source of revenue to the broadcasters. They are unlikely to stop licensing their content. Doing so would cut off a much-needed source of income. That could give the deep-pocketed tech giants the edge. If so, the broadcasters’ feared plotline is likely to unfold.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
77;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-01T21:17:22Z;Advertising’s big play stalls as Super Bowl prices plateau;TV commercials for championship match are selling for same price as 2017;For decades, the Super Bowl has been an exceedingly reliable moment for advertisers. In a media landscape dominated by Netflix and YouTube, the world’s biggest brands still count on 30 seconds of national attention on the first Sunday in February.This year has been no different. Last month executives from CBS, the broadcaster airing the programme, touted the enduring strength of the Super Bowl in a lavish press conference where former NFL stars such as Tony Romo spoke.“There is no bigger or better event than the Super Bowl,” said Joe Ianniello, who is interim chief executive while CBS searches for a successor to Les Moonves after he left over sexual misconduct allegations.“We will generate hundreds and hundreds of millions in that single day, and the lion’s share is coming from advertising,” Mr Ianniello told reporters.Prices of Super Bowl advertising have soared, from $2.7m for a 30-second spot in 2008 to $5.24m in 2018. But as audiences are switching off traditional TV in favour of streaming services, brands have had little choice but to play along and embrace a live event that draws 100m viewers.However, there are signals their willingness is approaching a top. Reports suggest that 30-second commercials have been selling for about $5.2m, which would be unchanged from last year, after prices have risen for eight consecutive years. CBS says it has sold more than 90 per cent of inventory for the game.The Super Bowl remains the most expensive time on television by a wide margin. The second priciest segment last year was American football’s NFC Championship, at $3.15m, followed by the Oscar’s at $2.07m, according to Kantar Media.“The Super Bowl is 50 per cent more expensive than the second highest-priced piece of commercial television,” said Jon Swallen, Kantar’s chief research officer. “That’s a big multiple, at some point if pricing increases faster than audiences, that means advertisers are paying more per eyeball. And there are so many alternatives out there.”The face of advertisers is also changing. Cars and beer, the stalwarts of Super Bowl adverts, have been taking up a smaller slice of total sales in recent years. Meanwhile, spending from “media and entertainment” has been rising as streaming video companies have entered the fray. “Amazon and Netflix are using the Super Bowl to promote new series, the same way studios have historically used it to promote upcoming movies in theatres,” said Mr Swallen.
78;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-26T00:15:25Z;‘X-Files’ lovers need to grow up and embrace Scully as Thatcher;Casting Gillian Anderson as the Iron Lady is a wonderfully imaginative choice;"As the news broke that Gillian Anderson has been cast as Margaret Thatcher in Netflix’s hit television series The Crown, you could almost feel the deflation of a million old adolescent dreams. The responses on Twitter summed it up: “This has put me in the very awkward position of fancying Margaret Thatcher”; “This is something that would have really confused us circa 1994”; “Oh no. This will be too difficult to watch.”The unexpected, but wonderfully imaginative, casting unleashed a series of dilemmas. The first question it poses is one about Ms Anderson’s capability as a performer. Is it demeaning to her as an actress to obsess over the character that made her a household name and a geek’s crush-object, FBI agent Dana Scully in the 1990s sci-fi series The X-Files? Answer: yes, it is a bit patronising, thanks very much, seeing as she has since had a full career, including roles in Great Expectations, The Fall and American Gods, and has received awards for her work on the London stage. Her role in the coming-of-age drama Sex Education has reignited her reputation for emitting screen heat.But perhaps more significant is the implied secondary insult this poses to the former British prime minister. Is it rude to suggest that the Iron Lady shouldn’t be portrayed by an actress whom audiences regard as sexy? Yes, it probably is rude, seeing as Thatcher was, in her time, regarded as attractive by many — horribly uncomfortable though this may be for those who would rather not think about her (or most politicians) in a sexual context.The digital whistleblower Edward Snowden once famously offered up “MargaretThatcheris110%sexy” as an example of a secure password. Vanity Fair magazine described her as having “a strong sexuality”, “powerful femininity” and “a sexual aura”. Jane Law, costume designer for the 2011 film starring Meryl Streep, The Iron Lady, has said the PM’s sex appeal was down to 1980s power-dressing: “Once she got the hang of it, there was no stopping her.” In came the shoulder pads, pussybows and pie-crust collars. “Then people decided she was sexy and she became rather attractive.”The Conservative MP Alan Clark was very specific about Thatcher’s charms: “I never came across any other woman in politics as sexually attractive in terms of eyes, wrists and ankles.” French President François Mitterrand went a step further, giving her “the eyes of Caligula and the mouth of Marilyn Monroe”. “I sometimes think Mrs Thatcher is even more beguiling when she is saying yes than when she is saying no,” he said.Her appeal went beyond politics. Journalist Christopher Hitchens said she was “surprisingly sexy” and enjoyed telling a (probably heavily embellished) story about how she “spanked” him playfully with a sheaf of documents. “Oh, she stinks of sex,” he told the writer Martin Amis — a turn of phrase that says more about Hitchens than Thatcher.It is strange that no one has asked whether it’s appropriate that either the gorgeous Claire Foy and ridiculously sexy Helen Mirren have portrayed the Queen. Or that Helena Bonham Carter has been cast as a Jessica Rabbit version of Princess Margaret. Nor was anyone perturbed to see Ms Streep as Thatcher.Perhaps it is more to do with the power of teenage fantasies. I can see that if your sexual awakening coincided with the rise of The X Files, it must be a tough call to reimagine Ms Anderson as anyone else. But I have little sympathy. Scully-lovers are 25 years older and wiser now; they can afford to grow up a bit. Ms Anderson will make a fascinating and nuanced Thatcher.Far worse, in my opinion, is the dilemma facing fans of Christian Bale, who is currently starring in the film Vice as a fat, toadlike Dick Cheney. That truly is a sight to make you feel handbagged by the passing of the years.The writer is a comedian and author of ‘How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking’"
79;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-22T17:33:28Z;Netflix nabs first best picture nomination with Roma;Streaming giant receives multiple Oscar nods as it shakes up film industry;Netflix has scored 15 Oscar nominations, including a coveted best picture nod for its film Roma, signalling that the streaming service is disrupting the silver screen the way it has television.Netflix has been pouring billions of dollars into original content, out-bidding traditional studios for the most sought-after talent, including acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón. The company threw its weight behind Mr Cuarón’s film Roma, a critically acclaimed black-and-white drama that chronicles the life of a maid and her family in Mexico City.The streaming giant has ruffled feathers in the film industry because it prefers to release its growing slate of movies on its streaming platform at the same time as they are released in cinemas. The company made a compromise on this front for Roma, as it seeks to expand its presence in film under the lead of producer Scott Stuber, who joined Netflix two years ago.Roma was promoted at prestigious film festivals and released in a small number of cinemas nearly a month before it was available to stream on Netflix. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, the Motion Picture Academy’s voters are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release. Roma was nominated for 10 awards, including Netflix’s first ever best picture nomination, and is tied with The Favourite for the most nominations this year. It won five additional nominations: three for The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a cowboy comedy by the Coen brothers, and two in the documentary shorts category.Keeping filmmakers happy is important for Netflix, to ensure that it can keep attracting talent and content. As Netflix is secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators.Netflix last week reported that it had its best year ever in terms of subscribers, adding nearly 29m new customers globally. However, investors were unimpressed by its net income, which shrunk to $134m for the fourth quarter, a 27 per cent drop from a year prior.Netflix uses debt to help fund its heavy spending on the production and acquisition of films and TV series. The company’s long-term debt stood at $10.4bn as of the end of December, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. Netflix last week said it anticipated free cash outflows of $3bn in 2019.Netflix’s foray into film comes as the industry is undergoing immense change, with Disney swallowing up Fox’s entertainment assets, shrinking the number of major studios from six to five. However, last year was also a positive one for the cinema industry: US box-office sales rose 7 per cent to $11.9bn in 2018, according to ComScore.Among other streaming services, Amazon, which previously achieved an Oscar milestone in 2017 as the first streaming service to land a best picture nomination with Manchester By the Sea, received just three nominations for Oscars this year.Nevertheless, traditional studios still dominated the Academy’s list of nominees. The Favourite, a Yorgos Lanthimos-directed period comedy starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, also achieved 10 nominations, including one for best picture. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, which will be under the helm of Disney after the companies integrate. Other standouts include A Star is Born, the latest remake of the Hollywood favourite, starring Lady Gaga, which scored eight nominations, including a best actress nod for the pop star. The film was distributed through Warner Bros studio, now owned by AT&T through its acquisition of Time Warner. Black Panther, Disney’s Marvel blockbuster, was nominated for seven awards, including best picture. It is the first superhero movie to be recognised in that category. 
80;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-18T18:36:22Z;Results disappointment only a scratch on Netflix’s January surge;;Racking up double-digit share price gains in January seems so easy for Netflix, it could probably do it blindfolded.Despite an underwhelming reaction from investors to its latest quarterly results, the streaming giant’s stock is up nearly 30 per cent so far this month, continuing its powerful recovery from the December sell-off’s nadir.That helps keep Netflix on course for one of its best starts to the year on record. But in contrast to other big Januaries, the share price gains have been front-loaded, as a broad market rebound lifts other stocks and indices from their recent lows.Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming during the December quarter. That included Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller that prompted many viewers to mimic the main characters and attempt day-to-day tasks blindfolded, sometimes with predictably harmful results. Still, results showed new subscriber additions and revenue fell short of market forecasts, with investors marking the shares down 2.3 per cent on Friday to $345.35.Among the so-called Faang stocks, Netflix has had the most powerful recovery since the lows that most of the quintet struck on December 24. It is up nearly 50 per cent over that period, but had also suffered the biggest drop among the group from its record high last year, falling 44.2 per cent to $233.88 on Christmas Eve from $418.97 on July 9.Netflix is down 17.2 per cent from its record high, lagging Alphabet and Amazon on this measure.Up 29.2 per cent so far this month, the stock’s performance this January still lags that of even last year, when it rose 40.8 per cent, and has plenty of work to do to take out 2013’s 78.5 per cent leap.So far this month, the S&P 500 is up 6.5 per cent, with biotechs Nektar Therapeutics, Celgene (which are both no strangers to big share price moves) and oil company Hess the only three companies to have outpaced Netflix.
81;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
82;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-18T17:49:49Z;Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and Apple accused of GDPR breach;Austrian campaign group files complaint with regulator over tech giants;Tech companies including Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Spotify are in breach of the EU’s new data regulations, according to a complaint filed with the Austrian Data Protection Authority on Friday. The Austrian privacy campaign group None of Your Business asked the country’s data regulator to investigate the firms for violating GDPR, the data regulation that came into force last May. The group said the companies failed to provide basic information, such as how they buy and sell user data, when contacted by 10 private citizens with requests for their personal information. “When tested, none of these systems provided the user with all relevant data. In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data were shared with. This leads to structural violations of users’ rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information,” said Max Schrems, co-founder and director of NOYB, who has already beaten Facebook in a major privacy case and filed complaints against the company across Europe.GDPR grants users the right to be informed about where and how their data are transacted, and how long it is stored for. This “right to access” is enshrined in Article 15, with violations theoretically leading to fines of up to €20m or 4 per cent of the companies’ worldwide turnover. To investigate whether large firms were indeed complying with GDPR, the group worked with 10 volunteers in Vienna who requested their own data from eight companies — Netflix, YouTube, Apple, Amazon, Spotify, SoundCloud, Flimmit and DAZN. “The results confirmed they were all evading their obligation to provide data or providing insufficient or inaccurate responses,” said Ioannis Kouvakas, a NOYB data protection lawyer who drafted the complaints. Of the eight services that were queried, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Amazon had automated systems that allowed users to download their data immediately. Apple provided users roughly “40 Excel spreadsheets filled with alphanumeric data that made absolutely no sense,” said Mr Kouvakas. “More than 80 per cent of the data from Apple was in an incomprehensible form.” Similarly Google-owned YouTube also provided files that were mostly gibberish to the average person, including in esoteric file formats like JSON, he said. Netflix provided a list of raw data including descriptions of all series watched, details of when and where they were watched and which devices they were watched on. But they did not disclose what third parties they shared or procured data from. Mr Kouvakas added the company had also retained certain data such as a user’s IP address, a proxy for their exact location, for more than five years. “They have to delete the data as long as they’re no longer necessary for processing, and they have to provide justification for retaining each data type,” Mr Kouvakas said. “They did not.”Tech groups have been preparing for a rush of similar claims under GDPR. In November, Privacy International, a campaign group, filed a series of complaints to the British, Irish and French data regulators against data brokers and advertising technology companies asking why they gather certain information and share it with third parties.The case for users’ right to their own data has been fought publicly by Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who wrote in an essay this week: “[W]e believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.”Mr Kouvakas said this was ironic. “Making declarations about how you respect user privacy is important but in order for it not to be a marketing statement, it has to be borne out in practice,” he said. “If the data they provide is incomprehensible to users, it doesn’t allow users to exercise their rights properly.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube and Google provide industry leading tools to give users meaningful data transparency and control.” They added that they inform users of retention practices/time periods in Google’s privacy policy. “Privacy and data protection are core to Netflix, and we comply with the GDPR. We have not yet formally received the complaint,” Netflix said.“Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant,” a spokesperson said.Apple and Amazon declined to comment. The Austrian Data regulator did not respond to a request for comment. his article has been changed since publication to correct the date of GDPR coming into force. 
83;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-17T21:45:13Z;Netflix flickers as quarterly results draw poor reviews;Stock slides 3.8% in after hours trading after mixed performance on revenues, earnings;Netflix underwhelmed investors with its latest quarterly results, snapping a recent stock rally for the streaming giant after a mixed performance on revenues, earnings and subscriptions.The figures sent the company’s shares down as much as 3.8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday.Netflix said it added 8.8m net new subscribers in the quarter, helped mainly by growth in countries outside the US. This was better than the 7.6m Netflix executives had forecast three months ago, and a Factset poll of analysts, but just below a Bloomberg poll looking for 9.2m.Fourth-quarter revenue jumped to $4.19bn, up 27 per cent from a year ago, but also under analyst expectations of $4.21bn. For the year, sales rose 35 per cent to $16bn.The results came two days after Netflix raised prices for all US customers, a move that was cheered by investors and industry analysts, sending the shares higher earlier in the week.“The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said eMarketer media analyst Paul Verna.For the final three months of the year countries outside the US continued to drive growth for Netflix, adding 7.3m net new paid accounts in the quarter compared to only 1.5m in the US.George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Don’t be fooled by the muted share price reaction to Netflix’s numbers . . . the numbers are well ahead of the group’s guidance from [October earnings]”.Investors and analysts keep a close eye on Netflix’s ability to attract new subscribers as it pours billions of dollars into new films and television shows, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas.As costs for programming have ballooned, Netflix executives have justified it as investment that leads to subscriber growth, against competition from Disney, Amazon and others. The latest results still validated that strategy last year: Netflix added nearly 29m subscribers globally, making 2018 its best year for customer growth. Netflix said it expected to add another 8.9m subscribers in the current quarter.Netflix has been spending big to finance the production and acquisition of films and TV series, and analysts had expected the splurge to dent profits but the hit was not as steep as Wall Street anticipated.Net income for the quarter fell to $134m, or 30 cents a share, from $186m, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts were expecting 24 cents a share. Operating margins narrowed to 5.2 per cent from 7.5 per cent a year ago — just ahead of the 5 per cent analysts had forecast.Netflix uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $10.4bn as of the end of December up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. Netflix on Thursday said it anticipated free cash outflows in 2019 to be about the same as 2018, which totalled $3bn.During the quarter Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming, notably Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller which the company estimates will be watched by more than 80m subscriber households in its first four weeks on the service.Netflix, which has until recently been secretive about viewership numbers, also touted the popularity of other programmes released in the quarter.You, a drama series starring Penn Badgley, was viewed by a projected 40m subscriber households in its first month on Netflix, the company said.In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it is up against a “very broad set of competitors” that extends beyond traditional television to gaming. “We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO,” the company said.
84;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-16T07:44:51Z;Netflix: full stream ahead;US customer price increase likely to be spent luring more viewers, not balancing the books;In the spirit of Netflix’s internal culture of radical honesty the US streaming group’s decision to raise customer prices could be judged as: bold but not bold enough.Lifting US monthly rates by a dollar or two will not put off users. It could go further. Netflix is still cheap, even after prices in the US rise by up to 18 per cent. Bundled cable packages can cost up to $100 per month. Netflix will cost $16 per month at most. There are no adverts or complicated restrictions on content and the service has more interesting things to watch than competing streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Hulu. So it should. Securing glitzy super producers such as Ryan Murphy and the Obamas meant Netflix spent an estimated $13bn on original content last year.For now, this largesse makes sense. Netflix trades at 107 times forecast earnings because it is seen as a high-growth tech company instead of a traditional media company. Disney, which is considered part of the old guard in spite of plans for its own streaming services, trades at just 16 times. This means the additional money will probably be spent luring more viewers, not balancing the books. It will not be enough to enable the streaming service to earn more than it spends. Netflix has about 58m US customers. Quarterly earnings due later this week may reveal another 2m. Yet even if every single one of those customers paid an extra $2 per month the additional $1.4bn in annual revenue would not result in positive cash flow. The company burnt through nearly $900m in the last quarter alone. Higher rates in the US might be used to partly offset lower prices in other countries as Netflix expands. But spending on content will do most to help Netflix see off the competition. Subscribers have more than tripled in five years. To keep rising Netflix needs programmes that beat rivals. It should be able to maintain its lead. Together, paying for Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix and future services from Disney and Comcast, plus internet access, could approach cable subscription levels. But if customers are going to choose a single service then Netflix is still the one to beat. Lex is seeking a team member to comment daily on US tech, the biggest business story of recent years.

85;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-15T15:21:35Z;Netflix to lift prices for US customers by up to 18%;Video streaming service squeezes users after boosting investment in content;Netflix is raising prices for all US customers by as much as 18 per cent, as the streaming giant looks to cover the billions of dollars it is spending to produce and acquire TV shows and films.Customers in the US, its largest market, and some Latin American countries will pay $8.99 a month for the cheapest Netflix streaming plan, up from $7.99. For its most popular tier, which offers high-definition video, prices will rise by $2 a month to $12.99. A “premium” plan will cost $15.99, up from $13.99. The price rises take effect immediately for new customers and will be introduced “over the next few months” for existing users, according to people familiar with the plans.Investors and analysts cheered the move, sending Netflix shares up more than 5 per cent in morning New York trading. The stock has climbed by more than 30 per cent so far this year. “We believe this action has a high probability of success, further fuelling the Netflix flywheel,” said Mark Mahaney from RBC.The price rise is meant to reflect Netflix’s heavy investments in content, according to people familiar with the company’s strategy. Netflix has been pouring money into original films and television series — analysts estimate the company spent $13bn on original programming in 2018. It released dozens of films last year, ranging from romantic comedy hits like To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, to Oscars contender Roma. In a statement, Netflix said: “We change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience for the benefit of our members.”At $12.99 a month, a standard Netflix plan is now a dollar more than rival Hulu’s ad-free subscription but cheaper than HBO Now, which costs $14.99 a month. Netflix had 137m subscribers globally as of September, of which 58m are in the US. Analysts expect the company to say that it added another 9m subscribers up until the end of December when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.It is the fourth time Netflix has raised US prices, most recently in 2017. However, this is the first time it will affect all US customers, and also the first price rise for its cheapest plan.Netflix is racing to build up its library as it faces looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered. Disney, AT&T and Apple are expected to unveil new streaming rivals in the next year.The company uses debt to finance its spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017, and Netflix issued another $2bn in bonds in October. Netflix has also signed contracts to license and produce future programmes, sometimes years in advance of broadcasting the shows. When adding these commitments to debt, Netflix had just over $28bn of total contractual obligations at the end of 2017, including more than $17bn owed for programming over the next five years, according to a regulatory filing. While fast subscriber growth has helped ease concerns, some analysts remain wary over the group’s cash burn rate. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that.
86;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-14T12:35:48Z;Netflix earnings aim to show ‘Bird Box’ effect pays off;Investors seek reassurance that streaming service can attract and keep subscribers;Four days before Christmas, Netflix gifted subscribers with Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller in which Sandra Bullock’s character has to wear a blindfold to avoid her destruction. It became the streaming equivalent of a blockbuster. Netflix claims 45m accounts watched Bird Box globally in the first week of its release, while television ratings group Nielsen says 26m people in the US viewed it in that time.The film’s popularity was helped by social media, where it became a viral meme, spawning a #BirdBoxChallenge as people posted videos of themselves blindfolded in various settings. “Classical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies all of it,” director Susan Bier told the Hollywood Reporter. “But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into something.” On Thursday, Netflix will update investors on how programming such as Bird Box translates into income. Netflix’s business model is expensive — the company spent an estimated $13bn on content in 2018, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas.As costs have ballooned, Netflix executives have justified it as investment that leads to subscriber and revenue growth. Thursday’s fourth-quarter results are expected to confirm that thesis: analysts predict Netflix added another 9.2m subscribers in the period, which would make 2018 the company’s best-ever year for subscription growth. The hype surrounding Bird Box and other holiday programming has helped sentiment for Netflix in recent weeks, as did a strong showing at the Golden Globes, where Netflix won five awards, more than any individual network or studio. The shares are up by more than 40 per cent since Christmas Eve. Wall Street analysts are on board. Goldman Sachs predicted that the fourth quarter “will only be the beginning of the pay-off from Netflix's accelerating spend and increasingly robust originals slate”, adding that “consensus continues to significantly underestimate the financial impacts of these dynamics”. UBS said Netflix would “achieve a higher margin and free cash flow trajectory than currently implied by the market” as its original content “demonstrates outsize marketplace success”.Analysts expect Netflix’s revenue to have grown to $4.21bn for the three months ending in December, up 28 per cent from a year ago. However, Netflix has been spending big to finance the production and acquisition of films and TV series, and analysts expect the splurge to hit profits. Net income is forecast to decline to 24 cents a share in the quarter, from 41 cents a year ago,while the consensus is for operating margins to fall to 5 per cent, from 7.5 per cent a year ago. Shares in Netflix soared in the first half of last year, briefly making it the world’s most valuable media company. However, the rally — which has earned it a place alongside Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, the so-called “Faang” stocks — faltered after a surprising second-quarter miss on subscribers. The company recovered in the third quarter by adding almost 7m new customers, but investors and analysts will be looking for further reassurance of the company’s ability to attract and keep the attention of subscribers.Netflix uses debt to finance its spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. It spent $291.6m on interest payments for the first nine months of 2018, compared with $238m for the whole of 2017.The company forecasts a free cash burn of $3bn for 2018 and another $3bn in 2019, but expects an improvement after that. But the pressure on Netflix to keep growing its multibillion-dollar content budget is only increasing as more and more rivals emerge in the video streaming market, with Disney, Apple and AT&T expected to launch fresh offerings. “This reminds me of Hollywood in the 1920s and 1930s, when studios were hiring so many people to roll out content as quickly as possible, because there was so much appetite for it,” said Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations. “You just wanted content, it didn’t matter what it was. That’s what it feels like Netflix is doing now.”This article has been amended to reflect the differing viewership methodology that Netflix uses to that of Nielsen
87;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-08T05:00:43Z;Saudi-backed broadcaster launches video challenge to Netflix;MBC’s plans open up new front in Riyadh’s propaganda war with Iran and Qatar;The Middle East’s largest broadcaster is expanding its video streaming service in a bid to rival Netflix in the Arab world as the Saudi government steps up its use of media assets in regional power battles, according to people briefed on the plans.The move by Saudi-controlled MBC Group, which is based in Dubai, is part of Riyadh’s efforts to wage fierce propaganda wars against rivals Iran and Qatar.Media assets, ranging from satellite news to football rights, have become soft power weapons for governments including the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, as the region has been reordered since the Arab uprisings of 2011.MBC is to hire former Hulu executive Johannes Larcher to broaden its digital and video on demand service, named Shahid, with plans to develop new Arabic content, the people said.MBC’s newly launched production house, MBC Studios, is already working on new films and shows to feed the video service, the people added, including historical biopics of Arab leaders and a dramatisation of the folk tales of 1,001 Nights. MBC also plans to buy content from the rest of the world.The potential challenge to Netflix’s regional dominance comes as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman grapples with the fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for which he has been blamed.At the request of the Saudi government, Netflix recently pulled an episode of comedy series Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, which was critical of Prince Mohammed in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair, renewing concerns over freedom of expression.The government has put 11 Saudis on trial for Khashoggi’s killing and denied that Prince Mohammed was involved.MBC, which reaches 140m satellite and online viewers in the region, came under majority government ownership last year in the wake of the crown prince’s purported anti-corruption shakedown in November 2017. One of the hundreds of princes and magnates detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel was MBC chairman Waleed al-Ibrahim, who retained his 40 per cent stake in the company and nominal management control, but the remaining shareholdings were transferred to a subsidiary of the finance ministry.MBC, which was founded in 1991, has traditionally operated at arm’s length from government control, showing more liberal programming than Saudi state television, albeit within the boundaries of “family-friendly” content.“Prevailing in-house standards that apply to on-screen TV will be applied to Shahid originals,” said one of the people.Saudi Arabia has sought to use its financial muscle in the Arab media to shape political debate in the tumultuous region, where Riyadh and its ally Abu Dhabi have lined up against Iran and imposed a trade embargo on Qatar for backing political Islam, most volubly through its Al Jazeera network.Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a publisher controlled by the family of King Salman, the Saudi monarch, has agreed to launch a news channel with Bloomberg, known as Bloomberg Asharq, though speculation has grown about its future since Khashoggi’s killing.Nabeel al-Khatib, project director for Bloomberg Asharq, was last week named general manager at a sister station of MBC, the government-owned news channel Al Arabiya. He replaced Turki al-Dakhil, an adviser to Prince Mohammed, in a senior management shake-up at the network.MBC is hoping that its pre-eminence in Arabic TV entertainment will help it to catch up with Netflix and fend off other on-demand streaming services, such as Starz Play, Wavo and Amazon.Last year, the Shahid video service had 72m users, including 600,000 subscribers to its premium service.Netflix has grown rapidly in the Middle East, with the largest paying subscriber base of 1.7m across the Arab world, according to Simon Murray, principal analyst at Digital TV Research, a UK-based consultancy.“There is already a lot of competition in the Arab world, but Netflix stands apart — largely for its international appeal and original content,” said Mr Murray.Saudi investors have also established a London-based Farsi language news network, Iran International, to serve Iranian viewers.Iranian officials suspect that the channel is backed by the Saudi government and is a tool in the growing regional media war. A spokesman for Iran International denied any state funding.Additional reporting by Andrew England and Cynthia O’Murchu in London
88;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-07T20:10:39Z;Credit investors should be wary of tech disruption risk;Corporate cash flows may seem solid but tech breakthroughs could change the outlook;As financial markets fall, investors often start to find out what they have really been holding in their portfolios.Questions that perhaps were not asked thoroughly of companies or investments during a bull market can quickly be answered during a bear market.One story that has been unfolding dramatically in the equity market is the growth and impact of technology, which makes up about 20 per cent of the S&P 500 and whose FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) tend to dominate newsflow.But a less-noticed risk to investors’ portfolios may be emerging in the credit markets. On the face of it, credit could be viewed as a safe haven from the tech fallout. Despite the entrance of the likes of Tesla and Netflix, tech still represents a very small part of the global high-yield bond market. As a rule, bond investors prefer to steer clear of lossmaking companies with big growth plans, instead favouring more solid cash flows from companies whose prospects they can analyse.But investors could find that the disruptive impact of technology is reaching into parts of their credit portfolios they had considered insulated.Fraser Lundie, co-head of credit at Hermes Investment Management in London, points to “potentially painful pitfalls” in companies that are starting to be hit by technological disruption.He highlights sectors such as autos, which is being shaken up by electric vehicles and self-driving cars. Or, more positively, healthcare, where apps are changing the nature and frequency of patients’ hospital visits. In contrast, he said he thinks the outperformance of the housebuilding sector last year was driven by its relatively high barriers to disruption.“There’s a lot of areas in high yield rapidly being disrupted by technology,” Mr Lundie adds. “There are certainly some areas where it is not fully priced in.”The impact of such disruption is, by its nature, hard to model. Factors such as the ending of the European Central Bank’s corporate bond-buying programme, a spike in defaults, Brexit and the global growth outlook, are all buffeting broader credit markets.But whereas equity investors may be happier to tolerate the impact of disruption because of potential upside in other areas, the upside for credit investors is much more limited. High-yield issuers typically have less room for manoeuvre when conditions change. It is a risk credit investors should pay attention to.
89;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-07T19:25:12Z;Netflix shares shine after Golden Globes wins, upbeat analyst comments;;After winning big at the 2019 Golden Globes on Sunday, investors in Netflix scored a win on Monday after shares in the streaming site jumped as its push into original content was rewarded and analysts took an upbeat view on its subscriber numbers.Shares in the streaming company jumped 5.6 per cent to $314.16, putting them up nearly 18 per cent year-to-date. This follows a more than 10 per cent surge on Friday when analysts at Goldman Sachs gave the stock a thumbs up, awarding it the highest price target on Wall Street.Netflix won four awards for original content on Sunday. Roma, the Mexican film, snagged best director for Alfonso Cuarón and also won best motion picture in a foreign language. Meanwhile, The Kominsky Method won two Golden Globes, one for best television series, musical or comedy and one for Michael Douglas for best performance by an actor in a television series, musical. And the British sitcom Bodyguard, picked up by Netflix, also won an award for actor Richard Madden.By comparison Jeff Bezos’s Amazon picked up just two awards for actors in its original series The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and A Very English Scandal.The wins were seen as an endorsement of Netflix’s heavy push into original content as it seeks to stave off competition from Amazon and media heavyweights like Walt Disney and AT&T that are looking to launch subscription services this year.Alongside the accolades, the company also received some upbeat commentary on Wall Street, where Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said their analysis of Netflix search trends point to “upside potential” for US subscriber growth in the December quarter.“Specifically, consensus calls for 10.0% y/y domestic sub growth in Q4 (an 80 bps decline in y/y growth vs. Q3) and our search index points to 11.5% growth (50 bps acceleration in y/y growth vs. Q3)” he said. Netflix is expected to report fourth-quarter results on January 17.Sunday’s wins and Mr Olson’s comments added to upbeat sentiment on the stock this year after analysts at Goldman Sachs on Friday awarded the company a $400 price target. They argued the Netflix’s “investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the US and internationally”.The analysts also argued that while these investments and Netflix’s about $3bn cash burn will need it to return to the high yield debt market over the next three years, they do see a way for the company to “both double its annual content investment and generate positive cash return by 2022”.Despite the recent success Netflix also received mixed reviews of its first interactive programme for adults: an episode of Black Mirror titled Bandersnatch. And one of the challenges facing new finance chief Spencer Neumann is how much debt the company should shoulder to support original content.Netflix’s 2019 rally follows a 39 per cent increase in its shares last year.
90;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-06T11:59:49Z;Netflix: streampunk ;Profits and subscriptions are rising, but self-sustainability is still elusive;Netflix has always been leery about releasing viewership ratings. With no advertisers to impress, the only numbers the streaming service needs to publish are subscriptions. But its push towards more original content means more publicity for success stories. Netflix has been more than happy to boast that a record 45m accounts streamed new release Bird Box in its first week. With 130m paying customers, this represents an impressive slice of the audience — especially given its lukewarm reception from critics. It is exactly the sort of hit that executives need to support their case for spending more in 2019. Profits and subscriptions are rising but the one thing that continues to elude Netflix is self-sustainability. New chief financial officer Spencer Neumann  has to decide what balance of debt the streaming service should shoulder in order to keep pumping out content. Even if revenue jumps 25 per cent to almost $20bn this year, Netflix still expects negative cash flow of more than $3bn. That means going cap in hand to high-yield bond markets just as interest rates are rising. The spread paid by borrowers reached a two-year high in December. Netflix could soon see net debt rise back to four times ebitda. Still, a run of successful Christmas programming and an enthusiastic recommendation from Goldman Sachs  helped push the share price up more than 10 per cent in the first week of the year to within touching distance of $300. Goldman analysts think it can get to $400. This all depends on a healthy rise in subscription rates — which means creating more international content. One survey found close to 60 per cent of US participants already watch Netflix. But in France and Germany household penetration is around a third. At least the company’s enormous spend on content will differentiate it as more rivals start to circle. Amazon, Hulu and new streaming services from Apple and Disney cannot compete with Netflix’s catalogue. To keep the numbers up Netflix should think about leaving the prestige Oscar bait to one side. A long-running series will attract more subscriptions than Alfonso Cuarón’s latest drama. At the very least someone should be commissioning Bird Box 2.

91;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-02T17:56:04Z;Netflix names Activision Blizzard’s Neumann as new finance chief;;Streaming service Netflix on Wednesday named media veteran Spencer Neumann as its new finance chief, just days after he was terminated from his job at video game maker Activision Blizzard.Mr Neumann replaces David Wells who had been Netflix’s finance head since 2010.“Spencer is a stellar entertainment executive and we’re thrilled that he will help us provide amazing stories to people all over the world,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive officer.Mr Neumann most recently served as Activision’s CFO, a position he has held since May 2017. Before that, he had worked at The Walt Disney Company and private equity firms of Providence Equity Partners and Summit Partners.The appointment of Mr Neumann comes as Netflix looks to ramp up its investment in original content in the US and overseas. The company behind The Crown and BirdBox secured more than $2bn through a bond offering in October to finance its heavy spending on original movies and television shows.Activision said in a filing on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had placed Mr Neumann on a paid leave of absence and intended to terminate his employment “for cause unrelated to the Company’s financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures”.On Wednesday, Activision said Mr Neumann was fired “for violating his legal obligations to the Company”.Reuters had previously reported that Netflix would announce that it had poached Mr Neumann.“Netflix is a singular brand, and I’m excited and honoured for the opportunity to work with the Netflix team and all of our stakeholders to build on the company’s exceptional track record of success and innovation,” Mr Neumann said.Netflix shares were down 1.2 per cent on Wednesday following a 39 per cent rise last year.
92;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-01T12:40:03Z;Netflix pulls episode of comedy show in Saudi Arabia;Second episode of ‘Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj’ criticised crown prince and Yemen war;Netflix has removed an episode of a comedy show critical of Saudi Arabia after the internet streaming service received a complaint from the kingdom, renewing concerns about government control over freedom of expression on online platforms.The second episode of Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj focused on Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and included criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.“Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,” Mr Minhaj said at the start of the episode. He called the Yemen war “the biggest tragedy of the MBS era”, referring to the crown prince by his initials.Netflix confirmed that it had removed the episode in Saudi Arabia last week, after the country’s Communications and Information Technology Commission made a request to take it down because it allegedly violated the kingdom’s anti-cyber crime law.Saudi Arabia has become an influential player in the technology and entertainment sectors through big investments by its sovereign wealth fund, which directly owns stakes in companies such as Uber and many other groups indirectly through its backing of Japan’s SoftBank Vision Fund.Later in the removed episode, Mr Minhaj criticised Silicon Valley for “swimming in Saudi cash” and urged tech companies to stop taking investment from the kingdom.The Saudi law has been previously criticised by human rights groups as a tool to suppress free speech and has been used to convict activists using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to criticise the government in recent years.The CITC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Netflix defended its decision. “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law,” the company said.Netflix said the Saudi telecoms regulator cited Article 6 of the law as reason for the request. The article states that “production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers” is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding SR3m ($800,000).While the episode has been removed from Netflix, Saudi users can still watch it on the show’s official channel on YouTube.Activists and rights groups warn that some governments may abuse their legal procedures in order to deprive their citizens of basic freedoms and say companies should take a more nuanced approach when it comes to addressing official takedown requests from undemocratic states.“Banning a comedy act that brings valid criticism of a government is a counterproductive measure and an affront to the freedom of expression that all citizens deserve,” said Jillian C York, a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.The incident comes as online platforms and the technology companies behind them face increasing scrutiny over their public policy and relationship with governments.Saudi Arabia, where roughly two-thirds of the population are under 30, represents a rapidly growing market for tech companies, which can make them cautious about upsetting the authorities for fear of losing access to affluent consumers.Twitter quietly fired a Saudi engineer in 2015 after western intelligence officials told the company that the government had persuaded him to spy on the accounts of dissidents, according to the New York Times. The company also warned of “unusual activity” from Saudi Arabia and China last November after discovering a bug that could have revealed the country code of users’ phone numbers.Experts say companies should be transparent about removing or restricting content, with a clear policy of conducting due diligence on government requests that follow legal procedures.“If they are not doing all these things then they are not following established industry best practice for being accountable and responsible in handling government demands to restrict content,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation.Netflix said its policy of complying with local law was consistent with how other US-based companies operated, but it did not disclose information about how many government requests it received or how many were acted upon in each jurisdiction.
93;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-28T08:15:24Z;Netflix releases interactive episode of dystopian drama Black Mirror;‘Bandersnatch’ experiments with giving viewers the choice over how a story unfolds;"For the first time, Netflix is giving viewers the choice over how a programme unfolds. On Friday, the streaming service is releasing its first interactive programme for adults, an episode of Black Mirror, the dystopian series created by Charlie Brooker about the often dark interactions between people and technology.As the episode, titled “Bandersnatch”, unfolds, viewers are given a series of binary choices on what the main character, a programmer working on a choose-your-own-adventure computer game, should do, creating a branching set of storylines that descend down rabbit holes exploring free will and mind control.“This particular idea is about the form that you’re experiencing it in. That’s why we were excited to do it,” Mr Brooker said.Updating the choose-your-own-adventure format for the streaming video age is an expensive bet for Netflix at a time when it is already spending billions of dollars as competition for viewers escalates.Netflix has a formidable head start: it counts 140m global subscribers and adds 80,000 new ones each day. But with media heavyweights Walt Disney and AT&T aiming to launch subscription services next year and television content owners growing more wary of giving up lucrative streaming rights to a company they see as a competitor, Netflix is doubling down on investments in original productions.“Our job is to think about, what else can internet TV do that linear TV can’t?” said Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix’s director of product innovation, who oversees interactive content at the company.Part of that push will bring more interactives based on the technology Netflix developed for “Bandersnatch”. The company hopes the format will prove a competitive advantage when convincing television watchers faced with an array of subscription choices that Netflix is a must-have.“When this comes out we are going to get a lot of knocks on our door from creative people from around the world,” said Todd Yellin, Netflix vice-president of product. “We do picture you’re going to see a ramp up and more and more of this. But we don’t just do it for the sake of this; we do it if the story is right and interactivity will add to the experience.”Netflix has been experimenting with interactive children’s programming for more than a year. It has released four children’s show episodes that let viewers pick the course of actions for characters, allowing them to play out different storylines and endings.“If it didn’t work with kids we were going to walk away from this,” Mr Yellin said. “Kids were eating it up and then we started to test with adults and it looked really good.”Netflix is not the only company testing the waters of interactive video. HQ Trivia, a live quiz show app, shot to popularity a year ago, drawing in 1m viewers a day and raising $15m in funding* earlier, demonstrating appetite for interactive entertainment at scale. But the company has been thrown into turmoil following the death of its chief executive this month.HBO released an app to accompany Mosaic, a series from film-maker Steven Soderbergh, that allowed viewers to follow the story through different characters’ perspectives.Twitch, the video game live streaming site owned by Amazon, has also expressed interest in creating choose-your-own-adventure programmes.The question for Netflix as it looks to build a catalogue of choose-your-own-adventure titles is whether the technology is truly the future of television or simply a stunt.Mr Brooker admitted to harbouring doubts when Netflix executives first approach him and his co-creator Annabel Jones over creating an interactive episode of Black Mirror.“We didn’t know what the story would be and we were like, ‘Wouldn’t that just be a gimmick?’” Mr Brooker said.But once the pair hit upon a plot with the right themes, they were quick to embrace the opportunity, Ms Jones said.“It’s absolutely baked into the story this idea of freedom of choice and control and the illusion of control and the illusion of choice. Once you’ve got that as the basic conceit and you have the protagonist and you can give them multiple endings, but those endings only build to reinforce the whole, then that’s delicious,” she said.The multiple narrative strands mean the episode contains more video than a traditional television programme. It has five main endings and multiple additional variations. Netflix claims that the choice points sprinkled through the episode mean there are more than a trillion unique permutations possible.All of that demanded a greater amount of production time and expense. Netflix created proprietary software to map out the branches of the story and keep track of how choices made early on would affect what viewers are shown later.“In terms of production timeline it was akin to producing two episodes,” Ms Engelbrecht said. Netflix declined to say how much production cost.From a creative point of view, the effort was even greater, Mr Brooker said.“We thought going in, it’s probably about as complicated as doing two episodes. And then that kept growing, because the thing kept exponentially growing,” he said. “So by the end . . . it felt like doing a whole season in one go.”*This article has been amended to correct the size of the HQ Trivia fundraising"
94;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-28T05:00:25Z;Is Netflix’s global dominance a force for good or bad?;The streaming channel is set to spend up to $13bn on shows — but it could also be creating a monopoly on entertainment;"How have you been spending the holiday period? Regardless of faith or family, many of us will have lost an afternoon, evening, or possibly even 10 days straight sprawled in front of the television.If you are one of the 130m people worldwide who subscribe to Netflix, there is a high possibility that this week you will have watched one of the following: The Christmas Chronicles, a family film starring Kurt Russell, which had 20m downloads within three weeks of its release; the Spanish-language film Roma, set in 1970s Mexico, directed by Alfonso Cuarón and already tipped to win an Oscar; Mowgli, a live-action adventure based around the Jungle Book novels; or Bird Box, an apocalyptic thriller starring Sandra Bullock.Perhaps you haven’t yet seen any of them. In which case you should prob­ably hurry up and do so because you’ll need to have an opinion about one or preferably all by the time you return to your desk. Netflix is one subject that transcends geopolitical boundaries, national interests and generation gaps.In the five years since it started streaming original content, we’ve become a bunch of binge-watching insatiables, desperate for entertainment and the hit of the “what’s next?”. Other channels exist, of course — Amazon Prime, HBO and the venerable BBC among them, all delivering their own acclaimed series. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, plans to launch a Disney streaming service next year. An AT&T streamer is also planned. But no other brand has come close to claiming Netflix’s reach.“More shows, more watching; more watching, more subs; more subs, more revenue; more revenue, more content,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told New York Magazine this year, when asked to outline his model for growth. The phrase “Netflix and chill” first entered the lexicon in 2013. These days we’re just Netflixed.And yet, for all the whoop-de-do, Netflix’s overwhelming dominance has made some wary. Over 2018, at least half a dozen fashion designers told me how they were inspired by the prestige drama The Crown in their own collections. Others have cited the saffron-robed cultists of the Wild Wild Country documentary as their muse. Could such a cultural hegemony be dulling our creative output?Others, meanwhile, wonder whether the network can sustain its quality offering when it is now making so many programmes. And to what extent are these lauded shows merely window-dressing for a platform on which original content makes up only a fraction of its views? (According to TV analyst Ampere, original programmes constitute only 8 per cent of Netflix content watched when measured in hours.) Are we really watching foreign-language document­aries, or are we actually schlubbing out over old repeats of Friends?“Have you seen the movie WALL-E?,” asks Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who takes an especially dystopian view of the future, which he likens to the Pixar drama about the last robot on Earth. “It’s not necessarily 1984, it’s not necessarily Brave New World. It’s actually almost worse than that because it’s so lame,” he says. “We destroy the planet because it becomes completely uninhabitable, and we move it into outer space where the spaceship — which is powered by AI — pacifies and infantilises all humans that live on it. And they float around as fat slobs, watching whatever personalised entertainment system that’s there, and that becomes what it is to be human.”Few others are so pessimistic, but many are worried that the network is building a monopoly with plans to leave us with nothing to watch but commercial sap. “I’ve heard a lot of people in the industry say that Netflix is the Coca-Cola of the audiovisual industry,” says one television and film producer who prefers to remain anonymous, as is often the case when you’re speaking about the most powerful entertainment company around.“There’s an argument that they come blundering in saying, ‘Here’s a shiny new model and we’ve got loads of money’, very much like Coke when they go into a country. And they build a shiny new factory, or they will give one particular factory loads and loads of money and put all of the competitors out of work. And then the moment they’ve monopolised the market, they slash all of their wages. There’s a fear that they’ll put the competition out of business, and then charge whatever price they like.”The danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is. And it’s like having too much sugar“I think that’s a slightly exaggerated view of what they’re doing,” he continues. “But undoubtedly they’ve inflated prices for established talent, so suddenly big-name writers, actors and directors can be paid very large fees to do TV shows. And the tendency has been to draw those people away from terrestrial channels. So there is a bit of a talent drain going on from the UK to America. And everybody feels compelled to compete. What’s interesting over the past year, say, in the UK, is that costs have probably risen between 15 and 20 per cent: and some of that is the Netflix effect. But it’s not just the Netflix effect; it’s also the Amazon effect; and other global players.”“That’s absolute rubbish,” says Peter Morgan, writer and showrunner of The Crown. Morgan, who first met the Netflix team when it was “operating out of a portacabin in Beverly Hills”, was persuaded to go with them when making The Crown because it married a British drama about what might be thought quite “stuffy” subject matter with a newly disruptive production house that he found “inspiring and releasing”.The series debuted in November 2016 to coincide with the international push that saw Netflix operating in 190 countries. Immediately, it was a critical and popular smash, and season three of The Crown is now in production.“They have an uncomplicated mandate to entertain, and I think that that has led to charges of them being like a Walmart because they have so much of everything, and they don’t have a particular line or objective or goal in the way that FX does or HBO,” says Morgan. “But I just don’t understand this talk of talent drains. Talent will go wherever talent is given a home and it’s not about the money. I think we can all agree that whether it’s a little podcast or a blockbuster television show, spending money isn’t the secret to success.” (He insists that reports of The Crown’s £10m-an-episode budget are horribly exaggerated.)Morgan is adamant that Netflix has been a force for cultural good. “I can understand if you are new into the job as a commissioner at, say, one of the terrestrial broadcasters, that it must be a bit harder to get premium-quality content,” he says. “But from the point of view of the filmmakers, I think it’s a lovely moment. There used to be a time where all you would hear about was the star system. And that’s no f***ing fun if you’re a writer or a filmmaker or a director and basically your entire existence is predicated upon some infant, narcissist deranged creature surrounded by sycophants saying yes or no to a piece that’s suitably flattering to them. I’m far happier being in this universe where writers and producers are starting to get more of an upper hand.”Morgan believes that far from creating a monopoly, the competition has opened things up. “There’s never been more people in jobs, there’s never been more work being done. I think there’s a lot to be happy about. Netflix has stimulated a huge amount of competition. The BBC is making more drama. Channel 4 is making drama. Sky is making drama. I don’t know a writer that is out of work. You can’t get a soundstage. You can’t get a post-production house. It’s impossible to book actors, they’re all busy. Everybody seems to be in work.”Other producers agree that Netflix has done much to stimulate the market, experimenting with new formats and genres that might once have been deemed too niche. It has broadened our taste in unexpected ways, whether it’s for Finnish crime dramas (Deadwind) or German sci-fi thrillers (Dark). Meanwhile, smaller independent films that may not have had much exposure on general release have been given a second, successful life.“It’s one of the few elements about being British we can still hold our heads up about,” says Morgan. “You think about the brand of being British, which is so corrupted and devalued right now that you hold your head in shame. And then you realise Britain’s reputation is being held up by its cultural exports.”Morgan was lucky. He walked into a room with the right idea at the right time. And he has been handsomely remunerated for it. What is more surprising, perhaps, is the extent to which he and his team were given free rein by Netflix to do what they wanted. One imagines a bunch of Silicon Valley techies devising scenes by script-bot. But the truth was quite the opposite.“Honestly, they did leave us alone,” says the series’ producer Andy Harries. “And I think we have rewarded them with really, really great work. But I have to say,” he adds, “I think we’re a very responsible team. So we were trusted, and delivered for them.”Harries, co-founder and chief executive of the UK production company Left Bank Pictures, recently signed another deal with Netflix to produce a new bilingual drama White Lines, which is set in Ibiza and is a co-production with the Spanish production company owned by Alex Pina, the showrunner behind the global hit La casa de papel (Money Heist).“There’s no question that their desire to grow as fast as they have means that they are commissioning tons and tons of stuff,” he says of Netflix’s expansion. And commissioning isn’t cheap: as of September 30 2018, Netflix reported $8.34bn in long-term debt.Whether it can keep up its current hit rate is more of a challenge. “In a sense they’ve created a different world for people in the way that they look at things, and in the way they watch things,” says another producer who prefers to speak off-record. “So it has revolutionised viewing, and it has created some very good drama and documentary and movies. The problem is that the machine has to be fed and so you can’t keep feeding it with good stuff because — as in everything — there’s only so many good things. And so the danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is. And it’s like having too much sugar.”Most producers suggest that algorithms are playing at least a part in Netflix’s content. “Data is very, very important,” says Harries pragmatically. “They’re a tech company, and tech companies are very, very research- and data-obsessed.” There’s a sense also that commissioners, across all platforms, are becoming more careful. The grip is getting tighter. And no wonder. Netflix can ill-afford another disaster such as Baz Luhrmann’s Bronx-set musical drama The Get Down, which went wildly over budget, premiered this summer to a lukewarm critical response and was then promptly cancelled.But Netflix itself is quick to push back on the idea that it is becoming more data-driven. “There’s no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show steeped in 1980s nostalgia and starring four unknown kids, like Stranger Things, would have been a huge success,” says Netflix spokesman Jonathan Bennett. “And actually, we have very little data on our subscribers. When you sign up, you give your name and email, payment details, so we don’t even know what country you live in, or your gender. All we know is your viewing tastes.”It’s these viewing tastes that help inform the “taste clusters” that feed the different recommendations on the Netflix dashboard. Today, for example, my dashboard is encouraging me to make good on a 99 per cent match with the new Netflix film Dumplin’, about a Texas teenager who enters herself into a local pageant, one of whose judges is her former beauty queen mother, played by Jennifer Aniston; and, somewhat mortifyingly, suggesting that I will enjoy the 2006 romantic comedy The Holiday (a 98 per cent match). “We might suggest content you might not normally have watched,” says Bennett. Or, indeed, content I will never, ever watch, and which got clustered via a reading of my daughter’s viewing tastes.There’s no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show like “Stranger Things” would have been a huge success“Viewing figures are not the only measure,” adds Bennett. “We also look at social media to see how much buzz a show is getting. And whether a new show is pulling new subscribers in. And yes, we do take risks, and we make mistakes. But I think a measure of our success should be the number of industry accolades our original shows are getting. Success isn’t measured in a time slot.”Maybe not, but new shows today have less time to make a good impression than they once had. “They know within a month how many people have watched it, and if people are not watching beyond an hour or two, they just cancel the shows, they’re gone,” says one producer. “It’s pretty savage.” Another producer bemoans the issue with promotion. After all, if you’ve only got one portal to go to, and there are more and more shows, how do you stand out?In the meantime, the numbers keep growing. Many in the industry assume that they’ll one day sell to Amazon or another big competitor such as Apple. For the time being, however, it’s clear that they’re way out front. And there’s no point in trying to stop them.“I am optimistic,” says Harries. “But I’m conscious that all things change; I’ve been too long in this business not to have seen many ups and downs and challenges. Getting into the originals game is a very, very expensive business. But it’s a ride. I mean, there is no question that the opening-up of the streamers has completely changed the business. It’s been transformative. It blows all the cobwebs off the old sort of terrestrial channels. But it’s ever-changing, and you certainly can’t take it for granted. It’s a crazy business but it’s enormous fun. You’ve got to just strap yourself in and go for it.”In the meantime, the rest of us will no doubt stay glued to our sofas.Founded in 1997 by chief executive Reed Hastings and tech entrepreneur Marc Randolph, Netflix first began streaming in 2007 — but it wasn’t until 2013, with the premiere of its first original drama House of Cards, that it emerged as a content creator in its own right.Today it has around 130m paying subscribers, 73m of whom live outside the US (9m in the UK), and a subscription growth that some analysts predict will hit 300m by 2028. It accounts for 15 per cent of all internet bandwidth worldwide and the company recently surpassed Disney to become, at $153.8bn, the most valued media company in the world.And the output is growing and growing and growing. Next year, Netflix is expected to spend up to $13bn on content, of which the majority will be spent on original programming. It’s also making a more strategic effort to build its global profile. In 2018, Netflix had 141 projects in Europe, 40 of which were based in the UK, and the channel is planning to launch 100 foreign-language originals within the next two years. Many will be developed at the massive new production site that the company is building in Madrid.Jo Ellison is an FT associate editorFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

95;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-14T04:00:29Z;Iceland’s orang-utan sends grim message on TV advertising;Brands are not lacking alternative ways to get their messages across;The most successful television commercial this Christmas did not appear on television. The No Palm Oil ad from Iceland, the UK supermarket chain, featured a loveable orang-utan forced to flee its forest because of destructive farmers. With a voiceover by actress Emma Thompson the ad certainly tugged the heartstrings, but was deemed to have breached rules regarding political advertising because it had been made by Greenpeace, the environmental group.The ad appeared online instead and quickly became a viral sensation, viewed more than 65m times. It also scored more favourable responses from consumers than rival ads, according to brand research agency Kantar Millward Brown, which used “facial coding” — computer analysis of people’s expressions — to determine whether the ad struck an emotional chord.Iceland’s ability to connect with millions of viewers without spending a penny on television ads should be grim news for commercial broadcasters, largely because it suggests that the right campaign can deliver a mass audience online for a fraction of the cost.It also comes at a time when advertisers are spending less on TV. ITV, Britain’s largest commercial broadcaster, recently warned that advertising sales would fall in the final quarter of 2018, blaming an “increasingly uncertain economic environment”.Brexit has cast a shadow over the ad landscape, with advertisers taking a more cautious approach to their spending. But the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU is only part of the story: the rise of online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon — which are ad-free — and competing forms of online entertainment from platforms such as YouTube and Facebook means people are spending fewer hours watching live television.This seems to be borne out in recent data from the Advertising Association and World Advertising Research Centre, which found that TV ad spending in the UK fell 3.2 per cent in 2017 but rallied 1.9 per cent in the first half of the 2018. Spending on digital and mobile advertising, by contrast, rose by almost 15 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the same six-month period in 2017.The picture in the US is even more bleak. Cord-cutting — the cancellation of pricey pay-TV subscriptions — is accelerating faster than expected. More than 20m people cut the cord in 2017, the first year outside of a recession or war in which spending on US TV advertising fell, according to MoffettNathanson analysts.With these trends in mind, is there any reason for brands to keep spending on TV?It turns out there are plenty — the main one being that TV advertising is among the most effective forms of marketing. A study by Ebiquity and Gain Theory, two consultancies that measure marketing effectiveness, examined more than 2,000 brands and found that TV was responsible for more than 70 per cent of all ad-generated profits.Then there is the question of whether the Iceland ad was a one-off. It spread like wildfire online because it was deemed to have been too controversial for TV — an argument that most viewers (including ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall) thought ridiculous. Yet the controversy was the best thing that could have happened to Iceland, which benefited from masses of additional free publicity. It is doubtful if lightning will strike twice to the extent that another brand could pull off the same trick.Iceland certainly hasn’t abandoned TV advertising: it is still spending money on TV advertising this Christmas, running other slots in the commercial schedules. “They continue to use TV because they know it works,” said a spokesman for Thinkbox, the marketing body for commercial TV in the UK.Still, broadcasters know that the ad landscape is in a period of profound flux and that rivals such as Facebook and Google are growing in strength every year. ITV has sought to lessen its dependence on broadcast advertising by investing more heavily in content production and selling its programming to other outlets. Other media companies, such as Discovery, are launching direct-to-consumer subscription services to catch viewers that have drifted to on-demand viewing.Can TV advertising survive or is it, like the Iceland orang-utan, an endangered species? There is life in it yet, but brands will know that they are not lacking alternative ways to get their messages out there.matthew.garrahan@ft.com
96;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-13T04:00:56Z;‘Friends’ episode shows the power of Netflix;Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services;Last week, Netflix gave devotees of Friends a scare. For a couple of days, it seemed that the sitcom would be taken down from the streaming service come January — a prospect that dismayed fans.Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T, which now owns the rights to Friends via its purchase of Time Warner, assured investors last Tuesday that the show would stay on Netflix for another year. Netflix is paying close to $100m, equivalent to about $400,000 per episode for a show that last aired live 14 years ago. It is the first of dozens of such decisions that traditional media companies will have to make in the coming months. Walt Disney and AT&T have between them spent more than $150bn on megadeals to build up their arsenals of content, and are working to launch their own streaming services next year. Most industry executives and analysts accept that the days of people paying $100 a month for hundreds of TV channels are numbered. AT&T lost another 300,000 TV customers this in its most recent quarter, while Comcast lost 106,000. Netflix, meanwhile, is on track for its best year yet, adding 80,000 subscribers a day. However, Disney makes $6bn at the box office and still generates half of its operating income from television channels.Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services, and what to keep available on other platforms where hundreds of millions of people might watch it. This will not only determine how valuable their streaming services might be — it will also directly impact revenues. MoffettNathanson analysts predict Disney’s streaming push will slice revenues for its film studio and media networks units by $1.4bn in fiscal 2020. “This is going to be a food fight for a while,” Liberty Media chief John Malone told CNBC last month. “The question is how much pain are they willing to suffer pulling back rights for existing distribution, so that they create this appetite or starvation, for their brand and their content?”“This is a looming disaster,” said Jonathan Taplin, an Oscar-nominated film producer and author of Move Fast And Break Things. “At the end of the day there will be three giant players. Not 10, or even 6. That’s the bet Netflix is making. When they get to 200m or 250m subscribers then they will have all the power and everyone will have to distribute their content through them.” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said last week that Netflix planned to meet the competition by pouring money into its own programming. “We’re better off deciding our own destiny,” he said. Netflix has a big head start in streaming, with 140m subscribers worldwide, years of experience, and the ability and willingness to spend big on content — it has issued high-yield bonds to finance original programming, the latest being a $2bn issue in October.Meanwhile, AT&T must toe a careful line between short-term business decisions such as taking the $100m from Netflix, and committing to a long-term bet on its own streaming service. Through WarnerMedia, it has the largest library in Hollywood, the result of decades of investment. But if it gives that catalogue to Netflix, how will it lure people to its own platform?“The question is: do you want to harvest your business, or do you want to be around for a century?” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research.For now, AT&T has chosen to delay that decision. It has not decided whether it would also license Friends to Netflix for 2020, when it would presumably want to bring it to its own service, according to people briefed on the negotiations.Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, has said that its new Disney+ streaming service, will cater to “super-fans” of its blockbuster franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel. The goal is to “not necessarily be in the volume game, but to be in the quality game”, he said.AT&T has a similar message. Mr Stephenson said the company does not want to become “another Netflix …in terms of being a warehouse of content”, likening Netflix to Walmart. The next few years will be a period of reshuffling, as a dizzying number of new streaming services come to market from companies ranging from Discovery to Apple. The risk is that the push into streaming results in a solution that satisfies no one. As content gets pulled from some platforms and placed on new ones, consumers will be confused, while media companies will be shelling out billions to build out services that have no guarantee of success. What is certain is that there will be more decisions to be made about crown jewel shows. Analysts say the next big deal could be for The Office, the most-viewed TV show on Netflix, according to data company 7Park. Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, which owns the rights to The Office, declined to comment on that contract.“If that’s how much Netflix had to pay to hang out with Friends for just a little while longer, you can bet there’s going to be a similar scramble to keep [The Office],” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.
97;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-25T06:28:41Z;Oscars triumphs for ‘Green Book’ and Olivia Colman;Film about pianist Don Shirley wins top gong and Briton is crowned best actress;Green Book, a biopic about the black pianist Don Shirley, scooped the Oscar for best picture, thwarting Netflix’s aggressive push to win Hollywood’s top prize.The film also won best original screenplay and a best supporting actor for Mahershala Ali, during a briefer than usual ceremony in Los Angeles.The result will be seen as an upset for Netflix, which spent tens of millions promoting Roma, a critically acclaimed drama about a maid in 1970s Mexico, as it sought to win the highest honour in Hollywood for the first time.Netflix still walked away from Tinsel Town’s biggest night with several accolades and momentum. Alfonso Cuarón won best director for Roma, while the film also clinched best cinematography and best foreign language film.But Roma had been a favourite for best picture, raising fresh questions about whether the academy was willing to fully embrace a film from a technology company.Bohemian Rhapsody, the biopic of rock band Queen and its late lead singer Freddie Mercury, was another big winner on Sunday night. The movie led the ceremony with four awards including best actor for Rami Malek and film editing.Olivia Colman fended off Glenn Close to win the best actress award for her portrayal of Queen Anne in The Favourite. It was the only award for the film, which had entered the night tied with Roma for the most nominations with 10 each.The event also marked a first for Spike Lee, with the African-American director winning his inaugural non-honorary Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlansman.Black Panther, the Walt Disney blockbuster that featured a black superhero, walked away with three Oscars for best costume design, production design and best original score.Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed their hit song Shallow from the film A Star Is Born, which won the Oscar for best song.The star-studded ceremony did not have a host for the first time in 30 years, after the comedian Kevin Hart pulled out of the event following controversy over historic remarks that had been deemed homophobic. Without a host and the usual accompanying monologues, the entire ceremony clocked in at just over three hours, compared with nearly four hours last year.Netflix has spent the past year throwing its weight behind Roma as it looks to become a force in film production in the same way it has in television. Netflix stormed film festivals in the past year and plastered billboards across Los Angeles to drum up excitement for the movie.However, the streaming giant has ruffled feathers in the film industry because it prefers to release its movies on its streaming app at the same time as the cinema. The company made a compromise for Roma, releasing it in a limited number of cinemas nearly a month before it was available to stream. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, voters in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release.While accepting the award for best director, Mr Cuarón thanked Netflix executives by name, including Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, and Scott Stuber, the producer who joined Netflix two years ago to lead its push into film.Keeping filmmakers happy is important as Netflix competes for scripts and talent with traditional film studios and other tech groups such as Amazon. As Netflix is secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators.In a sign of the unusual times, Roma, which won four Academy Awards, has registered no official box-office sales because Netflix does not disclose the figures.
98;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-22T16:43:03Z;Hollywood faces sweeping changes on eve of Oscars showcase;Netflix challenges traditional studios while deals and mergers shake up industry;With the race for the Oscars reaching a climax on Sunday night, the US film industry looks in good shape with money rolling into the box office as big names vie for the annual prizes.But that is just the surface. Under the glamorous veneer of blockbusters and multibillion sales figures, the industry is being unsettled by big changes.Netflix is challenging the traditional studios while deals and mergers shift the Hollywood landscape. The online streaming service has outspent the major studios in what could be a significant turning point in the way Hollywood films are produced.But Disney, the media giant, is not going to make it easy for its new rival in a year when North American box-office sales rose 7 per cent to $11.9bn, according to ComScore.It shelled out $70bn to buy the Fox studio, which owns the 20th Century Fox brand, gaining the rights of the Avatar, X-Men and Deadpool films that have done consistently well at the box office. The group is racing to build a content war-chest to compete with Netflix’s debt-financed catalogue.“The movie business is going from physical goods to streaming faster than anybody is cognisant of,” said Jonathan Taplin, an Oscar-nominated film producer and author of Move Fast and Break Things, about internet entrepreneurs and disrupters in the 1990s.“There is going to be a war to see which aggregator can get to 400m worldwide streaming subscribers first. At that point everybody else in the movie and TV business will have to distribute through Disney or Netflix,” he added.With technology and deals driving change, pundits say it makes sense that the Oscars’ field is open with one of the most telling races between Netflix’s Roma, a Spanish language drama, and Disney’s Black Panther for Best Picture.Black Panther is the first superhero film to be nominated for Hollywood’s top award, but it may be edged out by Roma after Netflix spent millions in a campaign to win over Academy voters.Roma is tied with The Favourite for most nominations with 10 each. The Favourite, a dark comedy from Fox Searchlight, the Murdoch-owned studio known for its edgy sensibility, is also in the running for Best Picture.In a sign of the unusual times, Roma has registered no official box-office sales as Netflix will not disclose them.Another interesting contest will be between Britain’s Olivia Colman and America’s Glenn Close who are vying for Best Actress. Ms Close could pick up her first Oscar for her role in The Wife, while a victory for Ms Colman on Sunday night for her performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite would add to her success in the British Bafta awards.Green Book, a biopic about the black pianist Don Shirley distributed by Comcast’s Universal Pictures, is also tipped as a strong contender for Best Picture.“They talk about peak oil. This is peak content,” said Marty Kaplan, a former vice-president at Disney’s film studio and now the Norman Lear professor of entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California.Mr Kaplan said film studios were essentially running franchise businesses for big films, as opposed to “what studios did in ancient history” — make a wide-ranging slate of films across genres to appeal to frequent movie-goers.“The only people taking a risk on smaller or mid-list pictures tend to be the independents, or more recently, Netflix and Amazon,” he said.Disney’s pending integration of Fox will consolidate the industry further. The merger shrinks the number of Hollywood’s major studios from six to five, with thousands likely to be laid off.Film executives are also questioning what this will mean for the creative future of Fox, one of the world’s largest and most storied studios.The consolidation comes as Netflix, and to a lesser degree Amazon, continues to push into cinema. Netflix is making about 55 films a year now. In comparison, Universal released 36 films last year, according to Box Office Mojo, the industry site.While online services have already upended the music and television businesses, the film industry has remained comparatively untouched. Going to the cinema is viewed as a fundamentally different experience from watching a movie on the sofa at home.But as tech companies pour money into film, some analysts expect it is a matter of when, not if, this will change.“While we are still in the early days of Netflix’s entry into the movie business . . . there will be a dramatic ramp up over the coming year,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG.He likens Netflix’s film frenzy with its leap into TV with House of Cards in 2013. “Whether or not Roma wins Best Picture at Sunday’s Academy Awards, it is hard not to think about how Hollywood is repeating itself.”
99;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-15T02:35:29Z;Netflix: licence to bill  ;The streaming service has had no trouble raising debt. But it is in a delicate position;Netflix has put down a far bigger bet for viewer attention than its balance sheet might suggest.The streaming service is already notorious for financing rapid growth with debt. Prestige Oscar-nominated films and Friends reruns do not come cheap. At the end of 2018 long-term debt exceeded $10bn.But this debt is not the whole story. Netflix has agreed to pay $19.3bn for television shows and films it wants to stream in the future. There are also agreements that have not yet priced — so-called unknown obligations. These could add up to $5bn to the total over the next three years. All told, Netflix is on the hook for some $24bn.Given the company is free cash flow negative and expects to remain so in the foreseeable future, that suggests it will need to raise more debt soon.The rise in content obligations is a neat illustration of Netflix’s new business model: a shift from content aggregator to content creator and expansion overseas. New markets want their own content and rivals are moving to stream their own shows, so it makes sense for Netflix to create original programmes. But competition for content means higher prices. Netflix is not only trying to outrun rivals such as Apple and Disney, it is paying more to do so.Only $8.5bn of Netflix’s content liabilities appears on the balance sheet. It is not alone in recording agreements for content this way. Broadcasters tend to pay for sports programming via content obligations — recognising costs when games are shown.And Netflix has had no trouble raising the debt required to amass a huge store of content so far. But it is in a delicate position. The company added close to 9m new subscribers in the fourth quarter of last year — more than expected. But that increase was led by international subscribers, many of whom pay lower subscriptions than US customers. It has raised rates. In the last quarter of 2018 revenue growth was 27 per cent — down from 33 per cent the previous year. Remove the impact of foreign exchange and growth would have been 33 per cent.But more international subscribers means more FX exposure. International expansion is a good strategy, but the price tag is going to keep on rising.Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers.

100;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-04T18:38:33Z;Apple should buy Netflix, Sonos or Activision Blizzard, JPMorgan says;;If Apple’s $245bn cash pile is burning a hole in its pocket, it could do worse than buy Netflix, according to analysts at JPMorgan.The investment bank speculated that Netflix, video-game developer Activision Blizzard and speaker maker Sonos are the best strategic fits should Apple seek large acquisitions to drive growth, particularly in its services business.“While investors hardly seem to be complaining about the massive buyback pace, including ~$73bn last year, we believe they do hope the firm uses its balance sheet strength to insulate the business against often-seen disruptions in the technology landscape, some of which Apple itself has driven in the past,” JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Apple shocked Wall Street last month when it unveiled a rare downgrade to its guidance, saying revenue would fall short of its expectations as sales in China weakened and customers wait longer to upgrade their iPhones. Last week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reported $84.3bn in revenue for the quarter ending in December, down 5 per cent year-over-year. Sales in the current quarter are forecast to drop as much as 10 per cent.With many technology names trading below 52-week highs, Mr Chatterjee called it an “opportune time” for Apple to use its strong balance sheet to refocus on growth potential in services, a segment that includes Apple Music and the App Store, and whose sales jumped 19 per cent in the most recent quarter.Netflix represents the best strategic fit for Apple in the video content space, although a tie-up with the popular streaming service would be expensive, he said. Mr Chatterjee believes Netflix would command a “much higher premium” than 20 per cent, which would give the company an enterprise value of $189bn. Netflix had a market value of $148bn as of Friday’s close, in addition to $7bn in net debt.But scooping up Netflix would accelerate Apple’s plans to create original video content, according to JPMorgan.“Video streaming, including original video content, is a highly competitive market with established traditional media houses as well new entrants fighting aggressively for incremental subscribers, which is likely to make it difficult to scale any new platform to compete effectively,” Mr Chatterjee said, noting that Netflix had 139m global paid subscribers by the end of 2018.He added: “With media/video consumption expected to increasingly move to mobile devices, Apple could fortify its ecosystem with the acquisition of one of the largest on-demand content providers.”In video gaming, JPMorgan suggested Activision Blizzard would be a strategic fit given the market’s shift towards mobile gaming. A hypothetical Sonos acquisition would help enhance the value of Apple Music and bolster the company’s smart home products, the note said.Spokespeople for Sonos and Activision Blizzard declined to comment. Apple and Netflix didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares in Apple were trading 2.6 per cent higher at $170.83 on Monday afternoon. Netflix rallied 2.7 per cent, while Sonos surged 7 per cent. Activision Blizzard shares rose 1.5 per cent.Electronic Arts, which JPMorgan said was a less ideal merger partner than Activision Blizzard, was one of the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100. Shares were down 2.7 per cent.
101;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-04T16:00:00Z;UK broadcasters/Netflix: shriek show;US streaming giant’s success is frighteningly real;Netflix has started to excel at horror. Post-apocalyptic thriller Bird Box was a smash hit. Increasingly, the business model of the US streaming giant is also terrifying broadcasters.Netflix is revving up its production of local content. In Britain, it is trying to compete with local broadcasters, says research group Enders Analysis. One reason is that the UK is Netflix’s most valuable market outside the US. Another is that it makes sense to spend on British content, given worldwide appetite for costume dramas and the likes of Planet Earth. Netflix was able to spend almost $8bn globally on content last year, significantly more than the non-sport budget of UK broadcasters. By 2022, Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and Apple could together be outspending them by a factor of four.The BBC says there is no evidence that viewers are deserting it in favour of services such as Netflix. But licence fee cancellations rose for the first time in five years last year. The growth of streaming services underlines the challenge of defending the £150.50 licence fee in its current form. ITV is also threatened by changes in viewing habits, particularly of young people. Although the World Cup and Love Island helped it attract more viewers in 2018, its business faces disruption. Its share price has fallen by a fifth in the past six months, more than twice the decline of the FTSE 100.UK broadcasters are responding by drawing up plans for a joint streaming service. Subscribers will get access to archives and some dramas. Foreign groups are floating similar proposals. Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport, is joining forces with ProSiebenSat. 1, for example. More dramatically, Walt Disney and AT&T are both launching their own streaming services this year in a challenge to Netflix’s dominance.But there are difficult trade-offs. Netflix is a valuable source of revenue to the broadcasters. They are unlikely to stop licensing their content. Doing so would cut off a much-needed source of income. That could give the deep-pocketed tech giants the edge. If so, the broadcasters’ feared plotline is likely to unfold.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
102;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-02-01T21:17:22Z;Advertising’s big play stalls as Super Bowl prices plateau;TV commercials for championship match are selling for same price as 2017;For decades, the Super Bowl has been an exceedingly reliable moment for advertisers. In a media landscape dominated by Netflix and YouTube, the world’s biggest brands still count on 30 seconds of national attention on the first Sunday in February.This year has been no different. Last month executives from CBS, the broadcaster airing the programme, touted the enduring strength of the Super Bowl in a lavish press conference where former NFL stars such as Tony Romo spoke.“There is no bigger or better event than the Super Bowl,” said Joe Ianniello, who is interim chief executive while CBS searches for a successor to Les Moonves after he left over sexual misconduct allegations.“We will generate hundreds and hundreds of millions in that single day, and the lion’s share is coming from advertising,” Mr Ianniello told reporters.Prices of Super Bowl advertising have soared, from $2.7m for a 30-second spot in 2008 to $5.24m in 2018. But as audiences are switching off traditional TV in favour of streaming services, brands have had little choice but to play along and embrace a live event that draws 100m viewers.However, there are signals their willingness is approaching a top. Reports suggest that 30-second commercials have been selling for about $5.2m, which would be unchanged from last year, after prices have risen for eight consecutive years. CBS says it has sold more than 90 per cent of inventory for the game.The Super Bowl remains the most expensive time on television by a wide margin. The second priciest segment last year was American football’s NFC Championship, at $3.15m, followed by the Oscar’s at $2.07m, according to Kantar Media.“The Super Bowl is 50 per cent more expensive than the second highest-priced piece of commercial television,” said Jon Swallen, Kantar’s chief research officer. “That’s a big multiple, at some point if pricing increases faster than audiences, that means advertisers are paying more per eyeball. And there are so many alternatives out there.”The face of advertisers is also changing. Cars and beer, the stalwarts of Super Bowl adverts, have been taking up a smaller slice of total sales in recent years. Meanwhile, spending from “media and entertainment” has been rising as streaming video companies have entered the fray. “Amazon and Netflix are using the Super Bowl to promote new series, the same way studios have historically used it to promote upcoming movies in theatres,” said Mr Swallen.
103;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-26T00:15:25Z;‘X-Files’ lovers need to grow up and embrace Scully as Thatcher;Casting Gillian Anderson as the Iron Lady is a wonderfully imaginative choice;"As the news broke that Gillian Anderson has been cast as Margaret Thatcher in Netflix’s hit television series The Crown, you could almost feel the deflation of a million old adolescent dreams. The responses on Twitter summed it up: “This has put me in the very awkward position of fancying Margaret Thatcher”; “This is something that would have really confused us circa 1994”; “Oh no. This will be too difficult to watch.”The unexpected, but wonderfully imaginative, casting unleashed a series of dilemmas. The first question it poses is one about Ms Anderson’s capability as a performer. Is it demeaning to her as an actress to obsess over the character that made her a household name and a geek’s crush-object, FBI agent Dana Scully in the 1990s sci-fi series The X-Files? Answer: yes, it is a bit patronising, thanks very much, seeing as she has since had a full career, including roles in Great Expectations, The Fall and American Gods, and has received awards for her work on the London stage. Her role in the coming-of-age drama Sex Education has reignited her reputation for emitting screen heat.But perhaps more significant is the implied secondary insult this poses to the former British prime minister. Is it rude to suggest that the Iron Lady shouldn’t be portrayed by an actress whom audiences regard as sexy? Yes, it probably is rude, seeing as Thatcher was, in her time, regarded as attractive by many — horribly uncomfortable though this may be for those who would rather not think about her (or most politicians) in a sexual context.The digital whistleblower Edward Snowden once famously offered up “MargaretThatcheris110%sexy” as an example of a secure password. Vanity Fair magazine described her as having “a strong sexuality”, “powerful femininity” and “a sexual aura”. Jane Law, costume designer for the 2011 film starring Meryl Streep, The Iron Lady, has said the PM’s sex appeal was down to 1980s power-dressing: “Once she got the hang of it, there was no stopping her.” In came the shoulder pads, pussybows and pie-crust collars. “Then people decided she was sexy and she became rather attractive.”The Conservative MP Alan Clark was very specific about Thatcher’s charms: “I never came across any other woman in politics as sexually attractive in terms of eyes, wrists and ankles.” French President François Mitterrand went a step further, giving her “the eyes of Caligula and the mouth of Marilyn Monroe”. “I sometimes think Mrs Thatcher is even more beguiling when she is saying yes than when she is saying no,” he said.Her appeal went beyond politics. Journalist Christopher Hitchens said she was “surprisingly sexy” and enjoyed telling a (probably heavily embellished) story about how she “spanked” him playfully with a sheaf of documents. “Oh, she stinks of sex,” he told the writer Martin Amis — a turn of phrase that says more about Hitchens than Thatcher.It is strange that no one has asked whether it’s appropriate that either the gorgeous Claire Foy and ridiculously sexy Helen Mirren have portrayed the Queen. Or that Helena Bonham Carter has been cast as a Jessica Rabbit version of Princess Margaret. Nor was anyone perturbed to see Ms Streep as Thatcher.Perhaps it is more to do with the power of teenage fantasies. I can see that if your sexual awakening coincided with the rise of The X Files, it must be a tough call to reimagine Ms Anderson as anyone else. But I have little sympathy. Scully-lovers are 25 years older and wiser now; they can afford to grow up a bit. Ms Anderson will make a fascinating and nuanced Thatcher.Far worse, in my opinion, is the dilemma facing fans of Christian Bale, who is currently starring in the film Vice as a fat, toadlike Dick Cheney. That truly is a sight to make you feel handbagged by the passing of the years.The writer is a comedian and author of ‘How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking’"
104;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-22T17:33:28Z;Netflix nabs first best picture nomination with Roma;Streaming giant receives multiple Oscar nods as it shakes up film industry;Netflix has scored 15 Oscar nominations, including a coveted best picture nod for its film Roma, signalling that the streaming service is disrupting the silver screen the way it has television.Netflix has been pouring billions of dollars into original content, out-bidding traditional studios for the most sought-after talent, including acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón. The company threw its weight behind Mr Cuarón’s film Roma, a critically acclaimed black-and-white drama that chronicles the life of a maid and her family in Mexico City.The streaming giant has ruffled feathers in the film industry because it prefers to release its growing slate of movies on its streaming platform at the same time as they are released in cinemas. The company made a compromise on this front for Roma, as it seeks to expand its presence in film under the lead of producer Scott Stuber, who joined Netflix two years ago.Roma was promoted at prestigious film festivals and released in a small number of cinemas nearly a month before it was available to stream on Netflix. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, the Motion Picture Academy’s voters are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release. Roma was nominated for 10 awards, including Netflix’s first ever best picture nomination, and is tied with The Favourite for the most nominations this year. It won five additional nominations: three for The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a cowboy comedy by the Coen brothers, and two in the documentary shorts category.Keeping filmmakers happy is important for Netflix, to ensure that it can keep attracting talent and content. As Netflix is secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators.Netflix last week reported that it had its best year ever in terms of subscribers, adding nearly 29m new customers globally. However, investors were unimpressed by its net income, which shrunk to $134m for the fourth quarter, a 27 per cent drop from a year prior.Netflix uses debt to help fund its heavy spending on the production and acquisition of films and TV series. The company’s long-term debt stood at $10.4bn as of the end of December, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. Netflix last week said it anticipated free cash outflows of $3bn in 2019.Netflix’s foray into film comes as the industry is undergoing immense change, with Disney swallowing up Fox’s entertainment assets, shrinking the number of major studios from six to five. However, last year was also a positive one for the cinema industry: US box-office sales rose 7 per cent to $11.9bn in 2018, according to ComScore.Among other streaming services, Amazon, which previously achieved an Oscar milestone in 2017 as the first streaming service to land a best picture nomination with Manchester By the Sea, received just three nominations for Oscars this year.Nevertheless, traditional studios still dominated the Academy’s list of nominees. The Favourite, a Yorgos Lanthimos-directed period comedy starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, also achieved 10 nominations, including one for best picture. The Favourite was distributed by Fox Searchlight, which will be under the helm of Disney after the companies integrate. Other standouts include A Star is Born, the latest remake of the Hollywood favourite, starring Lady Gaga, which scored eight nominations, including a best actress nod for the pop star. The film was distributed through Warner Bros studio, now owned by AT&T through its acquisition of Time Warner. Black Panther, Disney’s Marvel blockbuster, was nominated for seven awards, including best picture. It is the first superhero movie to be recognised in that category. 
105;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-18T18:36:22Z;Results disappointment only a scratch on Netflix’s January surge;;Racking up double-digit share price gains in January seems so easy for Netflix, it could probably do it blindfolded.Despite an underwhelming reaction from investors to its latest quarterly results, the streaming giant’s stock is up nearly 30 per cent so far this month, continuing its powerful recovery from the December sell-off’s nadir.That helps keep Netflix on course for one of its best starts to the year on record. But in contrast to other big Januaries, the share price gains have been front-loaded, as a broad market rebound lifts other stocks and indices from their recent lows.Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming during the December quarter. That included Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller that prompted many viewers to mimic the main characters and attempt day-to-day tasks blindfolded, sometimes with predictably harmful results. Still, results showed new subscriber additions and revenue fell short of market forecasts, with investors marking the shares down 2.3 per cent on Friday to $345.35.Among the so-called Faang stocks, Netflix has had the most powerful recovery since the lows that most of the quintet struck on December 24. It is up nearly 50 per cent over that period, but had also suffered the biggest drop among the group from its record high last year, falling 44.2 per cent to $233.88 on Christmas Eve from $418.97 on July 9.Netflix is down 17.2 per cent from its record high, lagging Alphabet and Amazon on this measure.Up 29.2 per cent so far this month, the stock’s performance this January still lags that of even last year, when it rose 40.8 per cent, and has plenty of work to do to take out 2013’s 78.5 per cent leap.So far this month, the S&P 500 is up 6.5 per cent, with biotechs Nektar Therapeutics, Celgene (which are both no strangers to big share price moves) and oil company Hess the only three companies to have outpaced Netflix.
106;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
107;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-18T17:49:49Z;Netflix, YouTube, Amazon and Apple accused of GDPR breach;Austrian campaign group files complaint with regulator over tech giants;Tech companies including Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Spotify are in breach of the EU’s new data regulations, according to a complaint filed with the Austrian Data Protection Authority on Friday. The Austrian privacy campaign group None of Your Business asked the country’s data regulator to investigate the firms for violating GDPR, the data regulation that came into force last May. The group said the companies failed to provide basic information, such as how they buy and sell user data, when contacted by 10 private citizens with requests for their personal information. “When tested, none of these systems provided the user with all relevant data. In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data were shared with. This leads to structural violations of users’ rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information,” said Max Schrems, co-founder and director of NOYB, who has already beaten Facebook in a major privacy case and filed complaints against the company across Europe.GDPR grants users the right to be informed about where and how their data are transacted, and how long it is stored for. This “right to access” is enshrined in Article 15, with violations theoretically leading to fines of up to €20m or 4 per cent of the companies’ worldwide turnover. To investigate whether large firms were indeed complying with GDPR, the group worked with 10 volunteers in Vienna who requested their own data from eight companies — Netflix, YouTube, Apple, Amazon, Spotify, SoundCloud, Flimmit and DAZN. “The results confirmed they were all evading their obligation to provide data or providing insufficient or inaccurate responses,” said Ioannis Kouvakas, a NOYB data protection lawyer who drafted the complaints. Of the eight services that were queried, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and Amazon had automated systems that allowed users to download their data immediately. Apple provided users roughly “40 Excel spreadsheets filled with alphanumeric data that made absolutely no sense,” said Mr Kouvakas. “More than 80 per cent of the data from Apple was in an incomprehensible form.” Similarly Google-owned YouTube also provided files that were mostly gibberish to the average person, including in esoteric file formats like JSON, he said. Netflix provided a list of raw data including descriptions of all series watched, details of when and where they were watched and which devices they were watched on. But they did not disclose what third parties they shared or procured data from. Mr Kouvakas added the company had also retained certain data such as a user’s IP address, a proxy for their exact location, for more than five years. “They have to delete the data as long as they’re no longer necessary for processing, and they have to provide justification for retaining each data type,” Mr Kouvakas said. “They did not.”Tech groups have been preparing for a rush of similar claims under GDPR. In November, Privacy International, a campaign group, filed a series of complaints to the British, Irish and French data regulators against data brokers and advertising technology companies asking why they gather certain information and share it with third parties.The case for users’ right to their own data has been fought publicly by Apple chief executive Tim Cook, who wrote in an essay this week: “[W]e believe the Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.”Mr Kouvakas said this was ironic. “Making declarations about how you respect user privacy is important but in order for it not to be a marketing statement, it has to be borne out in practice,” he said. “If the data they provide is incomprehensible to users, it doesn’t allow users to exercise their rights properly.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube and Google provide industry leading tools to give users meaningful data transparency and control.” They added that they inform users of retention practices/time periods in Google’s privacy policy. “Privacy and data protection are core to Netflix, and we comply with the GDPR. We have not yet formally received the complaint,” Netflix said.“Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant,” a spokesperson said.Apple and Amazon declined to comment. The Austrian Data regulator did not respond to a request for comment. his article has been changed since publication to correct the date of GDPR coming into force. 
108;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-17T21:45:13Z;Netflix flickers as quarterly results draw poor reviews;Stock slides 3.8% in after hours trading after mixed performance on revenues, earnings;Netflix underwhelmed investors with its latest quarterly results, snapping a recent stock rally for the streaming giant after a mixed performance on revenues, earnings and subscriptions.The figures sent the company’s shares down as much as 3.8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday.Netflix said it added 8.8m net new subscribers in the quarter, helped mainly by growth in countries outside the US. This was better than the 7.6m Netflix executives had forecast three months ago, and a Factset poll of analysts, but just below a Bloomberg poll looking for 9.2m.Fourth-quarter revenue jumped to $4.19bn, up 27 per cent from a year ago, but also under analyst expectations of $4.21bn. For the year, sales rose 35 per cent to $16bn.The results came two days after Netflix raised prices for all US customers, a move that was cheered by investors and industry analysts, sending the shares higher earlier in the week.“The fact that investors reacted negatively to what amounted to a strong performance indicates the extent to which Netflix has set a high bar,” said eMarketer media analyst Paul Verna.For the final three months of the year countries outside the US continued to drive growth for Netflix, adding 7.3m net new paid accounts in the quarter compared to only 1.5m in the US.George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Don’t be fooled by the muted share price reaction to Netflix’s numbers . . . the numbers are well ahead of the group’s guidance from [October earnings]”.Investors and analysts keep a close eye on Netflix’s ability to attract new subscribers as it pours billions of dollars into new films and television shows, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas.As costs for programming have ballooned, Netflix executives have justified it as investment that leads to subscriber growth, against competition from Disney, Amazon and others. The latest results still validated that strategy last year: Netflix added nearly 29m subscribers globally, making 2018 its best year for customer growth. Netflix said it expected to add another 8.9m subscribers in the current quarter.Netflix has been spending big to finance the production and acquisition of films and TV series, and analysts had expected the splurge to dent profits but the hit was not as steep as Wall Street anticipated.Net income for the quarter fell to $134m, or 30 cents a share, from $186m, or 41 cents a share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts were expecting 24 cents a share. Operating margins narrowed to 5.2 per cent from 7.5 per cent a year ago — just ahead of the 5 per cent analysts had forecast.Netflix uses debt to help finance its heavy spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $10.4bn as of the end of December up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. Netflix on Thursday said it anticipated free cash outflows in 2019 to be about the same as 2018, which totalled $3bn.During the quarter Netflix released a strong slate of holiday programming, notably Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller which the company estimates will be watched by more than 80m subscriber households in its first four weeks on the service.Netflix, which has until recently been secretive about viewership numbers, also touted the popularity of other programmes released in the quarter.You, a drama series starring Penn Badgley, was viewed by a projected 40m subscriber households in its first month on Netflix, the company said.In a letter to shareholders, Netflix said it is up against a “very broad set of competitors” that extends beyond traditional television to gaming. “We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO,” the company said.
109;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-16T07:44:51Z;Netflix: full stream ahead;US customer price increase likely to be spent luring more viewers, not balancing the books;In the spirit of Netflix’s internal culture of radical honesty the US streaming group’s decision to raise customer prices could be judged as: bold but not bold enough.Lifting US monthly rates by a dollar or two will not put off users. It could go further. Netflix is still cheap, even after prices in the US rise by up to 18 per cent. Bundled cable packages can cost up to $100 per month. Netflix will cost $16 per month at most. There are no adverts or complicated restrictions on content and the service has more interesting things to watch than competing streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Hulu. So it should. Securing glitzy super producers such as Ryan Murphy and the Obamas meant Netflix spent an estimated $13bn on original content last year.For now, this largesse makes sense. Netflix trades at 107 times forecast earnings because it is seen as a high-growth tech company instead of a traditional media company. Disney, which is considered part of the old guard in spite of plans for its own streaming services, trades at just 16 times. This means the additional money will probably be spent luring more viewers, not balancing the books. It will not be enough to enable the streaming service to earn more than it spends. Netflix has about 58m US customers. Quarterly earnings due later this week may reveal another 2m. Yet even if every single one of those customers paid an extra $2 per month the additional $1.4bn in annual revenue would not result in positive cash flow. The company burnt through nearly $900m in the last quarter alone. Higher rates in the US might be used to partly offset lower prices in other countries as Netflix expands. But spending on content will do most to help Netflix see off the competition. Subscribers have more than tripled in five years. To keep rising Netflix needs programmes that beat rivals. It should be able to maintain its lead. Together, paying for Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix and future services from Disney and Comcast, plus internet access, could approach cable subscription levels. But if customers are going to choose a single service then Netflix is still the one to beat. Lex is seeking a team member to comment daily on US tech, the biggest business story of recent years.

110;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-15T15:21:35Z;Netflix to lift prices for US customers by up to 18%;Video streaming service squeezes users after boosting investment in content;Netflix is raising prices for all US customers by as much as 18 per cent, as the streaming giant looks to cover the billions of dollars it is spending to produce and acquire TV shows and films.Customers in the US, its largest market, and some Latin American countries will pay $8.99 a month for the cheapest Netflix streaming plan, up from $7.99. For its most popular tier, which offers high-definition video, prices will rise by $2 a month to $12.99. A “premium” plan will cost $15.99, up from $13.99. The price rises take effect immediately for new customers and will be introduced “over the next few months” for existing users, according to people familiar with the plans.Investors and analysts cheered the move, sending Netflix shares up more than 5 per cent in morning New York trading. The stock has climbed by more than 30 per cent so far this year. “We believe this action has a high probability of success, further fuelling the Netflix flywheel,” said Mark Mahaney from RBC.The price rise is meant to reflect Netflix’s heavy investments in content, according to people familiar with the company’s strategy. Netflix has been pouring money into original films and television series — analysts estimate the company spent $13bn on original programming in 2018. It released dozens of films last year, ranging from romantic comedy hits like To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, to Oscars contender Roma. In a statement, Netflix said: “We change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience for the benefit of our members.”At $12.99 a month, a standard Netflix plan is now a dollar more than rival Hulu’s ad-free subscription but cheaper than HBO Now, which costs $14.99 a month. Netflix had 137m subscribers globally as of September, of which 58m are in the US. Analysts expect the company to say that it added another 9m subscribers up until the end of December when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.It is the fourth time Netflix has raised US prices, most recently in 2017. However, this is the first time it will affect all US customers, and also the first price rise for its cheapest plan.Netflix is racing to build up its library as it faces looming competition in the streaming video market it pioneered. Disney, AT&T and Apple are expected to unveil new streaming rivals in the next year.The company uses debt to finance its spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017, and Netflix issued another $2bn in bonds in October. Netflix has also signed contracts to license and produce future programmes, sometimes years in advance of broadcasting the shows. When adding these commitments to debt, Netflix had just over $28bn of total contractual obligations at the end of 2017, including more than $17bn owed for programming over the next five years, according to a regulatory filing. While fast subscriber growth has helped ease concerns, some analysts remain wary over the group’s cash burn rate. Netflix has forecast a free cash burn of $3bn in 2019, although it expects an improvement after that.
111;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-14T12:35:48Z;Netflix earnings aim to show ‘Bird Box’ effect pays off;Investors seek reassurance that streaming service can attract and keep subscribers;Four days before Christmas, Netflix gifted subscribers with Bird Box, a post-apocalyptic thriller in which Sandra Bullock’s character has to wear a blindfold to avoid her destruction. It became the streaming equivalent of a blockbuster. Netflix claims 45m accounts watched Bird Box globally in the first week of its release, while television ratings group Nielsen says 26m people in the US viewed it in that time.The film’s popularity was helped by social media, where it became a viral meme, spawning a #BirdBoxChallenge as people posted videos of themselves blindfolded in various settings. “Classical measurement has either been box office or awards. This defies all of it,” director Susan Bier told the Hollywood Reporter. “But creating a phenomenon is bound to translate into something.” On Thursday, Netflix will update investors on how programming such as Bird Box translates into income. Netflix’s business model is expensive — the company spent an estimated $13bn on content in 2018, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas.As costs have ballooned, Netflix executives have justified it as investment that leads to subscriber and revenue growth. Thursday’s fourth-quarter results are expected to confirm that thesis: analysts predict Netflix added another 9.2m subscribers in the period, which would make 2018 the company’s best-ever year for subscription growth. The hype surrounding Bird Box and other holiday programming has helped sentiment for Netflix in recent weeks, as did a strong showing at the Golden Globes, where Netflix won five awards, more than any individual network or studio. The shares are up by more than 40 per cent since Christmas Eve. Wall Street analysts are on board. Goldman Sachs predicted that the fourth quarter “will only be the beginning of the pay-off from Netflix's accelerating spend and increasingly robust originals slate”, adding that “consensus continues to significantly underestimate the financial impacts of these dynamics”. UBS said Netflix would “achieve a higher margin and free cash flow trajectory than currently implied by the market” as its original content “demonstrates outsize marketplace success”.Analysts expect Netflix’s revenue to have grown to $4.21bn for the three months ending in December, up 28 per cent from a year ago. However, Netflix has been spending big to finance the production and acquisition of films and TV series, and analysts expect the splurge to hit profits. Net income is forecast to decline to 24 cents a share in the quarter, from 41 cents a year ago,while the consensus is for operating margins to fall to 5 per cent, from 7.5 per cent a year ago. Shares in Netflix soared in the first half of last year, briefly making it the world’s most valuable media company. However, the rally — which has earned it a place alongside Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, the so-called “Faang” stocks — faltered after a surprising second-quarter miss on subscribers. The company recovered in the third quarter by adding almost 7m new customers, but investors and analysts will be looking for further reassurance of the company’s ability to attract and keep the attention of subscribers.Netflix uses debt to finance its spending on content. Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from $6.5bn at the end of 2017. It spent $291.6m on interest payments for the first nine months of 2018, compared with $238m for the whole of 2017.The company forecasts a free cash burn of $3bn for 2018 and another $3bn in 2019, but expects an improvement after that. But the pressure on Netflix to keep growing its multibillion-dollar content budget is only increasing as more and more rivals emerge in the video streaming market, with Disney, Apple and AT&T expected to launch fresh offerings. “This reminds me of Hollywood in the 1920s and 1930s, when studios were hiring so many people to roll out content as quickly as possible, because there was so much appetite for it,” said Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations. “You just wanted content, it didn’t matter what it was. That’s what it feels like Netflix is doing now.”This article has been amended to reflect the differing viewership methodology that Netflix uses to that of Nielsen
112;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-08T05:00:43Z;Saudi-backed broadcaster launches video challenge to Netflix;MBC’s plans open up new front in Riyadh’s propaganda war with Iran and Qatar;The Middle East’s largest broadcaster is expanding its video streaming service in a bid to rival Netflix in the Arab world as the Saudi government steps up its use of media assets in regional power battles, according to people briefed on the plans.The move by Saudi-controlled MBC Group, which is based in Dubai, is part of Riyadh’s efforts to wage fierce propaganda wars against rivals Iran and Qatar.Media assets, ranging from satellite news to football rights, have become soft power weapons for governments including the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi ally, as the region has been reordered since the Arab uprisings of 2011.MBC is to hire former Hulu executive Johannes Larcher to broaden its digital and video on demand service, named Shahid, with plans to develop new Arabic content, the people said.MBC’s newly launched production house, MBC Studios, is already working on new films and shows to feed the video service, the people added, including historical biopics of Arab leaders and a dramatisation of the folk tales of 1,001 Nights. MBC also plans to buy content from the rest of the world.The potential challenge to Netflix’s regional dominance comes as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman grapples with the fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for which he has been blamed.At the request of the Saudi government, Netflix recently pulled an episode of comedy series Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, which was critical of Prince Mohammed in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair, renewing concerns over freedom of expression.The government has put 11 Saudis on trial for Khashoggi’s killing and denied that Prince Mohammed was involved.MBC, which reaches 140m satellite and online viewers in the region, came under majority government ownership last year in the wake of the crown prince’s purported anti-corruption shakedown in November 2017. One of the hundreds of princes and magnates detained at the Ritz-Carlton hotel was MBC chairman Waleed al-Ibrahim, who retained his 40 per cent stake in the company and nominal management control, but the remaining shareholdings were transferred to a subsidiary of the finance ministry.MBC, which was founded in 1991, has traditionally operated at arm’s length from government control, showing more liberal programming than Saudi state television, albeit within the boundaries of “family-friendly” content.“Prevailing in-house standards that apply to on-screen TV will be applied to Shahid originals,” said one of the people.Saudi Arabia has sought to use its financial muscle in the Arab media to shape political debate in the tumultuous region, where Riyadh and its ally Abu Dhabi have lined up against Iran and imposed a trade embargo on Qatar for backing political Islam, most volubly through its Al Jazeera network.Saudi Research and Marketing Group, a publisher controlled by the family of King Salman, the Saudi monarch, has agreed to launch a news channel with Bloomberg, known as Bloomberg Asharq, though speculation has grown about its future since Khashoggi’s killing.Nabeel al-Khatib, project director for Bloomberg Asharq, was last week named general manager at a sister station of MBC, the government-owned news channel Al Arabiya. He replaced Turki al-Dakhil, an adviser to Prince Mohammed, in a senior management shake-up at the network.MBC is hoping that its pre-eminence in Arabic TV entertainment will help it to catch up with Netflix and fend off other on-demand streaming services, such as Starz Play, Wavo and Amazon.Last year, the Shahid video service had 72m users, including 600,000 subscribers to its premium service.Netflix has grown rapidly in the Middle East, with the largest paying subscriber base of 1.7m across the Arab world, according to Simon Murray, principal analyst at Digital TV Research, a UK-based consultancy.“There is already a lot of competition in the Arab world, but Netflix stands apart — largely for its international appeal and original content,” said Mr Murray.Saudi investors have also established a London-based Farsi language news network, Iran International, to serve Iranian viewers.Iranian officials suspect that the channel is backed by the Saudi government and is a tool in the growing regional media war. A spokesman for Iran International denied any state funding.Additional reporting by Andrew England and Cynthia O’Murchu in London
113;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-07T20:10:39Z;Credit investors should be wary of tech disruption risk;Corporate cash flows may seem solid but tech breakthroughs could change the outlook;As financial markets fall, investors often start to find out what they have really been holding in their portfolios.Questions that perhaps were not asked thoroughly of companies or investments during a bull market can quickly be answered during a bear market.One story that has been unfolding dramatically in the equity market is the growth and impact of technology, which makes up about 20 per cent of the S&P 500 and whose FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) tend to dominate newsflow.But a less-noticed risk to investors’ portfolios may be emerging in the credit markets. On the face of it, credit could be viewed as a safe haven from the tech fallout. Despite the entrance of the likes of Tesla and Netflix, tech still represents a very small part of the global high-yield bond market. As a rule, bond investors prefer to steer clear of lossmaking companies with big growth plans, instead favouring more solid cash flows from companies whose prospects they can analyse.But investors could find that the disruptive impact of technology is reaching into parts of their credit portfolios they had considered insulated.Fraser Lundie, co-head of credit at Hermes Investment Management in London, points to “potentially painful pitfalls” in companies that are starting to be hit by technological disruption.He highlights sectors such as autos, which is being shaken up by electric vehicles and self-driving cars. Or, more positively, healthcare, where apps are changing the nature and frequency of patients’ hospital visits. In contrast, he said he thinks the outperformance of the housebuilding sector last year was driven by its relatively high barriers to disruption.“There’s a lot of areas in high yield rapidly being disrupted by technology,” Mr Lundie adds. “There are certainly some areas where it is not fully priced in.”The impact of such disruption is, by its nature, hard to model. Factors such as the ending of the European Central Bank’s corporate bond-buying programme, a spike in defaults, Brexit and the global growth outlook, are all buffeting broader credit markets.But whereas equity investors may be happier to tolerate the impact of disruption because of potential upside in other areas, the upside for credit investors is much more limited. High-yield issuers typically have less room for manoeuvre when conditions change. It is a risk credit investors should pay attention to.
114;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-07T19:25:12Z;Netflix shares shine after Golden Globes wins, upbeat analyst comments;;After winning big at the 2019 Golden Globes on Sunday, investors in Netflix scored a win on Monday after shares in the streaming site jumped as its push into original content was rewarded and analysts took an upbeat view on its subscriber numbers.Shares in the streaming company jumped 5.6 per cent to $314.16, putting them up nearly 18 per cent year-to-date. This follows a more than 10 per cent surge on Friday when analysts at Goldman Sachs gave the stock a thumbs up, awarding it the highest price target on Wall Street.Netflix won four awards for original content on Sunday. Roma, the Mexican film, snagged best director for Alfonso Cuarón and also won best motion picture in a foreign language. Meanwhile, The Kominsky Method won two Golden Globes, one for best television series, musical or comedy and one for Michael Douglas for best performance by an actor in a television series, musical. And the British sitcom Bodyguard, picked up by Netflix, also won an award for actor Richard Madden.By comparison Jeff Bezos’s Amazon picked up just two awards for actors in its original series The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and A Very English Scandal.The wins were seen as an endorsement of Netflix’s heavy push into original content as it seeks to stave off competition from Amazon and media heavyweights like Walt Disney and AT&T that are looking to launch subscription services this year.Alongside the accolades, the company also received some upbeat commentary on Wall Street, where Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said their analysis of Netflix search trends point to “upside potential” for US subscriber growth in the December quarter.“Specifically, consensus calls for 10.0% y/y domestic sub growth in Q4 (an 80 bps decline in y/y growth vs. Q3) and our search index points to 11.5% growth (50 bps acceleration in y/y growth vs. Q3)” he said. Netflix is expected to report fourth-quarter results on January 17.Sunday’s wins and Mr Olson’s comments added to upbeat sentiment on the stock this year after analysts at Goldman Sachs on Friday awarded the company a $400 price target. They argued the Netflix’s “investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the US and internationally”.The analysts also argued that while these investments and Netflix’s about $3bn cash burn will need it to return to the high yield debt market over the next three years, they do see a way for the company to “both double its annual content investment and generate positive cash return by 2022”.Despite the recent success Netflix also received mixed reviews of its first interactive programme for adults: an episode of Black Mirror titled Bandersnatch. And one of the challenges facing new finance chief Spencer Neumann is how much debt the company should shoulder to support original content.Netflix’s 2019 rally follows a 39 per cent increase in its shares last year.
115;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-06T11:59:49Z;Netflix: streampunk ;Profits and subscriptions are rising, but self-sustainability is still elusive;Netflix has always been leery about releasing viewership ratings. With no advertisers to impress, the only numbers the streaming service needs to publish are subscriptions. But its push towards more original content means more publicity for success stories. Netflix has been more than happy to boast that a record 45m accounts streamed new release Bird Box in its first week. With 130m paying customers, this represents an impressive slice of the audience — especially given its lukewarm reception from critics. It is exactly the sort of hit that executives need to support their case for spending more in 2019. Profits and subscriptions are rising but the one thing that continues to elude Netflix is self-sustainability. New chief financial officer Spencer Neumann  has to decide what balance of debt the streaming service should shoulder in order to keep pumping out content. Even if revenue jumps 25 per cent to almost $20bn this year, Netflix still expects negative cash flow of more than $3bn. That means going cap in hand to high-yield bond markets just as interest rates are rising. The spread paid by borrowers reached a two-year high in December. Netflix could soon see net debt rise back to four times ebitda. Still, a run of successful Christmas programming and an enthusiastic recommendation from Goldman Sachs  helped push the share price up more than 10 per cent in the first week of the year to within touching distance of $300. Goldman analysts think it can get to $400. This all depends on a healthy rise in subscription rates — which means creating more international content. One survey found close to 60 per cent of US participants already watch Netflix. But in France and Germany household penetration is around a third. At least the company’s enormous spend on content will differentiate it as more rivals start to circle. Amazon, Hulu and new streaming services from Apple and Disney cannot compete with Netflix’s catalogue. To keep the numbers up Netflix should think about leaving the prestige Oscar bait to one side. A long-running series will attract more subscriptions than Alfonso Cuarón’s latest drama. At the very least someone should be commissioning Bird Box 2.

116;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-02T17:56:04Z;Netflix names Activision Blizzard’s Neumann as new finance chief;;Streaming service Netflix on Wednesday named media veteran Spencer Neumann as its new finance chief, just days after he was terminated from his job at video game maker Activision Blizzard.Mr Neumann replaces David Wells who had been Netflix’s finance head since 2010.“Spencer is a stellar entertainment executive and we’re thrilled that he will help us provide amazing stories to people all over the world,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive officer.Mr Neumann most recently served as Activision’s CFO, a position he has held since May 2017. Before that, he had worked at The Walt Disney Company and private equity firms of Providence Equity Partners and Summit Partners.The appointment of Mr Neumann comes as Netflix looks to ramp up its investment in original content in the US and overseas. The company behind The Crown and BirdBox secured more than $2bn through a bond offering in October to finance its heavy spending on original movies and television shows.Activision said in a filing on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had placed Mr Neumann on a paid leave of absence and intended to terminate his employment “for cause unrelated to the Company’s financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures”.On Wednesday, Activision said Mr Neumann was fired “for violating his legal obligations to the Company”.Reuters had previously reported that Netflix would announce that it had poached Mr Neumann.“Netflix is a singular brand, and I’m excited and honoured for the opportunity to work with the Netflix team and all of our stakeholders to build on the company’s exceptional track record of success and innovation,” Mr Neumann said.Netflix shares were down 1.2 per cent on Wednesday following a 39 per cent rise last year.
117;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2019-01-01T12:40:03Z;Netflix pulls episode of comedy show in Saudi Arabia;Second episode of ‘Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj’ criticised crown prince and Yemen war;Netflix has removed an episode of a comedy show critical of Saudi Arabia after the internet streaming service received a complaint from the kingdom, renewing concerns about government control over freedom of expression on online platforms.The second episode of Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj focused on Saudi Arabia in the aftermath of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and included criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.“Now would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia. And I mean that as a Muslim, and as an American,” Mr Minhaj said at the start of the episode. He called the Yemen war “the biggest tragedy of the MBS era”, referring to the crown prince by his initials.Netflix confirmed that it had removed the episode in Saudi Arabia last week, after the country’s Communications and Information Technology Commission made a request to take it down because it allegedly violated the kingdom’s anti-cyber crime law.Saudi Arabia has become an influential player in the technology and entertainment sectors through big investments by its sovereign wealth fund, which directly owns stakes in companies such as Uber and many other groups indirectly through its backing of Japan’s SoftBank Vision Fund.Later in the removed episode, Mr Minhaj criticised Silicon Valley for “swimming in Saudi cash” and urged tech companies to stop taking investment from the kingdom.The Saudi law has been previously criticised by human rights groups as a tool to suppress free speech and has been used to convict activists using social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook to criticise the government in recent years.The CITC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Netflix defended its decision. “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request — and to comply with local law,” the company said.Netflix said the Saudi telecoms regulator cited Article 6 of the law as reason for the request. The article states that “production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers” is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine not exceeding SR3m ($800,000).While the episode has been removed from Netflix, Saudi users can still watch it on the show’s official channel on YouTube.Activists and rights groups warn that some governments may abuse their legal procedures in order to deprive their citizens of basic freedoms and say companies should take a more nuanced approach when it comes to addressing official takedown requests from undemocratic states.“Banning a comedy act that brings valid criticism of a government is a counterproductive measure and an affront to the freedom of expression that all citizens deserve,” said Jillian C York, a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.The incident comes as online platforms and the technology companies behind them face increasing scrutiny over their public policy and relationship with governments.Saudi Arabia, where roughly two-thirds of the population are under 30, represents a rapidly growing market for tech companies, which can make them cautious about upsetting the authorities for fear of losing access to affluent consumers.Twitter quietly fired a Saudi engineer in 2015 after western intelligence officials told the company that the government had persuaded him to spy on the accounts of dissidents, according to the New York Times. The company also warned of “unusual activity” from Saudi Arabia and China last November after discovering a bug that could have revealed the country code of users’ phone numbers.Experts say companies should be transparent about removing or restricting content, with a clear policy of conducting due diligence on government requests that follow legal procedures.“If they are not doing all these things then they are not following established industry best practice for being accountable and responsible in handling government demands to restrict content,” said Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation.Netflix said its policy of complying with local law was consistent with how other US-based companies operated, but it did not disclose information about how many government requests it received or how many were acted upon in each jurisdiction.
118;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-28T08:15:24Z;Netflix releases interactive episode of dystopian drama Black Mirror;‘Bandersnatch’ experiments with giving viewers the choice over how a story unfolds;"For the first time, Netflix is giving viewers the choice over how a programme unfolds. On Friday, the streaming service is releasing its first interactive programme for adults, an episode of Black Mirror, the dystopian series created by Charlie Brooker about the often dark interactions between people and technology.As the episode, titled “Bandersnatch”, unfolds, viewers are given a series of binary choices on what the main character, a programmer working on a choose-your-own-adventure computer game, should do, creating a branching set of storylines that descend down rabbit holes exploring free will and mind control.“This particular idea is about the form that you’re experiencing it in. That’s why we were excited to do it,” Mr Brooker said.Updating the choose-your-own-adventure format for the streaming video age is an expensive bet for Netflix at a time when it is already spending billions of dollars as competition for viewers escalates.Netflix has a formidable head start: it counts 140m global subscribers and adds 80,000 new ones each day. But with media heavyweights Walt Disney and AT&T aiming to launch subscription services next year and television content owners growing more wary of giving up lucrative streaming rights to a company they see as a competitor, Netflix is doubling down on investments in original productions.“Our job is to think about, what else can internet TV do that linear TV can’t?” said Carla Engelbrecht, Netflix’s director of product innovation, who oversees interactive content at the company.Part of that push will bring more interactives based on the technology Netflix developed for “Bandersnatch”. The company hopes the format will prove a competitive advantage when convincing television watchers faced with an array of subscription choices that Netflix is a must-have.“When this comes out we are going to get a lot of knocks on our door from creative people from around the world,” said Todd Yellin, Netflix vice-president of product. “We do picture you’re going to see a ramp up and more and more of this. But we don’t just do it for the sake of this; we do it if the story is right and interactivity will add to the experience.”Netflix has been experimenting with interactive children’s programming for more than a year. It has released four children’s show episodes that let viewers pick the course of actions for characters, allowing them to play out different storylines and endings.“If it didn’t work with kids we were going to walk away from this,” Mr Yellin said. “Kids were eating it up and then we started to test with adults and it looked really good.”Netflix is not the only company testing the waters of interactive video. HQ Trivia, a live quiz show app, shot to popularity a year ago, drawing in 1m viewers a day and raising $15m in funding* earlier, demonstrating appetite for interactive entertainment at scale. But the company has been thrown into turmoil following the death of its chief executive this month.HBO released an app to accompany Mosaic, a series from film-maker Steven Soderbergh, that allowed viewers to follow the story through different characters’ perspectives.Twitch, the video game live streaming site owned by Amazon, has also expressed interest in creating choose-your-own-adventure programmes.The question for Netflix as it looks to build a catalogue of choose-your-own-adventure titles is whether the technology is truly the future of television or simply a stunt.Mr Brooker admitted to harbouring doubts when Netflix executives first approach him and his co-creator Annabel Jones over creating an interactive episode of Black Mirror.“We didn’t know what the story would be and we were like, ‘Wouldn’t that just be a gimmick?’” Mr Brooker said.But once the pair hit upon a plot with the right themes, they were quick to embrace the opportunity, Ms Jones said.“It’s absolutely baked into the story this idea of freedom of choice and control and the illusion of control and the illusion of choice. Once you’ve got that as the basic conceit and you have the protagonist and you can give them multiple endings, but those endings only build to reinforce the whole, then that’s delicious,” she said.The multiple narrative strands mean the episode contains more video than a traditional television programme. It has five main endings and multiple additional variations. Netflix claims that the choice points sprinkled through the episode mean there are more than a trillion unique permutations possible.All of that demanded a greater amount of production time and expense. Netflix created proprietary software to map out the branches of the story and keep track of how choices made early on would affect what viewers are shown later.“In terms of production timeline it was akin to producing two episodes,” Ms Engelbrecht said. Netflix declined to say how much production cost.From a creative point of view, the effort was even greater, Mr Brooker said.“We thought going in, it’s probably about as complicated as doing two episodes. And then that kept growing, because the thing kept exponentially growing,” he said. “So by the end . . . it felt like doing a whole season in one go.”*This article has been amended to correct the size of the HQ Trivia fundraising"
119;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-28T05:00:25Z;Is Netflix’s global dominance a force for good or bad?;The streaming channel is set to spend up to $13bn on shows — but it could also be creating a monopoly on entertainment;"How have you been spending the holiday period? Regardless of faith or family, many of us will have lost an afternoon, evening, or possibly even 10 days straight sprawled in front of the television.If you are one of the 130m people worldwide who subscribe to Netflix, there is a high possibility that this week you will have watched one of the following: The Christmas Chronicles, a family film starring Kurt Russell, which had 20m downloads within three weeks of its release; the Spanish-language film Roma, set in 1970s Mexico, directed by Alfonso Cuarón and already tipped to win an Oscar; Mowgli, a live-action adventure based around the Jungle Book novels; or Bird Box, an apocalyptic thriller starring Sandra Bullock.Perhaps you haven’t yet seen any of them. In which case you should prob­ably hurry up and do so because you’ll need to have an opinion about one or preferably all by the time you return to your desk. Netflix is one subject that transcends geopolitical boundaries, national interests and generation gaps.In the five years since it started streaming original content, we’ve become a bunch of binge-watching insatiables, desperate for entertainment and the hit of the “what’s next?”. Other channels exist, of course — Amazon Prime, HBO and the venerable BBC among them, all delivering their own acclaimed series. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, plans to launch a Disney streaming service next year. An AT&T streamer is also planned. But no other brand has come close to claiming Netflix’s reach.“More shows, more watching; more watching, more subs; more subs, more revenue; more revenue, more content,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told New York Magazine this year, when asked to outline his model for growth. The phrase “Netflix and chill” first entered the lexicon in 2013. These days we’re just Netflixed.And yet, for all the whoop-de-do, Netflix’s overwhelming dominance has made some wary. Over 2018, at least half a dozen fashion designers told me how they were inspired by the prestige drama The Crown in their own collections. Others have cited the saffron-robed cultists of the Wild Wild Country documentary as their muse. Could such a cultural hegemony be dulling our creative output?Others, meanwhile, wonder whether the network can sustain its quality offering when it is now making so many programmes. And to what extent are these lauded shows merely window-dressing for a platform on which original content makes up only a fraction of its views? (According to TV analyst Ampere, original programmes constitute only 8 per cent of Netflix content watched when measured in hours.) Are we really watching foreign-language document­aries, or are we actually schlubbing out over old repeats of Friends?“Have you seen the movie WALL-E?,” asks Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who takes an especially dystopian view of the future, which he likens to the Pixar drama about the last robot on Earth. “It’s not necessarily 1984, it’s not necessarily Brave New World. It’s actually almost worse than that because it’s so lame,” he says. “We destroy the planet because it becomes completely uninhabitable, and we move it into outer space where the spaceship — which is powered by AI — pacifies and infantilises all humans that live on it. And they float around as fat slobs, watching whatever personalised entertainment system that’s there, and that becomes what it is to be human.”Few others are so pessimistic, but many are worried that the network is building a monopoly with plans to leave us with nothing to watch but commercial sap. “I’ve heard a lot of people in the industry say that Netflix is the Coca-Cola of the audiovisual industry,” says one television and film producer who prefers to remain anonymous, as is often the case when you’re speaking about the most powerful entertainment company around.“There’s an argument that they come blundering in saying, ‘Here’s a shiny new model and we’ve got loads of money’, very much like Coke when they go into a country. And they build a shiny new factory, or they will give one particular factory loads and loads of money and put all of the competitors out of work. And then the moment they’ve monopolised the market, they slash all of their wages. There’s a fear that they’ll put the competition out of business, and then charge whatever price they like.”The danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is. And it’s like having too much sugar“I think that’s a slightly exaggerated view of what they’re doing,” he continues. “But undoubtedly they’ve inflated prices for established talent, so suddenly big-name writers, actors and directors can be paid very large fees to do TV shows. And the tendency has been to draw those people away from terrestrial channels. So there is a bit of a talent drain going on from the UK to America. And everybody feels compelled to compete. What’s interesting over the past year, say, in the UK, is that costs have probably risen between 15 and 20 per cent: and some of that is the Netflix effect. But it’s not just the Netflix effect; it’s also the Amazon effect; and other global players.”“That’s absolute rubbish,” says Peter Morgan, writer and showrunner of The Crown. Morgan, who first met the Netflix team when it was “operating out of a portacabin in Beverly Hills”, was persuaded to go with them when making The Crown because it married a British drama about what might be thought quite “stuffy” subject matter with a newly disruptive production house that he found “inspiring and releasing”.The series debuted in November 2016 to coincide with the international push that saw Netflix operating in 190 countries. Immediately, it was a critical and popular smash, and season three of The Crown is now in production.“They have an uncomplicated mandate to entertain, and I think that that has led to charges of them being like a Walmart because they have so much of everything, and they don’t have a particular line or objective or goal in the way that FX does or HBO,” says Morgan. “But I just don’t understand this talk of talent drains. Talent will go wherever talent is given a home and it’s not about the money. I think we can all agree that whether it’s a little podcast or a blockbuster television show, spending money isn’t the secret to success.” (He insists that reports of The Crown’s £10m-an-episode budget are horribly exaggerated.)Morgan is adamant that Netflix has been a force for cultural good. “I can understand if you are new into the job as a commissioner at, say, one of the terrestrial broadcasters, that it must be a bit harder to get premium-quality content,” he says. “But from the point of view of the filmmakers, I think it’s a lovely moment. There used to be a time where all you would hear about was the star system. And that’s no f***ing fun if you’re a writer or a filmmaker or a director and basically your entire existence is predicated upon some infant, narcissist deranged creature surrounded by sycophants saying yes or no to a piece that’s suitably flattering to them. I’m far happier being in this universe where writers and producers are starting to get more of an upper hand.”Morgan believes that far from creating a monopoly, the competition has opened things up. “There’s never been more people in jobs, there’s never been more work being done. I think there’s a lot to be happy about. Netflix has stimulated a huge amount of competition. The BBC is making more drama. Channel 4 is making drama. Sky is making drama. I don’t know a writer that is out of work. You can’t get a soundstage. You can’t get a post-production house. It’s impossible to book actors, they’re all busy. Everybody seems to be in work.”Other producers agree that Netflix has done much to stimulate the market, experimenting with new formats and genres that might once have been deemed too niche. It has broadened our taste in unexpected ways, whether it’s for Finnish crime dramas (Deadwind) or German sci-fi thrillers (Dark). Meanwhile, smaller independent films that may not have had much exposure on general release have been given a second, successful life.“It’s one of the few elements about being British we can still hold our heads up about,” says Morgan. “You think about the brand of being British, which is so corrupted and devalued right now that you hold your head in shame. And then you realise Britain’s reputation is being held up by its cultural exports.”Morgan was lucky. He walked into a room with the right idea at the right time. And he has been handsomely remunerated for it. What is more surprising, perhaps, is the extent to which he and his team were given free rein by Netflix to do what they wanted. One imagines a bunch of Silicon Valley techies devising scenes by script-bot. But the truth was quite the opposite.“Honestly, they did leave us alone,” says the series’ producer Andy Harries. “And I think we have rewarded them with really, really great work. But I have to say,” he adds, “I think we’re a very responsible team. So we were trusted, and delivered for them.”Harries, co-founder and chief executive of the UK production company Left Bank Pictures, recently signed another deal with Netflix to produce a new bilingual drama White Lines, which is set in Ibiza and is a co-production with the Spanish production company owned by Alex Pina, the showrunner behind the global hit La casa de papel (Money Heist).“There’s no question that their desire to grow as fast as they have means that they are commissioning tons and tons of stuff,” he says of Netflix’s expansion. And commissioning isn’t cheap: as of September 30 2018, Netflix reported $8.34bn in long-term debt.Whether it can keep up its current hit rate is more of a challenge. “In a sense they’ve created a different world for people in the way that they look at things, and in the way they watch things,” says another producer who prefers to speak off-record. “So it has revolutionised viewing, and it has created some very good drama and documentary and movies. The problem is that the machine has to be fed and so you can’t keep feeding it with good stuff because — as in everything — there’s only so many good things. And so the danger is that you get a lot of dross to fill up what they imagine the appetite of the public is. And it’s like having too much sugar.”Most producers suggest that algorithms are playing at least a part in Netflix’s content. “Data is very, very important,” says Harries pragmatically. “They’re a tech company, and tech companies are very, very research- and data-obsessed.” There’s a sense also that commissioners, across all platforms, are becoming more careful. The grip is getting tighter. And no wonder. Netflix can ill-afford another disaster such as Baz Luhrmann’s Bronx-set musical drama The Get Down, which went wildly over budget, premiered this summer to a lukewarm critical response and was then promptly cancelled.But Netflix itself is quick to push back on the idea that it is becoming more data-driven. “There’s no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show steeped in 1980s nostalgia and starring four unknown kids, like Stranger Things, would have been a huge success,” says Netflix spokesman Jonathan Bennett. “And actually, we have very little data on our subscribers. When you sign up, you give your name and email, payment details, so we don’t even know what country you live in, or your gender. All we know is your viewing tastes.”It’s these viewing tastes that help inform the “taste clusters” that feed the different recommendations on the Netflix dashboard. Today, for example, my dashboard is encouraging me to make good on a 99 per cent match with the new Netflix film Dumplin’, about a Texas teenager who enters herself into a local pageant, one of whose judges is her former beauty queen mother, played by Jennifer Aniston; and, somewhat mortifyingly, suggesting that I will enjoy the 2006 romantic comedy The Holiday (a 98 per cent match). “We might suggest content you might not normally have watched,” says Bennett. Or, indeed, content I will never, ever watch, and which got clustered via a reading of my daughter’s viewing tastes.There’s no way an algorithm could have predicted that a show like “Stranger Things” would have been a huge success“Viewing figures are not the only measure,” adds Bennett. “We also look at social media to see how much buzz a show is getting. And whether a new show is pulling new subscribers in. And yes, we do take risks, and we make mistakes. But I think a measure of our success should be the number of industry accolades our original shows are getting. Success isn’t measured in a time slot.”Maybe not, but new shows today have less time to make a good impression than they once had. “They know within a month how many people have watched it, and if people are not watching beyond an hour or two, they just cancel the shows, they’re gone,” says one producer. “It’s pretty savage.” Another producer bemoans the issue with promotion. After all, if you’ve only got one portal to go to, and there are more and more shows, how do you stand out?In the meantime, the numbers keep growing. Many in the industry assume that they’ll one day sell to Amazon or another big competitor such as Apple. For the time being, however, it’s clear that they’re way out front. And there’s no point in trying to stop them.“I am optimistic,” says Harries. “But I’m conscious that all things change; I’ve been too long in this business not to have seen many ups and downs and challenges. Getting into the originals game is a very, very expensive business. But it’s a ride. I mean, there is no question that the opening-up of the streamers has completely changed the business. It’s been transformative. It blows all the cobwebs off the old sort of terrestrial channels. But it’s ever-changing, and you certainly can’t take it for granted. It’s a crazy business but it’s enormous fun. You’ve got to just strap yourself in and go for it.”In the meantime, the rest of us will no doubt stay glued to our sofas.Founded in 1997 by chief executive Reed Hastings and tech entrepreneur Marc Randolph, Netflix first began streaming in 2007 — but it wasn’t until 2013, with the premiere of its first original drama House of Cards, that it emerged as a content creator in its own right.Today it has around 130m paying subscribers, 73m of whom live outside the US (9m in the UK), and a subscription growth that some analysts predict will hit 300m by 2028. It accounts for 15 per cent of all internet bandwidth worldwide and the company recently surpassed Disney to become, at $153.8bn, the most valued media company in the world.And the output is growing and growing and growing. Next year, Netflix is expected to spend up to $13bn on content, of which the majority will be spent on original programming. It’s also making a more strategic effort to build its global profile. In 2018, Netflix had 141 projects in Europe, 40 of which were based in the UK, and the channel is planning to launch 100 foreign-language originals within the next two years. Many will be developed at the massive new production site that the company is building in Madrid.Jo Ellison is an FT associate editorFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

120;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-14T04:00:29Z;Iceland’s orang-utan sends grim message on TV advertising;Brands are not lacking alternative ways to get their messages across;The most successful television commercial this Christmas did not appear on television. The No Palm Oil ad from Iceland, the UK supermarket chain, featured a loveable orang-utan forced to flee its forest because of destructive farmers. With a voiceover by actress Emma Thompson the ad certainly tugged the heartstrings, but was deemed to have breached rules regarding political advertising because it had been made by Greenpeace, the environmental group.The ad appeared online instead and quickly became a viral sensation, viewed more than 65m times. It also scored more favourable responses from consumers than rival ads, according to brand research agency Kantar Millward Brown, which used “facial coding” — computer analysis of people’s expressions — to determine whether the ad struck an emotional chord.Iceland’s ability to connect with millions of viewers without spending a penny on television ads should be grim news for commercial broadcasters, largely because it suggests that the right campaign can deliver a mass audience online for a fraction of the cost.It also comes at a time when advertisers are spending less on TV. ITV, Britain’s largest commercial broadcaster, recently warned that advertising sales would fall in the final quarter of 2018, blaming an “increasingly uncertain economic environment”.Brexit has cast a shadow over the ad landscape, with advertisers taking a more cautious approach to their spending. But the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU is only part of the story: the rise of online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon — which are ad-free — and competing forms of online entertainment from platforms such as YouTube and Facebook means people are spending fewer hours watching live television.This seems to be borne out in recent data from the Advertising Association and World Advertising Research Centre, which found that TV ad spending in the UK fell 3.2 per cent in 2017 but rallied 1.9 per cent in the first half of the 2018. Spending on digital and mobile advertising, by contrast, rose by almost 15 per cent in the first half of the year compared with the same six-month period in 2017.The picture in the US is even more bleak. Cord-cutting — the cancellation of pricey pay-TV subscriptions — is accelerating faster than expected. More than 20m people cut the cord in 2017, the first year outside of a recession or war in which spending on US TV advertising fell, according to MoffettNathanson analysts.With these trends in mind, is there any reason for brands to keep spending on TV?It turns out there are plenty — the main one being that TV advertising is among the most effective forms of marketing. A study by Ebiquity and Gain Theory, two consultancies that measure marketing effectiveness, examined more than 2,000 brands and found that TV was responsible for more than 70 per cent of all ad-generated profits.Then there is the question of whether the Iceland ad was a one-off. It spread like wildfire online because it was deemed to have been too controversial for TV — an argument that most viewers (including ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall) thought ridiculous. Yet the controversy was the best thing that could have happened to Iceland, which benefited from masses of additional free publicity. It is doubtful if lightning will strike twice to the extent that another brand could pull off the same trick.Iceland certainly hasn’t abandoned TV advertising: it is still spending money on TV advertising this Christmas, running other slots in the commercial schedules. “They continue to use TV because they know it works,” said a spokesman for Thinkbox, the marketing body for commercial TV in the UK.Still, broadcasters know that the ad landscape is in a period of profound flux and that rivals such as Facebook and Google are growing in strength every year. ITV has sought to lessen its dependence on broadcast advertising by investing more heavily in content production and selling its programming to other outlets. Other media companies, such as Discovery, are launching direct-to-consumer subscription services to catch viewers that have drifted to on-demand viewing.Can TV advertising survive or is it, like the Iceland orang-utan, an endangered species? There is life in it yet, but brands will know that they are not lacking alternative ways to get their messages out there.matthew.garrahan@ft.com
121;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-12-13T04:00:56Z;‘Friends’ episode shows the power of Netflix;Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services;Last week, Netflix gave devotees of Friends a scare. For a couple of days, it seemed that the sitcom would be taken down from the streaming service come January — a prospect that dismayed fans.Randall Stephenson, chief executive of AT&T, which now owns the rights to Friends via its purchase of Time Warner, assured investors last Tuesday that the show would stay on Netflix for another year. Netflix is paying close to $100m, equivalent to about $400,000 per episode for a show that last aired live 14 years ago. It is the first of dozens of such decisions that traditional media companies will have to make in the coming months. Walt Disney and AT&T have between them spent more than $150bn on megadeals to build up their arsenals of content, and are working to launch their own streaming services next year. Most industry executives and analysts accept that the days of people paying $100 a month for hundreds of TV channels are numbered. AT&T lost another 300,000 TV customers this in its most recent quarter, while Comcast lost 106,000. Netflix, meanwhile, is on track for its best year yet, adding 80,000 subscribers a day. However, Disney makes $6bn at the box office and still generates half of its operating income from television channels.Media companies must choose what content to restrict to their own streaming services, and what to keep available on other platforms where hundreds of millions of people might watch it. This will not only determine how valuable their streaming services might be — it will also directly impact revenues. MoffettNathanson analysts predict Disney’s streaming push will slice revenues for its film studio and media networks units by $1.4bn in fiscal 2020. “This is going to be a food fight for a while,” Liberty Media chief John Malone told CNBC last month. “The question is how much pain are they willing to suffer pulling back rights for existing distribution, so that they create this appetite or starvation, for their brand and their content?”“This is a looming disaster,” said Jonathan Taplin, an Oscar-nominated film producer and author of Move Fast And Break Things. “At the end of the day there will be three giant players. Not 10, or even 6. That’s the bet Netflix is making. When they get to 200m or 250m subscribers then they will have all the power and everyone will have to distribute their content through them.” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said last week that Netflix planned to meet the competition by pouring money into its own programming. “We’re better off deciding our own destiny,” he said. Netflix has a big head start in streaming, with 140m subscribers worldwide, years of experience, and the ability and willingness to spend big on content — it has issued high-yield bonds to finance original programming, the latest being a $2bn issue in October.Meanwhile, AT&T must toe a careful line between short-term business decisions such as taking the $100m from Netflix, and committing to a long-term bet on its own streaming service. Through WarnerMedia, it has the largest library in Hollywood, the result of decades of investment. But if it gives that catalogue to Netflix, how will it lure people to its own platform?“The question is: do you want to harvest your business, or do you want to be around for a century?” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research.For now, AT&T has chosen to delay that decision. It has not decided whether it would also license Friends to Netflix for 2020, when it would presumably want to bring it to its own service, according to people briefed on the negotiations.Bob Iger, Disney chief executive, has said that its new Disney+ streaming service, will cater to “super-fans” of its blockbuster franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel. The goal is to “not necessarily be in the volume game, but to be in the quality game”, he said.AT&T has a similar message. Mr Stephenson said the company does not want to become “another Netflix …in terms of being a warehouse of content”, likening Netflix to Walmart. The next few years will be a period of reshuffling, as a dizzying number of new streaming services come to market from companies ranging from Discovery to Apple. The risk is that the push into streaming results in a solution that satisfies no one. As content gets pulled from some platforms and placed on new ones, consumers will be confused, while media companies will be shelling out billions to build out services that have no guarantee of success. What is certain is that there will be more decisions to be made about crown jewel shows. Analysts say the next big deal could be for The Office, the most-viewed TV show on Netflix, according to data company 7Park. Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, which owns the rights to The Office, declined to comment on that contract.“If that’s how much Netflix had to pay to hang out with Friends for just a little while longer, you can bet there’s going to be a similar scramble to keep [The Office],” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.

Pinewood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Netflix has already secured soundstage and studio space in Los Angeles, leasing the Sunset Bronson studios on Sunset Boulevard — site of the original Warner Brothers studio — as well as a facility in New Mexico.But Pinewood would represent its biggest bet yet, given its central role in UK film production.The latest round of Star Wars films was produced at Pinewood and Episode IX in the series is currently shooting there. Walt Disney, which owns the series, has other projects in development but has not announced any details about shooting locations.Netflix in August wrote to the local council in support of Pinewood’s planning application to expand its Shepperton facility, located south-west of London, saying it wanted to make “great use” of Pinewood’s sites for UK productions. The expansion has not yet received planning permission.Ty Warren, Netflix’s vice-president for physical production, added in the letter: “In 2018, Netflix plans to spend approximately $8bn on content worldwide, across more than 700 television and film productions. We would like to be able to produce more in the UK, and at Shepperton in particular; however, we are limited by the lack of available space.”Netflix is planning to ramp up the number of European series, films and documentaries it makes next year as it steps up its competition with broadcasters on the continent.It is on course to make 141 projects in Europe this year consisting of 81 original productions and 60 co-productions or programmes licensed from other producers. In 2019 it will make 221 projects, including 153 originals.Pinewood Group is planning a £500m expansion of the Shepperton site to add 465,000 sq ft of additional stage space. It has owned the site since merging with Shepperton Studios in 2000, with films such as the 2017 remake of The Mummy shot there. The studio group is also expanding its Pinewood East site in Buckinghamshire.Netflix has sharply increased its content investment in Europe this year and will spend close to $1bn on original productions across the continent.However, its ambitions have alarmed European broadcasters, which are struggling with the migration of audiences to on-demand services from “linear” viewing, when audiences tune in to watch at a particular time.Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, the UK media regulator, this week called on public service broadcasters to develop a jointly owned streaming service that would showcase the best British content and combat the rise of Netflix."

But its ambitions have alarmed European broadcasters, which are struggling with the migration of audiences to on-demand services from “linear” viewing, when audiences tune in to watch at a particular time.“A year ago we had one or two shows in Spain, next year we will have six or seven,” said Erik Barmack, Netflix’s vice-president of international originals. “We are ramping towards 10 to 12 in each country . . . it could be more in particular markets.”Its new European projects include The Eddy, a musical drama series from Damien Chazelle, the director of La La Land, which will be filmed in Paris in French, English and Arabic. Netflix at present has 40 projects in production or being produced by partners in the UK, including acclaimed hits such as The Crown and Black Mirror. Its latest series, Sex Education, about the teenage son of a sex therapist, is set in Wales.The company is a big buyer of programming from UK producers. The recent hit The Bodyguard was made by ITV and screened in the UK on BBC One, but Netflix owns the international rights and is showing it on its service.“We’re seeing a need in our biggest European markets for more local series and regional programming,” Mr Barmack said, adding that the shows were crossing borders and attracting large audiences across Netflix’s international customer base. It has about 130m subscribers worldwide.The UK’s media watchdog this week urged the country’s public service broadcasters to collaborate on a jointly owned streaming service that could showcase the best British programming.Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, warned that “cord-cutting” — the cancellation of pricey cable or satellite subscriptions — was growing in the UK. “Cord-cutting is no longer just a US phenomenon,” she told the Outside the Box conference in London. “In the UK, for the first time ever last year, the amount spent on traditional pay TV fell, and the number of subscriptions was overtaken by the streaming services.”Ms White said the country’s PSBs should develop a joint streaming service. “Each of the big broadcasters operates an on-demand service, such as the BBC with its iPlayer. “A common platform could combine the pulling power of Broadchurch, Blue Planet and Bake Off,” she said.Broadcasters are beginning to strike collaborative deals in response to the growth of Netflix and other streaming services. Discovery, the US media group that owns Eurosport, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German media company, are developing a subscription streaming service in Germany that will integrate their programming and digital services.This article has been amended to correct the size of the increase in European productions
124;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-11-28T00:01:55Z;Ofcom head calls on UK broadcasters to develop rival to Netflix;Sharon White says ‘viewers will flock to single destinations’ with wide content;The head of UK media regulator Ofcom is urging public service broadcasters to collaborate on a streaming service for British TV shows that would capture audiences that have moved online to services such as Netflix.Sharon White’s speech at the Outside the Box conference in London on Wednesday will be the latest call to arms for an industry bruised by changes in audience behaviour and technological disruption. “If the growth of Netflix and Amazon tells us one thing, it is that viewers will flock to single destinations that offer a wide variety of quality content,” she will say.Each of the big broadcasters operates an on-demand service, such as the BBC with its iPlayer. “A common platform could combine the pulling power of Broadchurch, Blue Planet and Bake Off,” Ms White plans to say. “It would make it easier for viewers to access content across a range of devices, with a single login.”The UK’s PSBs worked on a joint streaming operation a decade ago in a project dubbed “Kangaroo” but the plans were ultimately blocked by the Competition Commission because of the impact a combined service would have had on the broader market.But since then international players such as Netflix and Amazon have built large international streaming businesses, with Netflix alone having more than 9m paying members in the UK. The company is increasingly outbidding UK broadcasters for the best programmes and has made hits such as The Crown, a drama about the life of Queen Elizabeth II.The UK PSBs have talked about renewing the Kangaroo project but discussions have not progressed. The BBC should “take the lead” on forming such a partnership, Ms White will say.Her call for action comes as the broadcasters prepare to launch a new app that will aggregate their on-demand operations. Freeview, which is owned and run by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Arqiva, will launch the app on Wednesday. It will initially be available on Apple iOS devices with plans to launch on Android early next year.The app falls short of the “single login” offering envisaged by Ms White because viewers will still have to sign in to each individual service. However, Jonathan Thompson, the chief executive of Digital UK, the company that supports Freeview, said it was a positive example of media sector collaboration.“The new app provides the aggregated experience that consumers increasingly expect from a TV provider,” he will say on Wednesday. It will put “the best of free-to-air content . . . in one place on mobile, just as we have on TV”.The new app is the result of a new £125m, five-year deal by Freeview’s shareholders to develop new services.Carolyn McCall and Alex Mahon, the new chief executives of ITV and Channel 4, have also talked of the need to join forces in an increasingly competitive marketplace.BBC, Channel 4 and ITV are also pushing for the government to pass legislation that gives PSBs more prominence on new internet TV services. Ms White will tell the conference that Ofcom will advise the government next year “on how prominence in an online world might be made to work”.

The latter is expected to launch its child-friendly streaming service Disney+ — which will focus on its five key franchises: Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Disney and National Geographic — at the end of next year.Netflix surpassed estimates for subscriber growth in its most recent quarterly results and plans to span $8bn on content this year as it seeks to lure in new customers and retain existing ones. Reed Hastings' company secured just over $2bn through its latest bond offering last month as creditors continue to foot the bill for its aggressive programming expansion.Netflix shares, which are up nearly 37 year-to-date, were little changed at $262.22 at pixel time.
126;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-11-16T13:15:55Z;Paramount agrees deal to make films for Netflix;Parent company Viacom takes different approach to streaming threat;Paramount Pictures has struck a deal to make films for Netflix, becoming the first major studio to form a production partnership with the streaming giant that has disrupted Hollywood. As the box office has become increasingly risky in the age of digital streaming, the big studios, including Paramount and Universal, have sold some castoff films to the likes of Netflix. However Paramount, under the lead of chief executive Jim Gianopulos, will now team up with Netflix from the start, producing explicitly for the tech company. “We have more capacity for great production than the theatrical release can accommodate,” Mr Gianopulos told investors on Friday.Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Hulu are spending more than $20bn on content, Mr Gianopulos noted, describing this deal as a “new, incremental revenue stream”. He did not specify how many films Paramount would make for Netflix. The announcement came as the traditional cinema helped power better than forecast quarterly sales and earnings for Paramount’s parent company Viacom, as the latest Mission: Impossible film starring Tom Cruise grossed nearly $800m at the box office.For its fiscal fourth quarter, Viacom made adjusted earnings of 99 cents a share on $3.49bn in sales. Wall Street analysts were looking for 95 cents on $3.34bn. The blockbuster hit Mission: Impossible — Fallout drove revenues at the Paramount film studio up 25 per cent to $984m, helping Paramount earn a $38m profit in the quarter. Viacom, which also runs cable channels including MTV, has been trying to turn around its fortunes as the cable television business is in long-term decline. While peers like Disney are looking to battle the streaming disrupters, Viacom chief Bob Bakish — installed two years ago by billionaire media titan Shari Redstone, Viacom’s controlling shareholder — is instead betting on co-operation.Viacom has been making TV shows for services like Netflix and Amazon, which has helped grow licensing revenues. The company highlighted one such programme, the romantic comedy To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, which was produced for Netflix by Viacom-owned AwesomenessTV. Netflix said the film, released in August, was one of the most-watched ever on the platform, although it keeps viewership numbers a secret. Netflix, which has rattled the big studios that historically controlled Hollywood, recently made a significant concession to filmmakers and the traditional cinema. It said last month it would allow a trio of films to debut in cinemas ahead of introducing them on its streaming service. In another sign of the changing times for the media business, Viacom is reviving MTV’s reality TV show, The Real World — this time to air on Facebook. Viacom is also making programming for Amazon, such as the Paramount-produced television series Jack Ryan, produced by author Tom Clancy.On a call with investors, Mr Bakish dismissed concerns that making shows for tech platforms would further erode ratings for Viacom’s own cable channels, instead extolling the value of growing brands like MTV online. Viacom’s traditional cable business, still the biggest driver of revenues, fared less well in the quarter. Sales from its media networks unit, which includes cable channels MTV and FX, fell 1 per cent to $2.52bn in the quarter, weighed by a 6 per cent drop in advertising sales. For the full fiscal year ending in September, Viacom’s sales fell 2 per cent year-over-year to $12.9bn, while net earnings dropped 10 per cent to $1.7bn. Mr Bakish called it a “pivotal year for Viacom”, in which the company “successfully turned around our core business”. Shares in Viacom fell 2 per cent in early trading in New York.
127;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-11-15T21:48:56Z;Apple strikes movie deal with Moonlight producer A24;;Apple is following Netflix into original movies, through a new partnership with A24, the New York-based studio best known for producing 2017’s Oscar winner Moonlight.The multiyear agreement will see A24 produce several original films for Apple, as it gears up to launch a new video streaming service next year.Other big A24 movies include Oscar nominees Lady Bird, Room and Ex Machina.The deal is the latest addition to Apple’s growing content slate, which already includes TV series from Damien Chazelle, the Oscar-winning director of La La Land, a reboot of Steven Spielberg’s science-fiction fantasy show Amazing Stories, and a drama set on a morning TV show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.Apple’s move from TV to feature-length films comes as Netflix is gearing up for an Oscar push for new movies such as Roma and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Netflix, which has so far failed to replicate its success with TV-style shows in the movie business, has taken the unusual step of releasing some of those films in cinemas before they arrive on its streaming service.Apple’s renewed push into Hollywood began last year when services chief Eddy Cue hired feted executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg from Sony Pictures Television.Boosting its Services business has become a higher priority for both Apple and its investors. It said earlier this month that it would no longer report iPhone unit sales as part of an effort to push Wall Street to judge its performance on overall revenues, including digital income from the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud.Apple has shed almost $100bn in market capitalisation in recent days after warnings about order cuts from suppliers panicked investors about the iPhone’s growth prospects.Thursday brought some respite from what had been Apple’s longest losing streak since April, closing up 2.5 per cent at $191.41.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients that investors were “overreacting” to bad news from iPhone component suppliers such as Lumentum and Qorvo.“We believe Apple’s December quarter guidance incorporates these revisions as guidance was provided less than two weeks ago,” Morgan Stanley wrote. “As the smartphone market matures, Services takes the growth baton from Devices which ultimately results in more stable growth and higher margins at Apple.”

The Disney+ app will have branded sites with different user interfaces for each of these franchises, Mr Iger added.While some legacy media companies such as MTV have been making content for Netflix, Disney has instead decided to battle head-on with the streaming company that has shaken Hollywood.But competing with the deep pockets of technology companies is expensive, as Disney’s results for the three months to the end of September revealed on Thursday. Total expenses in the quarter were $11.2bn, up from $10.2bn a year ago. For the full fiscal year that ended in September costs and expenses were $44.6bn, up from $41.3bn in the previous year.“Most of what’s going on is ramping up our production . . . in terms of increased investment, specifically for this app,” Mr Iger said, warning that “it will obviously take some time to get the scale we need because it takes time to make these products”.Mr Iger teased some of the new programming Disney is developing for Disney+, including a prequel to Star Wars: Rogue One, that will be a live action TV series starring Diego Luna.$59.4bnDisney sales for the fiscal year ended September 2018Disney’s push into streaming comes as its traditional television business has stalled. Mr Iger says that its $71bn acquisition of Fox assets will help create a television business “to service both the present as well as the future”, meaning making shows for both traditional TV and its streaming service.Disney’s blockbuster films such as Black Panther have been helping offset weakness in TV networks, its largest business unit which includes channels such as ESPN and ABC.“You’ve seen incredible performance in [theme] parks and [film] studio, year after year,” Mr Iger said. However apart from ESPN, “the rest of our TV business has been relatively modest”.This trend was clear in Disney’s earnings, as strength in its film studio powered record profits and sales for the year. Disney made $59.4bn in sales for the fiscal year, up 8 per cent from the year ended September 2017.Disney also blew past forecasts for its fiscal fourth quarter, reporting adjusted earnings of $1.48 a share on $14.3bn in revenues. Wall Street analysts were looking for $1.33 a share on $13.7bn in sales.Quarterly revenues from Disney’s film studio surged 50 per cent to $2.2bn thanks to the hit sequel Incredibles 2. For the year, film studio sales soared 19 per cent, while Disney’s TV business revenues grew only 4 per cent.Shares in Disney rose 1.6 per cent in after-hours trading.Disney this summer won a high-stakes battle with Comcast for Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment assets, which the company expects will help lure people to its own streaming services. The acquisition adds the Fox film studio and cable channels including National Geographic to Disney’s own prized assets such as Marvel and Pixar.As part of the drawn-out takeover contest, Comcast subsequently agreed to buy Fox’s 39 per cent stake in the UK broadcaster Sky, which generated £11.6bn ($15.2bn) for Disney. Disney says it will use the proceeds to help pay for its heavy investment in content.Mr Iger said that Disney+ will come to Europe, even though the company lost to Comcast in the bidding for Sky. “You can’t cry over spilled milk . . . we would have loved to have Sky,” he said, while warning that “it could be possible it takes a little bit longer to penetrate in these markets”.While Disney has told investors the June deal with Fox would take 12 months to close, but Mr Iger said on Thursday that the company is now optimistic it will close “meaningfully earlier”.
129;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-11-01T03:49:32Z;Netflix to debut Oscar contenders in cinemas before streaming;Academy voters believed to look more favourably on movies that have wider release;Netflix has made a significant concession to filmmakers who want to see their movies released first on the big screen, by allowing a trio of films to debut in cinemas ahead of introducing them on its streaming service.The move could open the door to Netflix’s first best picture nomination at the Academy Awards early next year. Roma, the latest film by Oscar-winner Alfonso Cuarón, will be screened at a limited number of cinemas in New York and Los Angeles starting on November 21, almost a month before it arrives on Netflix’s own app, the company said on Wednesday. That marks a reversal by Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, who told investors just two weeks ago that he was committed to a “member-centric simultaneous release model”, launching its growing slate of original movies online and offline at the same time. Roma, seen as Netflix’s strongest Oscar contender, will go live on the streaming service worldwide on December 14, at which point it will get a wider theatrical release in more than 20 markets, including some screenings on a high-resolution 70mm print. Mr Cuarón, the acclaimed director of Gravity, has already won a clutch of awards on this year’s film festival circuit for Roma, a drama set in 1970s Mexico and shot in black and white. “There’s been an overwhelming response to all of our films this festival season, and this plan is building on that momentum,” said Scott Stuber, head of Netflix’s film group.The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the latest from Joel and Ethan Coen, the writer-director siblings who have previously won Oscars for Fargo and No Country for Old Men, will hit the big screen a week before it lands on Netflix. In December, the streaming pioneer will also give the big-screen treatment to Bird Box, a new film from Susanne Bier, the Danish director behind the TV series The Night Manager and 2010’s Oscar-winning In a Better World. Netflix released more than 30 films in cinemas last year, mainly at smaller cinema chains such as Landmark and iPic. Those movies included Mudbound, which was nominated for four Oscars this year, as well as Bright, War Machine and The Meyerowitz Stories, which all featured big-name Hollywood actors such as Will Smith and Brad Pitt. However, Roma, Buster Scruggs and Bird Box will be receiving a much bigger push. While it takes only a few screenings to qualify a film for entry to the Oscars, Academy voters are believed to look more favourably on movies that have a wider release. “Netflix’s priority is our members and our filmmakers, and we are constantly innovating to serve them,” said Mr Stuber.Keeping filmmakers happy is important for the company, to ensure that it can keep attracting talent and content. As Netflix is notoriously secretive about the viewing figures for anything shown on its service, awards can be a vital badge of success for creators. Netflix’s Oscar drive follows a strong showing for its original TV shows at the Emmys. It won 23 awards this year, tying with HBO for the largest number of wins. However, the company has not succeeded in replicating its success in TV shows with movies.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
131;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-23T10:59:10Z;Netflix secures $2bn from bond investors to back expansion;TV streaming company prepares fresh push into original content;Netflix has secured just over $2bn through its latest bond offering, as debt investors continue to foot the bill for the streaming television and movie company’s aggressive programming expansion.Investors chalked up billions of dollars of orders for the deal, although Netflix ultimately paid a slightly higher interest rate than initially expected amid a volatile day for broader financial markets, according to people with knowledge of the deal.Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, has already turned to the $1.3tn high-yield bond market to pay for original programming, such as Stranger Things, that has helped attract millions of new subscribers. Netflix said it would pour up to $8bn into content this year, although some analysts think the number could hit $13bn.John McClain, a portfolio manager with Diamond Hill Capital, said he expected Netflix to continue to tap the corporate bond market in the years to come.“They are going to persistently come to market and that’s OK as long as every dollar they are borrowing is creating more than that in value,” he said. “That is certainly the case for them. It makes sense for them to tap the high-yield bond market. Borrowing at 5, 6 or 7 per cent is a much cheaper cost of funding.”Netflix was finalising a capital raise in both euros and dollars, with the $800m tranche of the bond expected to price with a yield of roughly 6.375 per cent, according to people familiar with the matter. The US dollar notes mature in 10.5 years. The €1.1bn tranche was set to price with a yield of 4.625 per cent, the people added. Yields on both notes were priced an eighth of a percentage point above the levels marketed to investors late on Monday.Earlier this month Netflix said it signed up nearly 7m new customers last quarter, well above analysts’ estimates, and forecast that it would add a record 29m subscribers this year. Although Netflix shares have fallen about 20 per cent from the record set in July, they remain up more than 50 per cent this year.Netflix forecasts it will use up to $3bn in cash this year, a sum Mr Hastings insisted will reap long term benefits.“You’re using the word loss and I think you mean investment,” he told analysts on a call this month. “We definitely hope that they’re not turning into losses. A track record would show that those investments have turned out to be very successful for us.”The company unveiled 676 hours of programming in the third quarter, a company record and more than double from a year ago, according to Cowen & Company.The rapid pace at which Netflix uses up cash has been a focus for investors, particularly as other highly valued tech companies such as WeWork and Uber test the junk bond market. Christian Hoffmann, a portfolio manager with Thornburg Investment Management, said the group of sub-investment-grade companies had so far won the backing of bond investors because of their sky-high equity valuations, even as they lacked “robust credit metrics”.“Most companies that burn cash and have high leverage, the market normally shies away from,” he said. “But that is not the case here. Some investors feel supported by the loan to value argument.”Analysts with rating agency S&P Global last week upgraded their view of Netflix, lifting their rating one notch to double B minus. Rival agency Moody’s said it believed Netflix would top 200m subscribers by the end of 2021 and that it would stop bleeding cash within five years as its margins rise. Moody’s rates Netflix Ba3, three notches below investment grade and equivalent to S&P’s opinion.The bond sale was being led by Morgan Stanley, alongside Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo.Netflix declined to comment.Additional reporting by Rob Smith
132;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-22T13:41:32Z;Netflix returns to market with $2bn junk bond offering;Debt to help finance heavy spending on original movies and TV shows;Netflix is hitting the corporate bond market again, announcing plans on Monday to issue $2bn in dollar and euro-denominated junk bonds to help it finance its heavy spending on original movies and television shows.The company behind hit shows such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black is planning to spend more than $8bn on original content this year, up from $6bn in 2017.To fund this, Netflix has been tapping the debt rather than the equity markets — even though its shares have surged more than 73 per cent this year. It last raised $1.9bn in April and $1.6bn in October last year. Pressure to keep increasing its content budget is only growing as more deep-pocketed rivals have piled into the streaming video market that Netflix pioneered.Walt Disney, Apple and AT&T are all set to launch their own online TV and movie services in 2019.Netflix justifies its ballooning investments as vital to gaining and retaining viewers, particularly as media companies have pulled back on giving a rival rights to show their programming. Netflix has spent robustly on original and local language content as it as rolled out services around the world, including in India, where it launched its first original series, Sacred Games, this year.News of the bond issue comes less than a week after Netflix reported stronger-than-expected earnings and subscriber gains for the third quarter. That eased worries that the company might repeat a miss in subscriber gains in the second quarter that sent its stock plunging in July.While the results and the accompanying upbeat fourth-quarter guidance have helped allay concerns over slowing momentum at Netflix, some analysts remain wary over the group’s cash burn rate. It forecast a free cash burn of $3bn this year and another $3bn in 2019 — although it expects an improvement after that.Long-term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from the $6.5bn reported at the end of 2017.
133;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-19T14:37:09Z;UK’s political class finds new home in Silicon Valley;US-based companies find willing recruits in figures such as Nick Clegg;"For several years now, a group of former ministers and advisers who once occupied the top spots in British politics have provided a talent pool in which US businesses and organisations regularly fish.During the years of New Labour dominance and the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that followed, relations between ministers and business were good. In those pre-Brexit times, companies felt they had the ear of government, and the relationships helped both MPs and their staff members when their party fell out of favour or their own star waned. Policy experts and advisers to politicians, if they had worked with influential ministers, could rely on finding good jobs in the private sector.But the news that Facebook has recruited Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister and leader of the Lib Dems, to head its global affairs and communications team confirms that this longer-term trend applies to the top ranks as well. Once-powerful figures who represented the moderate, centre ground of British politics have lost traction with the electorate in the polarised Brexit era. Many see the fresh pastures of Silicon Valley as the place to mould the future of society.After leaving jobs at the top of former prime minister David Cameron’s operation in Downing Street, Steve Hilton and Rachel Whetstone transplanted themselves to California. Ms Whetstone has taken senior roles at Facebook, Google and Uber, and earlier this year moved to Netflix. Mr Hilton now hosts a Fox News show, The Next Revolution — his much satirised attempts to introduce “blue skies thinking” into Conservative party politics now has a much wider audience.The former PR executive has taken senior roles at Facebook, Google and Uber, and moved to Netflix earlier this yearThe former foreign secretary is now chief executive of the humanitarian aid group International Rescue CommitteeThe former political adviser is now host of the Fox News show The Next RevolutionBritish politicians have also joined US non-profit organisations.David Miliband, the former UK foreign secretary, forged a close, even affectionate, relationship with Hillary Clinton when she was US secretary of state. After he lost out on the Labour party leadership to his brother Ed, Mr Miliband resigned his seat in the House of Commons in 2013 to become president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, a US humanitarian aid operation.Mr Clegg and Mr Miliband are the most senior ranking recruits so far — but numerous advisers have also left Westminster to advise technology companies.One former recruit who took this route from SW1 to Silicon Valley said: “Europe is a very important set of markets for US tech firms; they need that understanding. Plus dealing with the UK media is very tough — that is seen as good experience, and you are used to dealing with important people who are in the spotlight.”Google now employs Theo Bertram, who worked in Downing Street under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. DJ Collins, who was a close confidant of Mr Miliband, also left Labour politics to work for the search giant. Google presently employs Tim Chatwin, another Cameron aide, who heads up its Emea communications.Nick Pickles, a former think-tank boss and Conservative party candidate, is now a senior public policy strategist for Twitter.The technology companies are also keenly poaching political talent. Thea Rogers, once an adviser to former chancellor George Osborne, is now head of global communications and policy for Deliveroo. She is joined by Robert Oxley, former adviser at the Ministry of Defence and a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign.Adam Atashzai, another former adviser to Mr Cameron, is Uber’s head of public policy in northern Europe. Uber announced on Friday that Lottie Dominiczak, until recently an adviser at the Department of Health, is joining the company to run its UK communications operation.For these former advisers, moving from politics to technology businesses has several advantages. Especially for those with backgrounds in policy, these companies are seen as the most interesting industry in the private sector.With new developments rapidly outpacing regulation, businesses have little choice but to quickly expand their public affairs teams. And compared with political life, technology companies may also offer more stable employment, better career prospects and higher levels of remuneration.As one former adviser who had made this move told the Financial Times, the scrutiny which tech groups are now under because of their power is comparable to the world of politics.“There is a definite pull, for anyone who wants to make a bigger impact on the world. You are dealing with global questions, some of which are existential for society,” this person said."
134;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-17T17:20:07Z;Tech investors still nervous despite Netflix rally;Sector exerts heavy influence on wider US stock markets;Netflix has set a bullish tone for the Faang stocks but investors who have piled into the tech trade remain cautious, as a crucial earnings season for US technology companies kicks into gear.Shares in the video streaming company rallied 4 per cent on Wednesday, buoyed by better than expected subscriber data in its latest financial quarter. The rise extended a run that has lifted its stock more than 90 per cent since the start of 2018.Despite the rise in Netflix shares, the New York Stock Exchange’s Fang+ index remained lodged in negative territory on Wednesday, down 0.31 per cent from Tuesday’s close.The benchmark, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet and other popular tech names, is down almost 15 per cent from its all-time high struck in June.That stumble has been closely watched by Wall Street and global investors, as investing in Faang stocks has been one of the most lucrative and popular trades in recent years.For the year to date, the Fang index is 17.8 per cent higher, and the trade has been responsible for driving much of the wider 2018 rally in US stock markets.“The concentration of performance in the Faangs over the last three years causes numerous investors to be concerned and rightly so,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations.“We need to see more depth and breadth of performance to the market to instil more confidence. That is why today, you aren’t seeing more buyers.”As investors have increased their exposure to the stocks, there is a rising awareness that a concentration of capital in a select few companies has raised the risk that a fall in their prices could magnify losses across the market should turbulence persist.Fund managers surveyed by Bank of America ranked the long-Faang position, combined with a long position in the Chinese equivalent BAT trade, which includes Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as the most crowded for the ninth consecutive month.Combined with a record proportion of investors believing the global economy is in the late stage of the economic cycle, increasing the likelihood that any dip will become a concerted downturn, the exposure to tech stocks threatens to ripple through other sectors should investors rush to sell.The upcoming earnings season is seen as an important test for other big tech names and for Wall Street more broadly.“Netflix is important short term, but as soon as the next tech bellwether company reports, it will be forgotten,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “It is a sort of ‘what have you done for me lately’ mindset.”
135;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-17T15:32:57Z;Netflix: sub bubble;Streaming group’s ‘happy ending’ could yet prove just another plot twist;Movie goers usually prefer a happy ending. Netflix, the online video site, does its best to please. A dramatic conflict was set up in the second quarter ending in June. The streaming pioneer announced a shock shortfall in subscriber growth compared to its own forecasts. Hollywood could not have scripted a better next episode. In the third quarter results, announced late on Tuesday, subscriber numbers snapped back. Overall subscribers jumped by 7m, driven by viewers outside the US, well ahead of the 5m forecast. Applause!Netflix’s share price jumped more than 5 per cent at the start of trade on Wednesday, boosting the bruised US tech sector. The recent tech fade — Nasdaq fell as much as 9 per cent in two weeks — suggests worry about the vertiginous valuations that have endured for years. That very much applies to Netflix. Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear that Netflix will get the ending it wants.Start with the rapid growth in international subscribers, 5m quarter over quarter, the lion’s share of its overall gain. That rate is perhaps not surprising given how much Netflix has spent on developing programmes such as Indian crime thriller Sacred Games.But while its operating profit margin hit 12 per cent for the quarter, ahead of forecast, the company attributed the good result to the timing of marketing and content expenses. The company also said that its free cash flow deficit would hit $3bn this year. That figure reflects the optimistic side of previous forecasts but remains a massive number and nearly double last year’s outflow. Moreover, Netflix sees the storyline continuing next year with perhaps a chance of reaching cash flow neutrality several years away. Sigh.The daunting reality of those maths have finally registered with Wall Street analysts many of whom who have knocked down their price target of Netflix. Analysts from MoffettNathanson calculated that even with 90m US subscribers (Netflix currently has 60m in America), the enterprise value of the American business would only be worth $50bn. That is just a third of Netflix’s current enterprise value. Not even its rapidly growing International unit justifies such a gap.Netflix shares, before Wednesday’s jump, had lost a fifth since July. Yet it still trades at more than 7 times 2019 revenue as the market’s eye focuses only on subscriber growth. Too much good news is priced into these shares.
136;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-17T14:17:34Z;Netflix jumps as investors binge on strong third quarter;Shares open up 8% after subscriber growth outstripped expectations;It has been full stream ahead for Netflix’s stock on Wednesday.Shares in the online video company jumped more than 8 per cent at the open as investors cheered Netflix’s blowout earnings and subscriber gains, which have helped allay concerns over slowing momentum that have dogged the stock in recent months.The company behind hit shows such as House of Cards, Lost in Space and Orange is the New Black added nearly 7m net new subscribers in the third quarter — exceeding the 5.3m Wall Street analysts were expecting and the 5m its executives had predicted three months ago.Netflix also said it was expecting to add 1.5m and 6.1m domestic and international paid subscribers, compared to previous guidance of 1.35m and 5.2m.The figures should go some ways to reassuring investors who fear Netflix might repeat a shock miss in subscriber additions in its second-quarter report in July, which sent its stock plunging.“Upside in both third-quarter results and the fourth-quarter guide essentially . . . confirms our view that second-quarter softness did not reflect any fundamental change in the business,” said Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan.William Power at Baird added that international growth was especially encouraging. “The standout was the strong fourth-quarter international guidance,” he said. “International growth remains broad-based, with the company calling out Asia as a growing contributor.”Despite Wednesday’s gains, the stock remains down 11 per cent from its June high of $423.20.Shares are nonetheless up 93 per cent for the year, underscoring the scale of Netflix’s stunning rally, which in May briefly propelled the company’s market capitalisation above of that of Walt Disney to make it the most valuable media group in the US.Not everyone was blown away by Netflix’s latest results, however. Analysts at Keybanc downgraded their rating on the stock to “sector weight” from “overweight”, arguing that they see limited upside to the shares.“While we remain positive on Netflix’s opportunity to grow subscribers and revenue, we believe revenue growth and accelerating margin expansion are needed to drive substantial upside from here,” they wrote. “The latter has not developed at a pace that exceeds our expectations, which suggests upside is more limited.”Cash burn could also be another headwind given the company’s frantic pace of spending on original content such as the series Maniac, which starts Hollywood A-lister Emma Stone and comic actor Jonah Hill.Netflix forecast a free cash burn of $3bn this year and another $3bn in 2019 but expects an improvement after that.Long term debt stood at $8.3bn as of September 30, up from the $6.5bn reported at the end of 2017. The amount spent on interest payments meanwhile totalled $291.6m for the first nine months of the year, compared to $238m for the whole of 2017.

It now counts more than 137m subscribers globally.Shares jumped as much as 16 per cent in after-hours trading in New York. The rise eased in pre-market action on Wednesday, with the stock up 12 per cent ahead of the Wall Street open.The results eased worries Netflix might repeat an unusual miss in subscriber additions in its second-quarter report in July, which had then sent its stock plunging.Overall, this was a strong quarter for the company. Normal service has been restoredThe July report brought a sudden end to a rally that had seen Netflix shares more than double between early January and mid-July. The pressure has only been amplified by the recent sell-off among other previously high-flying technology stocks.Investors and analysts keep a close eye on Netflix’s ability to attract new subscribers as it pours money into new films and television shows.The company plans to spend $8bn on content this year and has justified its investments as vital to gaining and retaining viewers amid increasing competition from the likes of Walt Disney, Amazon and AT&T.The company relies on debt to finance its ballooning levels of content spending. It said it now anticipates free cash outflows of about $3bn in 2018, down from an earlier forecast of $4bn.In the third quarter, Netflix reported robust subscriber growth both in its home country and in international markets where it has made a big push in recent years. It added 1.1m subscribers in the US and 5.9m in other countries, ahead of its own forecast of 650,000 and 4.35m, respectively.“Overall, this was a strong quarter for the company. Normal service has been restored,” said Paolo Pescatore, a telecoms and media analyst. “More importantly, strong growth in its overseas market is encouraging.”Reflecting the scrutiny given to Netflix’s subscriber growth, the company said it would focus on a metric it can forecast more accurately: net growth in paid subscribers. This excludes people who use free trial memberships to its service.Starting in January, Netflix will only issue guidance for paid memberships, Reed Hastings, chief executive, wrote in his letter to shareholders, saying they were “a more reliable indicator of revenue growth”.Third-quarter net income surged to $403m, or 89 cents a share, from $130m, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 34 per cent to $4bn. Analysts had estimated earnings of 68 cents a share and $4bn in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.During the quarter, new seasons of popular Netflix shows such as Orange is the New Black, Bojack Horseman and American Vandal were accompanied by new original franchises such as Maniac and Sacred Games, its first original series in India. The company also noted the success of original films including the romantic comedy To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.Netflix gave bullish guidance for the current quarter, forecasting the addition of another 9.4m subscribers globally, ahead of analysts’ forecasts of 8.35m, according to FactSet.
138;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-10-16T03:00:49Z;Netflix investors brace for repeat of subscriber ‘miss’;Goldman Sachs cuts price target ahead of third-quarter earnings announcement;Netflix investors will discover on Tuesday whether July’s stunning subscriber miss was a one-off episode or the beginning of a new series of disappointments.Shareholders in what was briefly the world’s most valuable media company were left with a cliffhanger after Netflix’s last quarterly earnings report, when it missed its own forecasts by 1m subscribers. Netflix executives blamed their own internal forecasting for the misfire.The shock brought to a sudden end one of this year’s strongest rallies, with Netflix shares more than doubling between early January and mid-July. The pressure on Netflix’s shares has only been amplified by the recent sell-off among high-flying technology stocks.By the beginning of this week, the stock was still trading more than 15 per cent below the $400 level last seen three months ago, when Netflix’s market capitalisation had overtaken that of Walt Disney.Netflix bulls have been cheered by a report from the app analytics provider Sensor Tower that pointed to a return to the forecast-busting growth to which Wall Street had become accustomed.Sensor Tower estimated that third-quarter revenues from in-app subscriptions had increased more than 90 per cent year on year to $243.7m in the third quarter, thanks to more than 50m new app installations.As well as surging in newer markets such as Brazil and India, the data provider reported strong growth in the US, where some analysts had been concerned that saturation was limiting its scope for new subscribers.During the quarter, new seasons of popular Netflix shows such as Orange is the New Black, Bojack Horseman and American Vandal were accompanied by new original franchises such as Sacred Games and Maniac.But analysts at Goldman Sachs warned on Monday that even if Netflix does beat its target of 5m net additional streaming subscribers for the third quarter, investors were still bracing for “more conservative” fourth-quarter guidance.Goldman’s analysts predicted a big jump in content spending in the second half of the year, with cash burn likely to increase from $2bn last year to $3.3bn in 2018.It cut its price target from $470 to $430, saying that other internet companies are trading off lower price-to-earnings ratios. Netflix’s enterprise value is currently 47.5 times its estimated ebitda for 2019, compared with 14 times for the sector as a whole.But the analysts also said that Wall Street “continues to underestimate the size of Netflix’s global addressable market, the impact of incremental content spending, and the growing value of Netflix to both distributors and content creators”.The pressure on Netflix to keep increasing its multibillion-dollar content budget — estimated to hit $13bn this year — is only increasing as more and more rivals emerge in the video streaming market.As well as the long-anticipated debuts of new streaming apps from Disney and Apple next year, AT&T executives have said they plan to launch a new online video service that would include content from Warner Bros and HBO by the end of 2019.Other retailers are following in the footsteps of Amazon Prime Video, with Wal-Mart and Costco reported to be trying to beef up their online channels.At the same time as physical retailers are looking to digital entertainment, Netflix is starting to embrace the traditional movie theatre alongside its latest push into feature films. The streaming pioneer is hoping that a theatrical release will capitalise on the buzz at recent film festivals surrounding three films: Roma, 22 July and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.

On offer was a framed copy of Banksy’s “Girl With Balloon”. The hammer came down at £860,000 ($1.4m) and the work instantly began to self-destruct (there was a shredder hidden in the frame). Somebody’s brand new status symbol was ripped to bits.Most of us might have then considered the remains of the art work to be instantly worth rather less. Not so your average art expert. They instantly announced that, what with its new role as not just a piece of art but a piece of performance art — and surely the most expensive piece of performance art ever — the shredded print was in fact worth rather more.“When Banksy does something crazy,” said one expert, “it will naturally have a dramatic effect on values.” You can interpret this incident however you like, this particular freedom being I believe the precise point of contemporary art. But here is one way to look at it.Artists and auction houses are pretty clever. They have both picked up that something is changing in the financial world — and that this change is not going to be particularly supportive of a business model that thrives on flogging feel-good assets with no yield to the mostly undeserving rich. Keeping attention held and values up therefore requires a little more effort than usual. Look at it like this and this PR stunt should be seen as just that — the last gasp of a fairly desperate canary.So what is this change, and what does it have to do with tech stocks?It is rising bond yields. It has been obvious for some time that 2018 would be the year inflation began to build in the system and interest rates would turn. You can argue about why this is the case and whether it will last or not, but you can’t deny that it is happening.For 30-odd years, yields around the world have been falling (you have been getting less for lending your money to governments) into an environment of falling inflation numbers. Now they aren’t any more.The yield on US 10-year Treasury bonds jumped to 3.26 per cent on Tuesday. It wasn’t much above 2 per cent at the turn of the year. This matters because the yield on government bonds is the cornerstone of all equity valuation models and also the bar by which we all — consciously or subconsciously — judge the risk inherent in our investments.If you can get nothing — or only a negative return after inflation — on a government bond or in a deposit account (3.2 per cent is a distant dream for Europeans) it doesn’t seem silly or even madly risky to invest in other assets that pay nothing. This applies to copies of other pieces of art in suspiciously heavy frames, or technology stocks that promise a networked monopoly of endless profits — but maybe not for 20 years.When there is no return on cash, lots of cash at some indeterminate point in the future can look a lot more attractive than a little of it now. But while you can justify any old expensive growth story when rates are very low, when they aren’t, you can’t.As interest rates rise, investors begin to express a preference for the jam they know they can get today, rather than that which is promised several tomorrows from now. That’s why they might not be rushing to buy Banksys for much longer, and why tech stocks have been so badly hit in the global markets sell-off this week.Anyone holding shares in so-called Faang stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) will know what I mean but the shift is best summed up for many readers by the performance of shares in Scottish Mortgage, an investment trust that many investors — including me — hold to gain exposure to high-growth stocks. They are down about 10 per cent since the beginning of October.It seems, as Capital Economics rather politely puts it, that “investors are still struggling to assess appropriate valuation multiples in an era of higher interest rates”. Clue for those still struggling — assess them lower.There are other things in the mix of course. October is traditionally the month when the market takes money off the table. The stand-off between Italy and the European Commission is fascinating (who rules Italy, Italy or the EU?) but it is unlikely to be resolved in a hurry and anti-EU feeling is high in Italy.The midterm elections in the US are another worry. Republican success would give more power to President Trump, which could be scary. Democrat success could mean a potential impeachment, which is also scary. But scariest of all? US federal debt levels, now at more than 100 per cent of GDP, are back in the news.These worries are playing out against a backdrop of trade tensions — the globalisation that has been so very helpful to big listed companies over the past decade is at best stalled.All of these things matter. But the thing that matters most is bond yields. While they have been falling, valuations haven’t mattered. Now they aren’t, they do.So how do you invest in this environment? The key, of course, is to keep out of things at risk of being shredded after you have paid for them.So you keep a bit more cash than usual in recognition of its optionality. If the rout continues, real bargains will appear and only those with cash will get to buy into them. And you recognise that what you are seeing here is as much a great rotation as a market correction.So you rebalance out of growth stocks — which we can loosely define as those promising you cash flow and profits some time in the future — and in particular technology stocks (usually the growth stocks with the longest term promises). The obvious alternative is to move into value stocks — those offering you cash flow, profit and dividends now.Regular readers of this column won’t be much surprised by what is going on in the market. Look back at the value funds I have mentioned in recent columns — I hold both the Personal Assets Trust and the Ruffer Investment Company — and perhaps go back to some of the multi-asset funds that did so well for investors the last time markets corrected. We haven’t heard much about these kinds of investments recently. But perhaps we soon will.Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek. Views are personal. merryn@ft.com. Twitter: @MerrynSW
140;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Comcast down sharply on Wall Street jitters over Sky offer;;Investors are not breaking out the bubbly over Comcast’s triumphant £30.6bn bid for Sky over the weekend.Shares in the US cable TV company were down 8.2 per cent in early Monday trade as Wall Street took a dim view of the eye-watering price the company is paying to increase its reach in Europe.While the addition of Sky and its 23m customers should help Comcast bolster its defence against streaming services from the likes of Netflix and Amazon, the company, which already owns NBC and Universal Pictures, will also be taking on more debt to fund the all-cash offer.Comcast’s £17.28 a share bid beat a rival £15.67 a share bid from Fox, which was backed by Walt Disney. Comcast’s offer also represents a more than 100 per cent increase on where Sky shares were trading at before Fox’s initial approach in December 2016.Sky shares by contrast were up 8.6 per cent at £17.21 while those for Fox rose 1.1 per cent.
141;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-09-20T11:57:05Z;Netflix: stream locomotive;Raising the subscription fee at a quicker pace will help the business;This week Netflix took home more trophies from the Emmy Awards than any broadcast TV network. As the stars of its smash show Queer Eye would say: “Can you believe?” The haul looks like vindication of the streaming service’s decision to carry on spending heavily on content. But it also means the company’s debt-fuelled model remains as far from breaking even as ever.There is a good reason for the US-based group to keep its foot on the gas. Not only is it competing with upstarts such as Amazon Prime and 21st Century Fox-backed Caffeine but traditional companies such as Disney and AT&T.For now, Netflix has the lead. YouTube lacks its prestige programmes, Amazon Prime and Hulu have less content. Viacom has agreed to produce a Nickelodeon series for Netflix, showing that not every media company wants to compete. Some are more interested in co-operation.Netflix will go on broadening its content. Its glossy US drama series will be ballasted by more local-language films and TV shows. Worldwide subscribers reached 125m at the end of March — equal to more than a third of the US population. The largest untapped audiences are overseas. It can hardly be a coincidence that Mathias Döpfner, boss of German publisher Axel Springer, joined the Netflix board this week.New content should bolster a brand that is already formidably strong. If Netflix is guilty of extravagance, it is only in allowing the costs to crystallise as forecast negative free cash flow of $4bn. The solution is to raise the average monthly subscription fee at a quicker pace.Revenue for 2018 should be about $15.8bn. Subscription rates vary. The average is $10.99. If all users paid $15 a month, it would generate revenue of about $22bn.Netflix’s current monthly fee is about the price of a movie ticket. At $15 a month, Netflix would still be cheaper than cable television and in line with rates charged by HBO and MoviePass. YouTube TV and fellow streamer Sling TV have both raised prices recently. Viewers pay more to sate a voracious appetite for new content. Netflix should take advantage of that.

142;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Nasdaq slides as technology stocks take a hit;Amazon, Apple and Netflix lead sell-off, continuing index’s decline from August highs;Tech stocks were under pressure on Monday morning, with heavy falls for some of the most popular names in the sector.The declines had the Nasdaq Composite eyeing its second 1-plus per cent drop this month and its biggest one-day drop since September 5.The Nasdaq was down 1.1 per cent at 7,919.296 in morning trade, nearly triple the 0.4 per cent drop for the S&P 500. The tech-heavy index is off 2.3 per cent from its record closing high at the end of August.The NYSE Fang + TM index, which tracks the so-called Faang stocks and a number of telecommunications names, was down 2 per cent. Among those names:• Amazon tumbled 3.1 per cent to $1,910.0129. The fall comes after the ecommerce giant said over the weekend that it was investigating claims that employees accepted bribes to disclose confidential data that would give some sellers a competitive advantage.• Apple was down 1.8 per cent to $291.75.• Facebook dropped 1.2 per cent and was at a five-month low of $160.28.• Google parent Alphabet sank 1.1 per cent to $1164.44.• Netflix fell 2.1 per cent to $357.07.• Microsoft eased 0.7 per cent to $112.58.Tech stocks have in general had a rocky few weeks, punctuated by some relatively sharp one-day drops. Social media stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off on September 5 when executives from those companies provided testimony before Congress to discuss alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, as well as Twitter’s transparency and accountability.The next day, semiconductor stocks took a hit after the chief executive of Micron Technology said pricing for the company’s Nand chips had fallen in the current quarter. Less than a week later, chipmakers suffered another round of sharp declines after Goldman Sachs downgraded its recommendation on the sector to “neutral”.The tech sector is also due a shake-up after closing bell on Friday when the GICS classification system of sectors gets its biggest overhaul since inception in 1999. At a cosmetic level, Standard & Poor’s will rename the telecommunications services sector “communication services”. But the index provider will also move a number of consumer discretionary names such as Walt Disney and Netflix join it, as well tech stocks including Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter across to the revamped group.
143;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-09-13T13:52:18Z;Netflix sets its sights on the silver screen;Group that made its name in TV streaming is about to unveil the fruits of its foray into film;"Alfonso Cuarón, the acclaimed director of Gravity, arrived in Toronto this week to promote his first film in five years. Roma, an intimate drama set in 1970s Mexico and shot in black-and-white, has been described as a “masterpiece”, winning the grand prize at the Venice film festival and instantly becoming a contender for Academy Awards.But the film has perhaps garnered just as much attention for being distributed by Netflix, which has stormed the autumn festivals in recent weeks as it aims for a standout success in film — a format that has not lent itself as easily to streaming as television. While series such as Stranger Things and Orange Is The New Black made Netflix a singular force in TV, it has yet to repeat that performance with movies. “For the past year, [Netflix] has been the topic of conversation at most meetings,” said the chief executive of a film financing company. “At first there was this glorification . . . that Netflix was saving the business. Then there was backlash. And now we’re in this period of questioning: what exactly are they doing?”Netflix wants to change that view. A year and a half ago, it hired producer Scott Stuber to develop its film business. This autumn will be the first big test of Mr Stuber’s strategy, as a number of projects under his watch debut in the coming months. The Toronto International Film Festival, which has become an unofficial start to the six-month Oscar’s race, welcomed Mr Cuarón with a lavish red carpet gala, where he dutifully thanked Netflix executives for “bringing this film to the world”. Roma, one of Mr Stuber’s first projects to hit the screens, is set to be shown nine times in Toronto as part of a marketing blitz by Netflix, and observers speculate it could finally yield the company a coveted best picture nomination.The push comes at a crucial time for Netflix, whose years-long stock rally was abruptly halted this summer after the company revealed a rare miss in quarterly subscriber growth— more than $20bn was wiped from its market value minutes after the news broke. However, despite the slowdown, Neftlix gave no indication that it would cut spending this year; rather, it insists that investing in new content is the key to attracting customers.Analysts agree. “Having great movies that are exclusive to the platform is absolutely critical,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG. That said, “it’s really early . . . we haven’t seen any of [Stuber’s] films come out yet”.The company has taken on more than $8.3bn in long-term debt to fund its original content, and expects free cash outflows of as much as $4bn for 2018. Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix promised investors in July that its films would become as successful as its TV shows, “but it will take another year or so as we get into it”. Netflix’s presence hung heavily over Toronto this week as Roma’s rapturous reception reignited a debate about the future of the movie business. The company brought eight films to Toronto, including Outlaw King, a Scottish war drama that opened the festival — the first time a big festival has given the highest profile slot to any streaming service. It was also very much in evidence at the Venice and Telluride festivals a few weeks ago.This was in sharp contrast with its Cannes experience earlier this year. Cannes’ leadership banned Netflix films from competing for awards unless it showed them in French cinemas. Netflix refused and pulled out of the festival entirely.The sticking point was that Netflix releases its films online at the same time as in cinemas — if they place them there at all — which has infuriated cinema owners. Netflix has been firm in this strategy, but it has been rumoured that the company might compromise and give Roma a traditional cinema release in its Oscar quest. Netflix has not yet made this decision on Roma, according to industry executives familiar with the matter.Amazon and Apple also descended upon Toronto which, like Sundance, is a showcase for awards-worthy movies that have not yet secured distribution deals. Netflix also competes against established studios such as Universal Pictures, Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, and Warner Bros. Some filmmakers argue that Netflix and Amazon are funding smaller films that the studios have turned away from in favour of big blockbusters. Producer James D Stern worked with Netflix on the films Come Sunday and The Discovery, and “in both cases, I’m not sure those films would get made at all without Netflix”, he says. Distributing with Netflix also makes for “a lot less pressure”, said Mr Stern, who produced The Old Man and The Gun, a Robert Redford western that premiered in Toronto this week. “You can make the right film for the right money, without dying on opening weekend because you’re looking at every ticket.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in Los Angeles"
144;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-09-12T17:30:24Z;Sky/Comcast/Fox: code red;The battle for the media group could end up being resolved by the regulators;After thousands of hours of haggling and millions of dollars in fees for advisers, the battle for Sky could be resolved in the humdrum offices of a low-profile City regulator. If neither Fox nor Comcast makes a knockout bid for the UK-based pay-TV group soon, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, a 50-year old body staffed mostly by secondees from law firms and banks, will squeeze one from them.Stakes are high. The sport and drama purveyed by Sky is coveted by the US groups, with the wrinkle that Fox itself expects to be bought by Disney. Compelling content is the best defence against Netflix, Amazon and other disruptive media groups.Normally, by this advanced stage of a bid, one contender has made a move which the other party cannot, or will not match. UK rules designed to prevent sieges require that if the warring parties are still locked in combat 46 days after the second (or final) contestant entered the fray, the matter should be settled by an auction.These are rare. They have happened about once every six years since the mid-1980s. The rules are set out in the Takeover Code, the fat rule book that governs UK M&A. This details a default process with five bids over five days.The consequent game theory could give Garry Kasparov a headache. Fox, Comcast and Sky could opt for a different number of rounds or stipulate minimum increments. They could also come up with their own structure involving a “formula bid”, if the Panel approved it. Comcast, for example, might say its maximum price for Sky is £15.50p a share, but that it will always pay 50p more than Fox. Fox might say its maximum is £14.50, and it will always pay 30p more than Comcast. If so, Comcast would win at £15.Step back from the detail for a moment. A multibillion-pound bidding contest could be resolved by the City equivalent of a compère auctioning a spa day for charity. Bankers and lawyers would be right to feel embarrassed, to the extent they are capable of it.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

145;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-31T04:01:06Z;Hollywood studios bask in box office revival;Ticket sales set to reach record despite competition from Netflix and Amazon;"Two years ago Jon Chu, the director of films such as Step Up, faced a tough choice. Many of his peers had begun cutting deals with Netflix and Amazon to debut their films online, as the traditional movie rollout became increasingly risky in the age of digital streaming. Netflix offered Mr Chu an eye-watering payday for the rights to his upcoming romantic comedy, Crazy Rich Asians, which appeared the clear safer route after Chu’s most recent film had bombed in theatres.He decided to open Crazy Rich Asians at the cinema anyway. Mr Chu’s gamble might have looked foolish in the ensuing year: a series of flops produced Hollywood’s worst summer in two decades — igniting fresh fears about the future of the big screen in the digital era. “People were throwing in the towels,” said Leo Kulp, an analyst at RBC. But a year later, Crazy Rich Asians has landed amid a strong turnround for the box office. This summer has been lush with hits, allowing Hollywood executives to breathe a sigh of relief as 2018 is on track for a record $11.6bn in box office returns in the US and Canada. As the industry consolidates, the riches are ending up increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few megastudios. During the critical summer season, which typically makes up about 40 per cent of annual revenues, North American box-office sales have grown 14 per cent from a year ago to $4.22bn, according to ComScore, which tracks ticketing. On an inflation-adjusted basis, this was the best summer in five years. “It was a perfectly programmed summer that no one saw coming,” said Paul Dergarabedian, analyst at ComScore. The better year has defied Wall Street forecasts, padding the earnings of the world’s largest media companies such as Disney and Fox, and lifting the stock price of Wanda-owned AMC, the biggest US movie theatre company. Few could be happier than Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney. Its film studio has unveiled blockbuster after blockbuster, taking up a third of all box-office sales this year. Disney’s dominance has been on the rise for the past decade, largely because of the reliable success of Marvel films, and its film schedule can swing the direction of the entire box office in a given year.“The huge stabilisation factor in 2018, and what we will see in the next five to 10 years, without a doubt is the rising power of Disney,” said Jeff Bock, analyst at Exhibitor Relations, an entertainment consultancy. “Their consistency is unparalleled in the blockbuster era. One strong brand is what you need when you’re competing against the streaming services, and Disney is going to be the megastudio for some time.”Disney’s power is only set to deepen, after the company in June won a battle over Fox’s entertainment assets, which will fold the Avatar and X-Men films into Disney’s treasure chest that also includes Star Wars and Pixar films. Combined, Disney and Fox’s film studios this year made up 42 per cent of the entire box office. The merger shrinks the number of major film studios from six to five. The number of people going to the movies in the US, the largest movie market, has been slowly declining for years, which cinema owners have partially offset by raising ticket prices. This year has bucked that trend: the North American box office has sold 881m tickets through August 26, higher than the 832m at this point in 2017. The average ticket price has risen about 4 per cent to $9.27, according to ComScore.The movie business is one of momentum; the idea is that if someone sees a good movie in theatres, they will be compelled to return. Executives attribute the better year to a stronger schedule of films, which kicked off with Disney’s Black Panther in February. Black Panther, the first big-budget superhero movie with a predominantly black cast and a black director, was a staggering success. The film drew $700m in domestic sales, passing Titanic to become the third-highest grossing film of all time in the US. “I don’t think you can underestimate the impact that Black Panther has had on the movie business this year,” said Greg Foster, chief executive of Imax Entertainment. “I’ve been in this business for a long time. There’s two things you need for a year to be successful: a little bit of luck, and starting out with something that hits it out of the park.”Black Panther also became a cultural talking point, drawing water-cooler conversations back to the cinema, after last summer was dominated by increasingly cinematic television such as Netflix’s Stranger Things. “A movie like Black Panther is sort of streaming-proof,” said Mr Dergarabedian. “You want to be a part of that conversation, and you can’t be if you wait for it to hit the small screen.”Disney followed Black Panther with Marvel’s latest Avengers sequel in April, and the Pixar film The Incredibles 2 in June, which became the second and third-highest grossing movies of the year. After last year’s dismal showing, RBC’s Mr Kulp had predicted that 2018 sales would be flat. But as the months passed, and films surprised, he has repeatedly revised his forecast upward. He now expects 2018 to rake in $11.65bn in the US and Canadian box office, a fresh record.The question remains whether Disney’s dominance is good for audiences. Four of the top five movies this year have been sequels, and some analysts caution about the prospect of a Walmart-esque presence in film, which would have greater leverage in negotiating deals with theatre owners and bigger budgets to produce more blockbusters.The top 10 films this year have accounted for 46 per cent of total box-office sales, up from 38 per cent last year, according to ComScore. Doug Creutz, director at Cowen & Company, a research consultancy, said: “If you’re Disney then yeah, things are holding up better than expected. But if you’re not one of the big mega-blockbusters, then it’s still really tough to do well. Teenagers are playing Fortnite now. There are just more ways to entertain yourself than there used to be.”In this environment, he added, the smaller major studios “have been getting squeezed out”.But others point to Disney as the best equipped to defend the theatre in the face of streaming. On a call with investors this month, Mr Iger declared his continuing commitment to the cinema, which has earned Disney $6bn in revenues a year. While laying out plans for a Disney streaming service, he cautioned: “I want to be clear that we remain incredibly supportive and enthusiastic about the movie theatre experience.” The future looks ripe for more consolidation, as the industry stares down the deep pockets of Netflix and Amazon. Warner Bros, which distributed Mr Chu’s Crazy Rich Asians, has been swallowed up by AT&T as part of its acquisition of Time Warner, and Universal is owned by Comcast through its 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal. But the remaining studios — Paramount, Sony and Lionsgate — “are barely surviving at this point,” said Mr Bock at Exhibitor Relations.For now Mr Chu and his peers are enjoying something of a moment for the traditional cinema, at least this summer. Crazy Rich Asians has made $76m domestically in its first 12 days in theatres, capturing the zeitgeist in a way that Mr Chu said only the theatre can, which was his goal in placing an Asian-American cast in a big Hollywood production. “We would not be in the conversation as much as we are . . . on a streaming service,” he told TV talk show CBS This Morning this month. “Having a big studio say this is worth tens of millions of dollars to throw down for marketing, and this is worth your time to leave your house and fight for parking and sit in a dark room . . . it says something bigger than just: this is a piece of content.”The movie industry, like music and television, has seen its business disrupted by the internet. But unlike its peers, the subscription model of Netflix and Spotify had not truly invaded the big screen until this year.MoviePass, a financially strapped start-up, has shaken the industry with a monthly subscription that offered customers up to one movie a day. Founded in 2011 to bring a Netflix-style “all you can eat” model to US cinema-going, subscriptions jumped last year when it cut its monthly price to $10 — less than a single movie ticket in many big cities.The product pleased frequent movie-goers, racking up 3m subscribers since launching one year ago. But it prompted soul-searching from theatre chains who feared it could erode prices.MoviePass has had a series of financial setbacks, sending shares in parent company Helios & Matheson tumbling in recent months as concerns mounted about the sustainability of the business model.And ultimately analysts view subscriptions as a niche product for film. RBC estimates only about 10 per cent of people go to the movies once a month, which would make it worth it to sign up.But it did show exhibitors another way to lure people into the cinema, as ticket prices rise every year. “Studios are hesitant to tip their hats to MoviePass. But they really have revitalised audiences,” said Jeff Bock, the analyst at Exhibitor Relations. “Despite all the problems MoviePass has had, someone will figure out how to do that service justice.”The incumbents have already followed: AMC, the biggest US chain, in June unveiled its own flat-rate monthly service, allowing members to watch up to three movies a week for $19.95.

146;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;‘Seinfeld’ for the soul;When gorging on a good box set is all the salve you need;"There are times in life when TV turns out to be all you need. Good TV and a lot of it. Yes, there are other art forms more usually associated with strong emotions. And if you are after catharsis, then a good sob at the opera, or even at the wheel of your car listening to Classic FM, will do the trick every time. But sometimes the soul can be soothed just as effectively with a good box set.When my father died at the beginning of this year, I stopped doing a lot of things I normally do. I couldn’t listen to music; anything classical was out, and my usual Spotify playlists too laden with association. I stopped reading last thing at night. I still read during the day, on the bus or on the Tube, but by nightfall books suddenly became too risky, dangerous even. The “D-words” (death, dad . . .) could spring out at any time and leave me horribly wide awake. I didn’t want to think or be reminded of anything, I just wanted to be reliably and safely distracted until sleep descended.So it felt almost like divine intervention when all nine seasons of the funniest TV show ever made, Seinfeld, landed on Amazon Prime Video. This was to be my salve. I calculated that at roughly 23 minutes each — the perfect length for pre-slumber wind-down — the 180 episodes would keep me going for at least six months. By which time, hopefully I would be able to read again.I had already gorged on all nine seasons on DVD in 2005 after a bad break-up — having somehow missed out on the first wave of Seinfeld mania when it aired between 1989 and 1998. But the fact that I had watched them all before was no deterrent; on the contrary, compared with the deluge of “original” new drama on Netflix and Amazon, it was tried and tested and, most importantly, safe viewing.When my father died at the beginning of this year, I stopped doing a lot of things I normally do. I couldn’t listen to music; I stopped reading last thing at nightWith these sites, gorging isn’t just easy — it is unavoidable. Each episode is teed-up, and seasons roll into one, remembering where you were when you last left off. There’s no need even to reach for the remote or to press eject. It couldn’t require less effort — something that the sofa-loving protagonists of Seinfeld would surely have appreciated.The show, written by comic geniuses Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, was famously about nothing — a particularly hilarious brand of nothing perfected by its four thirtysomething leads, Jerry (played by Seinfeld himself), Kramer (Michael Richards), Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and George (Jason Alexander).Loafing around in Jerry’s apartment or shooting the breeze about life’s smaller questions in their local Upper West Side coffee shop, the foursome’s repartee ranged from the trivial (the ideal position for a button on a shirt?) to the even more trivial (is it ever OK to double-dip a chip?).But compared with its cosier cousin Friends, Seinfeldian comedy was always piquant, risqué even. Take the famous episode “The Contest”, which may have been the first time that masturbation was talked about openly by men and women on television — albeit in a variety of amusingly coded ways. And of course, the show yielded many concepts and phrases that have famously entered the lexicon: among them “yadda, yadda, yadda”, “re-gifter”, “low-talker”, “close-talker” and “sponge-worthy” (don’t ask).“Isn’t Seinfeld a bit . . . dated?” a colleague asked me. Giddy-up!, as Kramer might say. Its datedness is one of the many reasons why it is so therapeutic to watch now. Theirs was a pre-smartphone world where the gang’s social life was governed by the tyranny of the landline, and where a digital detox meant not bothering to listen to your answering machine messages. Where, somehow, even in New York, there was more time to just hang out — and where the best chats happened over an egg salad sandwich rather than on a WhatsApp group.I looked forward to my date with my four friends, a joyous reward for surviving my daily dose of realityBut most of all, Seinfeld encapsulated those carefree (egg) salad days before real responsibility kicks in — proper jobs, marriage, kids, ailing parents — and that is what makes it so nostalgic (never mind the fact that by the end of the show Jerry and co’s salad days had extended into their early forties).So much time has passed that even the gang’s questionable fashion choices seem nostalgic, and are coming around again (Jerry’s suede blouson and stonewashed high-waisted jeans, Elaine’s waistcoats and scrunchies, Kramer’s vintage shirts). And yet the jokes are still razor-sharp, undimmed, even on second, third or fourth viewing.So, religiously, at about 10.30pm, I tuned in to an episode on my iPhone (I have a theory that small screens make you sleepy). During the evening, I looked forward to my date with my four friends, a joyous reward for surviving my daily dose of reality. And despite frequently snorting with laughter, I still reliably drifted off when the credits rolled.Of course, there are dads and death in Seinfeld. But the dads — in particular George’s father Frank Costanza, played by the inimitable Jerry Stiller (father of Ben) — are so hilarious, and the one actual death-related storyline so absurd (poisonous wedding invitation envelopes), that I wasn’t derailed at all.I got to the end of Seinfeld a month ago and, in a panic, started casting around for something else to watch. But I soon gave up — there is nothing that can compete. And it had done its job. Whether I was through the worst or not, my bedside book pile suddenly started to look appealing again.

147;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-29T14:30:34Z;Superstar chief executives can self-destruct;Charismatic and unruly entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk are risky business titans;"Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists decamp to the Nevada desert this week for Burning Man, the annual jolly to celebrate “radical self-reliance”, gift-giving and co-operation. It culminates on Saturday with the torching of the effigy.Burning Man is a playful experiment in how community can flourish away from private finance and rival companies. Its art theme this year is “I, Robot”. The irony is that technology titans such as Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and a regular “Burner” (event participant), are giants of the real economy.The way the latter works was the topic of another gathering in a western state last week — that of central bankers at Jackson Hole in Wyoming. They fretted about the power and profitability of “superstar companies” such as Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Google. Wages, prices and monetary policy are all heavily affected by these oligopolies.Jackson Hole is a better guide to economic reality than Burning Man but the Burners are right in one respect. The symbolic giant — the superstar founder of the superstar company — is a figure of the time. Wilful, charismatic, unruly entrepreneurs such as Mr Musk embody its economic spirit.A Jackson Hole paper by John Van Reenen, professor at MIT, holds some clues as to why. Professor Van Reenen analyses the phenomenon of concentration in industries, such as technology and media, and how they have become “winner-takes-all” markets.Rather than oligopolies and all-powerful platforms emerging from mergers and lax antitrust rules, Prof Van Reenen argues that they are mainly produced by structural factors. Globalisation and new technology foster superstar companies with high sales margins and returns on capital because “network effects mean that small quality differences can tip a market to one or two players”.It is a familiar story, and companies such as Netflix and Tesla have taken Silicon Valley’s growth and domination mantra beyond the technology industry. But as he notes, it does not mean the industries are uncompetitive; they are just competitive in a strange way. It is an all or nothing (or “most or very little”) contest to grab global territory and become a crushing force.This influences the personalities of leaders at many superstar companies — impatient, relentless and crazily ambitious. It seems bizarre that Tesla’s board and shareholders have allowed Mr Musk to act so unpredictably. He has been sleeping at his electric-car factory to boost output while dabbling publicly with taking the company private to limit scrutiny. But that is how giants roll.One reason why financiers have permitted technology entrepreneurs to secure managerial control over public companies through dual class shares is that they have limited choice — that is what founders such as Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook demand. But they have also made calculated bets that such figures work best for the company in a winner-takes-all economy.This is in sharp contrast to 40 years ago, when Harvard professor Michael Jensen articulated concerns about the “agency costs” imposed on shareholders by the entrenched class of managers who ran big US companies. It encouraged the rise of leveraged buyouts and private equity ownership of companies, with share incentives to make executives follow investors’ interests.Giants have superseded bureaucrats, and shareholders do not have to worry as much about indolence and entrenchment. Rather the opposite, in fact. The managerial risk in the superstar economy is that the founder and leader pushes so aggressively for global control that the company unravels.This happened at Uber, where Travis Kalanick had to be pushed out of the chief executive’s seat by investors despite his voting stake because he had upset too many people, including regulators. He was replaced last summer by Dara Khosrowshahi, an experienced operator who calmed things down.Superstars can be decent managers. Neither Larry Page at Alphabet nor Jeff Bezos at Amazon have the same problem, although both are hugely ambitious. The job of keeping the enterprise on track is often delegated to a chief operating officer, and some shareholders would like one at Tesla.But the value of a founder who personifies the company and has an insatiable desire to grab territory is reinforced by the economy that Prof Van Reenen describes. Another recent study emphasises the importance of “the superstar entrepreneur as a factor of production who implements superstar technology”. That might account for Mr Musk’s long nights at the Tesla factory.There is one hope for the rest of us, who fear domination by winner-take-all behemoths. Whatever the flaws in antitrust law and the structural causes of the new oligopolies, reliance on wilful genius also makes them vulnerable to instability. It is hard for others to compete with them head on, but wait for a while and they may self-destruct.Mr Musk has reportedly skipped Burning Man this year because he has other things on his mind, so he will not witness the climax of the event. On Saturday, the giant goes up in flames. It always ends the same way.john.gapper@ft.com"
148;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-27T18:44:08Z;Rachel Whetstone swaps Facebook for Netflix to run global comms;British executive is a seasoned Silicon Valley operator who previously worked at Uber and Google;Rachel Whetstone is swapping Facebook for Netflix to run global communications for the streaming service as it focuses on international markets that have become the source of most of its subscriber growth.The British executive is a seasoned Silicon Valley operator who worked at Uber and Google before she moved to Facebook last year. She joins Netflix as it is spending an increasing share of its $8bn programming budget outside the US: it recently revealed plans to spend about $1bn on original productions in Europe alone.Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said Ms Whetstone’s “deep knowledge and international expertise” would be “invaluable as we bring Netflix and its expanding line-up of original content to an increasingly global audience”.Ms Whetstone joined Facebook a year ago as vice-president of communications for Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. This followed a two-year stint at Uber, where she was hired as the ride-sharing group tried to build a more experienced management team following a period of rapid growth.Before Uber, she spent a decade at Google, where, as senior vice-president of communications and public policy, she had a ringside seat as the company grew to become a leader in search, adding new products and services. In that time, Google also ran into regulatory trouble in Europe, where it was investigated by the European Commission over claims that it had abused its dominant position in search.This European experience will be important in her new role at Netflix, given that European media companies are increasingly wary of the company and the implications of its growth on public service broadcasters.As one of the so-called “Faangs”— a group of tech stocks that includes Facebook and Google — Netflix has attempted to win over European governments sceptical of the inroads it has made against state broadcasters by highlighting the jobs it creates through its work in Europe.Netflix shares have soared in recent years thanks to strong subscriber growth outside its core US market. The shares slumped last month on disappointing subscriber growth, ending a year-long rally, although they have since won back some of their losses.Earlier in her career, Ms Whetstone worked at Conservative central office in London alongside the likes of future chancellor George Osborne. She joined Google in 2005.She is married to Steve Hilton, the former top David Cameron adviser who fell out with the UK prime minister over immigration and Brexit: Mr Hilton now presents his own television show on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News Channel.
149;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-24T03:00:28Z;Why television’s bogeymen are here to stay;Proposals to protect broadcasters will not stop the likes of Netflix and Amazon;Another week, another kicking for the new bogeymen of UK media. Streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon deliver original television shows and movies to an increasing number of households and have the financial clout to outbid broadcasters for the most sought-after projects. But their growth has sparked concerns.Tony Hall, director-general of the BBC, did not mention Amazon, Netflix or other “digital giants” such as Facebook and Apple in a speech this week, but it was clear which companies he was referring to when he said “new global players” had created “huge super-inflation” in the market for programmes.“We can’t allow what our countries produce at home to be crowded out,” he warned.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, went further in a speech on Thursday at the Edinburgh Television Festival, proposing a new tax or digital licence fee on the likes of Amazon and Netflix to subsidise the BBC.The incursion by technology companies into television is a theme that dominates media industry conferences, and there is plenty of hand-wringing by anxious executives. Their fears would appear to be justified: a recent report by media regulator Ofcom found that people aged 16-34 now watch more non-broadcast than broadcast television content, with YouTube taking an increasingly large share of available audiences. More people in the UK now subscribe to a streaming service such as Netflix and Amazon than pay-television — part of what Ofcom has described as a “major shift in the UK’s viewing habits”.The question for traditional broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV is whether anything can be done about this shift. Digital levies or windfall taxes of the sort proposed by Mr Corbyn could certainly raise money for the BBC at a time when the broadcaster is under pressure to save money. Other measures, such as ensuring that public service broadcasters are prominently featured on the home screens of new smart TVs, which Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon has called for, would at least ensure that the PSBs remain visible.However, none of these ideas will stop the streaming players growing. And European media companies may have left it too late to compete with them.A decade ago, the UK’s leading broadcasters held discussions about pooling resources into a streaming service that they would jointly own and operate. The project advanced far enough to have a working title (for some reason they decided to call it Kangaroo) but ultimately it was blocked by regulators. These days the broadcasters operate their own broadband-delivered “catch-up” services, but these lack scale and breadth of programming when compared with Netflix and Amazon.With that in mind, the UK’s broadcasters have recently begun talking about reviving the Kangaroo concept. In Germany, a similar project is in the works: Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German media group, recently announced plans to build a subscription streaming service that will integrate programming and digital services from the two companies. They have also invited German operators RTL, ARD and ZDF to join the venture.National broadcasters have one built-in advantage over the likes of Netflix and Amazon: they have a closer understanding of the tastes and interests of local audiences, and are better placed to develop programming that caters to those viewers.A streaming service that aggregates UK content from the BBC, ITV and others would undoubtedly appeal to UK viewers. Yet any collaborative service would be at an overall disadvantage when compared with Netflix, which spends most of its annual spending — now at more than $8bn — on its own original programming. It owns the global rights to this content, which never leaves the Netflix service — a contrast with the BBC’s iPlayer, where series appear for limited periods of time before being withdrawn in order to be licensed to other channels and services.European broadcasters are unlikely to stop licensing their content in this way anytime soon: doing so would cut off a much-needed source of revenue. With that in mind, Netflix and deep-pocketed peers like Amazon will continue to have the upper hand as audiences in the UK and Europe continue their migration to on-demand platforms.With Walt Disney also working on a global streaming service— and vying with Comcast, the US cable operator, to acquire Sky — the streaming market is about to get even more crowded. The bogeymen are increasing in number, and UK broadcasters are right to fear them.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that project Kangaroo was blocked by UK regulatorsmatthew.garrahan@ft.com
150;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;3,453 days and $18tn later, the US bull market hits record run;From battered banks to tech titans, the historic milestone in seven charts;"The US bull market is now officially the longest ever. From the depths of the financial crisis, revived by central bank stimulus, fuelled by technological innovation and finally given a shot of tax cuts, the S&P 500 has gone 3,453 days without a drop of 20 per cent, the decline typically associated with a bear market. That edges it past the 1990-2000 bull run that culminated in the dotcom boom.Like the bull market it surpasses, the rally from March 9, 2009, has also coincided with a technological revolution; in this case the rise of the digital economy and reflected in the reshuffled leadership of the S&P 500.In March 2009, the largest companies in the index by market capitalisation were ExxonMobil, Walmart and Microsoft, respectively. Now topping the leaderboard are Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. Facebook, in the No 6 spot, was not even a public company when this bull run first got under way. Microsoft may have weathered the transition to the cloud to retain a top slot; IBM has not been so successful.The stock market stars of the digital economy were even given a nickname as the bull market got longer in the tooth: the Faangs. If you had dropped 99 per cent of the S&P 500 and focused on the behemoths that seem to have taken over consumers’ everyday lives — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent Alphabet — you would have outperformed the bull market handsomely. Concerns about privacy, heightened regulation and growth prospects of these tech companies are not just important questions for the durability of their share price gains. They are now central to the prospects for the overall bull market.But 3,453 days ago, all eyes were on the banks. Brought low by excessive risk taking and then the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, they had only just been recapitalised with injections of taxpayer bailout cash and their futures were in doubt. Investors who picked through the rubble wisely beat the S&P 500 on some of the biggest banks.The market value of the S&P 500 is up 312 per cent from March 9, 2009, a thumping $18.4tn. But measured another way, the market is shrinking. The number of shares in the S&P 500 has fallen 3.1 per cent — a factor that some say creates a scarcity value that has added to the gains.After a burst of equity issuance in the wake of the financial crisis, particularly by banks rebuilding balance sheets, the number of shares has been declining sharply. The reason? A surge in companies buying back their own stock.That spree has underpinned stock prices and propped up all-important earnings per share numbers. Economic growth and the big tax cuts enacted at the end of last year are the biggest factors, but buybacks have also helped the S&P 500 companies report back-to-back quarters of nearly 25 per cent earnings per share growth this year. The buyback trend has been accelerated by the repatriation to the US of profits once held overseas to avoid taxes; Goldman Sachs believes US companies will repurchase a record $1tn of their own shares this year.Have a glass of champagne to celebrate the record length of the bull run, for sure, but consider that it has significant ground to go before becoming the most lucrative.The index closed on Wednesday up 323 per cent from the start of the bull market, shy of the 417 per cent gain for the 1990-2000 run. The latest rally has actually been quite sluggish, at an annualised pace of 16.5 per cent compared with the 22 per cent average for bull runs in the US.The fastest? The 35.5 per cent annualised pace of the 1932-1937 bull market that followed the 1929 stock market crash."
151;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-19T09:00:24Z;Sacking staff is hard but let’s be adult about it;There are many ways to fire people but it always helps to be upfront and honest;"I doubt I will ever forget the first time I fired someone.The casualty was a young reporter, unfairly thrust into too big a job at an outfit too small to offer suitable work. There were tears. There was shock. I still hate to think of how badly I handled it.The one thing there was not, though, was a secret recording of the sacking, like the one that Omarosa Manigault Newman says she made when she was fired from the White House in December.Ms Manigault Newman, a contestant on The Apprentice-turned-White House aide, caused a stir last week when she plugged a tell-all book with what she said was a recording of her booting by chief of staff, John Kelly.President Donald Trump’s response — he called her a low-life “dog” — suggests the recording was genuine, which makes it very unusual. People are fired all the time around the world and a lot of them have a smartphone. Yet we rarely see or hear a sacking.The closest a lot of us get is a Hollywood film like Up in the Air, where George Clooney plays a man who fires people for a living. Or reality television shows like The Apprentice, still going in some countries 14 years after Mr Trump hosted its first season in the US. Part of the show’s appeal is surely the glimpses it offers of the horror of the sack, a disaster that can take longer to recover from than either divorce or the death of a spouse.I would not know because thankfully I have never been fired. I came close as a university student, when I took a telephone marketing job, selling ads for a business directory that I was never sure actually existed.I failed to make a single sale and would have certainly been shown the door if I had not taken the precaution of sacking myself first.Smartphones had not been invented then but even if they had, I cannot imagine I would have had the gumption to covertly record a sacking.I am still astonished when I hear of people who do, though I can see why it happens.Not that long ago, a man I know was thoroughly stitched up by bosses who made him a scapegoat for a superior’s mistake.They hauled him in for a disciplinary hearing where he was so sure he would be unfairly treated that he took in a hidden tape recorder.Unhappily, the device was discovered and he was fired on the spot for deception. The reaction was understandable but I still think he was mistreated.So would it make any difference if more sackings were made public?Probably not. An enormous amount is written on the right way to fire someone: always do it in person and never without a warning. Don’t blather on with small talk. Be direct but also compassionate. Never say anything like “I know how you feel”, because you almost certainly don’t.But ultimately there can never be a truly good way to fire someone. It is a horrible thing to endure and only a psychopath could enjoy doing it.The dread of dismissal is so profound that workers will openly round on a boss for firing a troublesome colleague — even if the casualty is so repellent that the entire office has been dreaming of their disappearance for months.For this reason, I have a lot of time for the bracing approach taken by Netflix. The online entertainment company calmly states on its website that its idea of a great workplace has nothing to do with “sushi lunches” and fancy offices.It sees itself as “a team, not a family”, where people are paid well but shown the door if they fail what it calls the “keeper test”: managers have to think about whether they would try hard to keep someone from leaving for another firm. If the answer is “no”, a merely adequate performer is supposed to be promptly offered a generous severance package so a star replacement can be found.I am not sure I would want to work there myself and obviously not every company is big enough to afford such a policy.But it does have two big advantages. It treats its staff like grown-ups and it is honest about an unavoidable truth: companies do not exist to make life joyous for their employees.pilita.clark@ft.com

152;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Convertible bonds: debt wish;2018 has become an ideal time to sell a combination of debt and equity;Elon Musk’s Twitter habits may not make him much of a role model on corporate governance. But in corporate finance he is a trendsetter. Tesla and SolarCity (the clean energy company he co-founded) have been prolific issuers of convertible bonds — debt instruments that can convert into equity.Issuance of convertible bonds has exploded in the US this year for good reason. Companies like Netflix, which has big financing needs, should consider eschewing sales of equity and debt for a combination of the two.Convertible bonds can be cheap, often paying annual coupons of below 1 per cent. Twitter priced $1bn of convertibles this year with a coupon of just 0.25 per cent. The rub is that the convertible bondholder gets a call option that lets her swap the bond into equity if the company’s share price rises by some preset amount, say 30 to 50 per cent.In the first half of 2018, US companies issued $58bn of convertible debt — the highest level since the crisis. The convertible bond index is up 6 per cent this year even as high-grade and junk benchmarks are negative.The rush makes sense. If interest rates are rising, low coupon convertibles seem more attractive. For buyers, the embedded call option looks juicier as equity values keep rising. However, the ultimate catalyst is the jump in stock market volatility. Volatility is a key input in call option valuation.So far this year, tech companies have dominated convertible issuance. Twitter, Western Digital, Atlassian, Akamai and Palo Alto Networks have all sold more than $1bn. Netflix has previously said that it would continue to rely on high-yield debt to raise the billions it needs to create new shows. But instead of paying interest at three or four per cent, after tax, Netflix could pay a tenth of that in exchange for the small possibility that it owes shares down the road. Convertible bonds make sense. Just ask Mr Musk.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
153;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-13T16:31:52Z;Netflix finance chief to step down after seven years;David Wells presided over video streaming group’s huge investment in original content;Netflix’s chief financial officer David Wells is stepping down after more than seven years in the role.Mr Wells, who has been at the video streaming group since 2004 and CFO since December 2010, will stay with the company until a successor takes the reins. Netflix would consider both internal and external candidates for his replacement, it said. Since Mr Wells took over from predecessor Barry McCarthy, who led Netflix’s initial public offering in 2002, the company’s share price has increased by more than 1,000 per cent, with subscribers rising from 20m at the end of 2010 to more than 130m in the most recent quarter. Mr Wells has presided over Netflix’s huge investment into original content, now running at $8bn a year, as well as taking on substantial debt to finance it. His 14 years at the Silicon Valley-based online video company recently included a two-year posting in Amsterdam, to help develop its European expansion. “After discussing my desire to make a change with Reed [Hastings, chief executive], we agreed that with Netflix’s strong financial position and exciting growth plans, this is the right time for us to help identify the next financial leader for the company,” Mr Wells said in a statement on Monday.Mr Wells, 47, said he wanted the next chapter of his life to focus more on philanthropy, but was also interested in “big challenges”.Netflix shares were hit last month after the company revealed it added 1m fewer subscribers than expected during its second quarter and issued a conservative outlook for the current quarter. It expects free cash outflows of as much as $4bn for 2018 and said it would continue to finance its spending on content through debt rather than by tapping equity markets.The company blamed its own internal forecasting errors for the disappointment, which was its biggest miss in two years. Netflix shares are down 17 per cent from their record high in early July but are still up by about 70 per cent in the year to date. The stock was down about 1 per cent on Monday after news of Mr Wells’ planned departure. To fuel its push into original shows, which began in earnest with the release of House of Cards in 2013, Netflix has taken on more than $8.3bn in long-term debt, as of the most recent quarter. At the end of June, the company had $18.4bn in total streaming content obligations, including both licensed and original TV shows and movies. The final season of House of Cards is expected to air in November. According to Netflix’s annual proxy statement in April, Mr Wells was due to be paid $2.8m this year, including an annual stock option allocation then worth $2.5m. His total remuneration in 2017 reached $5.2m. “David has been a valuable partner to Netflix and to me,” Mr Hastings said in Monday’s statement. “He skilfully managed our finances during a phase of dramatic growth that has allowed us to create and bring amazing entertainment to our members all over the world while also delivering outstanding returns to our investors.”
154;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

156;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-07T20:42:14Z;Disney lifts spending ahead of streaming launch;Second-quarter earnings undershoot Wall Street forecasts as it readies Netflix rival;"A hot summer at the box office was not enough for Disney to beat profit forecasts, as the company spent heavily on its upcoming streaming service and prepares to compete head-on with Netflix. Disney undershot Wall Street forecasts for earnings and revenues in its most recent quarter, sending shares down as much as 3 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Bob Iger, chief executive, struck an optimistic tone with analysts regardless, speaking at length about Disney’s ambitions for its own rival to Netflix, after sealing a blockbuster acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.Describing an “era of unprecedented consumer choice”, Mr Iger looked to assure investors that Disney can “thrive alongside Netflix, Amazon and anyone else in the market”.Media companies have been consolidating as they look to fend off the power of Netflix and Amazon, which have lured people away from traditional television to streaming.Mr Iger said the launch of its streaming service, which analysts have dubbed “Disneyflix”, will come late next year and is the “biggest priority of the company”.* In the first earnings report since winning a high-stakes battle with Comcast to buy 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, Disney reported net income of $2.9bn, or $1.87 a share on an adjusted basis. This was a 23 per cent rise in profits from a year earlier; however, it missed Wall Street estimates for $1.95 a share. It has been a brighter than expected summer for the cinema in the US, bolstering film studio results. Disney’s studio entertainment business increased revenues 20 per cent to $2.9bn, thanks to hits including Avengers: Infinity War, which has taken $2bn in ticket sales globally, making it highest-grossing film of the year and the fourth-highest grossing film on record.These successes were offset by higher costs, however. Disney spent $11.3bn in the quarter, an 8 per cent rise from a year ago, and profits declined at its largest business unit, its television networks, which include channels such as ESPN and ABC. Revenues in the unit rose 5 per cent to $6.2bn, but operating income fell 1 per cent to $1.8bn. Disney blamed the decline on “higher content and marketing costs” for its sports streaming service. Disney’s revenue overall rose 7 per cent to $15.2bn in the three months ending in June. Analysts had forecast $15.3bn. During an investor call, Mr Iger laid out his plans for the Disney streaming service, saying that “we’re going to walk before we run” in terms of how many shows it would offer. The service’s price will “reflect a lower volume of product” compared with Netflix, he added. The Fox television and film assets are crucial to Disney’s ambition to compete with Netflix. The acquisition adds the Fox film studio and cable channels including National Geographic to Disney’s own prize assets such as Marvel and Pixar. Disney and Fox shareholders, and the US Department of Justice, have already approved the $71bn proposed merger. Disney is awaiting regulatory approval in several countries, including China, however. Mr Iger said Disney could offer three streaming services — Hulu, where it will hold a majority stake after the Fox deal, ESPN, and the new Disney service — in a bundle together. By acquiring the Fox assets, Disney will ultimately own 39 per cent of Sky, the European pay-TV company. Fox had offered £14 a share for the rest of Sky, and could increase that offer to battle with Comcast, which has tendered £14.75 a share. Mr Iger on Tuesday declined to comment on the “fluid situation” regarding Sky.*This story has been amended to correct the expected launch date of Disney’s streaming service"
157;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-07T19:05:20Z;Musk tweet recalls Netflix’s social-media disclosure flap;;Tesla founder Elon Musk’s tweet that he was considering taking the electric car company private at $420 a share is unorthodox, but if the interest is legitimate it may not fall foul of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules on proper disclosure.The SEC’s ruminations on social media disclosure dates back to July 2012, when Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, wrote on his personal Facebook page that the streaming service had just enjoyed a record-breaking month. That caused Netflix’s shares to rocket higher once traders cottoned on to the posting.The SEC initially took a dim view of this possible breach of “Regulation Fair Disclosure”, and served Mr Hastings with a notice warning that it would probably bring some kind of action against the Netflix chief. Mr Hastings countered that he had 200,000 subscribers to his Facebook page, so the post should be considered a public disclosure, and pointed out the company had already disclosed it was approaching the 1bn hours of streaming mark.Ultimately, the SEC in April 2013 agreed with Mr Hastings that disclosure over major open social media sites could constitute public disclosure — as long as investors have been alerted to what social media will be used to disseminate the information.“One set of shareholders should not be able to get a jump on other shareholders just because the company is selectively disclosing important information,” George Canellos, then-acting director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement at the time. “Most social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors, but not if the access is restricted or if investors don’t know that’s where they need to turn to get the latest news.”While Mr Hastings and Netflix hadn’t previously disclosed that market-sensitive information might appear on the CEO’s Facebook page, the SEC said that there was enough “uncertainty” around the practice that it decided not to pursue any enforcement action against Mr Hastings.Turning to Mr Musk, the Tesla founder has over 22m followers on Twitter, and given his active presence on the social media site — and proclivity to tweet out potentially market-sensitive information — the car company could have a good case to argue that a tweet does not fall foul of RegFD.
158;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-03T17:24:44Z;Silicon Valley: Big Tech prepares for its second act;An investment boom helped several companies achieve huge growth, but incursions on rivals’ core businesses are inevitable in the race to $2tn;"There could hardly be a starker contrast in stock market fortunes. Apple’s shares have perked up this week after a strong earnings report, making it the first company to be worth $1tn. One week earlier, Facebook’s stock plummeted on a downbeat forecast, wiping nearly $120bn from its worth in Wall Street’s eyes — the biggest one-day destruction of value ever for a US company.The dramatic headlines were partly a reminder of the outsized impact the tech giants have on the wider investment world. Facebook’s reversal reflected the kind of change in perception that often happens when high-growth companies enter a more uncertain period — it is only the company’s sheer size, its stock market value is still above $500bn, that made the effect so startling. The bigger they come, the harder they fall.But the diverging stock market fortunes have highlighted deeper questions. The biggest tech companies have risen together to lead Wall Street inexorably higher over the past five years. So has something fundamental changed? And will their next phase of growth be different from what came before?From one perspective, it would be a mistake to read too much into the apparent decoupling of the so-called “Faang” stocks— a grouping of tech giants that also includes Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent, Alphabet. (Many investors throw in Microsoft for good measure .) The designation has been a handy way to sum up a popular theme of stock market investing, but it has yoked together a group of dissimilar companies in a number of markets and at different stages in their development.Yet there are still important similarities. They have all risen together on the same technology tides. The smartphone boom has turned the iPhone into a business with annual sales of roughly $150bn, while supplying Google and Facebook with a way of reaching users that now generates more than half of their advertising. And while Amazon does not reveal details, eMarketer estimates that digital retailers worldwide generate nearly 60 per cent of ecommerce revenue from mobile devices.Some parts of the mobile market are reaching maturity — for instance, in hardware. If Apple can produce another round of strong growth, it won’t just be because “they’re the leader in the smartphone business and smartphones are taking over communications — that’s done,” says Walter Price, a portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors in San Francisco. The tech giants need new tricks, he adds.“The industry is evolving,” says Jim Tierney, a growth investor at AllianceBernstein. “If you stand still trying to defend your monopoly, you’re probably going to get run over.”The core businesses for which they are best known still loom large. Google looks to search advertising for about 70 per cent of its revenues, the iPhone contributed 62 per cent of Apple’s sales last year, and online sales still account for 51 per cent of Amazon’s revenues. But their significance is waning.“The growth rates are going to continue to decline on a secular basis,” says Mr Price. “What we’re seeing is the limits to growth for all these companies. The question is, do they have another chapter?”That has left Wall Street searching for clues about how big these second acts might be, what they will do to the profit-earning potential of some of history’s most successful businesses, and which of the big tech players are best positioned to benefit.It also raises the possibility of a new era of direct competition between what some analysts regard as monopolistic businesses — though that looks set to take longer to develop than the world’s competition regulators might like.One message from the stock market divergence of Facebook and Apple in the past week has been the heightened risks — and potential rewards — that come with a period of raised capital spending and R&D.Apple, for one, is starting to see past investment pay off, contributing to its $1tn valuation. Two years ago, when it began to talk more openly with investors about the growth potential in its services business, many on Wall Street saw the move little more than an attempt to divert attention from an iPhone slowdown.But in the latest quarter, services like the App Store and selling music subscriptions brought in 17 per cent of revenues and grew by 31 per cent. And Wall Street now sees this as one of the key sources of growth for Apple.Facebook, by contrast, is stuck at an earlier stage, facing higher costs without yet being able to convince investors of the returns that will follow.“It’s probably where Google was five years ago,” says Mr Tierney, referring to a period when the stock market soured on the search company’s sharply rising spending. For investors staying with Facebook, he adds: “You have to take a leap of faith.”Wall Street is divided over how much of Facebook’s “investment” is really about shoring up its core service after recent data scandals, for instance by hiring 20,000 people to moderate content. It is “in between waves of growth” as it both fixes and extends its platform, says Mr Price. The question is how strongly it will emerge when this period of retooling is over.The move into new markets is also set to have significant and diverging effects on the groups’ profit profiles. Amazon, for instance, is seeing a profit revival as it diversifies. Almost anything new the company does “is going to be additive to their margin”, given the relative lack of profitability in the traditional ecommerce arm, says Mr Tierney.Amazon has been moving into more profitable areas such as third-party sales — taking a 15 per cent cut for selling products for other companies — and cloud computing, where it produces a strong 27 per cent operating margin.The effects are already apparent. Its operating profit margin reached 5.6 per cent in the latest quarter, eclipsing Wall Street’s forecast of 3.2 per cent and its highest level in more than a decade.That is helping to generate cash for investment in new markets. If Amazon was a widely feared competitor during its years as a margin-destroying online retailer, imagine how much more frightening it is set to become as it ploughs surplus cash from its new services back into growth.The potential for greater competition has complicated the outlook. After earlier attempts to invade each others’ turf — like Google’s failed efforts to break into social networking — the big tech companies have generally been content to stay away from each other’s core markets. But, according to Mary Meeker, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and former Wall Street analyst, that is set to change as they are forced to find new sources of growth.“Their core product road maps, their conceptual strategic plans, are very different,” says Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and longstanding tech industry observer. But that is still leading inevitably to creeping competition as they start to compete more for the same users’ attention, he adds.More direct forms of competition are emerging. Amazon has been pushing brands to spend more on ads to get their products at the top of the search results on its site, in a direct challenge to Google. Sellers say they have little choice but to do so as the volume of items sold on Amazon balloons. And for big brands that are scrutinising how their marketing expenditure converts into actual sales, Amazon provides hard evidence of a return on investment.“When people search on Amazon for products, it works,” says Colin Kinsella, chief executive for North America at Havas Media.Yet even this is likely to have little impact on the balance of power, given the sheer scale of the digital advertising businesses that Google and Facebook have already built. Amazon’s advertising revenues will reach $25bn in 2020, estimates Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. That is sizeable, but is still projected to leave it a distant third.Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, says investors are making “too much” of this apparent competition between digital rivals. Facebook might look like it is treading on the toes of Google-owned YouTube and Netflix with its investments in video content, but it is really seeking a slice of advertisers’ TV budgets. Along with Google, he adds, “they are going to feed off the carcasses of legacy media for years to come.”Observers believe the same could be true of the secular shift to cloud computing. Business worth only around $50bn of the $1tn IT sector has moved
to the cloud, estimates Mr Price. Google and Microsoft may be in hot pursuit of cloud leader Amazon Web Services, but their main rival is the on-premises technology sold by traditional IT suppliers.None of this means that another sustained period of growth is pre-ordained. There are clear external risks. Asked about the biggest threat, most investors point to potential action from regulators. Silicon Valley’s unshakeable belief in the ability of disruptive start-ups to find ways around established tech companies also remains intact, says Mike Volpi, a partner at Index Ventures.The move into new markets hints at a next phase in the rise of Big Tech. The question about which would be the first to get to $1tn has been settled. The race to $2tn has barely begun."
159;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-03T16:53:05Z;Fortunes of the Faangs begin to diverge;How tech giants differ in their audience reach, growth prospects and weaknesses;The Fang complex was popularised in 2013 by Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money.It has since proven an irresistible catch-all for fast-growing technology companies. (Apple later joined the club.)Their fortunes have diverged this year, however, with Facebook plunging in value just before Apple became the first company to achieve a trillion-dollar market value.But the companies have always had significant differences in users, profitability and business mix.
160;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-01T17:25:07Z;Faangs’ growing pains should not cause alarm;Pressures are mounting, but big tech business models remain sound;"The Faangs are dead; long live the Faangs. The latest earnings season from the US technology kings — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google — has been an uncharacteristic rollercoaster ride. Varying outlooks have been met by sharply contrasting market reactions. Share price falls after disappointments from Netflix, Facebook and the smaller Twitter, have left the broader Fang+ index of technology companies down almost 10 per cent from its June high, despite strong results from Apple.For the wider market and economy, this is a big deal. The Faangs account for about one-eighth of the S&P 500 index’s total value but, says Bespoke Investment, they have provided half the market’s growth this year. Buying into them has been the most popular trade among money managers for months — forcing passive funds to do likewise as their weighting in the index has increased. Some funds are rueing tech punts they chose or had to take.This reliance on one narrow segment for so much of the market’s growth is unhealthy; tech’s share of the wider index is now the highest since the dotcom boom. But that era featured too many flimsy companies with no profits reaching wildly inflated valuations based on hope and hot air. Today’s tech leaders have viable models and real earnings. Even Netflix, by far the smallest Faang, made net income of $1bn from revenues approaching $14bn in the past four quarters.This earnings round has, however, highlighted important differences in business models. The market needs to differentiate more between companies viewed for too long as a uniform group. Coupled with a potential rotation from growth into value stocks, that could mean more volatility. Investors should draw three lessons from recent weeks.First, the Faangs are unusual in becoming corporate titans while maintaining growth rates more akin to start-ups. This headlong expansion cannot be maintained forever. But managing down expectations is tricky. High-growth companies get punished when they disappoint — and even small downgrades to future growth at such big companies can erase a lot of value.Second, concerns that core businesses are maturing are justified. Google still depends too much on search-linked advertising (70 per cent of revenues) and Apple on iPhones (56 per cent this quarter). Competition between tech groups may squeeze margins as they seek growth in part by moving into each other’s markets.But on current evidence the mature businesses remain strong, while the latest tech leaders are doing better at diversifying and reinventing themselves than some predecessors did. Apple’s services division, including its App Store and music streaming, now accounts for a fifth of its business. Cloud computing is opening new growth for Amazon and Microsoft.Thirdly, regulatory risks are increasing, and difficult to price — but were not directly responsible for recent earnings disappointments. Google has largely shrugged off its €4.3bn antitrust fine from the EU. Facebook blamed its disappointing outlook not on the scandal over its data leak to Cambridge Analytica but on introduction of a new advertising format and giving users more control over privacy.Social media groups, battling to maintain user growth and engagement amid concerns over data security and “fake news”, may face bigger issues than other technology rivals. Yet while the tech correction may have a little further to run, the biggest takeaway from the Faangs’ latest results is that their businesses remain, fundamentally, in pretty good shape."
161;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-08-01T04:00:49Z;Stakes are high for passive funds after Faang sell-off;It is not clear where index providers will find buyers for their over-weighted holdings;If value investors have been on the rack in recent times, their experience has stemmed, at least in part, from inadequate exposure to Faang stocks — the fabled Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google/Alphabet. Since last Thursday’s spectacular $120bn fall in Facebook’s market capitalisation we have witnessed a great tech sell-off that may point to a watershed in the value versus passive investment saga. Yet by now, as in the tech bubble of the late 1990s, many value investors (who buy stocks that they think are undervalued) have thrown in the towel and bought into the Faangs. So is this a rerun of the dot.com story?Yes and no. Certainly a tired bull market has increasingly been driven by an ever shrinking pool of tech stocks, which bears some similarity to events at the turn of the millennium. It is also true that many fund managers with a value focus have again felt obliged to switch to a momentum approach to hang on to footloose clients. And, as in the late 1990s, indexed funds have been forced buyers of overpriced tech stocks. In indices weighted according to market value, net inflows into passive portfolios result in the share of overvalued stocks in the index increasing in a rising market and potentially declining in a falling one.Yet the Faang phenomenon is very different from the dot.com equivalent, which was accompanied by a great deal of dross — a welter of companies with no earnings, puffed by unscrupulous, conflicted analysts and prone to collapse at the first gust in a market squall. Today’s tech boom is powered by big companies with strong revenue streams and, in the main, credible business models.Their resilience is exemplified by the financial dynamics of Google’s battle with the European Commission over abuse of its market power in mobile operating systems. Alphabet, Google’s parent, confronts a $4.3bn fine with cash and marketable securities in its balance sheet of $102bn, net income at the half year of $12.6bn and a tax charge of just 14.6 per cent of pre-tax income.Also striking is how the forced buying effect is immeasurably greater this time because of the growth of both indexed mutual funds and exchange traded funds, According to the Bank for International Settlements passive funds managed about $8tn, or 20 per cent of global investment fund assets, as of June 2017, up from 8 per cent a decade earlier.This growth was at the expense of active investors who experienced outflows over the same decade. At the same time ETFs outpaced indexed mutual funds, accounting for 40 per cent of passive fund assets in June 2017 compared with about 30 per cent in 2007. And now the ETF universe is being expanded by the addition of smart beta ETFs whereby indices are adjusted to reflect a particular style of investment such as tech, growth, low volatility and so forth.A stock added to an index or smart beta fund amounts to an artificial form of increased popularityThe increased size of this passive investment industry means an underlying conflict of interest has become more intense. ETF managers operate a low-cost, low-fees business model which means they seek scale. Having Facebook or Apple in an ETF helps it achieve this. So many smart beta ETFs are biased towards the largest-capitalisation, highly liquid tech stocks. It is hard to believe that this does not result in distorted market prices. Inter alia, the growth of passive investing must lead to greater correlation of indexed securities and a reduction in company-specific information contained in stock prices.Howard Marks, co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, the US alternative investment manager, argues that for a stock to be added to an index or smart beta fund amounts to an artificial form of increased popularity and it is relative popularity that determines the relative prices of stocks in the short run.As with tech stocks in 2000, he says, the seeming perpetual motion machine created by all this forced buying by passive investors is unlikely to work forever: if funds ever flow out of equities and thus ETFs, what has been disproportionately bought will have to be disproportionately sold. And, Mr Marks adds, it is not clear where index funds and ETFs will find buyers for their over-weighted, highly appreciated holdings if they have to sell in a crunch. So appreciation that was driven by passive buying is likely eventually to turn out to be rotational, not perpetual.An important difference with 2000 concerns concentration risk and liquidity. The Faangs account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 index and 27 per cent of the Nasdaq 100 index. So investors in ETFs should not assume they are safely diversified. And the ETFs’ apparent promise of liquidity, especially in bond markets, has yet to be tested in a downturn. The stakes are much higher than in the dot.com era.john.plender@ft.com
162;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Tech tumbles test conviction trades of hedge funds;Many prominent stockpickers have made big positions in Facebook and Netflix;The tumble in Facebook and Netflix shares in July presents a test of what has been one of the strongest conviction trades of some of the world’s best-known stockpickers.Closely watched investors including David Tepper, Dan Loeb and a group of the largest so-called “Tiger Cub” funds made Facebook one of the biggest positions in their portfolios.Viking Global Investors, a $25bn fund founded by Andreas Halvorsen, held a stake in Facebook worth $1.49bn — the fund’s single biggest position — while David Tepper’s Appaloosa held 10.2 per cent of its long US equity portfolio in Facebook, the fund’s second-largest position worth $992m at the end of the first quarter, according to the latest US regulatory filings.Both funds added significantly to their positions after the collapse in Facebook’s value following the Cambridge Analytica controversy in March.While it is not yet public whether these funds have added to or reduced their positions since the first quarter, their concentrated bets came as an increasing number of closely followed bottom-up stockpickers argue that fast-growing tech companies are actually undervalued by the market despite trading at optically high valuation multiples.Dan Loeb, whose Third Point held Facebook and Netflix as its fifth and seventh largest holdings, commented in his fund’s letter to clients last month that “growth is where the value is”, and that Third Point was “moving from purely an event-driven, value-based universe of stocks to include ‘compounders’ and, increasingly, what are classically considered ‘growth’ stocks”.However, Facebook shares have lost 22 per cent since warning investors last week of slowing sales and user growth. Meanwhile, Netflix stock has tumbled 17 per cent since the video streaming company disclosed last month that it had added 1m fewer subscribers in the second quarter than forecast.Despite the weakness in both stocks in July, Facebook shares have climbed almost 50 per cent since the start of last year while Netflix stock has surged 180 per cent in the same period. By comparison, the S&P 500 has climbed 25 per cent.“We are happy owning these stocks for longer periods at higher multiples and absorbing the inevitable volatility, particularly in this late-cycle environment,” Mr Loeb said in his letter to clients. “We have also discussed with investors the insight that stocks with unprecedented growth rates have defensible valuations when one extends earnings out two to three years.”Several other prominent Tiger Cub funds, known as such because they trained at Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management hedge fund in the 1990s, have made outsized bets on Facebook, according to their latest filings. These include Lone Pine, which had Facebook as its biggest holding.Stanley Druckenmiller, who rose to prominence as the deputy to George Soros, was rare among his peers in dumping his entire Facebook position over the first quarter, with the stock previously having made up 9.6 per cent of the long US equity portfolio of his Duquesne family office.Viking Global, Appaloosa, Third Point and Lone Pine all declined to comment.
163;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-30T20:56:42Z;MoviePass woes prompt further plunge in owner’s shares;Future of Helios & Matheson’s film ticketing service in doubt due to cash crunch;Shares in MoviePass owner Helios & Matheson plunged again on Monday as investors and customers of the unlimited-cinema ticketing service fretted that its survival might have become “Mission: Impossible”.Users of the MoviePass app reported later on Monday that ticketing services were unavailable for most movie theatres that rely on its pre-paid debit cards. Instead of the usual list of films and showtimes, cinemas belonging to big chains such as AMC showed only a message saying “no more screenings” on MoviePass’ app. Some e-tickets still appeared to be available at partners such as Landmark Cinemas.Helios & Matheson was forced to take out an emergency $6.2m loan on Friday after becoming unable to pay the merchant processors that allow customers to buy tickets, causing a service outage on Thursday. Customers were further angered over the weekend by restrictions on certain showings of Mission: Impossible — Fallout, as well as other purchases attempted using its pre-paid debit cards. MoviePass apologised on Saturday for what it claimed was a “technical issue” with ticketing, just a day after insisting it had “resolved the issues with card check-ins”. Complaints continued to flood in to its customer support account on Twitter on Sunday. Helios & Matheson shares closed 60 per cent lower on Monday at 80 cents. That level puts the stock at risk of delisting from Nasdaq unless it is able to sustain its price above $1.Concerns have been gathering for months about the sustainability of MoviePass’s business model. Founded in 2011 to bring a Netflix-style “all you can eat” model to US cinema-going, it enjoyed a surge in subscriptions last year when it cut its monthly price to $10 — less than a single movie ticket in many big cities. Its more than 3m subscribers can buy tickets in two ways: in person, using a pre-paid debit card that MoviePass must top up with the full box office price for each purchase, and via e-ticketing in its app, through partnerships with a limited number of smaller cinema chains. Customers who use their pre-paid debit card more than twice a month cost MoviePass far more than they when pay in subscriptions, causing its losses to mount. In May, Helios & Matheson said its average monthly cash deficit had been about $21.7m since September, with $43.4m in available cash and deposits at that time. To reduce its cash burn, MoviePass has introduced a growing number of restrictions on usage in recent weeks. These include limiting users to one movie a day, preventing them from watching the same film more than once, and “peak pricing” that adds an extra fee for popular new movies. This weekend it added a blackout on Paramount and Skydance’s latest offering in the Mission: Impossible series unless customers went to cinemas that supported its e-ticketing service. The film took more than $150m at the global box office in its opening weekend, making it Mr Cruise’s biggest hit in more than a decade. “As we continue to evolve the service, certain movies may not always be available in every theatre on our platform,” MoviePass said in a statement to customers on Friday. “MoviePass’s mission is to make moviegoing accessible to everyone and to enhance the power of discovery — but we need your support as we refine our model for the long-haul.” Helios & Matheson has been looking to lenders as well as customers for that support. Friday’s loan, which raised $5m, followed one of $6.8m two weeks ago. On July 23, its directors approved a reverse stock split giving investors one share for 250 older ones. That could allow the company to raise money by issuing more shares, although such a move would heavily dilute existing equity investors. Industry observers are now predicting MoviePass’s demise. “Basically, if you are @moviepass subscriber, time to get your moneys worth the next few weeks,” Peter Pham, a Los Angeles based venture capital investor, wrote on Twitter after the latest restrictions were brought in. “It probably won’t be around much longer.”MoviePass representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A warning last week from Facebook — the F in the Faang acronym — of slowing user and advertising sales growth prompted a brutal sell-off in shares of social network.By Monday in New York, the selling was spreading throughout the tech sector, weighing heavily on some benchmark indices.“These companies have defied gravity for multiple years and they are starting to come back to earth,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations.The technology sector of the S&P 500 has lost more than 5 per cent since Facebook reported its earnings on July 25, destroying $280bn of market value. Facebook accounted for about $125bn of that loss.The NYSE Fang+ index, which includes a broader group than the original Faang stocks, declined as much as 3.7 per cent on Wall Street. Monday’s fall left it down more than 10 per cent from the intraday high that it hit on June 21, meeting the typical definition of a correction. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed down 1.4 per cent after an abrupt slide on Monday after starting the day barely changed.Among casualties on Monday were Netflix, closing down 5.7 per cent, Google parent Alphabet, which was 1.5 per cent lower, while Facebook was down 2.2 per cent.If [Apple] miss, the selling pressure could continue, but I am not sure if they have a great quarter, it will alter the situation positivelyEarnings this week from Apple and Tesla is likely to shape whether the selling deepens or the declines begins to draw buyers. Apple, off by 0.6 per cent on Monday, reports on Tuesday while earnings from Tesla, down 2.4 per cent, are slated for Wednesday.“It is true to the downside,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “If they [Apple] miss, the selling pressure could continue, but I am not sure if they have a great quarter, it will alter the situation positively.”Mr Arone added that investors are trying to evaluate what the future growth rate for tech companies is and do those growth rates still justify share prices.Monday’s pullback knocked Invesco’s QQQ, the biggest technology-focused exchange-traded fund, down 1.4 per centThe “skew” on QQQ, which measures demand for downside puts versus upside calls, last week hit a record high in another sign of investor nervousness, said Mandy Xu, chief equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse.“It tells you people were buying hedging protection into and after some of the big earnings,” she said.Big tech has been a popular trade with the shares broadly held among money managers.“These are crowded trades, with long-only and hedge funds having fallen in love with the sector as well as with the ‘Faangs’, in particular, so we expect that the drop in the sector and the significant drop in certain components will impact July performance for active managers,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.Following the recent sell-off, some analysts speculated about the potential for a rotation that favours “value” investing — a term used to describe a styles of investing that involves buying stocks because they are cheap compared with their fundamentals — as opposed to growth style that refers to a strategy that favours companies that can show a path to grow.Steven DeSanctis, analyst at Jefferies, thinks with two of five Faang stocks posting disappointing results, along with some others so-called high-growth stocks, “the shift from growth to value is upon us”.

Monday’s fall left it down 10.5 per cent from the intraday high that it hit on June 21, fulfilling the typical definition of a correction.Investors keep close tabs on the so-called Faang stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet — because they have posted big gains over the past few years and helped to power the broader market higher.However, two of them have hit major stumbling blocks during this year’s earnings season. Facebook plummeted by almost a fifth after it warned of slower revenue growth during the second half of this year. Meanwhile, Netflix has declined about 20 per cent from the highs it hit in late June after its subscriber growth figures missed forecasts.Steven DeSanctis, analyst at Jefferies, said with two of five Faang stocks posting disappointing results, along with some others so-called high-growth stocks, he thinks “the shift from growth to value is upon us”.Following the recent sell-off, some analysts are asking whether we are seeing a rotation that favours “value” investing — a term used to describe a styles of investing that involves buying stocks because they are cheap compared with their fundamentals — as opposed to growth style that refers to a strategy that favours companies that can show a path to increasing revenues and earnings.NYSE’s Faang+ index also includes other big tech-focused stocks that have sustained heavy selling this month. Tesla, for instance, is down 15.9 per cent in July, while Twitter has shed more than 26 per cent.On Monday, Facebook fell more than 3 per cent to $169.24, while Netflix declined nearly 4 per cent to $341.66, Google-parent Alphabet was down 1.3 per cent to $1,221.87, Amazon drifted lower by about 0.6 per cent to $1,806. 79. Twitter shares were off by more than 5 per cent to $32.35.Apple, which is due to release its results after the market close on Tuesday, were off by about 0.6 per cent.Monday’s pullback knocked Invesco’s QQQ, the biggest technology-focused exchange-traded fund, down 1.2 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index 1 per cent lower.
166;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-27T14:51:54Z;Move over Faangs, make way for Maga;And then there were four . . . Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon are taking the market higher;Wall Street loves Maga. And that doesn’t just refer to the tax-cutting, deregulating, market-boosting Make America Great Again agenda from the Trump White House.There is another Maga now causing stock market palpitations. It describes the ever-narrower group of Big Tech companies leading the market higher: Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon.A previous group of techies feted on Wall Street — the Faangs — was already looking decidedly long in the tooth, even before this week’s Facebook flop.Consider the “N”: Netflix. The video streaming service is still riding high, despite losing some of its mojo with a shortfall in subscriber growth last quarter. But these days Netflix hardly deserves to be wrapped into the same acronym as the other tech leaders: Microsoft has added $280bn of stock market value in the last year alone, almost double Netflix’s entire market cap.Now the “F” has fizzled. Facebook’s epic slump, on the back of downbeat forecasts for growth and profit margins, has knocked its value down to a mere half-trillion dollars.Some have rushed to construct an appealing retribution narrative around this: mess with democracy, and a reckoning will surely follow. Alas, life isn’t so simple or punishment so swift. The huge leak of data to Cambridge Analytica and exploitation of the network by Russians out to influence the US presidential election didn’t figure in Facebook’s explanation for the slowdown.It has also been tempting to see Facebook’s slip as a sign that Big Tech’s days of go-go growth are coming to an inevitable end.Digital now accounts for 40 per cent of the total advertising market: some predict that it will become increasingly hard to continue lifting that share, particularly given the resiliency of TV ads (which account for another 32 per cent, according to Zenith). Star internet analyst-turned-investor Mary Meeker warned recently that Big Tech companies will increasingly have to fight each other for what growth they can find: Amazon is moving into advertising, matching a counter-move by Google into ecommerce.Certainly, trees don’t grow to the sky. But the new digital markets still have plenty of high-growth opportunities even for companies of this size — not least cloud computing, which is quickly becoming a major rocket propellant for Amazon, Microsoft and Google (and one of the main forces behind Maga).It takes constant reinvention to keep a seat at tech’s top table. This is something Facebook has shown itself adept at before, from its purchase of Instagram (which some think will eventually take over as its main money earner) to its reinvention as a mobile-first service (a process that was accompanied by a year-long slump in its stock as Wall Street worried about the shift).Now comes another stage in the overhaul. Facebook is trying to coax users into more “meaningful social interactions” in their newsfeeds, while at the same time nudging them to spend more time with “stories”, or collections of photos.It’s hard to anticipate how transitions like this will affect the way people use the service and how advertisers will respond. Their timing doesn’t always line up perfectly with the kind of steady quarterly growth rates and margin stability that the stock market loves.So, for now, Facebook has slipped and Maga rules. Its stumble is a reminder of the increasingly narrow leadership on which the market depends, and just how much is at stake when high expectations don’t pan out.richard.waters@ft.com
167;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-27T04:00:34Z;Faangs take diverging paths as investors rethink prospects;Facebook’s tumble is a reminder the hot tech stocks each have different business models;"Buying the collection of high-growth US technology behemoths known as the Faangs has been a simple route to outsized investment returns in recent years.Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet — collectively known by the acronym Faangs — have shaken off occasional public relations problems and growth scares to hit record high after record high.But the latest round of earnings reports for the group has made this winning trade look more complex.“It is a wake-up call,” said Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, which advises funds on tech investments. “You cannot blindly buy these stocks.”Contrasting fortunes in the second quarter have served as a reminder that, while often bunched together by investors, they operate different businesses. That raises questions about whether their performance may diverge in the future.Certainly in the short term the shares can do wildly different things, in response to idiosyncratic pressures. Facebook lost more than $120bn in value on Thursday by warning of slowing user and advertising-sales growth. Earlier this year, it lost almost as much market capitalisation over a few days when concerns emerged over its ability to protect users’ privacy.Shares in Netflix fell last week when its quarterly earnings revealed disappointing viewer growth. By contrast, Amazon beat Wall Street profit estimates by a wide margin and traded up, while Alphabet this week shrugged off a record fine from the EU as investors focused on growth and profits. Apple reports earnings on Tuesday.“On the whole, [Faangs] may be classified in the same economic sector, but they are very different businesses subject to different risks and executing at different levels,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth Management. “Why would you expect them all to behave the same way at the same time?”Tech stocks have seemed to promise relentless growth, based on the over-arching trend of a digital revolution across society, making them different from other stocks whose growth can depend on the ebbs and flows of the underlying economy, or the political vagaries in Washington that cause investors to fret.As for the Faangs, the very biggest of the big tech stocks, “they have huge valuations for a reason”, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek. “A small number of people have built huge franchises.”With the exception of Netflix, the Faangs have market values topping $500bn and Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are approaching the $1tn mark.“People are captivated by them because they are all . . . huge and still growing fast, and that doesn’t come together often,” said George Pearkes, a strategist at Bespoke Investment Group. “Even with the deceleration, Facebook’s growth is still better than almost any other major company.”For Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, the Faangs dominate the main ways consumers use the internet. Google for maps, search and video; Amazon for shopping; Apple for mobile devices; Netflix for entertainment; and Facebook for social media.“They are powerful in the verticals of the internet, but they are different verticals,” he said. “While, yes, they are all benefiting from what we would call the digital revolution, they are different and the challenges are different.”Valuation-wise it is interesting now. There are still some clouds on the horizon“The Faangs” is a catchy label, really nothing more than that, but the point is that it is catchy. “Just because somebody chose a cute name, it doesn’t mean anything,” Mr Colas said, but he added that it was also one of the reasons why the companies were popular. “Maybe too popular,” he said.Many fund managers have long worried that the rush into the big tech companies of the US and China has become a “crowded trade”, in other words over-extended and vulnerable to a sharp reversal. Investors surveyed by Bank of America voted it the most crowded bet in markets for the sixth consecutive month in July, and by the greatest margin of any crowded trade since December 2015.More than $20bn has flowed into dedicated technology funds this year, smashing past the full-year, record-breaking inflows of 2017.The rise of passive investing has increased correlations among Faangs in recent years, as it has for stocks in general. Meanwhile, so-called momentum investing, where traders and investors buy assets that are rising, has also fuelled the Faang trade, investors said.The NYSE Fang+ index, which includes the Faangs and other companies that have enjoyed explosive growth to become household-name brands since the turn of the millennium, has handily beat the broader US stock market in recent years. It also includes Tesla, chipmaker Nvidia, and China’s Baidu and Alibaba. The index has risen about 200 per cent since the start of 2015 versus close to 40 per cent for the S&P 500.Many actively managed equity funds have also piled in enthusiastically. For example, Fidelity’s $129bn Contrafund, led by famed stockpicker William Danoff, held a $9.3bn stake in Facebook at the end of May, according to filings, while Capital Group’s $198bn Growth Fund of America held a $7bn stake at the end of June.Leading up to Wednesday’s earnings, 44 of the 52 analysts that track Facebook rated its stock as a “buy”, while only two were neutral and two rated its shares as a “sell”. On average they had a 12-month price target of $229.53. After the earnings, analysts had pruned the average price target to $209.50, a downgrade but still well above their beaten-up level of $176.26 at the close of Thursday’s brutal trading day.“Valuation-wise it is interesting now,” said Marco Pirondini, head of US equities at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management. “There are still some clouds on the horizon,” he pointed out, but Facebook — and many of its other Big Tech peers — remain enviably profitable and still enjoy robust growth outlooks.“Technology stocks have performed very well, and are in need of a correction,” Mr Pirondini added, “but these are still real winners with strong business models”.FACEBOOKRevenue: $13.2bn (up 42%); Net income: $5.1bn (up 31%)The news: The social network warned of slowing user and sales growth, shocking investors into rethinking the company’s financial prospects amid wider concerns over data privacy.

168;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-25T16:01:51Z;ITV: fly me to the moon;The UK commercial broadcaster must remain grounded under Carolyn McCall;The silvery orb that crosses the sky each night means different things to different folks. When full, it hints at romance to some and madness to others. In television it signals prime time viewing hours. Given the advertising potential, ITV, the UK’s leading commercial broadcaster, should care a lot about this time of day.But the axis upon which television’s world spins has shifted. Netflix and Amazon Prime look set to eclipse old-fashioned linear broadcasters. ITV’s newish chief executive Carolyn McCall believes she must address this threat by taking the network beyond television. This sounds too much like ITV’s previous strategy.ITV’s latest trajectory was mapped with half-year results on Wednesday. Earnings fell a little less than expected thanks to a good performance from ITV Studios, the group’s production arm. But as with a “reality” TV show, all is not quite as it appears. The figures from ITV Studios were flattered by earlier than expected booking of revenues. That “phasing” added to income this half, but will take it away in the next period. Markets were hardly moonstruck. ITV’s share price rose only a little.That will disappoint long-suffering shareholders. ITV shares are bumping along at around 9 times forward earnings, a five-year nadir. And this for the leading commercial free-to-air television station in the UK. Advertisers have no other place to go to reach such a wide audience. ITV’s share of viewers across all channels rose 9 per cent year on year. But the stock is a lot less popular than the shows.The real theatrics are yet to come. ITV wants to create a mini-Netflix of purely British drama and comedy. Dame Carolyn sees a gap in the market, and ITV will happily rush to fill it. ITV hopes the venture will become another prime channel with the extra benefit of monthly subscription fees. ITV would struggle to take on Netflix, which reportedly could spend $13bn this year on content. Although the announced investment is only £60m, the broadcaster would have to spend many multiples of this amount. ITV’s total spend on all its programming is over £1bn per year.In her defence, Dame Carolyn has a habit of taking strategy flyers that work out well — she anticipated customer needs shrewdly at easyJet. But ITV will be out of its league in online broadcasting. Low-cost flights to Europe were one thing. Moon shots are another.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button “Add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page above the headline.
169;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-24T21:06:06Z;AT&T shares slip as revenue falls short of expectations;Media group under pressure following $80bn Time Warner takeover;AT&T executives have promised to ramp up investment in HBO as the company looks to build out a television, film and mobile communications behemoth. After AT&T’s first financial report since winning legal approval for the deal, chief executive Randall Stephenson reflected on the long path to its $80bn takeover of Time Warner as consolidation sweeps the media business. “We could not be happier that we moved first,” he told analysts on a call after quarterly earnings. “When you move first, you rarely regret it as you see the industry trend happen.”John Stankey, an AT&T veteran who is now overseeing WarnerMedia, the rebranded unit of Time Warner, looked to assure investors over the future of HBO. Referring to reports that he had urged employees at a town hall to add more HBO subscribers, Mr Stankey said the comments did not “characterise what we are about”.On Tuesday he vowed to “greenlight additional projects” that Time Warner previously could not afford, but declined to say how much more money would be poured into HBO. He said AT&T would reinvest a “responsible amount” of an estimated annual $2.5bn in merger “synergies” into HBO projects. HBO spends about $2bn a year into content, but is competing with the deep pockets of Netflix, which spent $8bn on content last year, and Amazon. This year, Netflix programmes for the first time drew more nominations for Emmy awards than HBO, underscoring its disruption in Hollywood. AT&T shares slipped more than 1 per cent in after-hours trading, as the company unveiled weaker-than-forecast sales for the second quarter.Revenues for the three months ending in June fell 2.1 per cent to $39bn, undershooting analyst estimates. However AT&T eclipsed profits expectations — the company reported adjusted earnings of 91 cents a share, up from 79 cents a year ago, and beating forecasts for 86 cents. Including debt absorbed from Time Warner, AT&T said it now had $180.4bn in net debt.AT&T is looking to offset the pressures on its core wireless and video businesses, as the media industry contemplates a future beyond traditional television. AT&T lost 262,000 traditional television customers in the quarter, which was offset by new subscribers to its streaming service, DirectTV Now. In its core wireless business, AT&T added 46,000 postpaid, or recurring, phone subscribers in the quarter. During the two years of tying up the AT&T-Time Warner merger, the media industry has changed rapidly. As technology and the rise of Netflix has overhauled how people watch TV and film, media companies have responded with sweeping consolidation. Comcast last week bowed out of a bidding war for Fox’s entertainment assets, leaving the path clear for Disney to gobble up Rupert Murdoch’s crown jewels. “We expected sometime back, [in 2016] that this would happen, that you would see media companies consolidate,” said Mr Stephenson. “We’re now a modern media company.”The US Department of Justice had sued to block AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner. Last month a US district judge approved the deal, but the DOJ is still trying to unwind the merger by appealing the court’s decision. Raymond James downgraded its outlook on AT&T this month, citing the appeal as a “negative catalyst”. AT&T shares have fallen by more than 15 per cent this year. 
170;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-22T15:38:07Z;A light shines on the concentration of power in Silicon Valley;Oligopoly is showing itself to be the economic and political challenge of our time;The fines keep getting bigger, and so do the companies. Last week’s whopping €4.3bn antitrust penalty by the EU against Google for abusing its power in the mobile phone market was nearly double what it was charged last year for favouring search results from its shopping service over competitors.In both cases, the core issue was the way in which Google uses the power of its enormous ecosystem — it has about 90 per cent of key EU search markets and its Android software is used in more than 80 per cent of the world’s smartphones — to winnow out competitors.It is appealing the latest decision, and will make technical arguments, with varying degrees of merit, about why it is not a monopoly. But the case also shines an uncomfortable light on the concentration of power in a handful of companies. The oligopoly that has resulted is the economic and political challenge of our time.Research published in the past few years shows that concentration and profit rates have increased across most US industries since the 1990s. Jason Furman, the former head of the Council of Economic Advisors, suggested that this phenomenon hints at barriers to entry in some markets.Academic David Autor has linked the same consolidation to a decrease in labour’s share of the US economy. There is also evidence that a small group of “superstar” companies are pulling way ahead of others, not only in terms of profits but also productivity.In a paper released last month, OECD economists linked the insufficient diffusion of new technologies to weak overall productivity growth. The biggest companies, particularly in the most digitally connected parts of the economy (tech, finance and media), are incredibly productive. Everyone else, not so much. The upshot is that economic growth as a whole has suffered.Researchers are busy digging into the reasons for this centralisation of power. They suggest that the shift from a “tangible” economy, based on physical goods, to one based more on intangibles — namely intellectual property, ideas, and data — has sped up the trend towards concentration.Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google — known collectively as the Faangs — are case studies in how the network effect supports dominant players and allows them to ringfence users and their data. Google’s claim that “competition is only a click away” rings hollow — if for some reason the site went down, we would all be more likely to take a coffee break and wait for it to come back online than seek out a competitor.Another reason for the concentration of corporate power is political capture. Americans invented modern antitrust policy, and love to rail against “statist” old Europe. But a fascinating study by academics Germán Gutiérrez and Thomas Philippon shows that EU markets are, in fact, more competitive. They have lower levels of concentration, lower excess profits, and lower regulatory barriers to entry.The study points to a huge rise in US political lobbying as the key reason that levels of concentration between the two regions have diverged since the 1990s. “European institutions are more independent than their American counterparts, and they enforce pro-competition policies more strongly than any individual country ever did,” it says.It serves as a sharp counterpoint to the argument often used in Silicon Valley that Europeans do not have an internet giant because they simply are not innovative. US tech groups have been using that tired old line in Brussels for years, apparently forgetting that it was a British computer scientist, Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the worldwide web while working at Cern, the European physics research laboratory.Google has lobbied hard in recent months against a proposed change to copyright law in Brussels, and put in eleventh hour emergency calls in advance of the Android ruling.It is to the great credit of EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager that she has not been cowed by such efforts. It will be interesting to see whether American regulators follow her lead.Joseph Simons, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, has pledged “vigorous” antitrust enforcement, including hearings later this year on competition and consumer protection. They would be the first broad policy hearings on the topic since 1995. A Republican lawmaker recently called on the FTC or the Department of Justice to reopen a 2013 case on how Google handles search results — Democrats have been calling for the same for some time.Makan Delrahim, the DoJ head of antitrust, recently told the Financial Times that he believes “data is an important asset”. While he is not opposed in principle to Big Tech’s business models or deal making, he is concerned about abuse of a dominant position. One of his touchstones for anti-competitive behaviour is the late 1990s US v Microsoft case, in which the company was found guilty of using its operating system monopoly to stifle competitors like Netscape a rival browser and software markets.Many critics see echoes of that behaviour in Google today. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic need to grapple with it.rana.foroohar@ft.comWe are moving towards a global plutocracy / From Annalisa Burello, London, UK
171;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-20T11:40:59Z;How I learnt to love the Fangs;I was too negative when writing about Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google years ago;"Netflix used to be a perfectly good horror movie. Company management swings a chainsaw; investors scream and are cut to bits; audience is titillated. Now it has become one of those avant-garde films your pseudo-intellectual friend recommends: no fun to watch, surreal and confusing.Those are the opening lines of a Lex column I edited seven years ago. A bit heavy on metaphor, perhaps, but another third had just been wiped off the value of Netflix in a day. The video streaming company’s shares had collapsed from $45 to $10 in a few months after a subscription price rise hurt subscriber growth. Many on Wall Street saw the credits rolling. (There I go again.)Today Netflix trades at $370 and is one of the triumphs of our age. It is similarly hard to believe that we once worried about Facebook’s missing mobile strategy (shares up 500 per cent over the same period), Amazon’s unprofitability (700 per cent) and Google’s lack of focus (300 per cent). This so-called Fang group (I have omitted Apple) is now worth $2.5tn and dominates four industries.But this week confidence in the Fangs took a swing to the choppers. Amazon endured a technical snafu that marred its Prime Day sale and disrupted video streaming and voice assistants. Sounds innocuous until you consider that its rapidly growing cloud computing business competes on being able to handle massive amounts of traffic.Then Netflix reported lower than forecast second quarter subscriber growth and a less buoyant outlook. Its shares dropped by as much as 14 per cent at one point — their biggest fall in years. Then came the most significant punch of the lot: Google was hit with a record $5bn EU antitrust fine for supposedly using its Android clout to entrench its own apps on mobile phones.Usually investors would be quick to put these setbacks into perspective. Netflix may be beamed into two-thirds of US homes, but it still has the rest of the world to conquer. Google’s fine amounts to just 15 days of revenues — hardly the “taking advantage” President Donald Trump complained about. The Amazon sale was such a roaring success that many reckon the company can beat Apple in the race to be valued at $1tn.Yet there is unease nevertheless. One reason is that the seemingly inexorable rise of the Fangs evokes memories of the dotcom era. Just as in the late 1990s, the technology sector is driving the whole market upward. And within tech, Fang stocks are doing most of the work. In the past two years, they are responsible for a quarter of the gain in the S&P 500 index. Such a narrowing of returns often means a bust is approaching.There is a flaw in this comparison, though. Most dotcom darlings produced neither profits nor free cash flow. In contrast, the average gross margin of the Fang quartet was an eye-watering 55 per cent last year and revenues jumped by a third. These gargantuan businesses move like start-ups. The result is a compounding of earnings that keeps justifying their price.Another concern is that the Fangs will be hobbled by regulation, hence the significance of Google’s fine. Trust busters the world over are eyeing Facebook’s almost one-third slice of the global mobile advertising market and Google’s 90 per cent share of search in some countries. Meanwhile, Amazon, with almost half of US online shopping sales, is blamed for the death of the high street — a red rag to politicians.Again these worries are overdone. Sure Fangs have benefited from so-called network effects, where the bigger the platform the more attractive it is to buyers and sellers — to the detriment of rivals. But if the traditional purpose of competition law is to drive down prices for consumers, Fang stocks have achieved this on their own. Facebook and Google offer their services for free. Hard to moan about that. And people love Amazon because it is cheap and convenient, as they do Netflix.Are there any threats? After years of excess the Fangs could become blunt and lazy. Keep a watch on spending at Facebook and Google, which is growing faster than revenues. Or regulators may grind the companies down in ways they do not expect. One radical idea doing the rounds is that watchdogs should curtail their aggressive gobbling up of smaller firms. Fangs do this to nullify potential threats or nab their intellectual property — think of Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram or Google’s purchase of HTC’s design team.The Fangs are not immune to an old-fashioned economic slump either. Then again they would probably weather a recession better than most. When times are tough, people watch more films and shop online for bargains. Nor would we stop searching for things or liking cat videos. Fangs let investors play offence and defence at the same time.I was too negative when writing about Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google all those years ago. Nothing that has happened this week suggests that I could still be proved right.The writer is head of DWS’s Global Research Institute and a former editor of the FT’s Lex columnNetflix lacks a sustainable competitive advantage / From Daniel Mauro, Chicago, IL, US"
172;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Investors pile yet more cash into tech stock funds;Global equity funds dedicated to technology amass $20bn so far this year;Inflows into technology-focused funds have surpassed the $20bn mark for the year so far, despite rising concerns among some fund managers that the “ tech trade” is overextended.Global equity funds dedicated to technology stocks took in another $673m in the week ending July 18 — the 12th straight week of inflows, bringing the total for 2018 to $20.3bn, according to EPFR. That eclipses the $18.3bn raised in 2017 as a whole, which was a record for a calendar year.The strong appetite for technology funds reflects the fact that it has been the best performing sector worldwide both this year and last. The S&P 500’s technology index has gained 15.3 per cent so far in 2018, compared with the broader market’s 4.9 per cent gain. Without the inclusion of technology stocks and Amazon, which is classified as a retailer, the US stock market would be down for the year.The market gains come as fears rise over a trade war and the US government’s tariffs on goods from some of its biggest trade partners. Tech company growth rates are considered relatively resilient to escalating tensions.“Technology continues to grow in popularity, partly because it is seen as somewhat invulnerable to trade tensions,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “It is also one of the few areas were people are still seeing strong growth in the middle of what has been a pretty mediocre year.”The so-called Faang stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet — have dominated the rally.Asian technology stocks have also enjoyed strong gains in recent years. China’s Tencent has dropped more than 7 per cent this year, but Baidu and Alibaba — the three are often grouped together as the “Bats” — are up 12 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively in 2018.The New York Stock Exchange’s Fang+ index, which includes a mix of US and Chinese tech companies, has climbed more than 32 per cent this year.However, some investors think the rally in “Big Tech” shares is overdone. Betting on the Faangs in the US and China’s Bats has been identified as the most crowded trade for sixth months running in an investors survey conducted by Bank of America. It was judged the most overextended trade since the long-dollar trade of late 2015.“There’s always a concern that investors are getting sucked in at the wrong time, but today’s technology sector is very different from that of the technology bubble 20 years ago,” Ms Hooper said.
173;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Netflix takes another step into audio with Sirius XM deal;;Netflix is taking a step into the world of audio entertainment, with a promotional channel on Sirius XM radio to showcase its growing roster of comedians.The tie-up with the US satellite radio broadcaster will promote material from the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Schumer, Aziz Ansari and Sarah Silverman, who have all produced stand-up comedy shows for Netflix in the past. The new full-time channel is expected to go live in January 2019, the two companies said on Wednesday.The deal marks the first time that Netflix has joined forces with another subscription-based media company and will be its first foray into radio.However, for now at least, the move has been couched more as a promotional vehicle for Netflix than a strategic shift. Sirius XM gives Netflix a way to reach customers in the one place they can’t watch its shows - in the car.Netflix has strayed from video into audio before - through podcasts.In April, it launched a podcast series, You Can’t Make This Up, going behind the scenes of its original documentaries, including Wild Wild Country and its Oscar-winning film Icarus. Wormwood, a documentary series by filmmaker Errol Morris exploring the death of a CIA scientist in the 1950s, was given its own companion podcast mini-series last year.On the same day as announcing the Sirius deal, Netflix also unveiled a redesign of its big-screen TV app - where most of its subscribers spend the bulk of their viewing time. The new interface, which starts rolling out on Wednesday, adds a sidebar that makes it easier to search between movies and TV series, as well as a shortcut to shows that viewers have saved for later on “My List”.Netflix shares have had a wild, wild ride this week, plunging as much as 13 per cent on Tuesday morning after it missed its own subscriber forecasts. After briefly losing its position as the world’s most valuable media group to Walt Disney, Netflix stock rallied later on Tuesday and the two companies’ market caps were neck-and-neck by Wednesday lunchtime at around $165bn.
174;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-17T23:01:51Z;Streaming video subscriptions overtake pay TV in UK;Ofcom report reveals shift in viewer habits as digital services expand;More people in the UK now subscribe to streaming video services, such as Netflix and Amazon, than pay-television, underscoring the challenges cable, satellite and public service broadcasters are facing in the digital age.A new Media Nations report from Ofcom, the UK media regulator, found there had been a “major shift in the UK’s viewing habits” as viewers moved to new digital services.The number of UK subscriptions to the three largest streaming services — Netflix, Amazon Prime and Sky’s Now TV — hit 15.4m in the first quarter of 2018, eclipsing the number of pay TV subscriptions, which was 15.1m, the report found.“Today’s research finds that what we watch and how we watch it are changing rapidly, which has profound implications for UK television,” said Sharon White, Ofcom’s chief executive.Social networks and competing video services, such as YouTube, are drawing viewers away from television. Average daily viewing on the television set fell by nine minutes, to three hours 22 minutes, in 2017, continuing a five-year downward trend, with average viewing time falling by 38 minutes since 2012.The shift to new platforms and services is beginning to hit pay-TV providers in the pocket, with total revenues among the competing services falling 2.7 per cent in 2017, to £6.4bn. Television advertising income fell 7 per cent, to £3.9bn.The growth of new platforms and services has also hit spending by the UK’s public service broadcasters — the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 — with total spending of £2.5bn hitting a “record low,” according to Ofcom.“We have seen a decline in revenues for pay-TV, a fall in spending on new programmes by our public service broadcasters, and the growth of global video streaming giants,” said Ms White. “These challenges cannot be underestimated.”She urged UK broadcasters to collaborate in order to contend with the threat posed by wealthy competitors from Silicon Valley.“UK broadcasters have a history of adapting to change,” she said. “By making the best British programmes and working together to reach people who are turning away from TV, our broadcasters can compete in the digital age.”

The advance in shares of Jeff Bezos’ ecommerce juggernaut came despite the embarrassing technical glitch the US website suffered at its 36-hour global discount event dubbed ‘Prime Day’ on Monday and strikes by its workers in Germany on Tuesday.Netflix was the main outlier falling as much as 14.1 per cent — after saying its quarterly net new subscribers fell 1m shy of analysts estimates before — clawing back those losses to trade about 6 per cent lower.Despite the sell-off in the streaming site the Nasdaq Composite scaled new highs rising 0.7 per cent to 7,863.06. The broader NYSE Fang+Index that includes Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Twitter, Baidu and Alibaba however failed to match that feat but was up 0.8 per cent on the day.
176;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-17T14:18:56Z;Netflix subscriber miss prompts concern over competition;Share price slide threatens to put rival Disney back on top in market cap battle;Netflix tussled with Walt Disney for the crown as the world’s most valuable media group after disappointing subscriber growth prompted a share price slide at the Silicon Valley video streaming service.The company, whose shares had more than doubled in the year to date, opened 13 per cent lower on Tuesday, initially wiping as much as $20bn off its valuation, before recovering some ground. Netflix’s stunning rally came to a halt after it missed its own subscriber forecasts on Monday afternoon. The early stock drop was Netflix’s biggest since its last serious disappointment on subscriber numbers in July 2016.Netflix’s market capitalisation fell below $150bn at the opening of trading, compared with Disney’s $166bn, before bouncing back above its rival. Netflix’s valuation surpassed that of the home of Mickey Mouse, Star Wars and Marvel’s Avengers in May. Disney is preparing to launch its own Netflix rival next year. Netflix reported worse than expected subscriber growth for both its international and domestic markets in the second quarter and cut its estimates for third-quarter growth, despite ramping up spending on marketing over the past year. Reed Hastings, chief executive, insisted in an analyst Q&A session on Monday afternoon that the company’s “fundamentals have never been stronger”, with viewing setting new records. Executives blamed their own forecasting errors for the subscriber shortfall, which was not concentrated in any one part of the world. In a note on Tuesday, analysts at UBS warned investors that “bingeing Netflix requires digestion”. The shortfall marked a “clear break from recent business model momentum”, after four straight quarters of exceeding its forecasts, UBS said. William Power, analyst at Baird, noted that Netflix had quickly returned to form after its last significant subscriber shortfall two years ago. “Overall, we suspect the miss is more of a blip than a significant change to the broader growth opportunity,” he said, sympathising with the company’s “forecasting challenges . . . given the many moving pieces in 100-plus countries”. John Janedis of Jefferies added that “while there was no single source of the weaker results”, neither was there a “breakout hit during the quarter”, despite debuts of new seasons of Marvel superhero series Jessica Jones and Luke Cage, and controversial teen drama 13 Reasons Why. Some analysts questioned why a near-doubling of Netflix’s marketing spend in the first half of the year had not yielded better results, while the company’s ability to raise prices might be curtailed given increasing competition from Disney and HBO, now part of AT&T. “It is what it is,” Mr Hastings said of the new competition, adding that Netflix would focus on improving its content, user interface and marketing. Other observers suggested Netflix would have to raise prices to offset the slower growth. “The real question is how long investors will be willing to be patient with Netflix’s losses in original content spending, especially in light of the growing competitive environment,” said Ben Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies. “It helps when investors believe the company has little to no real competition. Perhaps that was a belief of Netflix a few years ago, but I don’t think that is a safe assumption any longer.”Additional reporting by Peter Wells in New York
177;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Netflix: flixer upper  ;Streaming service is taking an unnecessary risk with new high-yield bonds;Sometimes the analytically minded need to have more faith in their instincts. Netflix is producing hundreds of shows, many driven by algorithms and artificial intelligence, in a bid for ubiquity. This is not a cheap tactic. The streaming company expects cash needs to reach $3bn to $4bn this year. To raise this, it plans to tap debt markets rather than equity, claiming that high-yield bonds are cheaper than selling shares.A Modigliani-Miller capital structure spreadsheet must have spat out that idea. With a stock that has tripled since the start of 2017, Netflix’s gut instinct should be an equity offering.The biggest headline from second-quarter results released late on Monday was a miss on subscriber growth. Instead of 6m people joining, just over 5m did. The lack of blockbuster shows may be to blame. The company held up its hands and said that its estimates were wrong. But there was no broader conclusion on offer about the popularity of its streaming content.Instead, the focus was on debt. The company plans to add to its $8.4bn of existing junk bonds in order to finance its cash needs. It made the point that it was still relatively unlevered, alluding to its debt-to-enterprise-value ratio of just 5 per cent. Classic corporate finance theory says that it can lower its overall cost of capital by issuing more debt. But the premise of that textbook analysis is that the cost of equity is higher than the cost of debt. Yet Netflix’s current earnings yield — the reciprocal of the price/earnings ratio — is below 1 per cent. Its outstanding bonds offer a yield of about 6 per cent. Companies are often loath to issue stock even if it offers the lowest cost of capital. Selling equity can be seen as a signal of peak valuation. Plus there tends to be an aversion to expanding the volume of outstanding shares. But for a company so deeply cash flow negative, adding more than $100m of interest expense seems unnecessary when effectively costless equity is available.

178;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
179;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-16T20:22:40Z;Netflix shares tumble after subscriber growth misses forecasts;Stunning market rally comes to a halt as price falls 14%;Netflix’s stunning stock-price rally came crashing to a halt on Monday after it reported 1m fewer subscribers than investors had expected. The video streaming company added 5.2m net new subscribers in the second quarter, instead of the 6.2m that its executives had predicted three months ago. It admitted its performance was “strong but not stellar”. Netflix missed targets both in the US, where subscribers were up by 0.7m, and overseas, up 4.5m, bringing its total membership to 130.1m. Until the abrupt reversal in fortunes, Netflix stock had more than doubled in value so far this year including having added more than $40bn in market capitalisation since April’s forecast-busting results. The latest miss on subscribers is its biggest disappointment in two years, and it sent its stock tumbling by as much as 14 per cent in after-hours trading. Investors wiped more than $20bn from its valuation in a matter of minutes as they fretted that the past year’s growth spurt might be running out of steam.Netflix’s outlook for the third quarter was also more conservative than Wall Street had expected. It predicted 135.1m members at the end of September. Its forecast of 5m global net subscriber additions this quarter was below the 5.3m it added in the same quarter a year ago. Thanks to recent price increases and foreign exchange fluctuations, Netflix’s revenues were broadly in line with expectations at $3.9bn, as was net income of $384m. It forecast revenues to rise to $4.0bn in the next quarter, a little less than Wall Street’s consensus of $4.1bn, and said it expected net income to dip to $307m. In its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix blamed its own internal forecasting for the disappointment, rather than any change in demand for its services. For the last four quarters, Netflix has substantially beaten its own subscriber forecasts. The last quarter included new seasons of popular Netflix original shows such as Jessica Jones and Glow, while the next quarter is expected to see the return of longstanding hits House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Netflix touted its strong showing in last week’s Emmy nominations, when it received the most nominations of any company or studio, ending the 17-year dominance of HBO.$8bn vs $4bnAmount earmarked by Netflix to spend on content in 2018 versus free cashflowNetflix’s awards cabinet may be swelling but it has come at a cost of billions of dollars in content spending a year. Despite slower subscriber growth, the Silicon Valley-based media and technology group gave no indication that it would cut back its planned $8bn content budget this year. Netflix still anticipates free cash outflows of up to $4bn for 2018, adding that it would continue to finance its content spending through debt rather than tapping the equity markets.Executives have insisted that investing in yet more new films and TV shows is vital to keep attracting and retaining subscribers, especially as it faces increasing competition for both talent and viewers from Walt Disney, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and the newly combined AT&T and Time Warner, which owns HBO.The latest report on Monday gave no indication that Netflix was changing its approach. “We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings,” Netflix said. “Our strategy is to simply keep improving, as we’ve been doing every year in the past.”The company is increasingly looking to new markets around the world to sustain its growth. Earlier this month it released Sacred Games, its first original series in India. “After handily blowing away Street expectations on subs the last few years this is a clear speed bump for Netflix,” said Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights. “The international miss was most concerning given this is the linchpin to the core growth thesis for the coming years.”
180;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-16T04:00:36Z;India: Netflix takes a gamble on its next 100m subscribers;The streaming service hopes to exploit a boom in internet use in the country. But can it avoid the pitfalls that have dogged other ventures?;The first thing that comes into view as the camera pans up from the bottom of an austere tower block is the shape of a dog. “Do you believe in God?” asks the voiceover as the animal tumbles downwards. As the dog hits the ground with a dull thud, the voice intones: “God doesn’t give a f**k.”With that noir flourish, stylistically familiar to audiences worldwide from hit shows such as House of Cards or Narcos, Netflix this month launched its first ever Indian-produced series, Sacred Games. The show, based on the 2007 novel by Vikram Chandra, is an eight-part multimillion-dollar thriller set in the Mumbai criminal underworld, and featuring Hindi film stars Saif Ali Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Radhika Apte. But more than that, it is a statement of intent. Netflix, the streaming service with 125m global subscribers, views India as its next major source of revenue growth, not least because the country’s number of internet users has doubled in the past four years to 500m.“Even we couldn’t have predicted the last two years of Indian internet growth,” Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told a conference in Delhi this year. Talking about how the company had reached 125m subscribers, he added: “The next 100m is from India.”Mr Hastings’s optimism reflects a mood among many western executives that after several false dawns this might be India’s moment. The country’s gross domestic product is growing at 7.7 per cent a year — faster than any other major economy — and while many think growth should be even higher, it boasts both a young population and a prime minister in Narendra Modi who wants to encourage foreign capital.Consumer companies are keen to reap the rewards of India’s emerging middle class. Amazon has pledged to spend $5bn trying to become the country’s biggest online retailer. Its main challenger is Walmart, which this year made India’s biggest ever direct foreign investment with the $16bn takeover of Flipkart. Ikea is set to open its first megastore in the country next month.“Not only is India large but it is growing so quickly,” Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, said the day after completing the Flipkart deal. “The middle-income progress that is being made in urban centres and rural areas is very exciting for us.”But as many corporate rivals could tell both Mr McMillon and Mr Hastings, investing in India requires boundless patience and deep pockets, and even then may well be doomed to failure.Not only are there the usual pitfalls of stifling bureaucracy, widespread corruption and unpredictable policy changes, but experts warn that many western companies misjudge their target market in India — especially when it comes to the so-called “middle class”.Devdutt Pattanaik, a former executive at Mumbai-based Future Group, the retail conglomerate, says: “Western companies visualise the Indian ‘middle class’ as they view the western ‘middle class’, whereas in fact only the rich in India can afford most of the middle-class lifestyles of western cities.”Netflix entered India in a blaze of promotion and with a bag full of cash. Advertisements for Sacred Games are plastered over the Delhi metro and close to the airport. Its executives speak with a familiar zeal about the potential of the Indian market — like many western companies it has been shut out of China and hopes India will help make up for the lost growth opportunity.“We are carried away with enthusiasm by India,” says Todd Yellin, vice-president of product at Netflix. “We think it will be one of our biggest sources of growth over the next few years.”The company believes that India, where audiences are used to lavish Bollywood film productions but mainly watch low-budget soap operas on television, is a vast untapped market for its brand of glossy, highly produced shows.In its attempt to crack that market, Netflix is pursuing the same strategy that has earned it a $180bn valuation even before it makes a profit: spending big on original content in a variety of genres, and making the customer pay. Alongside Sacred Games, it has made a collection of short films about sex under the title Lust Stories, and next month will release a horror series entitled Ghoul. And if anyone doubted its ambition, it recently announced a plan to turn Midnight’s Children, Salman Rushdie’s sprawling novel about India’s transition to independence, into a series.The company has always been reluctant to disclose financial or viewing figures. But Anurag Kashyap, who co-directed Sacred Games, told the Financial Times he was given a budget equal to what he would spend on one of his films. His 2013 film Bombay Velvet cost $13m.“Indian television would not risk itself with this,” says Mr Kashyap. “National television channels want to appeal to everyone. That means there is no space for anything new and we would have to dumb it down.”Netflix does not carry advertising. So to fund productions such as Sacred Games, it is charging Indian subscribers between Rs500 ($7) and Rs800 a month, roughly what its western subscribers pay. Amazon, as a comparison, charges Rs129 a month for its Prime service, which includes streaming.According to estimates by IHS Markit, a market research company, Amazon’s streaming service had 610,000 subscribers to Netflix’s 522,000 at the end of 2017. Hotstar, the market leader, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, has 1.6m.“We see this as a fairly broad product over time,” says Erik Barmack, Netflix’s vice-president of international original content. “A cinema ticket at a multiplex, combined with popcorn and travel, is equivalent to the price of a Netflix subscription per month.”Entered market: 1981Profit before tax of Maruti Suzuki 2017-18: Rs110bnSuzuki entered India in partnership with the local company Maruti a decade before the country’s markets began to open up significantly to foreign capital. The company sold 1.8m cars in India in the last financial year.Western consumer companies that have had success in India have, unlike Netflix, usually appealed to the lower end of the market. Suzuki, for example, turned its low-cost Swift model into one of India’s most popular cars. The company made Rs110bn of pre-tax profits in the country in 2017-18, alongside its local partner Maruti — nearly four times what it made five years ago. India is now the Japanese company’s biggest market.Hindustan Unilever, meanwhile, in which the global consumer goods company owns a 54 per cent stake, has also focused on selling high volumes of relatively low-priced items, such as its single-use pouches of shampoo and face cream. The company made Rs72.9bn in pre-tax profits in 2017-18 — up nearly 70 per cent in the past five years.But for every success story there are examples of multinationals that have failed to crack India. Often, strict regulations, stifling bureaucracy and capricious rule changes have been to blame — in part a legacy of India’s historic antipathy towards global capitalism.Entered market: 1995Profit before tax of GM India Private: Not declaredGM’s presence in India has been a particularly bumpy ride. It has failed to capture more than a few per cent of the market with its Chevrolet brand, and suffered a high-profile embarrassment in 2013 when it had to recall 114,000 of its Tavera cars, citing issues with emissions.Ikea, for example, announced in 2006 that it intended to open its first store in India, but then spent years trying in vain to persuade New Delhi to relax rules forbidding foreign companies from operating retail stores without a local partner. In 2009, it said it was abandoning the plans, but then revived them when the government eventually relented. Nearly 10 years later, it is finally about to open in the southern city of Hyderabad.Meanwhile both Vodafone, the telecoms company, and Cairn, the British oil explorer, have been hit with retrospective tax claims for several billion pounds — which they have since spent years fruitlessly trying to appeal against.The other big risk is that companies simply fail to understand who should be buying their products.General Motors last year announced it would no longer sell Chevrolet cars in India after 21 years in the country, during which time it went through two joint venture partners, nine chief executives and more than $1bn in investment. Analysts say the company never produced the kind of cheap but heavily accessorised car that Indians really want.And despite the fact that India is the third-biggest smartphone market in the world, Apple sold just 500,000 iPhones there in the first quarter of this year, according to Counterpoint Research — roughly the same as its sales in Malaysia or Mexico. Its iPhoneX costs about $1,500 in India — 20 times the cost of the cheapest Samsung.Jayanth Kolla, partner at the Bangalore-based business consultancy Convergence Catalyst, says: “Western companies often get the Indian market completely wrong — though it is a failure more often made by American companies than European ones.“American companies don’t seem to understand how fragmented and diverse India is,” he adds.The problem for many companies wanting to sell to Indian consumers — especially at the premium end like Netflix — is that while the country’s middle-class is growing, it has nothing like the spending power of its western equivalent.The country’s gross domestic product per capita, in purchasing power parity terms, last year was just over $7,000 according to the World Bank. In China, often touted as the model for Indian development, it was more than double that.Economists Sandhya Krishnan and Neeraj Hatekar last year defined the “new Indian middle class” as those spending between $2 and $10 a day, some 600m people. Their French counterparts Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty calculated that to qualify among the top 10 per cent of earners in 2015, a person would have had to make around $3,000 a year — roughly the salary for a highly sought after job as a domestic worker in an affluent city.Entered market: 1931Profit before tax of Hindustan Unilever 2017-18: Rs72.9bnUnilever has carved out a position as one of India’s biggest consumer brands, leading the market with products such as its Fair & Lovely face creams. It captured market share by offering its products in cheap single-use pouches, but analysts say the company has found it difficult to sell those customers higher-value items.“There are about 50m Indians that would be global middle-class,” says Jayant Sinha, India’s aviation minister and a former finance minister. “That means they can fly everywhere in the country, they can fly internationally, they own a car, they have a stable job.“Then we have an Indian ‘middle class’ of about 200m-250m people who have a stable job but not a well-paying one. They have many of the things you would expect a middle-class person to have: a refrigerator, a motorcycle, a smartphone, etc . . . Thereafter we have about 500m people who would be aspiring middle-class. They would probably just have a motorcycle.”This is the challenge facing consumer companies spending big in India. Amazon is attempting to capture the market by discounting heavily and hoping it can outlast the Walmart-controlled Flipkart in a prolonged price war. Ikea is hoping to entice shoppers to buy its furniture, which at first will be imported and therefore relatively expensive, by stocking 1,000 items at below Rs200, from lightbulbs to small rugs.For Netflix, if Mr Hastings is right that its next 100m subscribers will come from India, the company must sell subscriptions not only to every single member of what Mr Sinha calls “India’s global middle class”, but a considerable portion of those on lower incomes.“If Netflix is looking at the most affluent 25m Indians, then it is doing the right thing,” says Mr Kolla. “Those people have probably heard of Netflix and are able to spend what they are charging. But if they are looking at the bigger India — 1bn or so Indians — they have definitely, definitely got that wrong.”For directors and producers such as Mr Kashyap — who have been given big budgets for films before, but never for the kind of series in which Netflix specialises — the freedom is liberating. However, even as he praises his new paymaster, he identifies a major hurdle that Netflix will face. “The problem,” he says, “is that India is a country where everyone likes everything free.”Ikea’s new store in Hyderabad, which is due to open next month, will be unlike anything India has ever seen before. The size of a shopping centre, the outlet will employ 850 people and include a restaurant that can seat 1,000 people, making it one of India’s largest.The strategy, says Patrik Antoni, the company’s deputy country manager, is to appeal to a broad range of incomes by selling cheaply-made domestic items alongside expensive imported furniture.“Our goal is to reach out to all these people who normally would not take part in a shopping experience like Ikea,” he says. “We want them to come, so we’re creating an offering that is much more affordable at the lower range, and then maybe some products at the top that are a bit more expensive [than they would be elsewhere].”But he admits that one of the company’s biggest challenges will be to avoid developing a reputation as a luxury brand. “We need to work on how we are perceived,” he says. “We need to make sure that we are not seen as this expensive foreign brand that comes into the market, because all other foreign brands have been expensive.”But like many of his corporate rivals, Mr Antoni says India presents a unique opportunity for his company, despite a decade of delays in opening. “There will be hiccups for sure, but no one would say that India will be a less prosperous and positive society by 2035 than it is today. No one believes that.“For other countries, will they be better or worse in 15, 20 years? We don’t know. Take Europe as a market: will the kids of today be better off than we are? Maybe not.”

Those gains, if held, would hand them all record closing levels.Alphabet was up 2.4 per cent and just a sliver away from its intraday record high in late June.

Netflix, which closed at a record on Monday, was down 1.9 per cent.Technology, up 1.6 per cent, was the best-performing sector in the benchmark S&P 500, which was up 0.8 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher.Fears of a global trade war have weighed on equities in recent months. Those concerns flared up again this week after the Trump administration started the process of imposing tariffs on a further $200bn of imports from China, adding to the levies on $34bn in goods that were put in place at the start of the month.But traders appeared to be encouraged by a report last night that Chinese and US officials could be looking to sit down together and resume trade talks.
182;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-07-10T19:39:44Z;AT&T/HBO: bigger in Texas;Netflix and Amazon are facing another challenger;“More please,” is rarely the outcome of a big M&A deal. AT&T’s expansion plan for HBO is, therefore, unusual. Now that the Texas telecoms group has closed its $80bn deal for Time Warner, a new strategy is coming into focus. Time Warner’s HBO premium content service thrived as a niche provider of expensive shows geared to wealthy urban audiences. Meanwhile, Netflix, Amazon, Disney and Comcast have transformed into mass market platforms commanding hours of attention from users every day. A reported recording from a recent AT&T/HBO employee town hall suggested that AT&T sees HBO as a way to muscle into the platform business.That will require a jump in HBO subscriptions and heavy investment in content. In 2017, the network generated $6bn of revenue and $2bn of operating profit. The latter accounting for a quarter of Time Warner’s total. It had 54m domestic subscribers and 88m internationally. Compare that to Netflix, which had global subscribers of about 120m. It had operating income of $1bn last year on revenue of $12bn but spent a staggering $10bn on content development. The streaming company’s strategy is obvious. It produces hundreds of shows from all over the world then uses data science to capture as wide an audience as possible. Wall Street has cheered this pricey approach by sending shares up more than 200 per cent since the end of 2016.Whether AT&T can afford to do the same is unclear. Before the Time Warner closing, AT&T was forecasting $21bn in free cash flow for 2018, more than enough to pay its dividend. Time Warner will only add to its free cash flow. But the deal will take AT&T up to nearly $250bn in adjusted net debt , nearly double what it had before. Over time, it hopes to both lower debt and secure its dividend. Yet it also wants to challenge Netflix and Amazon, two companies whose investors have very different expectations on profits.

During fiscal 2018, which ended March 31, revenues were up 33 per cent year-on-year to $593.7m, and it has guided for another 25 to 30 per cent gain in FY 2019.Among analysts, Abiomed has five “strong buy” ratings, four “buy”, two “hold” and no sells, with a mean price target of $418.33, according to Thomson Reuters data. That’s close to the $412.83 a share at which it was trading on Friday.Abiomed may not be a household name, yet, but its 2018 to-date run has put it above more recognisable names — including Netflix and Twitter — that make up the rest of the S&P 500’s top gainers in the first half of 2018.Netflix, which clocked in behind Abiomed with a 104 per cent gain, has been hovering in record territory this year as top-shelf original content offerings like Stranger Things, The Crown and Orange is the New Black have made it a major threat to traditional entertainment giants.Rounding out the top five gainers on the S&P 500 for the first half of 2018 are social media platform Twitter; up 82 per cent; travel and restaurant website TripAdvisor, up 63 per cent; insurer XL Group, up 59 per cent; and athletic apparel and gear maker Under Armour, up 58 per cent.On the flip side, Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands is the S&P 500’s biggest faller so far this year, down 38 per cent, followed by Arconic, down 36 per cent; Dentsply Sirona, down 33 per cent; Unum Group, down 32 per cent; and Brighthouse Financial, down 30 per cent.Year to date, the S&P 500 has notched a 2.35 per cent advance."
184;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-06-25T15:20:58Z;European streaming joint venture takes on Netflix;Discovery and ProSiebenSat.1 to build service in Germany that integrates programming;Two of Europe’s biggest media players are forming a joint digital venture to ward off the threat posed by streaming services such as Netflix, which have sparked big changes in audience behaviour worldwide.Discovery, the US group that owns Eurosport, and ProSiebenSat.1, the German media group, said they would build a subscription streaming service in Germany that integrates programming and digital services from the two companies. They have also invited German operators RTL, ARD and ZDF to join the venture.“The only market in the world that I’m aware of where broadcasters have come together to create a leading over-the-top product is the US with Hulu,” said JB Perrette, chief executive of Discovery Networks International, in a reference to the streaming service jointly owned by Walt Disney, Comcast, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner.Collaboration in Europe was essential, he added. “This is the only way that broadcasters can own and control their destiny.”The new venture comes as Netflix continues to add viewers in international markets. It has more than 125m subscribers and its explosive growth has prompted a round of consolidation among big media groups, which are seeking to create global content offerings and operations.Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is the subject of a bidding war between Walt Disney and Comcast, while Sky is also being fought over by Fox and Comcast.Max Conze, chief executive of ProSiebenSat.1, said the goal of the venture with Discovery was to get to 10m subscribers within 10 years. “We are putting very significant resources and investment with urgency into this effort,” he said.Alexandar Vassilev, a former executive with Google and YouTube, will lead the joint-venture team while Mr Conze will head the board. Mr Perrette will represent Discovery on the board.The new venture will integrate ProSiebenSat.1’s 7TV and Maxdome digital services with Discovery’s Eurosport player. It will offer local programming, an advertiser-supported service and a premium tier with sports and movies. More than 200 people will work on the venture, which will launch in the first half of 2019, the companies said.The deal is the latest move by Discovery into subscription streaming. It recently struck a 12-year deal worth $2bn with the PGA Tour to create a “Netflix of golf” digital service that would be available in every country outside the US.Its new deal comes ahead of a planned streaming service from Walt Disney and follows that company’s recent US launch of a sports service from its ESPN sports channel.
185;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Netflix’s top communications chief leaves over ‘insensitive’ remarks;;Netflix’s top communications officer has left the content streaming company after making “insensitive” remarks.Jonathan Friedland, who had been at the company for nearly seven years, announced his departure via Twitter on Friday afternoon. “Leaders have to be beyond reproach”, he tweeted, adding he “fell short of that standard when I was insensitive in speaking to my team about words that offend in comedy.”Media reports, citing sources at the company, said Mr Friedland used a racial slur in a meeting with Netflix staff.In a follow-up tweet, Mr Friedland said: “I feel awful about the distress this lapse caused to people at a company I love and where I want everyone to feel included and appreciated. I feel honored to have built a brilliant and diverse global team and to have been part of our collective adventure.”Netflix shares closed at a record high this week on a handful of share price target upgrades from analysts. The company’s market capitalisation has already more than doubled this year.
186;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-06-20T23:12:09Z;Share price records topple as Faangs power ahead;Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all closed at new highs;The “Faang” club of high-flying technology stocks continues to power the US stock market, with four of its five members hitting new intraday records on Wednesday and helping the S&P 500 claw back some of the losses caused by rising trade tensions.While the S&P 500 index gained 0.2 per cent on Wednesday, and the technology sector climbed 0.3 per cent, there were stronger performances from the narrower group of superstar stocks known as the Faangs: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google’s parent company Alphabet.Four of the five touched record highs during the day, while Apple’s stock bounced back to just 3.7 per cent below its all-time peak.Netflix, the smallest and most volatile of the Faangs, led their rally, closing up 2.9 per cent to $416.76. Facebook vaulted past the $200 per share mark for the first time, gaining 2.3 per cent to end the day at $202. Amazon closed up 0.9 per cent at $1750.08 per share. All three were record closing share prices.Alphabet fell back from the record high of $1201.49 it touched earlier on Wednesday, but ended the New York trading day up 0.2 per cent at $1184.07.In total, the five Faangs now have a total market capitalisation of $3.35tn — making them bigger than the entire FTSE 100, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index or France’s Cac 40.“These are pretty unique companies,” said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments. “This reflects the recognition of their growth.”The New York Stock Exchange’s “Fang+” index — which also includes other high-flying stocks such as chipmaker Nvidia, and China’s Baidu and Alibaba — climbed 1.5 per cent on Wednesday to extend its year-to-date gains to 36.8 per cent.The biggest technology-focused exchange-traded fund, Invesco’s QQQ, has taken in another $2.6bn of investor money this year, and is now the world’s eighth-biggest ETF, with assets of $67.8bn. That is nearly double its size two years ago.The concentration of tech sector gains in a handful of high-flyers was on stark display on Wednesday. The overall sector was dragged down by the poor performance of a few more mature members, such as Oracle and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which declined 7.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively.Some investors now consider Faang investments “ defensive”, as their continued growth is seen to be independent of other looming dangers such as weaker global economic growth, rising interest rates or trade tensions.Not all agree, however. The technology rally is increasingly reminiscent of the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century, argued Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. He noted that if one excluded the technology sector then the S&P 500 would be close to flat this year, instead of up 3.5 per cent.“It’s not as severe as it was back then, but it’s got a lot of similar elements,” he said. “This is the new leadership, and there’s comfort in popularity.”The extent of the Faangs’ popularity could become a problem if they disappoint investors’ expectations that they will continue to perform well regardless of the economic backdrop.“They have to keep delivering, quarter after quarter, and if they don’t there will be some shocks,” Mr Sen warned.
187;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-06-19T18:06:28Z;Netflix earns $500 price target as analyst sees ‘iron-like strength to grow’;Netflix shares hit $400 for first time;US streaming site Netflix on Tuesday was given a $500 price target by analysts at GBH Insights, the highest on Wall Street, helping send the company’s shares above $400 for the first time.That is $100 higher than GBH’s previous price target, surpassing the $490 that analysts at Goldman Sachs assigned Netflix last week and representing a near 30 per cent premium to Netflix’s closing price on Monday. The move also helped shares in the streaming site behind hit original series like The Crown, Stranger Things and Mindhunter buck broader Wall Street pain and rise as much as 2.9 per cent to $401.60.GBH’s price target would imply a market cap of about $217.35bn for Netflix — compared with $173.5bn at present — and would put it just ahead of where Pfizer, Mastercard, Cisco and Boeing are sitting today.“Our bullish thesis on Netflix is based on our belief that the company’s competitive moat, franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and original content build out will translate into robust profitability and growth as the next phase of this story plays out over the coming year with $10 of earnings power by 2022,” said Daniel Ives at GBH Insights.Mr Ives noted that the average Netflix user is already watching the streaming service for more than 10 hours a week, “nearly double its nearest competitors Amazon and Hulu which is closer to 5 hours per week, an eye-popping disparity” and added that despite competition, Netflix is in “a unique position of iron-like strength to grow its content and distribution tentacles over the next 12 to 18 months”.Netflix shares have continued to push deeper into record territory. Investors are betting on its growth prospects as it plans to spend more than $8bn on original content this year. Indeed, Reed Hastings’ company, which first disrupted DVD rentals like Blockbuster, has sparked a shake-up of the traditional media playersComcast has gatecrashed Walt Disney’s deal to buy 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets and Disney is now said to be readying an increased offer as Bob Iger seeks to challenge Netflix though a family-friendly entertainment service with Disney, Marvel and Pixar content, a sports-streaming service led by ESPN and Hulu for entertainment aimed at adults.Mr Ives noted that Comcast’s move has thrown a wrench into Mr Iger’s plan and is “ultimately a positive” for the streaming site, since Disney is “the most viable threat” to Netflix in the near term.“From Netflix’s perspective a bidding war and potentially a break-up up of some key assets to multiple bidders (Hulu front and centre, Sky) to navigate any regulatory hurdles would be a major win for Hastings & Co. not to have all these assets under one hood and especially under the control of Disney,” said Mr Ives.Separately, on Tuesday, analysts at Piper Jaffray boosted their price target on Netflix to $420 up from $367 previously while reiterating their “overweight” recommendation, while analysts at Moness, Crespi and Hardt lifted their price target to $460 from $375 previously.Netflix shares are now up nearly 109 per cent so far this year.
188;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-06-14T16:42:34Z;Netflix shares have doubled since start of year;New record high makes video service second-best performer in S&P 500;In hitting a new record high on Thursday, Netflix shares have doubled this year and cemented their position as the S&P 500’s second-best performer so far in 2018.The content streaming company behind hit series such as The Crown, 13 Reasons Why and Stranger Things was up 2.5 per cent at $389.56 in late morning trade in New York. It had traded as much as 2.9 per cent higher to an intraday record of $391.13.Thursday’s jump took its year-to-date gain to 103 per cent, making Netflix only the second company in the S&P 500 to have doubled so far in 2018. The other is Abiomed, which hit the milestone in mid-May.Hard on Netflix’s heels is Twitter, with its shares at a three-year high and up more than 90 per cent so far in 2018.At this time last year, Netflix’s shares were up 22.9 per cent, nearly half of the 55.1 per cent gain it posted for calendar 2017.Netflix now has a market cap of $165.2bn, putting it just behind Citigroup, at $171.6bn and Merck, at $168.4bn. Its market cap recently surpassed that of Walt Disney, which weighs in at $158.1bn and is doubling down on its own streaming services in an effort to be a contender in the Netflix era.Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analysts reiterated their “buy” rating on the stock and said the company would be cash flow-positive by 2022. The bank lifted its 12-month target price by $100 to $490, which is the highest on the Street.Netflix’s average target price is $335.91, according to a Bloomberg survey of 46 analysts, more than half of whom rate it a buy.The company reported a forecast-busting set of results in its first quarter and flagged strong revenue growth driven by international subscribers.There are 71 companies in the tech- and biomed-heavy Nasdaq Composite, besides Netflix and Abiomed, that are up by 100 per cent or more so far this year.
189;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;AT&T-Time Warner ruling opens door for more media consolidation;DoJ’s loss will buoy ambitions of dealmakers seeking to stitch businesses together;Almost 140 people crammed into Richard Leon’s courtroom on Tuesday to hear his verdict on AT&T’s $80bn takeover of Time Warner. Wearing black robes and a red-and-white striped bow-tie, the judge gave the deal his blessing and excoriated the government’s evidence. As his audience of mostly lawyers and journalists rushed out with the news, media stocks shot up.Judge Leon’s decision capped a nearly two-year journey for the two companies, as well as six intense weeks in a Washington courthouse as the Department of Justice tried to show that the deal would harm competition. The government’s loss will buoy the ambitions of dealmakers seeking to stitch large media businesses together.Attention has already turned to Comcast, which unveiled a formal $65bn cash bid for most of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox on Wednesday. A bidding war between the Philadelphia-based group and its rival Walt Disney is likely to ensue for the Rupert Murdoch-controlled entertainment business.“This decision will have wide-reaching ramifications across the telecommunications, media and tech industry for decades to come,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights.The reshaping of the entertainment industry is likely to accelerate in the wake of Tuesday’s ruling, which did not force any divestments from AT&T or Time Warner. The media sector is in the midst of sweeping consolidation with the old guard — cable channel operators and TV distributors — racing to combine as new entrants as Netflix and Amazon take market share. The decision could affect strategy at media groups and former corporate stablemates CBS and Viacom, which this year held talks on remerging. Separately, it could coax a telecoms company such as Verizon or a cable distributor like Charter to bid for media assets. The entertainment industry has long been rife with dealmaking, with buyers trading Hollywood studios and other content producers seeking scale through acquisitions.Judge Leon’s 172-page opinion on the first big vertical merger litigation in decades detailed the government’s failure to build a convincing case. He said the justice department had not provided adequate evidence that mergers between content providers and distributors harmed competition, a finding that will reassure the likes of Comcast.“It’s a blow to the government in pursuing any other media mergers of this kind,” said George Hay, an antitrust professor at Cornell Law School, who said it would make the justice department less likely to challenge a Comcast takeover of Fox. “If they did, Comcast would know exactly what to do to win the case at trial.”The decision is a setback for Makan Delrahim, the justice department’s antitrust chief, who has argued vociferously that the government should seek structural solutions to competition concerns, for example divestments or outright blocking of deals. He has dismissed behavioural solutions, such as the arbitration mechanism AT&T pledged to handle pricing disputes, as ineffective.The higher-risk approach had failed to pay off in the case of AT&T, said Amy Ray, an antitrust partner at Cadwalader. “The DoJ may have to rethink whether its stance to pursue structural remedies first or only is the appropriate strategy in future merger reviews,” she said.The government faced an uphill battle in the case as vertical mergers, which combine companies with distinct roles in the supply chain for the same product, have long been viewed as pro-competitive when compared with horizontal mergers, in which companies eliminate direct competitors. Judge Leon’s ruling will serve as yet more evidence of the difficulty the government faces in challenging vertical deals.“The DoJ will have a harder time making a credible threat that it can take a vertical merger to trial and block it,” said Eric Mahr, a partner at Freshfields who previously served as the director of litigation for the DoJ’s antitrust division. “It will affect the negotiating dynamics.”Politics has swirled around the case since its announcement in 2016. On the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged to stop the deal going ahead, and after the justice department sued to block in November, AT&T attempted to argue that the decision was politically motivated. After the trial ended, it emerged that AT&T had paid Michael Cohen, Mr Trump’s personal lawyer, for advice on the deal in 2017.Judge Leon kept the politics out of his courtroom, instead deciding to rule on the merits of the justice department’s evidence, which he found severely lacking. In court on Tuesday he said the government’s economic modelling was “founded on improper assumptions”. He also dismissed as “of little to no value” the evidence it provided to show prices would increase because of the combined company’s enhanced leverage over rivals.He rejected the government’s argument that AT&T and Comcast’s dominance of the telecommunications and entertainment market would lead them to squeeze out new, online-only networks. And he said of the government’s suggestion that AT&T-Time Warner would prevent other networks from using HBO as a promotional tool: “At the risk of stating the obvious, this is a gossamer-thin claim.”In his written opinion, Judge Leon noted the declining customer numbers of traditional networks and indicated he was persuaded by AT&T and Time Warner’s argument that they were seeking the deal to develop new products and better respond to the competitive threat from technology companies. “This is not a case containing direct, probative evidence of anti-competitive intent on the part of high-level executives within the merging company,” he wrote.His ruling required no remedies from the companies, although it did incorporate their commitment to arbitrate price disputes, the same mechanism he approved in 2011 when Comcast bought NBC Universal.The names of more than a dozen potential AT&T competitors dot the opinion, underlining the significant shifts under way in the media industry. The US judge name-checked investments by companies such as Apple and Netflix as well as the advent of new TV services, including Sony’s PlayStation Vue, Google’s YouTube TV and Hulu Live. He even quoted Bob Dylan: “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.”Logan Breed, a partner with law firm Hogan Lovells, said that point should not go unnoticed by dealmakers. He noted that the decision focused on how competition in the media industry had been in flux for some time. “That line of reasoning could have a much broader application,” Mr Breed said.The verdict was striking in how firmly Judge Leon found in favour of the two companies, whose courtroom defence was led by Daniel Petrocelli. However, in a courthouse lift after the hearing, Paul Cappuccio, Time Warner’s general counsel, raised with Mr Petrocelli one omission from Judge Leon’s comments. “He didn’t say how handsome you were,” he joked.
190;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-06-11T03:06:55Z;Broadcasters agree £125m Freeview deal to combat Netflix threat;BBC, ITV and Channel 4 collaborate in response to changing viewer habits;The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 have agreed a new deal to invest in Freeview, the free digital television service, in response to sweeping changes in audience behaviour and competition from streaming operators such as Netflix and Amazon.The three broadcasters, together with Arqiva, which owns and operates the national transmitter network, have sealed a £125m, five-year deal to develop new services for Freeview, including an app that will allow viewers to watch programming from the broadcasters live and on demand.Proponents of public service broadcasting hope the investment will lead to more collaboration between channels, including a Netflix-style service that aggregates all available content from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4.Pressure is building on the three organisations to work more closely together in the face of competition from Netflix and Amazon, which have vastly greater spending power. Sharon White, chief executive of Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, recently called on them to “collaborate to compete”.When competitors like Netflix are spending $8bn a year on content and $1bn a year on engineering, we need to think about what is good for the consumer and the creative industriesCarolyn McCall and Alex Mahon, the new chief executives of ITV and Channel 4, have also talked of the need to join forces in an increasingly competitive marketplace.“When competitors like Netflix are spending $8bn a year on content and $1bn a year on engineering, we need to think about what is good for the consumer and the creative industries, and where we should work together to make sure those values of public service broadcasting are best served in the UK,” said Ms Mahon recently.Channel 4 also is working with the BBC to lobby for the prominence of public service broadcasting content in the user interfaces and programme guides of new streaming services.“This new commitment from our shareholders is a major boost for UK viewers,” said Jonathan Thompson, chief executive of Digital UK, which runs the Freeview platform. Further collaboration between the broadcasters would “safeguard free-to-view TV” and “reinvent it for a new age of viewing”.As viewers “cut the cord” and cancel pricey pay-TV subscriptions, free-to-air terrestrial television has become increasingly important, with viewers taking Freeview alongside a subscription to Amazon or Netflix. Today, more than 11m homes use free-to-air terrestrial services — 1m more than in early 2016, according to BARB, the standard for TV measurement in the UK.Pay-TV operators in the US and Europe are grappling with shifting audience trends and the move towards lower cost “skinny bundles” of channels. According to BARB, the number of homes with a Sky satellite subscription has fallen by 400,000 since early 2016 — although this has been offset by sales of its cheaper NOW TV package.Netflix has more than 125m subscribers worldwide, of which about 8m are in the UK, and recently passed Walt Disney as the world’s most valuable media company. Amazon has more than 100m subscribers worldwide to its Prime video service.This article has been amended after a comment by Ms Mahon was wrongly attributed to Ms McCall.
191;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-06-01T22:28:02Z;Tech stocks hit record highs as trade war fears bite;Gains in 2018 for NYSE Fang+ index at 26% as investors view sector as less susceptible;The shares of Amazon, Netflix and other companies known as Faangs have rallied to fresh highs as the focus of investors has shifted from concerns about internet privacy and heightened regulation in the tech sector to worries about trade tariffs.Transatlantic trade tensions escalated on Friday as the EU vowed to respond to US President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium with measures of its own, while leaders from Canada and Mexico also prepared retaliatory duties.“The trade war discussion is resulting in folks hiding in Faang stocks,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.The NYSE Fang+ index rose 2.5 per cent to a new high on Friday, taking the year-to-date gain to 26 per cent. The group originally given the moniker included Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, formerly known as Google, but has since expanded to include Apple. The index also includes other high-profile tech companies such as Twitter, Nvidia and Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba.Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Apple closed at record highs on Friday.The outsized performance stands in contrast to the S&P 500, which is up little more than 2 per cent in 2018 and failed to test its January high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has added 9.4 per cent this year and sits about 1 per cent below its March high.“The feeling is let’s go with what is working and what has been working is Faangs,” Mr Arone added. “We are uncertain as to what the future holds as it relates to tariffs and investors cannot determine the impact on industrials and other sectors like steel and aluminium because of all the back and forth.”JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, agreed. “Certain sectors are more susceptible than others [to trade tension] and you go to the ones that are less susceptible,” he said. “Tech seems to be less susceptible — right now.”Investors are again embracing tech stocks after a sharp sell-off in March when privacy concerns translated into fears that regulators would step up oversight of these groups or even that they had become powerful enough to be broken up.Facebook and other shares came under pressure after reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis company employed by Mr Trump’s presidential campaign, mined the personal data of 50m Facebook users.Tech stocks on Friday got an added boost from news that Fiat Chrysler planned to invest €9bn into new electric models.Also on Friday, UBS analysts raised their price target on Apple to $210 from $190.
192;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-05-28T10:49:29Z;Pay ratios: Faangs for the money;Inconsistent methodologies mean ratios are proving to be nonsensical;The average Alphabet employee is paid almost $200,000. Chief executive Larry Page gets by on $1 a year — his finances helped by $43bn of Alphabet stock, the result of co-founding the world’s dominant search engine.These facts emerged last month in an Alphabet filing, which disclosed the company’s ratio of chief executive pay to that of the median employee was “1:197,274 or 0.000005”. It is not quite the expected result when Congress ordered the disclosure in 2010. The ratios were supposed to be the other way around and, well, less silly. Companies carp about “logistical nightmares” of working out the pay ratio rule and stiff opposition meant it has taken eight years of wrangling for the law to come into force. The results are now dribbling out in filings. It is true that the methodologies are inconsistent, making it hard to compare like with like. At Facebook, possibly Alphabet’s closest peer, the ratio looks less like an internet company than a Minnesota jam manufacturer, 37:1. What explains the difference — does Mark Zuckerberg take a large salary? Is the average Facebooker underpaid? No, and hardly. Like Mr Page, Mr Zuckerberg also takes a nominal salary, and the average Facebook employee makes even more than their friends seven miles down the road at the Googleplex: $240,430. It is just that Facebook has included Mr Zuckerberg’s huge $8.9m security costs in his compensation number.And the other Faangs? Netflix has a ratio of 133 to 1. Chief executive Reed Hastings is on $24.4m and the median employee paid $183,304. The outlier is Amazon. On a ratio of 59 to 1, the median worker is paid only $28,446. Perhaps not surprisingly, the ratios themselves are proving to be nonsensical. The median employee pay, however, is fascinating. Amazon is obviously the odd one out. As an ecommerce company, which now owns supermarket chain Whole Foods, its median employee’s pay is closer to that of Walmart ($19,177) than the other three internet giants. One extra element of distortion, though: the median pay is calculated using the grant date fair value of stock. Amazon’s shares have risen more than 60 per cent in 12 months. Netflix has more than doubled. The stock-earning employees of those companies do not feel like the poor relations to Alphabet and Facebook.Do these pay ratios provide any better a picture of pay inequality at US companies? Or should regulators focus on executive pay? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below. 
193;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-05-25T03:00:48Z;Liberty Media thinks digital to attract younger Formula One fans;The sport is ‘well positioned to increase in value’, F1 boss Chase Carey tells the FT;It is almost 18 months since Liberty Media completed its acquisition of Formula One and Chase Carey was installed as the sport’s new boss. The moves brought an end to Bernie Ecclestone’s long tenure in charge of F1 and ushered in a new era for its teams, star drivers and fans.Carey has spent his career at the pinnacle of the media industry and for many years was Rupert Murdoch’s top lieutenant to the extent that the mogul once referred to him as his most “trusted adviser”. The former executive vice-chairman of Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox now has F1 to run and says it is well placed to grow, both in commercial terms and in the size of the audience it can attract.Liberty Media’s chance to buy, own and control a global sport was too good to pass up, he explains. This is, in part, because the media landscape is fragmenting: viewers with a plethora of online platforms to watch are increasingly less likely to sit down to watch so-called linear television — that is, scheduled programmes when they air. They will, however, with live sport.“In a world where digital technology is changing everything, [live] event content is gaining value as other forms of content become commoditised,” Carey notes. F1 “is well positioned to increase in value”.He has already introduced significant changes to the sport’s business operations. F1 did not have a marketing group when Liberty acquired it but does now and new sponsors have come on board. There is also a much bigger emphasis on digital technology and how that can bring in new fans — particularly younger ones.CVC, the private equity firm that sold Formula One to Liberty, “had a short term view” in terms of the sport’s commercial prospects and F1’s previous management had a similar outlook, he says. “Formula One was underserved by a continued focus on the deal of the day.” Planning for the future and expanding its reach and appeal is now the biggest priority, as is the creation of a “shared vision” that its various stakeholders — the teams, drivers, fans and commercial partners — can buy into.“We’ve tried to put in place an organisation that can grow the sport,” he says. “We have a marketing group now, a digital organisation, a hospitality group . . . we’ve tried to build a meaningful long term vision.”A continued focus on the deal of the day did not serve Formula One wellCarey speaks the language of the modern media executive and his approach is a far cry from Ecclestone’s freewheeling style. In stressing a shared vision for F1’s multiple stakeholders, Carey represents a departure from the days when the sport was characterised as, as he puts it, “every man for himself”.He is not to be underestimated. Few of his peers in media command as much respect as Carey for, not least at 21st Century Fox, his dealmaking experience and battle hardened skills at the negotiating table — which may explain why Liberty was so keen to get him on board. Run by chief executive Greg Maffei and controlled by the pugnacious Denver-based billionaire John Malone, known as the “Cable Cowboy” for the outsized role he played in consolidating the US media sector, Liberty has a reputation for canny deals. Maffei is known for turning a $12,500 investment that Liberty had in Sirius, the satellite radio group, into a holding worth more than $16bn.At Formula One, Carey says he likes what he has seen since taking over as chief executive. “We feel encouraged by the support. One of the realities of a sport like this is it’s a big ecosystem. There are the teams, the sponsors, the broadcasters, the FIA . . . each respects the view of the sport as a whole but each comes at it from a unique angle.”One of his biggest priorities is reaching new audiences and he rattles off a list of initiatives, including an “e-sports” league contested by F1 teams and a Netflix series that is documenting the life of the teams as the Grand Prix circuit moves around the world. “They are going to film a lot of what goes on around the sport.” There are other new promotional efforts, such as ancillary events that have been put on in cities staging grands prix. “We had an event in Trafalgar Square last year and a fan festival in the centre of Shanghai . . . it creates the excitement and energy. Whether it’s online or events, it creates an ability to attract fans to the sport.”Analysts agree that F1 has the potential to attract new fans. “There’s an opportunity to build the sport in new markets,” says Ben Swinburne, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley. F1 can also use streaming technology to “maximise the media rights of the business”, he adds. The growth of on-demand streaming has reshaped the media landscape and owners of exclusive sports rights — such as F1 — have an opportunity to sell their coverage directly to consumers, rather than via a cable or broadcasting middleman. “It’s probably the single biggest change in the marketplace, in that you have global consumer adoption of [streaming] video services,” says Swinburne. “It’s a change in the landscape that wasn’t there before.”These and other opportunities are being explored by Carey, who has set a target date of 2020 for the full implementation of the plans he has in mind for F1, including a new grand prix in Miami. “Our focus isn’t on what we can do in the next three months,” he says. “This is an organisational start-up and a business turnround [story]. But it’s a great franchise with great potential.”
194;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-05-24T15:30:38Z;Netflix passes Disney to become most valuable US media company;Symbolic moment of transition as the pair go head to head in video streaming;Netflix’s market capitalisation briefly surpassed that of the Walt Disney Co on Thursday, making the streaming service the most valuable media company in the US.The move marks a symbolic moment of transition, as a Silicon Valley company focused entirely on digital TV and movies is seen as more valuable by investors than one of the most famous names in Hollywood.After years of wary collaboration, the two companies are about to become head-on competitors. Disney is preparing to launch a new streaming service for TV and movies in the coming months, and said it would remove some of its content from Netflix when its current deals expire. In April, it launched ESPN+, a new sports-focused streaming service, in its first move to take its programming direct to consumers.The two companies’ values were just a few hundred million dollars apart on Thursday morning, as their share prices continued to fluctuate during intraday trading. At around 11am in New York, Netflix had climbed just over 1 per cent to $348.43, giving it a market capitalisation of $151.9bn. Disney, down 1 per cent, was worth $151.6bn.Netflix shares have added more than 70 per cent so far this year, bolstered by better than expected subscriber numbers and key content deals with former US president Barack Obama and top US TV creator Ryan Murphy.The streaming service had already closed at a new record high on Wednesday giving it a valuation above Comcast, as Netflix climbed 4 per cent on news of its multimillion-dollar deal with the Obamas. Comcast was down 1 per cent to a market capitalisation of $145bn on Thursday morning, after the cable operator and NBCUniversal parent said this week it was looking to take on Disney in a battle for Fox’s entertainment assets.
195;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-05-21T16:56:22Z;Obamas strike multiyear production deal with Netflix;Agreement covers scripted and unscripted series, documentaries and feature films;Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have signed their first big media deal since leaving the White House with Netflix, bringing the former US president to the streaming service that produced American political drama House of Cards.It is the latest high-profile signing for Netflix after recent deals with Shonda Rhimes, who produced Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, and Glee creator Ryan Murphy.The Obamas have struck a “multiyear” agreement with Netflix that could include both scripted and unscripted series, documentaries and feature films, the company announced on Monday. The couple have formed a new production company, Higher Ground Productions, to create the shows.“We hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world,” Mr Obama said.Mrs Obama added: “Netflix’s unparalleled service is a natural fit for the kinds of stories we want to share, and we look forward to starting this exciting new partnership.”Netflix provides the couple with a platform to reach 125m people around the world. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said he was “incredibly proud” they had chosen to work with the Silicon Valley-based company.“Barack and Michelle Obama are among the world’s most respected and highly-recognised public figures and are uniquely positioned to discover and highlight stories of people who make a difference in their communities and strive to change the world for the better,” he said.It is unclear how overtly political the Obamas’ shows for Netflix will be. The New York Times reported on Monday that the former president has told associates he would not “wage a public campaign” against President Donald Trump or conservative broadcasters such as Fox News.In March, Netflix named to its board Susan Rice, the former UN ambassador and national security adviser under the Obama administration. The move angered some American right wingers, who called for a boycott of the streaming service.Netflix stock was trading 1.6 per cent higher on Monday after the Obama deal was announced. The company’s market capitalisation of $143bn is now just $12bn behind that of Walt Disney Company, America’s most valuable media group.
196;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Drug war drama reignites debate over Duterte’s violent crackdown;Critics say series being screened on Netflix glorifies Philippines vigilante squads;"A teenage boy is running down the alleyway of a Manila slum, under the sulphurous, menacing glow of street lights.Police cars, their lights flashing and sirens blaring, close in and catch him along with another suspect, who is handcuffed, hooded, and bundled away to an uncertain fate. “Just come with us, you bastard!” one of the policemen says.The scene is similar to those played out most nights in the Philippines since President Rodrigo Duterte began his violent crackdown on narcotics in 2016. Human rights groups say police or armed vigilantes have killed more than 12,000 people, using what they describe as summary justice and indiscriminate force.However, this is drama — the work of the award-winning Filipino director Brillante Mendoza, a supporter of Mr Duterte whose series Amo is streaming on Netflix. The production has brought mixed reactions in the Philippines, Mr Duterte has endorsed the series, saying it gave a “glimpse of the dark world of drugs” and suggesting it confirmed his hardline policies.“You go to the internet, you go to the documentaries, there’s the Amo, locally produced,” he said in a speech in Manila’s Malacanang presidential palace. “It’s what I’ve been telling you all along.”Critics, however, accuse it of endorsing — even glorifying — the brutal crackdown. The discussion has rekindled debate about the anti-drug campaign, and the narratives, imagery, and language Filipinos use to approach it.“Amo is a deliberate whitewash of a mass killing campaign by the Philippines National Police targeting urban slum dwellers, incited and instigated by Duterte and his most senior officers,” said Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.“I would like to ask you to cancel this show,” Luzviminda Siapo, whose 19-year-old son was gunned down in the crackdown wrote in a petition to Netflix that has garnered more than 10,000 signatures. “War on drugs is not the solution.”Her son Raymart, 19, was gunned down in Manila in March 2017 by masked men riding motorbikes in a case that was widely reported at the time. A witness at the scene heard one of the men tell Raymart, who was born with club feet, to run away, before he was shot twice in the head. The killing came a day after a neighbour accused the boy of peddling marijuana.The controversy over Amo’s screening on Netflix comes as the crackdown nears its two-year anniversary, the number of reported deaths begins to level off, and opponents and supporters of the president process it through film, TV shows, and art. Netflix said the series was part of its “diverse choice of content for our members, who will decide on what, where and when they want to watch”. A spokeswoman said in an emailed statement: “There are times viewers may have opposing opinions, but [we] leave it to them to decide.”In the Philippines, the series was produced by local network TV5 last year, but its release was delayed until last month. Amo launched for global distribution on Netflix on April 9, and debuted on TV5 in its home market from April 21.“I don’t really impose my own philosophies; I just show the truth and let people decide for themselves,” Mr Mendoza told the FT. “Just because I support the president, I don’t have to impose all my views about what the president is doing.”Using cinéma vérité style, the series tells the story of a teenaged drug dealer, Joseph Molina. The narrative then widens out to focus on bigger fish: a Japanese drug lord who is murdered by corrupt police, who then cover the crime up.Mr Mendoza said he based the series on research he drew from police and others in Mandaluyong, the inner Manila neighbourhood where his studio is. Actors were provided with outline scripts and general scenarios, allowing them to ad-lib dialogue.The series has garnered mixed reviews in the Philippines, where the website Rappler, which has been critical of Mr Duterte, dismissed it as “comfort food dressed up as edgy crime drama”.“Amo doesn’t fit into the binary narrative between those who want to demonise the drug war, and those who want to celebrate it,” said Antonio Contreras, professor of political science at Manila’s De La Salle University who described himself as an “independent-minded” supporter of Mr Duterte. Polls show that both the narcotics crackdown and the president enjoy the support of a large majority of Filipinos.Opponents of the anti-drug crackdown — many of whom object to the use of the word “war” say the series distorts reality by downplaying police excesses. “In the Amo universe, summary killings are infrequent, targeted at confirmed criminals, and committed by ‘bad apples’,” said Mr Kine.In 2016, Mr Mendoza drew both praise and derision for his unorthodox direction of Mr Duterte’s first State of the Nation Address, which included dramatic shots of the president from below, and which some critics compared with Leni Riefenstahl’s 1935 cinematic tribute to Hitler, Triumph of the Will.The director declined to comment on the comparison, but said: “I think I can face God right now at this moment, and my conscience is clear.” Mr Mendoza added: “Whatever I do for the government, I do because I ultimately want change.”Additional reporting by Guill Ramos*This story has been amended since first publication to correct the timing of Amo’s respective releases on Netflix and TV5."

Michael C Hall of Dexter fame plays Tom, widowed father of two daughters, the eldest of whom, Jenny, is playing up in typical teenage fashion. He’s trying not to confront her about older boyfriend, Chris, 19, but reveals to Tom’s best mate Pete (an inscrutable Marc Warren) that he’s intercepting all her texts just in case. “People are entitled to their secrets,” objects Pete, giving fair warning of the multiplying motives to come.Nearby, the parents of Jenny’s friend Sia have planned a romantic getaway. “No parties!” growls her rough diamond dad Jojo (Nigel Lindsay) on his way out. Hardly has the car swung down the drive before the local dealer drops off, and droves of scantily clad drunken teens arrive, among them Chris and Jenny, neither of whom make it home that night. Chris’s dad is convinced his son’s merely gone off in a huff, but Tom is frantic with worry about his daughter, calling on his secret love interest, Sophie, a capable police detective (Amanda Abbington). Her colleague Emma, (Hannah Arterton), is new to this supposedly sleepy beat, and brings a tough metropolitan edge to the case of the missing girl. Meanwhile, far from the cops’ prying eyes, the amateurish disposal of a body brings a tone of nightmarish slapstick.★★★★☆"

Energy companies account for 12 per cent of the S&P 500 Value index, only second to financials at 25 per cent.Investors embraced the shares of energy companies with Andeavor (being bought by Marathon Petroleum), Newfield Exploration, Valero Energy, Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources among the top performers in the S&P 500 in April.“At the same time I had the energy story, I had industrials falling and financials were flat,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank.“Given the size of financials within the value groups, it is financials that have to move to have a sustained rotation from growth to value,” he added.Financial shares fell 0.5 per cent in April and industrials lost 2.9 per cent. Tech eked out a 0.03 per cent rise.Consumer staples, which make up 11 per cent of the value index, were the worst performers in April, dragged down by losses at stocks of Philip Morris, Kraft Heinz and Procter & Gamble.Value beat growth in March as well, and six out of the past 12 months based on S&P 500 indices, but remains a long-term laggard in performance to growth.“Value in a broad sense has been underperforming for over a decade,” said Tim Edwards, managing director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It is not supposed to guarantee returns in the short term but people have begun to question how much patience do you need.”Sharp gains for the shares of high-growth technology companies, particularly a handful of large groups known as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) have helped to propel growth investing styles in recent years.But tech shares have stumbled this year on concerns about privacy and heightened regulation.Tech accounts for 41 per cent of the S&P 500 growth index, while energy is also in the index but accounts for just 0.3 per cent.
199;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-22T16:27:21Z;Regulating Facebook merely nips at the edge of a bigger problem;Consumers are under surveillance in ways we have just begun to grapple with;"Quickly conceived conventional wisdom is a terrible side-effect of the age of high-speed media. Storylines develop rapidly, as news organisations chase the most clickable themes. Subtlety and nuance about complex issues are the casualties.Take, for example, the rash of recent pieces about how, in the wake of Mark Zuckerberg’s five-hour tech support call with Congress, Washington is finally going to get serious about curbing the big tech companies known collectively as Faangs: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. “Regulation is coming,” scream the headlines. “The Faangs are finished.”As the Financial Times’ San Francisco-based Richard Waters points out, the correction in some Faang stock prices will not stop these companies from growing. Meanwhile, most of the regulatory “fixes” being discussed merely nip at the edges of a massive problem.It is good that US politicians are trying to make social media platforms disclose the sources of political advertising and take responsibility for sex trafficking online. But does anyone really believe that slapping a few moderate regulations — ones that other businesses already have to deal with — on Facebook is going to solve the economic, political and social problems being caused by Big Tech?Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation goes much further on privacy, of course. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. The big tech companies exacerbate problems — from monopoly power to the need for a new tax and education system to declining faith in liberal democracy — that are not just technical. They are existential.In an ideal world, the structural shift from a tangible to an intangible economy would trigger deep thinking about digital property rights, trade regulations, civil liberties and so on. Policymakers would have robust conversations with experts from a broad range of disciplines about what the new framework for growth in the digital economy should look like.We do not live in that world. I worry that public anger engendered by the big tech companies, coupled with the desire of some politicians to score quick points, may well lead us into the sort of regulatory paradigm we saw in the financial sector post-2008.Lobbyists and vested interests on both sides of the political aisle came up with a complex stew of new laws. Some were good, some bad. The sheer complexity created plenty of loopholes for corporate lawyers to jump through. While risk-taking was curbed at some individual institutions, the system as a whole is no safer. We lost sight of the only question that mattered: how can we create a financial sector that serves the real economy?We need to ask the same question now about the digital sector. Whatever regulators choose to do to the Faangs themselves, the “data horse” has already bolted. Data have become the most valuable commodity in the world and, as such, companies of every stripe have joined the big tech groups in collecting it. Athletic brands are putting chips in our running shoes that can track where and how we jog. Goodyear embeds sensors in tyres that can beam information about drivers’ performance back to their fleet headquarters. Tractor company Deere & Co recently paid more than $300m for Blue River Tech-
nologies, a California start-up that uses deep machine learning to automate farm work. Algorithms stuffed with millions of pictures of cabbages can figure out which ones to spray with fertiliser and which to blast with herbicide.Companies in every industry are counting on artificial intelligence to drive growth over the next several years. A McKinsey Global Institute report estimates that AI deployable now could create between $3.5tn and $5.8tn annually in value for companies, with the biggest potential gains in areas such as sales and supply chain management. Anecdotally, many companies I have spoken to say machine learning is increasing their return on investment by anywhere from 10 to 30 per cent.But AI depends on data — the more of it you can stuff into the algorithms, the smarter they become. That means both people and products are under surveillance in ways we have only just begun to grapple with, and not just by the Faangs.In Hawaii, the state tourism board has worked with online travel group Expedia to use facial recognition software to monitor travellers’ expressions. Users who opt in are monitored via computer webcams as they watch advertising for various kinds of vacations, and then given personalised offers.In Europe, such tactics may require disclosure. GDPR rules stipulate that citizens have the right, for example, to an explanation for some decisions that are made by machines. That is a smart idea in principle, as algorithms are only as good as the people who are programming them. And yet, EU-style data laws may lead to a trade-off between privacy and economic competitiveness when data are the new oil.We do not yet know the right balance. But two days of Congressional hearings starring Mr Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, have not helped us to come up with the answers. We need to take the time to grapple with the seismic shifts being wreaked by the digital economy in a deep and real way.rana.foroohar@ft.com"
200;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
201;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-20T21:59:14Z;Week in Review, April 21;"Strong results from US banks; Netflix and Unilever also in the news";"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Morgan Stanley completes strong quarter for Big SixMorgan Stanley chief James Gorman was enjoying himself so much on this week’s first-quarter earnings call that he began to do the analysts’ job for them, rattling off a list of things that did not go so well during the period, writes Ben McLannahan in New York.The underwriting calendar was “not phenomenal”, he said. Clients of the wealth management division did not trade much. The investment management division did not see many gains.“Not perfect,” he summarised. “We can definitely do better.”Still, this was a very strong quarter for the Wall Street bank, as it was for Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America— all of them benefiting from a pick-up in volatility that saw institutional traders pile back into the market. Combined net income at the big six US banks, including scandal-stricken Wells Fargo, was $6bn higher than a year ago, at $31.5bn.Can the banks keep it up? Probably not. As Susan Roth Katzke, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said, trading revenues are unlikely to continue growing at “anything close” to the scorching pace of the first quarter.But even if activity does sag a little, there’s plenty for the banks to which to look forward. Rising interest rates, for example, generally mean higher spreads between the yield on banks’ assets and the cost of their funds. And there are potential benefits for the banks in the way of financial deregulation. Last year the Treasury Department run by Steven Mnuchin — a former partner at Goldman — published three papers containing a total of 249 recommendations to loosen post-crisis restraints. More than 200 of them require no congressional action, on Barclays’ count.Last week saw two key developments on that front: a planned softening of the annual stress test in certain areas, especially for banks below $250bn in assets, and a plan to tweak calculations governing the “supplementary leverage ratio,” or the amount of capital banks must have compared to total assets.Moves like this are incremental, but the “aggregate impact is significant and growing,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director at the left-leaning group, Americans for Financial Reform.Netflix nears Walt Disney’s valuation on growth hopesNetflix’s valuation is closing in on the market capitalisation of rival Walt Disney after another firm set of results lifted the company’s shares this week and it looks to expand globally, writes Tim Bradshaw in Los Angeles.Disney’s market cap was just above $150bn for much of the week, while Netflix has been just below $145bn.Netflix has become the best performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, up 74 per cent in just over four months, including a 9 per cent jump on Tuesday alone. Revenues grew 40 per cent to $3.7bn for the first quarter — its fastest year-on-year growth rate since the DVD-by-mail company introduced its online video service 11 years ago.Netflix now has 125m users worldwide, more than Amazon’s 100m Prime
members.By the middle of 2018, Netflix expects subscribers from outside the US to outnumber those in its home market for the first time.As its audience becomes more global, so too is Netflix’s investment in content. The company plans to more than double its European spending on original content this year to about $1bn, according to people briefed on the plans. The move to accelerate its programming across the continent will add more pressure to traditional broadcasters who, like Disney, are racing to respond to fast-rising competition from online video outlets.Unilever plans €6bn share buyback after sales dipThe Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever announced plans this week for a share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend, as it revealed quarterly sales figures that highlighted pressure on prices in key markets, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu in London.The producer of Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise reported €12.6bn of sales in the three months to the end of March. The 5.2 per cent drop on the same quarter last year was caused primarily by the strength of the euro against the dollar and currencies in Brazil, Indonesia and India — Unilever’s three biggest emerging markets.Unilever plans to start buying back €6bn worth of shares starting next month using the proceeds of the sale of its spreads division to buyout group KKR.Pinar Ergun, an analyst at UBS, said: “We expect investors to welcome Unilever’s volume growth and the buyback announcement.”But shares were flat against a backdrop of investor worries that large consumer companies were finding it harder to charge higher prices because of supermarket and online price wars."
202;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-20T18:17:05Z;Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief with a global vision;His international outlook has disrupted the television industry and our viewing habits;The dozens of teenage fans amassed outside a hotel in Rome this week might have been waiting for a glimpse of a visiting pop star or Hollywood actor. Instead, they were there for the stars of an original Spanish language Netflix series. Set in Barcelona, La Casa De Papel has made global stars of its cast, underscoring the impact of the streaming service on television viewing habits and tastes around the world.Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, was also in Rome. While not subject to screams from adoring teenage fans he was very much the centre of attention. Netflix unveiled a big increase in European investment: the company will more than double its production spend in Europe to about $1bn this year, producing 100 programmes in 16 countries — a push that is attracting growing numbers of subscribers outside its core US market.At its quarterly results Netflix revealed that it had hit 125m subscribers with 69m of those now coming from outside the US— a number that exceeded analyst expectations and lifted its share price to a record high. Netflix now has a market value of $146bn, making it more valuable than GE, IBM and Nike and only slightly less valuable than Walt Disney.“We’re not valued as we are because of that 125m,” Mr Hastings told the Financial Times. He pointed to the 700m households that pay for television and fixed-line broadband around the world, excluding China, as well as the 2bn people that use YouTube — the inference being that there is a lot of market share for Netflix still to grab.He and Netflix have avoided the regulatory and political scrutiny experienced by his Silicon Valley compatriots at Google and Facebook (where Mr Hastings is a board member) mainly because Netflix does not need advertising and makes its money selling subscriptions. But he has been no less disruptive.Netflix, which he co-founded in 1997, has upended the market for video entertainment, moving from a licensing model, where it paid channels for the rights to their programmes, to becoming a fully-fledged producer of its own material with its own distribution network. It outbid traditional channels to buy shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror and introduced global audiences to on-demand viewing for a monthly price that does not require a costly cable or satellite subscription. This year it will produce 700 original titles, including hundreds of series and 80 full-length feature films — about four times an many as most Hollywood studios.It has also been entirely global in its approach. Mr Hastings and his colleagues realised early on that the company needed to acquire all international rights to its series to free it from the limits that beset the traditional television market, where shows are produced in one country and then licensed to others.Born Wilmot Reed Hastings in Boston, he was raised on the US east coast, where his father worked for Richard Nixon’s administration as an attorney for the department of health, education and welfare. The younger Mr Hastings attended Bowdoin, a liberal arts college in Maine, where he studied maths, before specialising in computer science at Stanford.Science runs in the family: his paternal great-grandfather was Alfred Lee Loomis, a noted physicist who invented the Aberdeen chronograph, a device that measured ordnance muzzle velocity — and which would become widely used by the US navy during the second world war.Netflix’s push into original production has turned it into one of the entertainment industry’s biggest players but its chief admits to not being very preoccupied with Tinseltown. “What’s in the back and front of my mind is sharing the world’s best content, whether that’s Japanese anime, Turkish telenovelas, the film noir of the Nordics,” he says. “I’ve never been very Hollywood-centric.”This international outlook may be explained by the time he spent abroad as a young man, first at the University of Bath, where he studied as part of an exchange programme, and then the time he spent with the Peace Corps between his stints at Bowdoin and Stanford. “I was a volunteer right out of college and was in Swaziland for two and a half years at a rural high school teaching O-level maths,” he told the FT this week. “That gives you a [different] sense.”Despite the company’s rocketing share price, the path to international streaming success has not all been plain sailing. Seven years ago Netflix said it would separate its streaming business from its original DVD-by-mail service, which would be renamed Qwikster. Mr Hastings revealed at the time that he shared the news with a friend while relaxing in a jacuzzi: “That’s awful,” the friend replied — an apt assessment, given that Netflix’s shares crashed.The plan was hastily abandoned and its first hit in-house production, House of Cards, premiered a year later. This set in motion a global push that has launched Netflix’s valuation — and Mr Hastings own stake, now worth an estimated $4bn — into the stratosphere.“Change comes slowly and often with resistance,” Mr Hastings said, as the company unveiled its new European programming, ranging from The Rain, a Danish science fiction series, to The English Game, a drama about the invention of football written by Downton Abbey’s Julian Fellowes. “There are so many great stories around the world . . . we want to make them available to everybody.”The writer is the FT’s global media editorBig tech’s roots lie in the Banyan tree model / From Akanksha Awal, St John’s College, Oxford, UK
203;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-19T10:50:16Z;The end is far from nigh for the Faangs era ;Regulatory risks will not stop big tech race to give world its first $1tn company;What do you do if you are a corporate leader and US President Donald Trump is hell-bent on attacking your company?If you’re Jeff Bezos, you talk about handstands. That was what the Amazon chief executive chose to focus on in his annual letter to shareholders, which came out late on Wednesday. More precisely, he wrote about the hard work it takes to achieve high standards (apparently you will never do the perfect handstand after only two weeks of practice).The singular focus that has always been the hallmark of Mr Bezos’s management style has a point. At a moment of maximum potential distraction, it pays to stick to the knitting. Under fire from the White House and facing growing antitrust risk? Keep talking about your corporate aspirations and what you do for customers. In 20 years of annual letters, the Amazon boss has barely done anything else.There has certainly been no shortage of distraction. The prospect of new regulations on big tech companies has turned from an inchoate Wall Street fear to a racing certainty: it is just a question of what and when. And the volatility that has swept through the stock market has led to predictions that the days when big tech led the market inexorably higher are at an end. It has been very tempting to declare an end to the era of the “Faangs”, the group of tech stocks that also includes Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google.Not so fast. Even with so many new risks, when the big tech companies report their latest earnings over the next two weeks they are unlikely to show any let-up in the headlong growth that has underpinned the long bull market. And despite the volatility, stock market expectations are still lofty. Apple’s share price is only 3 per cent beneath its all-time high and the company is within shouting distance of becoming the first to be worth more than $1tn.Apple’s stock, however, has undulated with the iPhone product cycles— moving steadily higher from one cycle to the next, but falling back after each new leap. It is not yet clear if the iPhone X will be enough to lift Apple past $1tn.If it does not make it on this iPhone cycle, there is a fair chance it will eventually be overtaken on the way to the magic number. Midway through this week, the stock market values of Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft were all within 1 per cent of each other, at close to $740bn. But there has been no shortage of analysts available and willing to make a case why each of these companies is on course to hit the $1tn mark sooner rather than later.UBS, for instance, argues that Alphabet’s prospects — which it puts at $1.1tn — are “heavily skewed to the upside”, thanks to a bigger pay-off than most are expecting from faster-growing businesses such as YouTube and cloud computing.Then there’s Morgan Stanley on Microsoft: the software company’s surging cloud business and improving profit margins point to “a $1tn market cap”, the bank says. And do not forget Amazon. According to research firm GBH, the $1tn valuation will not come “overnight” but “the path is now set for this to occur over the next 12 to 18 months”.It is tempting to put such predictions down to Wall Street boosterism. But the growth at scale that each of these companies has displayed has seldom been seen. Mr Bezos disclosed on Wednesday, for instance, that Amazon’s Prime service has more than 100m subscribers, the first time he has publicly confirmed a number. That is a huge — and growing — base of customers with big incentives to do a disproportionate amount of their spending with Amazon.But there are also bigger forces at work. A platform shift is under way in the tech world, and it is being led by companies other than Apple. The mobile revolution that was touched off by the iPhone is 11 years old. The computing era is coming into sight. It is one that depends heavily on the cloud, with artificial intelligence the driving force behind the next generation of advanced applications.Between them, Amazon, Microsoft and, more recently, Google, have seized leadership in this area. Led by Google, these companies have also developed the strongest capabilities in AI.It is not clear who the biggest winners in the AI era will be, or where the most value will be created. But there is a good chance that, before it is over, it will give rise to at least one trillion-dollar tech company.
204;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-18T17:08:56Z;Netflix plots $1bn European investment drive;US streaming service will double production budget in region in 2018;Netflix will escalate its assault on European broadcasters by sharply increasing its content investment across the continent, with plans to spend about $1bn on original productions this year.According to people briefed on the investment plans, the revised budget will be more than double that of last year. The company will expand both its English and foreign language offerings, with new dramas going into production in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Poland, Turkey and the Netherlands.The sharp increase, which will almost double the number of European productions this year, will have repercussions for traditional broadcasters who are already grappling with how to attract and retain viewers in the face of growing competition from Netflix as well as other streaming players such as Amazon.The company said this week that international revenues would exceed US sales for the first time this quarter. Netflix expects to spend as much as $8bn on original and licensed content in 2018, with most of that spent in the US.Netflix’s rapid expansion has already helped spark a wave of media mergers in the US and Europe as cable and satellite providers bulk up in order to lure back viewers who are increasingly “cutting the cable” and relying solely on streaming services for TV programming.AT&T aims to emulate Netflix’s global reach with its proposed acquisition of Time Warner — a deal that is being challenged by the US government — while Rupert Murdoch recently admitted his decision to sell the entertainment assets of his 21st Century Fox group to Walt Disney was due to his inability to compete with Netflix.Netflix shares hit new highs this week after its quarterly subscriber numbers topped 125m. Its market value hit $144bn, making it larger than General Electric and IBM, and only marginally smaller than Walt Disney.The company used a plush event at a villa in Rome to launch a slate of new series on Wednesday. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes is writing a Netflix drama about the invention of football and movie star Idris Elba is producing and starring in a new comedy.“Our belief is that great storytelling transcends borders,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer. The company was “committed to being a voice for European entertainment”, he added.The company, one of the so-called “Faangs”— a group of tech stocks that includes Facebook and Google — has attempted to win over European governments sceptical of the inroads it has made against state broadcasters by touting the jobs it creates through its work in Europe. It said current productions in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were generating employment for more than 35,000 people.Analysts have upgraded their price targets for Netflix, which has said it is targeting an international market of 700m broadband-enabled households. This figure excludes China, the only large market where Netflix does not operate, but includes 300m households in Europe, which is becoming an increasingly important market as the company attempts to sustain its rapid growth rate.“Higher global broadband penetration should increase Netflix’s addressable market, driving member growth and providing further opportunity,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote this week.More than 73m of Netflix subscribers come from outside the US, with the remainder based in its home market.“More investment in European productions is a welcome addition to the choice of content available to viewers,” said Jonathan Thompson, chief executive of Digital UK, which runs the UK’s free-to-air terrestrial TV network. “However, Netflix has a long way to go in matching the breadth and depth, and national relevance offered by UK broadcasters — particularly the public-service broadcasters.”
205;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Netflix performance burns hedge fund short sellers;Content provider and streaming platform is best performing stock in S&P 500 for 2018;Julian Robertson, the octogenarian stock picker, once described his job in disarmingly simple terms. All his Tiger hedge fund aimed to do was to buy shares in good companies while selling short, or betting against, shares in bad ones.Certain members of a younger generation of hedge fund managers are increasingly appearing as if they have got his simple maxim back to front. David Einhorn, a well-followed investor, has been doggedly betting against the shares of high-flying technology stocks such as Amazon and Netflix. At the same time he made big bets on struggling value stocks, expressing his gaping disbelief each quarter in letters to his clients as their performance fails to match the painful losses on his shorts.Since 2015, when Mr Einhorn not only berated Netflix’s cash-burning business model but went so far as to insult the script writers of House of Cards, the online video company’s shares are up by an eye-popping 574 per cent. The value of SunEdison, a company Mr Einhorn pitched as one of his top investment ideas in a public presentation in late 2014 ended up going to zero after it filed for bankruptcy protection.This week we have seen shares in Netflix surge even higher, helping the company overtake the equity market value of old tech stock IBM, and come closer to surpassing the value of the aristocrats of content, Walt Disney. Netflix shares are the best performing in the S&P 500 this year, up 74 per cent in just over four months.Netflix shares appear very expensive, valued at more than 10 times sales, but hedge fund managers who remain short must ask themselves is it really worth the pain trying to be a hero? They are meant to be paid to identify the most profitable investments for their clients, not to put money on the line for the sake of intellectual bragging rights.Debate over whether shares in fast-growing but mostly profit-lacking companies, such as Netflix, are egregiously overvalued or not will continue to rage. But in a world where there are hundreds of far worse companies for short sellers to choose from, such as outright frauds or melting ice cubes, hedge fund cynics may finally decide there are easier ways to make money than by betting against Netflix.miles.johnson@ft.com
206;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-17T20:40:12Z;Netflix binge powers Wall Street’s winning day;;Stranger Things have happened than a solid day for Wall Street powered by Netflix, which in turn handed the Fang stocks their biggest one-day advance in more than two-and-a-half years.Netflix closed up 9.2 per cent to a record high of $336.06 after delivering a forecast-busting set of results after the closing bell on Monday. It was the stock’s second-biggest one-day jump in 2018, and also its 10th-biggest of the past five years.That helped push up the NYSE Fang index, which tracks some of the market’s most popular tech stocks, up 3.7 per cent. It was the gauge’s biggest advance since late August 2015 in sessions that were also powered by gains for Netflix.The S&P 500 closed 1.1 per cent higher, with the technology sector the best performer with a 2.3 per cent gain. Next best were consumer cyclicals, up 1.6 per cent, and basic materials, up 1.1 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.9 per cent and flicked into positive territory for the year, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.7 per cent.Goldman Sachs and Johnson & Johnson both reported forecast-beating first-quarter results on Tuesday morning, but closed 1.6 per cent and 0.9 per cent lower, respectively.Southwest Airlines finished 1.1 per cent lower. A federal regulator said Tuesday that one person died after an engine failed on a Southwest flight and forced it to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia.Despite the gains for shares, longer-dated US Treasuries still managed to advance. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to price, on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was down 0.9 basis points to 2.823 per cent, although the more policy-sensitive two-year Treasury was up 1.3 bps to 2.3898 per cent.
207;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-17T15:17:45Z;Netflix overseas sales to surpass US home market;Net income surges 63% to $290m as subscriber growth outstrips expectations;Netflix expects international revenues to exceed sales from its home market of the US for the first time in the current quarter after the streaming service’s latest subscriber numbers beat forecasts.The milestone comes as Reed Hastings, chief executive, suggested on Monday that Netflix’s business model meant it was “substantially inoculated” from the legal and regulatory battles that tech companies are increasingly facing around the world over issues such as data privacy.“I’m very glad that we built the business not to be ad-supported [and] to be subscription,” Mr Hastings, who sits on Facebook’s board, said in an analyst interview.He also pointed to the $10bn that Netflix plans to spend over the next year in content and marketing, compared with $1.3bn on technology. “Objectively we are much more of a media company, in that way, than pure tech,” he said. “Of course, we want to be great at both but again, we are really pretty different from the pure tech companies.”Even as stocks such as Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon have come under pressure in recent weeks amid rising legal risks, Netflix has surged. Shares jumped more than 7 per cent in early trading on Tuesday to hit an all-time high.For the first quarter, the digital entertainment group posted net additional subscribers of 7.4m, compared with about 5m that most analysts were expecting, to reach a total of 125m members. There are so many competitors especially around the world. If we get lazy or slow we’ll get run over just like anybody elseRevenues were up 40 per cent to $3.7bn in the three months to March, the fastest quarterly year-on-year increase it has posted since introducing its online streaming service. Net income rose 63 per cent to $290m. The jump came from a combination of last year’s price rise, driving a 14 per cent increase in average selling price, coupled with faster than expected subscriber growth. The quarter saw the debut of new series including a second season of Marvel’s Jessica Jones and the splashy sci-fi drama Altered Carbon. Its revenue outlook for the second quarter was just ahead of Wall Street’s previous estimates at $3.9bn, with 6.2m net additional subscribers. International streaming revenues will hit $1.94bn in the second quarter, Netflix said in its outlook, compared with $1.9bn for the US.The Silicon Valley-based company already has more members overseas — international subscribers overtook the US in the second quarter of 2017 — but customers typically pay more in its most developed markets.A more global business also means a wider range of rivals, from traditional broadcasters to local streaming services. Netflix is producing original content in 17 different markets and expects an increasing number of those films and shows, such as the Brazilian sci-fi series 3%, to be viewed globally.“There are so many competitors especially around the world,” Mr Hastings said. “If we get lazy or slow we’ll get run over just like anybody else.”That would mean this year’s $8bn budget for TV shows and movies would continue to grow, he added. Observers lauded the company’s latest results, with analysts at Baird asking: “Can anything slow its subscriber momentum?”Baird forecasts Netflix will reach 300m global subscribers by 2025 but predicts that the company will not achieve free cash flow break-even until 2024, as it continues to invest heavily in content and marketing. Netflix’s cash outflows are expected to be as much as $4bn this year.Most analysts, however, are confident that investors will continue to stomach the losses so long as Netflix continues to increase membership.“Netflix’s programming win streak continues and it wields its large content acquisition budget as a weapon to put greater distance between itself and its competitors,” said Credit Suisse in a note. “Given the accelerated pace of subscriber additions, we believe the Street will continue to underwrite the investments.”However, none of Netflix’s films will be up for an award at the Cannes Film Festival this year. The streaming service decided not to enter the awards because of a rule that, it said, means any film in competition at Cannes “cannot be watched on Netflix in France for the following three years”.Ted Sarandos, Netflix content chief, denied that this would affect the company’s ability to attract talent or win bids for new films.Netflix gave 33 films a theatrical release last year at the same time as they appeared online, five of which were nominated for Academy Awards.“It’s becoming more and more accepted as part of the distribution norm,” Mr Sarandos said. “Defining distribution by what room you see it in is not the business we want to be in.”
208;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-17T10:15:37Z;How to cram in more media;From Netflix to TED to podcasts, there are too few hours in the day — but help is at hand;I am a slow reader. I have dozens of books I believe I will read one day, yet almost certainly will not. I also have more than 100 eBooks on my iPad, most of them unread. If they were the extent of my backlog headache, I would not complain. But I have also saved dozens of unheard music albums, more than 100 unwatched films and television series, and a heap of audiobooks.To add to this silent pressure of unconsumed content, there are streaming services to miss out on. The Netflix, Amazon Prime, Now TV, BBC iPlayer, Tidal, TED and Spotify icons glare accusingly from iPad and laptop. When I am in the US, there is Hulu to worry about. Apple is reported to be working on a video streaming service of their own original shows.It is all positively panic-inducing. And still there is one genre of entertainment and information I have missed: podcasts. They may be hot, but how do people fit them into their lives on top of all the other media?I spent a long weekend in upstate New York last month with four 30-somethings: my daughter, her husband and their friends. One of the main topics of conversation was podcasts. Recommendations bounced around, with me frantically scribbling them down for my catch-up list.Somewhat counter-intuitively, sales of physical books in the US are rising slowlyThese were busy professionals with young children. All were prolific film, documentary and drama watchers. And music streamers. And NPR listeners. And, yes, book and magazine readers. None watched TV — there was nothing worth watching on US terrestrial channels that was not available online.Tellingly, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said last year that the service’s main competitor was sleep. I manage to stay up until past midnight watching what little of his product I can fit in. Yet still I struggle to tick off items on that damned list.So I asked busy people how they consume this flood of quality media, and it turns out they are going to great lengths to keep up.One acquaintance listens to the soundtrack of Netflix documentaries in the car, to at least get the sense of them. Another listens to podcasts when she is running. Others listen when they are walking, doing housework, in the bath or commuting. “It can be hard even to hold and read a phone on a crowded train, but a podcast is fine,” one Financial Times editor told me.Children have become content multitaskers. “My 10-year-old son doubles screen time value by playing a Pokémon game and watching YouTubers at the same time, two devices balanced on his knee,” says another colleague.Others are disengaging with the pressure. “Young people are deleting Facebook and Twitter not for ethical reasons, but to cut down on the number of stories they need to read,” according to an American friend.Most bizarrely and to save time, some people listen to podcasts speeded up — not just to 1.5 times or double speed, but up to five times the normal rate, rendering artfully produced programmes to Donald Duck on helium.Most of all, though, people are just consuming media for extraordinarily long periods — to the detriment of newspapers and broadcast TV. Research in 2014 by Crowdtap suggested millennials were spending an aggregate of 18 hours a day gazing at devices (often more than one device at once).Ofcom, the UK’s telecoms regulator, last year found that broadcast television viewing had fallen by a third since 2010 among children, teenagers and young adults — and that the audience for Blue Peter, the BBC’s flagship children’s programme, had on one broadcast fallen to immeasurably low levels.Somewhat counter-intuitively, sales of physical books in the US are rising slowly.But there are certainly no books to be seen in the home of a 33-year-old entrepreneur I visited recently. She told me she consumes electronic media during pretty much all her waking hours, from falling asleep to Netflix to getting in an extra hour of the same at 6am, to podcasts in the car to music radio in the office.“One way or another, I get a lot of information each day,” she says. “It’s just weird that I’m not smarter.”jonathan.margolis@ft.com@TheFutureCritic
209;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix: dearly loved;Equity cushion just became fatter after streaming service’s quarterly results;"“Public joy” and “ delight” for viewers were bandied around as targets during Netflix’s quarterly results. It sounds a lot like the free love cult of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh depicted in the US streaming service’s current hit documentary, Wild Wild Country.Warm and fuzzy feeling are understandable. Most of the Faangs — Facebook, Alphabet and, to a lesser extent, Amazon — have lost their bite, partly on the Facebook data privacy scandal. Netflix has evaded the slump.The only frowns around are on the faces of short sellers, representing about 8 per cent of the shares outstanding. They have lost almost $3bn collectively this year, according to S3 Partners. Never mind that they are right: this is one of the most heinously over-valued megacaps.That does not mean the company is performing badly. There was plenty of evidence in Monday evening’s results. Revenue growth, in particular, is truly impressive. It helps to explain Netflix’s resilience while other Faangs have all lost steam.Netflix’s 43 per cent year-on-year growth in streaming revenues (to $3.6bn; 97 per cent of the total) was the fastest since the company switched its focus from DVDs to online delivery in 2007. International growth is strong and Netflix now forecasts revenues from overseas will surpass domestic sales in the next quarter. The US group’s success in delaying maturity at home is almost as impressive. It added more than 2m paying, streaming subscribers in the quarter, the biggest sequential addition in two years, to reach 55m.For all this, the commitment to the joy of viewers comes in the form of $8bn in spending on content this year. Twenty years after starting out, Netflix has negative free cash flow, amounting to about $4bn a year.Rating agency Moody’s said on Monday, days after raising Netflix’s credit rating, that it expected this year would be the “trough”. The only thing certain given the cash burn is that Netflix will be back to the trough following a $1.6bn bond issue last October. Devotion was expensive for devotees of the Rajneesh too.In the past, the company has pointed debt investors to its reassuring equity cushion. After the shares rose 5 per cent after-hours on Monday, that dubious cushion is fatter than ever, with a market capitalisation of about $140bn, almost 9 times this year’s expected sales. The cult endures.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Is Netflix over-priced? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below."

Net income was up 63 per cent to $290m.The jump came from a combination of last year’s price rise, driving a 14 per cent increase in average selling price, coupled with faster-than-expected subscriber growth. The quarter saw the debut of new series including a second season of Marvel’s Jessica Jones and the splashy sci-fi drama Altered Carbon.Its revenue outlook for the second quarter was just ahead of Wall Street’s previous estimates at $3.9bn, with 6.2m net additional subscribers.Netflix is poised to see its first quarter where revenues from streaming outside the US surpasses its domestic market.That continues the trend from the first quarter, where it added 5.5m international subscribers, compared with 1.9m in the US.The Silicon Valley-based company said that it still expects to spend up to $8bn on content this year, after recently signing up TV producer Ryan Murphy in a deal reportedly worth $300m.However, none of its films will be up for an award at the Cannes Film Festival this year.“The festival adopted a new rule that means if a film is in competition at Cannes, it can not be watched on Netflix in France for the following three years,” Netflix said in Monday’s shareholder letter. “Unfortunately we will have to sit out Cannes for now so that our growing French membership can continue to enjoy our original films.”Netflix shares were trading as much as 8 per cent higher after hours on Monday, just shy of its all-time high of $333.98.
211;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-04-12T01:19:20Z;Netflix and executives sued over bonus scheme;Shareholder complaint alleges ‘rigging’ and ‘misleading’ statements from streaming group;"Netflix and its senior executives have been sued in a shareholder complaint, which alleges the streaming company “rigged” a bonus scheme and issued “false and misleading” statements about it.The lawsuit, brought by the City of Birmingham Relief and Retirement System, in Alabama, follows and cites a report by the Financial Times last July, that highlighted how Netflix executives were hitting their targets for millions of dollars in cash bonuses with almost uncanny accuracy.Last July, Netflix attributed hitting the targets to “management skill”. Following the lawsuit on Wednesday, the company said: “We intend to respond to these claims at the appropriate time.”The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, named Reed Hastings, chief executive, and 13 other individuals as defendants, as well as the company itself.It said the directors “breached their fiduciary duties . . . by rigging Netflix officers’ bonus payments in order to guarantee that Netflix would pay more than $27m in unnecessary cash payments and by misleading Netflix investors about both the way in which executive compensation was calculated and the potential tax liability incurred”.The shareholder bringing the complaint is not seeking damages beyond legal costs but has asked the court for a finding that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by violating federal securities and tax laws. The complaint said they should be required to reimburse damages sustained by Netflix and for them to return “all compensation and remuneration” paid “during the time that they were in breach of the fiduciary duties”.In the FT article in July, tax experts and investors questioned whether the targets were really based on challenging performance goals. Under the prevailing US tax code, executive bonuses worth more than $1m could be deducted from corporate taxes only if “the outcome is substantially uncertain”.In December, Netflix said it would scrap the bonus plan in light of the tax reform by Republicans, which abolished the deductibility of performance bonuses. Instead, Netflix executives are now paid higher salaries.While its profits and subscriber numbers often differ hugely from company forecasts, Netflix has a much better record of predicting streaming revenues once it knows the number of subscribers it has at the start of a quarter. Streaming revenues were used from 2015 as the metric in a bonus plan for three top executives: Neil Hunt, chief product officer until he left the company this month; Greg Peters, who led international development before succeeding Mr Hunt; and Ted Sarandos, chief content officer.The three executives hit the target squarely in seven out of eight quarters between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2016, never exceeding it, and missing by just one percentage point in the other quarter.In 2016, the overall revenue target of $8.276bn was exceeded by $12m, or 0.14 per cent. The near-perfect precision meant that, out of a target pool of $18.75m, the three men collected $18.7295m, according to regulatory filings.The City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System manages $1bn, according to its last annual report, but does not appear among Netflix’s top shareholders."
212;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Viacom rejects CBS’s below-market takeover;Weeks of talks expected on proposal to reunite companies separated 13 years ago;Viacom has swiftly rejected CBS’s below-market offer to reunite the US media companies separated over a decade ago, kicking off what is likely to be one of the most hotly contested takeover battles in the traditional broadcasting and film industry.CBS offered 0.52 of its shares for each Viacom class B share, valuing the owner of Nickelodeon, MTV and the Paramount film studio below its $12.8bn market capitalisation, said people briefed about the matter.Viacom believed the bid failed to recognise the fair value of the company, people close to its senior management said, adding that CBS would have to offer more than 0.62 of its own shares to get a deal done.The significant gap in valuation, however, is not the only obstacle to getting a deal done.Les Moonves, chairman and chief executive of CBS, wants the combined company to be run by his lieutenants. According to people briefed on CBS’s proposal, Mr Moonves would remain in charge and Joe Ianniello, CBS’s chief operating officer, would be his second-in-command, leaving Bob Bakish, Viacom’s chief executive, out of the picture.Shari Redstone, who controls both companies through the holding group National Amusements, favours Mr Bakish as the second-most senior figure in a combined company, said people briefed about the matter.Negotiations between the two sides were likely to stretch for several weeks, said people close to both sides.Although the Redstone family are keen to get a deal done, believing that a merger would generate significant annual synergies, it remains unclear whether an agreement between the top managers of the two companies an be reached.A deal would reunite CBS and Viacom 13 years after Ms Redstone’s father, Sumner, split them in an effort to allow Viacom to grow faster.At the time, Viacom was one of America’s hippest media companies, with many analysts believing that MTV and Comedy Central would experience record revenue growth based of the wide appeal they had on younger television viewers. However, with the advent of digital champions such as Netflix, HBO and Vice, Viacom’s top brands struggled to perform as expected.CBS, which in the mid-2000s was viewed as the weaker unit of the then combined group, has instead flourished under the leadership of Mr Moonves. CBS’s stock value has more than doubled since the split, while Viacom’s has fallen below its debut as an independent company.
213;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-29T20:27:51Z;Wall Street stages valiant rally into Easter break;;A spirited rise for US stocks on the final trading day in March was not enough to drag stocks into positive territory for the year to date and extend one of the S&P 500’s longest quarterly winning streaks on record.Wall Street rallied hard on Thursday, putting behind it a volatile week and month that had been plagued by jitters over global trade, the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate rises and troubles with some of the market’s most high-profile technology stocks.US markets had a rocky start to March when President Donald Trump revealed a proposal to impose heavy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, only to follow up with a plan to place about $60bn worth of tariffs on Chinese goods in response to an alleged “theft” of American intellectual property.Concerns the Trump administration’s actions could trigger retaliation from other countries and trading blocs, sparking a trade war, weighed on investors for much of the month. Manufacturers like Boeing and Caterpillar were seen as probable casualties in a trade war and were dumped by investors.Another contentious theme was the pace of the Fed’s monetary policy tightening. The US central bank on March 21 raised interest rates by 25 basis points, as expected, and pencilled in an additional, third, rate rise for 2019. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury shot above 2.93 per cent, near a four-year high, in the immediate aftermath, but a sell-off in the stock market encourage investors to return to the relative safety of US government debt.As Wall Street’s key equities gauges hovered around correction territory this week, the difference between short- and longer-dated Treasuries narrowed to its slimmest margin since October 2007, just before the financial crisis. This flattening yield curve is often regarded as a precursor to an economic recession, giving investors pause as the June quarter is about to get under way.On Thursday, the S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent higher, but had been up as much as 2.1 per cent. The first gain in three sessions took stocks higher for the first week in three and trimmed the benchmark’s monthly loss to 2.7 per cent.For the quarter, the benchmark dropped 1.2 per cent, ending a nine-quarter winning streak that was one of its longest on record.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been in the spotlight. On Thursday, the index closed 1.6 per cent higher, having been up as much as 2.5 per cent, as major tech names bounced back from heavy drops in recent days.Amazon, which President Trump struck out at today via Twitter, closed 1.1 per cent higher, clawing back one quarter of yesterday’s drop. Facebook jumped 4.4 per cent, but entered bear market territory this week in the wake of its data misuse scandal.Other big tech names like Alphabet, Apple and Netflix posted solid gains on Thursday, but the overarching theme for many in the sector is that they are down for the month, but still ahead for the year.The Nasdaq, which closed at a record high on March 12, fell 2.9 per cent this month but rose 2.3 per cent in the March quarter. This is its seventh straight quarter of gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2 per cent on Thursday, down 3.5 per cent for the month and down 2.3 per cent for the quarter.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones both staged their first back-to-back monthly drops since October 2016, just before Donald Trump’s election victory. It was the Nasdaq’s first back-to-back monthly drop since February 2016.On a number of days in March, Wall Street’s most popular gauges briefly eyed their steepest monthly drops since January 2016 when fears about Chinese growth spooked markets.Global stocks, measured by the FTSE All World index, fell 2.6 per cent in March, also narrower than February’s drop, but the first back-to-back decline since June 2016 and the Brexit vote.Despite the rally for stocks, Treasuries still saw some demand on Thursday, with yields (which move inversely to price) pushing lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was down 3.4 basis points at 2.7407 per cent, close to its lowest level in seven weeks.The dollar index, measuring the US currency against a weighted basket of global peers, was flat on Thursday, but down 0.6 per cent for March, its fourth monthly drop in five. The buck fell for a fifth quarter in a row, with a 2.2 per cent decline over the past three months.
214;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-28T17:39:43Z;A moment of weakness for Tech’s oligopolists;The ‘Faang’ stocks were hammered — what, if anything, does it mean?;On Tuesday, the first became last. The big US tech companies that have long led the market higher led it sharply downward. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — the so-called Faangs — as well as a handful of others all took a beating. On Wednesday morning, some of the shares kept falling, in a choppy market.Markets do not need good reasons to fluctuate. Any analysis is a hostage to the next day’s trading. Still, the rise in these huge companies’ share prices was underwritten by widespread confidence in their future prospects. If that sentiment is beginning to change, that matters.The big US tech stocks can be divided according to valuation. Some have prices that are anchored by current profits and growth: Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft are presently in this class. The share prices of Amazon, Netflix and Tesla, on the other hand, have barely any relationship to current profit. Buying them is a bet that in the future their profits will be much, much higher than they are now.Among the “anchored” tech stocks, two stand out: Facebook and Google have become very cheap relative to recent profit growth. It is perhaps not coincidental that they are also in the same business: selling targeted advertisements based on close observation of how people behave on the internet.This business has been, up until now, a great one and together the two companies dominate it. In the US, they have over 60 per cent of the market, according to eMarketer. The fact that their shares look cheap indicates that the market thinks — to the degree that it does think — that something may well happen to knock these companies out of their comfortable positions.For Facebook, it is clear where this idea comes from, and it is not hard to see similar problems arising for Google. A data breach, handled badly both when it happened and when it became public, has put the company’s business model in a terrible light. This raises a range of possibilities. New regulations might restrict the collection of data, upsetting the advertising business. Antitrust regulators and tax authorities may start to get ideas, too — this is already happening in Europe. Users, finally, may start to consider what they are giving away in return for a “free” service.None of these worries can be quantified, and it is perfectly possible that none of them will be realised (that the market is proving so sensitive to such amorphous risks is notable). The relevant point is how quickly the perception of a company’s value can change. Facebook, like Microsoft before it, often looks to have an unbreakable hold on its chosen market. In the past week, that grip seemed to loosen.This has powerful implications for the tech stocks with “unanchored” valuations — Amazon, Netflix and Tesla. The consensus is that all three are building strong oligopoly positions in huge markets. If that is true, almost any price is worth paying for the shares. And both companies have dominated all rivals for years. If, however, doubt arises about their future dominance, the resulting share price move will make Tuesday look like a little hiccup.Stock prices are usually explained in terms of expected future profit growth. In tech, it may be more useful to talk of expected future dominance — of stock valuations varying according to how ironclad tomorrow’s oligopolies will be. The way that some tech stocks have been valued suggests a future where a few companies tower over all the rest. This week’s wobble in the markets could, then, be an indication of a more competitive, and exciting, future.Only one outcome for the tech acronym / From Eithne O’Keefe, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany
215;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-28T07:25:09Z;Shares in Faangs suffer their worst one-day loss;Tech sell-off spills into Europe amid fears over increased regulation;Facebook, Alphabet and the other so-called Faang stocks suffered their worst one-day loss as a group on Tuesday — a sell-off that continued into European trading — as fears over heightened regulation and setbacks for technology companies hurt the sector that has powered the US stock market to record highs.The New York Stock Exchange’s Fang+ index, which tracks a basket of 10 technology companies including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google’s parent Alphabet, fell 5.6 per cent, the index’s worst day since September 2014 when it began.This helped to drag the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to a near 3 per cent decline and the S&P 500 down 1.7 per cent. The declines marked a reversal from Monday’s rebound after major US benchmarks had their worst week in more than two years.The decline spread to Asia and then into Europe on Wednesday. Japan’s Topix index was down 1.7 per cent by midday as the technology sector slid 2 per cent.South Korea’s Kospi index fell 1.4 per cent while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 1.5 per cent, dragged lower by a 3.7 per cent decline for tech shares. Chinese technology company Tencent shed 3.2 per cent.In Europe, the Stoxx tech index is down 1.7 per cent, led lower by Austria Microsystem, down 4 per cent, and ST Micro which is 3.3 per cent weaker. The region’s wider indices are calmer, with the sector making up a less significant part of the stock market. The international Stoxx 600 is down 0.7 per cent.UBS’s wealth management group said it was concerned about the US taking a “hard line” on technology stocks. “We calculate a 20 to 30 per cent tariff on IT products would see Asian earnings decline by low to mid-single digits,” it said.Investors are repricing tech shares because they are uncertain about whether that growth will be there in the futureInvestors in New York were spooked by a report that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, is willing to testify before Congress about the social network’s data scandal.Nvidia’s suspension of self-driving car tests after the recent fatality involving an Uber autonomous vehicle also weighed on sentiment, as did renewed concerns about Tesla’s production plans.“The fundamental concern is that these issues — whether it be something in the business line that was expected to drive growth or an increase in regulation — will negatively impact growth expectations,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“Investors are repricing tech shares because they are uncertain about whether that growth will be there in the future.”Facebook and other shares have been under pressure since reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis company employed by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, mined the personal data of 50m Facebook users.“Investors are clearly worried that we may be about to see a regime change in regulation,” said Luca Paolini of Pictet. “History tells us that when a company or sector becomes dominant, it tends to attract the attention of either the regulator (US) or the taxman (Europe).“And today the value of many tech names is based almost entirely on intangibles like reputation and brand, so regulation can have a huge impact.”On Tuesday Twitter dropped 12 per cent while Facebook lost 4.9 per cent, Alphabet was down 4.6 per cent and Apple declined 2.6 per cent. Nvidia fell 7.8 per cent while Tesla was off more than 8 per cent.With the more defensive mood on Wall Street, investors shifted to utilities and telecoms shares, which rose 1.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, and also favoured government debt.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield broke out of a long-held trading range to touch its lowest level since early February. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell over 8 basis points to 2.77 per cent.The move also marked the first time the 10-year yield has closed below its 50-day moving average this year, with investors pointing to a growing dislocation between the current positive economic environment and tension over growth and inflation.The spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields fell to 50.9 basis points, closing in on its year-to-date low of 49.7bp, another sign of flagging confidence in the economy.“The flattening will take hold. It will accelerate,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets. “That’s an important theme for us to have on the radar for the year.”Additional reporting by Emma Dunkley in Hong Kong
216;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-23T12:37:54Z;Investors pull cash out of equities amid concern over tech shares;Fears over data breaches put big-name stocks at risk of tighter leash;Investors’ confidence in the US equity market turned out to be shortlived this week as concerns grew over the outlook for technology groups such as Facebook.The withdrawals of $24.9bn of cash in the week ended March 21, according to EPFR data, undid much of the record $34.6bn of inflows from just one week before.The social network has faced harsh criticism after reports that it allowed companies to use the personal data of millions of users without their permission.“A big part of it was the concern about tech stocks. We definitely saw IT sell off pretty consistently,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.The information technology sector of the S&P 500 has led US stock market gains this year and last, which left it vulnerable to profit-taking after the Facebook fallout.Fears emerged that companies with similar data on their users could face breaches like the one alleged at Facebook — all potentially amounting to heightened regulation of the sector.The NYSE FANG+ index of mega-cap tech companies Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet’s Google, has dropped 6.6 per cent since Friday, while Facebook is off nearly 11 per cent.The decision by investors to pull their cash out of the stock market also coincided with another interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.The Fed’s policymaking arm raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter point to 1.5-1.75 per cent, as had been widely expected.In the first Fed meeting to be chaired by Jay Powell, central bank officials released upbeat projections about the US economy and inflation, supporting expectations that the central bank may raise rates three times more this year.Some investors may have anticipated the introduction of tariffs on up to $60bn in annual imports from China unveiled by the Trump administration on Thursday, Mr Gokhman said.“There was some impending concern about the Powell testimony, and we did know the tariffs were coming,” he said. “There were some investors who saw to get ahead of that.”
217;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-22T05:00:20Z;Why tech keeps chief executives and investors awake at night;Facebook’s troubles show disruption cuts both ways;Chief executives don’t need Alexa letting out a loud, creepy laugh on their Echo speaker to lose sleep over technology. The recurring nightmare of Amazon is enough to make business leaders and investors wake up in a cold sweat.It’s not just a bad dream. Jeff Bezos, the tech world’s disrupter-in-chief, is constantly looking for inefficient markets to shake up.But this week, the focus has switched to how the tech world itself could be disrupted by tougher regulation.Facebook faces investigations on multiple fronts after revelations that data on 50m users were improperly harvested. Arguably the company’s biggest asset, user data, are now potentially its biggest liability, as privacy concerns mount and its shares come under pressure.The big tech companies — referred to collectively as the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) — have dominated the current bull run, but how their sky-high valuations could be dented by regulatory “tech-lash” is not the only worry for investors.Spotting the next big thing (think cryptocurrencies here) is a constant preoccupation. And how can you hedge your portfolio against tech-related disruption?Veteran fund manager Nick Train, of the Lindsell Train Funds and the Finsbury Growth and Income Trust, isn’t worried about Brexit, Russia or President Trump. But he does lose sleep over Asos, the online fashion retailer founded in 2002, which recently leapfrogged high street stalwart Marks and Spencer in terms of market capitalisation.The speed of technological change is threatening many business models, but tech can also be a great enabler. So when devising your investment strategy, there is a lot to consider.Take automation, used by multiple industries to cut costs (humans) in order to improve margins and create efficiencies. Yet, in many cases, scant regard is given to the customer experience.When considering potential threats to a business model, investors need to evaluate this experience — and the end customer could be consumers, the government, or other businesses.Arguably, at the heart of Facebook’s problem is the fact that it lost sight of what was in the best interests of its customers.David Coombs, multi-asset manager at Rathbones, talks about the “murder of the middle”. It is becoming increasingly important to offer a premium or specialised service or product, or cheap and excellent execution. Anywhere in the middle and you could be toast.Just look at how mid-range restaurants are being eaten alive. If chains don’t offer good value or something special, consumers won’t fork out. It’s called the “experience economy” for good reason. People might think of Apple as a product-first technology company, but in truth it is a hybrid that seamlessly combines the best of both product and service.It is also worth keeping an eye on “tech-flation”. The perceived wisdom is that technology is, by its very nature, deflationary. Automation and the relentless substitution of man for machine has kept a lid on wages and, by extension, inflation.Yet technology aids price discovery — and this can work both ways. On the one hand, online retailers with a much lower cost base than their high street counterparts can offer consumers cheaper fashion. But returning to the employment example, websites such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor mean today’s workers have a lot more data that can be used at the wage negotiation table.There is a growing question mark over how passive funds are impacting the efficient allocation of capital. Any investor will tell you that once a trend is in the headlines the smart money will have already moved on.Technology has also democratised investing and lowered fees. The golden investment rule of “buy what you know” stands the test of time, yet how many passive investors truly know what’s going on beneath the bonnet of their ETF?The allure of passives is understandable. Forget about owning a slice of one business. Stock picking is overcomplicated, old fashioned and expensive. You can do it much cheaper with a data scientist and an algorithm.However, exchange traded funds are fairly new investment vehicles, and market cycles tend to be long. ETFs have grown hugely in scale, but they haven’t been around for long enough to be tested against different market scenarios.There is also a growing question mark over how passive funds are impacting the efficient allocation of capital. Any investor will tell you that once a trend is in the headlines the smart money will have already moved on.But what happens when algorithms and rules-based vehicles are driving that consensus? Could the relentless march of passives be making the market less efficient? My colleague, Paras Anand, Fidelity’s chief investment officer for equities in Europe, puts it rather eloquently: “This is what happens when the wisdom of crowds is replaced by the oscillations of dumb money.”In all other aspects of modern life, technology is making life simpler, easier and cheaper. But if markets are becoming fundamentally less efficient, the path to value realisation will become steeper, meaning the investors of tomorrow will have to wait more patiently for returns.

218;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-19T23:21:21Z;Facebook data woes drag down tech sector;‘Fang’ stock falls raise fears about future of the bull market in US equities;The US technology sector was rocked on Monday by claims that Facebook profile data had been misused, sending shares of industry leaders tumbling and raising fears about the stability of a key pillar of the bull market in US equities.Technology companies, particularly the so-called “Fang” stocks including Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, have led the market higher for the past two years on their growth prospects.However, reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm employed by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, mined the personal data of 50m Facebook users raised the spectre of a regulatory clampdown on the sector. EU lawmakers said they would investigate and the UK’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney-general have already opened investigations.Facebook fell 6.8 per cent, its biggest loss in four years, while Alphabet lost more than 3 per cent and Amazon, Netflix and Apple dropped more than 1.5 per cent. The tech sector, which accounts for about a quarter of the benchmark S&P 500, dragged the index to a 1.4 per cent decline.“[Facebook] is one of the Fang darlings and the fear is that the government might try to do something to regulate Facebook, or that users become worried that Facebook is misusing their data, either of which could cause a slowdown in growth,” said Ari Shrage, chief executive of Aliya Capital, which advises funds on tech investments. “If regulation spreads to other technology companies it could negatively impact their fundamentals.”Jon Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders, added that “trade news lingering in the background” also played a role in the day’s declines. While based in the US, a company like Apple does its manufacturing in China.“If we move forward with a very strict interpretation around what Trump has said around steel and aluminium tariffs and targeting China, tech will probably get caught up in that,” he said, adding that the sector faces at least short-term headwinds “until we get more clarity on trade tariffs and the regulatory fallout, not just for Facebook”.Other investors saw a buying opportunity. “We will see a bounce from here because there is so much positive going on,” said Tom Plumb, chief investment officer at Plumb Funds, who agreed though that trade relations with China were a concern. Earnings per share for the companies in the information technology sector of the S&P 500 grew by 17 per cent in 2017 over the previous year and are expected to rise 16 per cent in 2018, according to FactSet.“I still expect the tech stocks to be the leaders because they are the leaders of economic growth,” Mr Plumb said.Even with the day’s declines, the information technology sector of the S&P 500 is still the year’s top performer with a gain of 7.8 per cent to date, following a 36 per cent rise in 2017. Such sharp gains prompted concerns about high prices and a so-called crowded trade among investors, leaving the sector vulnerable to a fall.
219;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Facebook leads $118bn wipeout for FAAMNG stocks;;Claims Facebook misused user data has the social media network on track for its biggest one-day market capitalisation loss on record and is leading a $100bn-plus wipeout today among so-called FAAMNG stocks.Down 7.1 per cent at $172.02 during lunchtime trade in New York, Facebook had shed $38.8bn, cutting its market cap down to $503bn. The stock had been down as much as 8.1 per cent.The move looks likely to surpass its previous biggest market cap drop of $26bn during the market sell-off earlier this year, although this was from a comparatively smaller percentage decline.But among peers, Facebook’s loss today is shaping up as one for the record books.In a Financial Times analysis of the top three market cap drops since 1990 for FAAMNG stocks — that is, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) — Facebook’s loss today would rank among the ten largest.Only Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have been around since before the new millennium, and it is Microsoft’s market cap losses during the dotcom bust that still dwarf those of the names assembled here.But particularly for Apple and Amazon, which are now much bigger than they were in the late 1990s and early 2000s, even a relatively moderate drop can wipe off billions in market cap.All up, the six FAAMNG stocks have today shed a combined $118.4bn in market cap, according to FT calculations of Bloomberg data.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 2.2 per cent for its second-biggest one-day sell-off this year, while the broader S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent.
220;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-14T18:12:26Z;Walt Disney unveils shake up to focus on streaming services;Media company reorganises as it looks to take on Netflix and cord-cutting;Walt Disney is reorganising itself to bring a new focus on internet streaming services and merchandising, as it steps up its efforts to go direct to consumers in an attempt to combat Netflix and cord-cutting.The shake-up, which comes as Disney prepares to ingest most of 21st Century Fox in a $66bn deal, will also spark fresh questions about who will succeed Bob Iger as chief executive if he leaves after his newly extended contract ends in 2021. “We are strategically positioning our businesses for the future, creating a more effective, global framework to serve consumers worldwide, increase growth, and maximise shareholder value,” Mr Iger said on Wednesday. The biggest changes come in the form of two new units. “Direct-to-consumer and international”, the most significant new division, will house its forthcoming streaming services in the US and abroad, as well as global advertising sales for ESPN, ABC and other Disney-owned channels. It also includes Hulu, the US streaming service of which Disney will become majority owner after its buyout of Fox’s entertainment business goes through. The division will be led by Kevin Mayer, giving a more prominent operational role to Disney’s chief strategy officer, who oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel. TV shows and movies based on popular franchises from those deals, including Star Wars and its ever-growing universe of superheroes, will be available exclusively on Disney’s streaming service. The reorganisation also consolidates technical development under BAMTech, formerly a part of Major League Baseball, which Disney took control of last August as it tooled up for its new streaming services. The second new Disney unit is “Parks, experiences and consumer products”, home to merchandising and Disneyland resorts. The move will hand extra responsibility for merchandising to theme parks chief Bob Chapek. Two existing divisions will remain relatively unchanged: “Media networks”, which will run the traditional domestic television business, minus its former role on international operations, and “Studio entertainment”, which includes the Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel distribution. The changes will result in a significant shake-up in Disney’s hierarchy and internal priorities, as it responds to the rise of online streaming services that bypass traditional broadcast networks. In fiscal 2017, media networks was Disney’s largest division by revenues, making up 43 per cent of sales, followed by parks and resorts, which was 33 per cent of sales. Consumer products and interactive media, a division which previously held merchandise, licensing and video games as well as ad-supported online video, was just 9 per cent of revenues in fiscal 2017. That unit, which had revenues decline by 13 per cent year on year, will no longer exist in its previous guise. The reorganisation takes effect immediately, Disney said on Wednesday.
221;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-14T05:00:56Z;Revenue streams: Spotify’s bid to generate a profit;The company is critical to the revival in the music industry but, with its brutal business model, can it make money?;"It should have been Daniel Ek’s victory lap. On the eve of the Grammy Awards in January, the founder of Spotify sat in a sun-drenched Tribeca loft, where rising stars such as Alessia Cara took to the stage to entertain some of the most influential figures in the music industry. In attendance were executives from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.Mr Ek, clad in his signature T-shirt and Nikes, was holding court. His invention has injected billions of dollars back into the music business and he was sitting back to enjoy a performance of “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi — the most streamed song of all time. “The music business is back where it should be,” declared Nas, the rapper who dominated hip-hop when the compact disc was king in the 1990s, “with artists getting paid”.Just minutes later lawyers representing songwriters announced a victory in a Washington court battle over royalty rates. The court awarded songwriters across America their largest ever pay rise , adding tens of millions to Spotify’s annual streaming costs. If Mr Ek was jolted by the news, he didn’t show it.David Israelite, chief executive of the National Music Publishers’ Association, the trade body, called it “the most exciting 24 hours” of his career. Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research, says the decision will partially undo Spotify’s work in shoring up its finances before its unconventional direct listing, expected to take place in the first week of April.That the streaming service was dealt a blow from a royalty payments system that dates back to 1909 illustrates its unforgiving business model, just weeks before it is expected to go public in what could be the biggest media IPO since Netflix in 2002.With 6.3bn streams Ed Sheeran was the most streamed artist on Spotify in 2017In revenues earned by Spotify in 2017, although losses rose to €324mPer $ of revenue that Spotify paid to rights holders last year, down from ¢88 in 2015Hours the average user listens per month in Q4 2017, up from 19 in Q4 2015Average revenue per Spotify user in 2017, down from €6.84 in 2015In the internet age music has become more commoditised — streaming trained consumers to expect all the world’s songs for a low price, or no price at all in the case of YouTube. Yet Spotify also has to pay most of its sales out in royalties to access that music; although revenues have more than doubled since 2015 to exceed €4bn, its losses have continued to grow and hit €324m last year.With Spotify required to meet quarterly earnings expectations once it goes public the pressure on it will intensify. “That battle for margin between Spotify and rights holders is going to be a difficult dynamic,” warns the chief executive of one of Spotify’s four big music suppliers, which control 87 per cent of the songs streamed on its service. “The music industry is cyclical. Next year we might not have an Ed Sheeran. I do worry about whether there is a natural compatibility between music and the stock market.”Spotify’s dilemma was laid bare in a 200-page filing last month to the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for life as a public company. It has a customer base that any Silicon Valley company would envy: red-hot subscriber growth, fewer cancellations and sales growth of 40 per cent a year. Crucially, people are spending more time using Spotify: the average customer streams 25 hours on the platform a month, up from 19 hours two years ago.The company has been credited with clawing the music industry out of near- extinction and towards a brighter — if imperfect — future. And it has fended off competition from the richest technology groups in the world, convincing 60,000 new customers a day to pay about $10 a month. Its influential playlists have taken on the same role as powerful radio stations in dictating pop hits.Mr Mulligan calls this Spotify’s “soft power . . . It is equivalent to what Apple had at the peak of the iTunes store, and Amazon at the peak of CDs,” he says. But he adds the caveat: “In actual revenue power, [Spotify] may never get there [to profitability]”.The Swedish start-up has never made a profit. It is dependent on a maze of licensing negotiations, leaving its fate in the hands of the big music companies that have a direct interest in Spotify’s success, but will also look to sap as much in royalties from the service as possible. Spotify admits to its problems in a 40-page section in the filing titled “risk factors” that highlights its tangled royalty payments and widening losses.“We have no control over the providers of our content,” the company warns. “The music industry has a high level of concentration, which means that one or a small number of entities may, on their own, take actions that adversely affect our business.”The company describes podcasts as a “significant opportunity”, and the company has invested in original shows, in addition to distributing a number of popular programmes from other companies. In January it joined forces with media companies including BuzzFeed to produce a daily newscast. The project, called Spotlight, would air short segments about news and politics, featuring work from BuzzFeed journalists. The move would help Spotify compete more directly with terrestrial radio — which draws $28bn in advertising globally, and $14bn in the US, according to BIA/Kelsey. In its regulatory filing, Spotify says “a migration away from radio broadcasting is likely and it will benefit both consumers and artists alike”.When Mr Ek first hatched plans for Spotify in 2006, there were about 30 tech companies promising music executives that they knew how to save their business. Mr Ek stood out because he “wasn’t another brash guy flying in from California, telling us we were screwed”, says one executive involved in the discussions. But he still had to spend two years reinforcing his message before the labels agreed to give Spotify a chance.In 2010, when Spotify was worth about $200m and had not yet launched in the US, the 27-year-old Mr Ek told a journalist that eventually Spotify would be worth “tens of billions” and that there would only be “four or five players left” in the market.Few believed him but he turned out to be right. Digital distribution is dominated by Spotify, Apple, Amazon and YouTube. Facebook has cut a series of music licensing deals in recent weeks in a bid to become a more formidable force in music video. While some retailers threaten to abandon CDs as soon as this summer. Spotify has recently been valued at up to $23bn according to private trades.Spotify’s justification for offering a free, ad-supported service has been that it would lure people into the platform, then help convince them to sign up for a full subscription — the real moneymaker. More than half of Spotify’s users have the ad-supported version, but advertising makes up only 10 per cent of sales. It has been trying to make itself more valuable to brands by rolling out new opportunities, such as sponsored playlists, which brands including Disney Pixar and Victoria’s Secret have participated in.The music business, which spent much of its previous life fighting providers of pirated music in court, remains cautious — but the scepticism has lifted a little since the cheques began rolling in. Over its lifetime Spotify has paid more than $10bn to the industry, according to regulatory filings. Vivendi-owned Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music — the “big three” labels — have seen their revenues jump 10 per cent a year, as subscription streaming sales have risen up to 50 per cent.Even some of the Swedish group’s loudest critics have come around. Scott Borchetta, chief executive of Big Machine Label Group, pulled Taylor Swift’s music off Spotify in 2014, sparking a debate over whether the service benefits musicians. Three years later, Ms Swift’s latest album was withheld from Spotify for just a few weeks— illustrating how the distribution strategy has changed even for the biggest artists.“We have to be where the fans are,” Mr Borchetta says. “Physical is almost done. We can now see the finish line,” Spotify’s public offering is “critical to our wellbeing . . . it’s far too late to turn back”, he adds.Spotify has vacillated on its video strategy. The company has produced a handful of original shows, but none has yet caught on meaningfully with users. Last year it looked to overhaul its video strategy, cancelling some shows that had been in development. It has also been injecting video into its most popular playlists, such as RapCaviar, with interview clips or music videos, as it aims to make subscribers more aware of video on the platform.At Spotify’s US headquarters in Manhattan’s Flatiron District, chief financial officer Barry McCarthy has been doing the groundwork on the listing. Known internally as “Professor Barry”, he guided Netflix through its IPO in 2002 before joining Spotify in 2015.Working alongside Mr Ek, he reformulated Spotify’s cost structure through painstaking negotiations with the big music companies, which agreed to accept lower royalty payments on the condition that Spotify keeps adding subscribers rapidly.The FT has created a playlist to mark Spotify’s public listing which features artists from Ennio Morricone to Woody Guthrie, Prince and Lil Wayne. If you want to add to the playlist please leave your contribution — song title and artist — in the comments below. We will include as many as possible.The results were immediate: Spotify last year paid about 79 cents of every dollar it makes back to rights holders, down from 88 cents in 2015. Yet that is still well above Netflix, which paid 66 cents for every dollar of revenue last year. It also converted debt to equity for its lenders, TPG and Dragoneer, while swapping shares with Tencent Music, the leading Chinese digital music company. Spotify says it now has no outstanding debt.“It did everything possible to make its metrics look perfect for the [listing],” says Mr Mulligan. However, the songwriting ruling “could well offset much of the savings impact” in the US, he warns. Anthony DiClemente, analyst at Evercore, estimates it will immediately increase Spotify’s costs by $40m a year, and eventually by an annual $100m.Spotify’s market debut will look different to its tech predecessors. The company is rejecting a formal IPO process, instead choosing to go public without issuing new shares — unprecedented for an entity of its size. Spotify does not feel it needs to raise money, and will save $70m in fees that it would have paid to underwriters. Instead, a direct listing allows it to go public without relying as much on the Wall Street machine and still meeting the obligations of its 2016 $1bn refinancing.While the idea came from Mr McCarthy, it resonated with Mr Ek. “He’s not going to be on the cover of business magazines,” says one personclose to the chief executive. “He doesn’t want to ring the bell [on Wall Street].”It raises the question of whether Spotify will turn into a Netflix or a Pandora? The music business is hoping for the former, as Netflix has become one of the most successful stocks on the S&P 500 index, while Pandora, the only digital music company on the public market, has seen its shares halve in the past year.Netflix and Spotify are pioneers of digital streaming and the darlings of their respective sectors — and similarly compete against larger Silicon Valley players. Unlike Netflix, Spotify’s costs balloon along with its revenues, and crucially it does not make its own content.“The problem with audio streaming is you need to have 100 per cent of the content rights in the world for music, otherwise nobody buys your product,” says Matt Pincus, chief executive of music publisher SONGS. Streaming has so far proved to be a punishing business. SoundCloud and Pandora have both flirted with bankruptcy in the past year, while Deezer scrapped its IPO plans.Spotify’s strategy has been to become big enough that the labels need it. “Initially, it was a fight pretty much every time they wanted to change the terms to be even slightly better,” says PJ Parson, a Spotify board member until last June. According to its SEC filing Spotify now commands 42 per cent of music streaming globally. “The power structure has changed,” adds Mr Parson. Once Spotify reaches 100m subscribers, the balance may tip further — it has 71m today.Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon found Spotify in StockholmAfter two years of negotiations with the largest record labels, Spotify officially launches in EuropeSpotify reaches 1m users, all of them in EuropeSpotify reaches 1m paying subscribersThe company raises $100m — valuing it at $1bn.

Streaming overtakes downloads to become the biggest revenue source for the US music industrySpotify says its number of paying subscribers has leaped to 60mSpotify privately files to list its shares on the New York Stock ExchangeBut it is not yet too big to fail. That it loses money while holding a commanding lead “begs the question just how dominant it needs to be to break even”, says Laith Khalaf, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, warning that Spotify “must be viewed as a high-risk investment”.Other analysts warn that Apple could become more of a threat. It launched Apple Music in 2015, and has amassed a respectable 38m subscribers. Spotify has held its first-mover advantage, while Apple has a conflict of interest because it still wants to attract people to buying digital downloads on the iTunes store.One solution is for Spotify to become something more than a streaming company. It could invest further in content such as podcasts, videos or advertising, which makes up just 10 per cent of sales at the moment. It might even invade the space occupied by traditional music companies. “It’s probably inevitable that Spotify will start doing things that record labels do,” as it works more closely with artists, says Mr Mulligan.In a letter to investors, Mr Ek makes it clear that he wants to be much more than a pipe that zaps songs into smartphones. “The old model favoured certain gatekeepers. Artists had to be signed to a label. They needed access to a recording studio,” he said. But in this “cluttered landscape”, he added Spotify empowers artists to “break through”."
222;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-10T01:18:34Z;Tech groups show their resilience and hit new highs;Sector continues to attract investors because of revenue and earnings growth;Shares of technology companies rallied to fresh highs on Friday as the sector’s growth continues to attract investors in what has been a tumultuous start to the year for US equities.Both the Nasdaq Composite and the information technology sector of the benchmark S&P 500 index set records, rising 1.8 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The tech sector has remained resilient even as US shares sold off last month on fears of rising inflation and accelerated interest rate rises.Investors and analysts said tech continues to shine on revenue and earnings growth amid uncertainty over big-picture issues around the strength of the US economy, the pace of inflation and the direction of monetary and trade policy. On Friday, a jobs report that pointed to economic growth, but that eased the worries over runaway inflation, added to the appetite for risk assets, including tech shares.“In an environment where you have modest growth without a lot of inflation, companies that can generate top-line and [earnings per share] growth continue to lead,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“The leaders continue to be the Fangs — momentum continues to be the primary driver,” he added, referring to the group of large, influential tech companies that have led the gains in recent years and continue to outperform.So far this year, Netflix is up 73 per cent, Amazon 35 per cent, Alphabet 10.9 per cent and Apple 6.4 per cent.The S&P 500 has added 4.2 per cent in 2018.“Momentum begets more momentum [with] buying in the category of stocks that has been working well, specifically technology sector stocks,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations.He added that a better than expected earnings report for Marvell Technology, a semiconductor company, breathed some additional life into that area of the market.The info-tech sector of the S&P 500 is the top performing sector year-to-date, with a 11.2 per cent gain coming on the back of a 34 per cent rise last year.“Typically growth [companies do] better when actual economic growth is scarce and that is what we have had in this economic cycle,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.Mr Gokhman cited aspects such as automation and consumer adoption of smartphones as helping to drive profits.For the fourth quarter, companies in the info-tech sector have reported earnings growth of 22.6 per cent versus a year ago, on revenue gains of 13.4 per cent, according to FactSet.Still, some investors including Mr Gokhman expect more traditional value-style companies, such as financials and energy, to outperform if economic growth accelerates.
223;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-09T08:09:34Z;Obamas in talks with Netflix about TV series;Discussions a sign of ambitions of group, which will spend $8bn on original content this year;Barack Obama is in talks with Netflix about a TV series that would give the former US president a global mouthpiece and the streaming service behind House of Cards another high-profile exclusive.President Obama and his wife Michelle could front debates or documentary-style shows, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, which were first reported by the New York Times. No deal has yet been agreed and the Obamas have also talked to other tech companies including Apple and Amazon about a potential content partnership, the NYT reported. A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment.If Netflix does win the rights to a series with the Obamas, who command an international audience of millions on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, it would be the latest sign in the shifting power balance between internet streaming services and traditional broadcasters.On Sunday, Netflix won its first Oscar for a full-length movie for Icarus, a documentary about Russian doping in the Olympics. It has already lured high-profile TV talent including Shonda Rhimes, who produced Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, and Glee creator Ryan Murphy from broadcast networks.Netflix has said it will invest as much as $8bn in original content this year. Its shift from licensing TV shows and movies from other broadcasters into owning and producing its own content began in earnest with 2013’s release of House of Cards, a political drama set in Washington DC that sees the ruthless Frank Underwood lie and murder his way into the White House.For Mr Obama, Netflix’s 117m subscribers would provide a real platform to weigh in on world affairs. The former president, who left office just over a year ago, has continued to voice his opinion on American issues from gun control to healthcare reform but has largely stayed out of the spotlight since President Trump took office.Mr Obama has already appeared on Netflix this year, in the first episode of talk-show host David Letterman’s new series. The hour-long interview passed without a single mention of Donald Trump by name.Thursday evening’s report is not the first suggestion that Mr Obama could launch a new career in the media. After news site Mic reported in December 2016 that the outgoing president might launch his own media company, then White House communications director Jen Psaki said on Twitter that Mr Obama was “interested in the changing ways people consume info, but he has no plans to get into the media business after he leaves office”.
224;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
225;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix hits new record high on UBS upgrade;;Neflix shares continued their seemingly inexorable rise on Monday, hitting a new record high after analysts at UBS sharply upped their price targets on the video streaming service.The stock ended the day up 4.6 per cent at $315, after briefly touching a fresh intraday high of $316.91. The move — which added the equivalent of $6bn to Netflix’s market value — takes the shares’ gains to over 64 per cent so far this year. Over the past 12 months, the stock has more than doubled in value, climbing more than 126 per cent and pushing the company’s market capitalisation to nearly $137bn.In a note to clients on Monday, analysts at UBS said Netflix’s heavy investment in original content and customer retention should allow it to strengthen its competitive advantage over its peers.“We believe Netflix’s core competencies in both content and technology should drive a virtuous circle of greater subs and increased viewing time, enabling higher Arpu and revenue, which will fuel content spending to attract even more subscribers, positioning Netflix to sustain its clear global leadership in the emerging online video subscription business,” said lead analyst Eric Sheridan.UBS raised its share price target on the stock to $345, 19 per cent higher from its previous target of $290.Mr Sheridan added that Netflix still have plenty of room to grow outside its key US market.“Out of the existing 700 million global broadband households ex China, Netflix has only penetrated ~17% in aggregate — while US penetration has reached ~60%, international (ex China) penetration remains only ~10%,” he said.“Broadband penetration remains low in many of Netflix’s key markets while internet infrastructure is still being built (eg, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, India). With increasingly sophisticated and efficient wireless infrastructure worldwide, Netflix’s total addressable market could expand to digital video viewers from fixed broadband households. For context, YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users and Facebook has 2bn MAUs.”
226;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-03-01T04:00:27Z;‘Black Panther’ brings fresh box office power to Hollywood;The success of the big-budget Marvel film has demonstrated the commercial potential for movies with more diverse casts and stories;"In the run-up to the Academy Awards two years ago, Hollywood was abuzz with complaints about its attitude to race. With not even one black actor nominated for any of the major categories, a social media protest under the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite went viral and several leading African-American figures in the industry boycotted the event.On the eve of this Sunday’s Oscars broadcast, Hollywood is again consumed with race. But this time it is celebrating the blockbuster global success of Black Panther, the first big-budget superhero movie with a black lead, a predominantly black cast and a black writer and director.The film, from Walt Disney’s Marvel Studios, is heading towards $1bn in global ticket sales thanks to the rapturous embrace of critics, audiences and the African-American community, for whom it has already become a cultural touchstone.After the controversy of the Oscars two years ago, the success of Black Panther provides a feel-good moment for Hollywood on its approach to diversity. Indeed, the nominees for the 2018 Oscars reflect a broader than typical range of race and gender, thanks largely to a recent push by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to refresh its largely ageing and white voting membership.But it is also a potentially important moment for a film industry that has often assumed audiences would not turn out in large numbers for movies filled with non-white faces, even when the racial make-up of American society is changing so markedly.At a time when movie studios are being forced to search for new audiences as they weather competition from Netflix and video-streaming, Black Panther has provided a wake-up call on the commercial potential for films that are made by and star black talent.“These things don’t happen overnight, but when studio executives worldwide think about greenlighting a movie with a black cast or a Hispanic cast that crosses all four quadrants [male, female, young and old movie-goers], rather than playing to a particular group, the experience of Black Panther changes the dynamic,” says Richard Gelfond, chief executive of Imax, the big-screen cinema company. “I think people will be more willing to take risks.”Bob Iger, chairman of the Walt Disney group, said the company was “exhilarated” because the film represented “an important moment in the culture” but that it also had the potential to become a blockbuster franchise sold across its businesses.“I pretty much guarantee you that this coming Halloween and even Christmas, you’ll be seeing a lot of Black Panther merchandise in the marketplace,” he said on Monday. The queues at Disneyland to meet the Black Panther character were an hour long, Mr Iger said, and he hinted about developing a ride around the film.Black stars are not new in Hollywood. From Sidney Poitier to Halle Berry and Denzel Washington, black actors have starred in box-office hits for decades. Plenty of films are also made specifically for black audiences, such as the Madea comedies from the actor and director Tyler Perry. Yet despite those successes Hollywood has been reluctant to take the next step with an all-black “tent-pole” movie — one with the earning potential to support a studio’s entire slate of movies.If Black Panther was a bet in that regard it has paid off handsomely for Disney. Even with the anticipation ahead of its release in February, it smashed expectations, pulling in more than $200m in the fifth biggest opening weekend ever.Worldwide ticket sales have topped $700m, a number that will only grow once the movie opens in China, the world’s second-largest film market, on March 9. Black Panther has already passed 2015’s Straight Outta Compton as the top-grossing film by a black director with a majority black cast.Across much of the US, the release of Black Panther was not just a night at the cinema but a cultural event. Movie-goers turned up in outfits inspired by the film’s costumes and traditional African dress then waited in queues that wrapped around city blocks. Cinemas added showtimes to meet demand. Churches, schools and companies including the advertising group Interpublic Group organised screenings.“I don’t know if we’ve ever been this proud to be African-American,” Chadwick Boseman, who plays the title character, told a sold-out crowd this week at an event at New York’s Apollo theatre.Outside a Harlem cinema a few blocks from the Apollo, vendors hawked T-shirts emblazoned with “Wakanda Forever” and “Straight Outta Wakanda” — the fictional African nation where the movie is set.“Deep down we all hoped that people would come to see a film about a fictional country on the continent of Africa, made up of a cast of people of African descent,” said Ryan Coogler, Black Panther’s director and co-writer, in a thank-you letter to fans after its opening weekend. “Never in a million years did we imagine that you all would come out this strong.”The film’s strong performance could potentially resurrect what had been looking like a disastrous first quarter for the industry. RBC Capital Markets said this week that its gloomy forecast for the 2018 box office had improved “meaningfully”. Total box office takings would be “closer to flat” in the first quarter rather than the expected 12 per cent decline, Leo Kulp, an analyst at RBC, said in a note, helped by the fact that “Black Panther substantially outperformed our expectations”.Enthusiasm for the movie is generating money from other sources as well. The soundtrack, curated by the rapper Kendrick Lamar, has topped Billboard’s album chart for two weeks. Sales of action figures, masks and other merchandise tied to the film have also been strong, according to Hasbro and other toymakers.The runaway commercial success of Black Panther underscores just how long it has taken the largest studios to produce big-budget films with diverse lead actors and casts. Other forms of entertainment have moved more swiftly: black acts dominate the music charts and hip-hop is the most streamed genre, with listening increasing by more than 74 per cent in 2017, according to Spotify. On US television some of the biggest hits of recent years, from Empire to Scandal and Blackish, have featured black stars and writing talent, part of a concerted effort by the main broadcast networks to produce programming that better reflects American society.Facing competition from streaming services, studios are searching for different types of film that can fill cinemas in the US and increasingly important international markets. Although the US film industry has long been dominated by a belief that films featuring largely black casts and storylines do not perform well around the world, many executives have made the case for more diversity on the big screen as a way to reach a wider audience.“Every movie that breaks down these barriers is another step towards more inclusion in mainstream Hollywood movies,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst with ComScore, a media research group. “If you have grown up and never seen someone like you on screen then you’re looking at the world through other people’s eyes. When people see themselves on screen it can be a very powerful experience.”Disney, which generated more than $6bn worldwide at the box office last year, has made a concerted effort to diversify its films both in front of and behind the camera, from the racially inclusive cast of the recent instalments of the Star Wars franchise to the animated Moana, based on Polynesian myths, to the forthcoming A Wrinkle in Time, for which African-American female director Ava DuVernay reimagined the world-saving protagonist as a biracial girl.A new study of diversity in Hollywood from the University of California, Los Angeles found that relatively diverse movies (casts with between 21 and 30 per cent ethnic minority actors) produce higher ticket sales. “Increasingly diverse audiences, the evidence shows, prefer film and television content populated with characters to whom they can relate and whose stories drive the narrative,” the report said.Non-white audiences carry box office clout: people of colour account for nearly 40 per cent of the US population but bought more than half of tickets for five of the top 10 global grossing films in 2016, according to the UCLA study. That included Captain America: Civil War, another Marvel superhero movie set in the same universe as Black Panther.Still, the research suggests that only modest progress has been made towards reflecting the make-up of contemporary audiences. While the proportion of minorities increased over the years in several employment categories, including lead roles on broadcast TV and creators of shows on streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon, they remain under-represented compared with the population at large, in every category the survey measured. Women are also under-represented across the industry, the study found.The number of directors of colour being given responsibility for top films has barely increased — 12.6 per cent in 2016 compared with 12.2 per cent in 2011. The percentage of minorities in lead acting roles rose from 10.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent in the same period.That lack of representation has come into sharp focus in recent years at the Oscars. The routine exclusion of people of colour from the industry’s top awards came to a head in 2015 and 2016, both years in which none of the acting categories had a single nominee of colour. The black activist April Reign coined the term #OscarsSoWhite on Twitter, generating a social media campaign that led Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith to boycott the 2016 ceremony.The Academy, whose membership is 87 per cent white and 72 per cent male, has pledged to become more representative. It has set a goal of doubling the number of female and non-white members by 2020. “I happen to think that the Academy’s initiatives regarding diversity are way overdue,” John Bailey, a cinematographer who was named Academy president in August, told the New York Times.Last year’s Oscars presented a different picture. Moonlight, a coming-of-age tale about a gay black man, beat favourite La La Land for best picture. The slate of nominees for this year’s prizes includes acting nods for Denzel Washington, Daniel Kaluuya, Octavia Spencer and Mary J Blige. The best director Oscar could go to the first ever African-American winner, Jordan Peele for Get Out, or the second-ever woman, Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird. Mr Peele received the accolade of being nominated for best director, best original screenplay and best picture, all for a debut film.Having been released this year, Black Panther is eligible only for next year’s Oscars. Cultural phenomenon or not, it will then have to contend with the Academy’s traditional disdain for superhero films.Black Panther has made it into the top five grossing films in nominal terms in their first and second weekends of release in the US.1. Star Wars: The Force Awakens $398m
2. Jurassic World $315m
3. Black Panther $313m
4. Marvel’s The Avengers $310m
5. Beauty and the Beast (2017) $265m"
227;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;ITV’s margins can only slide in Netflix and Sky technology race;Judges rated Carolyn McCall’s strategic triple toe loop with a 6% fall in the shares;ITV’s primetime Sunday night show involves well-known names risking their dignity by performing precarious manoeuvres, such as turning and spinning on the spot . . . on ice. Carolyn McCall — the former high-profile easyJet boss now running the UK broadcaster — may know the feeling. On Wednesday, she negotiated London’s frozen South Bank to demonstrate that she can turn further away from “spot” advertising and faster towards original content. All she eschewed were the sequins.So how did the judges rate her strategic triple toe loop? They awarded it a 6.0, but not the perfect kind: a nasty 6 per cent fall in the share price.On the surface, it seems they were worried about the impact of big production numbers on costs, and an advertising environment that shows little sign of thawing. Unusually, Dame Carolyn disclosed its next two year’s schedule costs and, at £1.06bn and £1.1bn, respectively, these were more than the City had been expecting — leading some to wonder whether the group is having to spend more to compete with pay-TV rivals, such as Netflix and Sky, in drama and sport. At the same time, she said net advertising revenue was only expected to grow 1 per cent this quarter — despite agencies suggesting growth of about 3 per cent.Dame Carolyn might have expected more of a bouquet, given that she is arguably taking the right steps, and some of her figures do not look too bad.Leaning further away from a broadcast TV spot-ad market as it continues its structural decline is the only sensible move. An 11 per cent increase in non-advertising revenues indicates success in executing it, too, and takes this income to 56 per cent of the group total. ITV Studios — the content business — has pulled off revenue growth of 13 per cent and already landed 60 per cent of its 2018 target. Online revenues rose 7 per cent.Stopping short of special dividends also looks prudent, with a more detailed strategy yet to be choreographed — and provides scope for acquisitions, some suggest.Why the share price slide, then? Arguably, on fears that margins cannot stand up. With online competitors pushing up the price of original drama — Netflix’s The Crown cost £10m an hour compared with former terrestrial TV costs of £800,000 — ITV Studios falling margin is set to come under pressure. But additional investment will also be needed in technology and data if ITV is to compete with the more personalised, targeted advertising already being offered by rivals.Dame Carolyn has carved out £15m-£20m for new property, online and data investments but noted these were “ongoing” and the data tranche only “initial”. If her strategic review decides more is needed, the only thing preventing margins slipping from 27 per cent to nearer 20 per cent may be a big recovery in spot ad revenue. ITV notes that this year sees England compete in the football World Cup. But is there really any more demand for watching highly paid people fall flat on their . . .If a mature company increases its headcount by 7 per cent in a year, what should happen to its operating profit and cash generation?Assuming those new heads can bring in more money than they cost, and other expenses remain flat, you might expect the former to rise a little more and the latter to be maintained. You might not expect to see increases of 36 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.But that is exactly what FTSE 100 wealth manager St James’s Place, established 1991, has just reported.This is partly a reflection of the operational efficiency built into its business over those years. A 7 per cent increase in the number of qualified financial advisers, to more than 3,600, was able to deliver a 20 per cent increase in funds under management, to £90bn, which in turn lifted investment and advice fee income. Partly as a result of this disparity, operating profit rose more than a third. Then, partly thanks to the operational effect, but also to contributions from pension products coming on to the books for the first time, cash generation increased even more.However, the big increases in funds under management and efficiency arguably came after 2012. In that year, funds grew 6 per cent. In the next five they grew 22 per cent, 27 per cent, 17 per cent, 28 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.Another FTSE 100 financial services group shows a similar growth trajectory. In 2012, Hargreaves Lansdown’s assets under management rose 7 per cent. In the next five, they were up 38 per cent, 29 per cent, 18 per cent, 12 per cent and 28 per cent.What happened in 2013? Regulatory change drove thousands of commission-based independent financial advisers out of the market, leaving consumers with a choice of only fee-based wealth managers, such as St James’s Place, or online platforms, such as Hargreaves. Both have positioned themselves well to benefit from higher standards and transparency. But operational efficiency is so much easier to achieve when part of state-ordained duopoly.matthew.vincent@ft.com
228;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Taxing revenues is a poor fix for tech’s avoidance;Greater harmonisation and energetic enforcement are a better bet;"One cannot blame the UK Treasury for considering radical measures. A handful of large technology companies, which make a lot of money in the UK, pay little tax there. This may or may not be completely legal, depending on the case. But it is certainly unjust.A fix is needed, and the temptation is to reach for one that is simple and bold. Taxing the tech companies on the basis of their local revenues would be both. UK sales are harder to shift to Luxembourg or Ireland. So Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, says a revenue tax is “potentially the preferred option”. Other countries, such as France and Italy, have similar ideas.The qualifications in Mr Stride’s statement indicate that the Treasury may change its mind. Good. A revenue tax would create more problems than it would solve. Better to focus on more fundamental changes to the tax code, greater international harmonisation and tougher enforcement.The figures are outrageous enough to be worth restating. In 2016 eBay had $1.3bn in UK revenue as stated in its annual report. Yet reported profits, on its UK tax filings, were £8m, and its tax liability was £2m. Netflix has 6.5m subscribers in the UK, implying roughly £400m in revenue. Profits made and tax paid in the UK? Almost nothing.Such companies displace older businesses — pay television, store-based retail — that have a harder time deploying wheezes such as sending fees to the entities, parked in tax havens, that hold server computers or intellectual property. So the UK does not just lose tax revenue; it is forced into the position of subsidising one form of economic activity (the software-based one) over others. No government should tolerate this.The challenge with a revenue tax is seeing that it hits only its intended target. It may be fine to hit eBay, Netflix, Facebook or Amazon on the basis of local sales. But then what happens to early-stage, unprofitable tech start-ups? They pay no corporate tax now, and that is exactly as it should be.Society wants to encourage their risk taking — as opposed to the rent seeking of tech oligopolies. And then there is the problem of profitable businesses that, because they do not derive earnings from intangibles, currently pay normal taxes on profits. A principled way of excluding them from a revenue tax, if one could be found, could be vulnerable to gaming, too.A better solution will be less elegant and take longer to reach, but would distribute the burden of taxation more fairly. It would involve coming to a consensus about where and when tech platforms create value. The current regime, by default, holds that most of the value is created by the intellectual property or at the nominal location of an electronic transaction, and that little or none is created where the service is delivered. A more balanced formula is needed.A rebalanced system, to be effective, would require a significant amount of international agreement, not about tax rates, but about the tax base — what constitutes a taxable event. This will take time. Both the EU and the OECD are working on it. In the meantime, individual countries have to enforce existing laws vigorously, and install smaller measures to plug tax leaks. The UK’s “ Google tax” on diverted profits, and the plan of Philip Hammond, the chancellor, to make royalties paid to low-tax jurisdictions subject to UK tax, are worthy efforts in this direction.Global technology businesses are complex, protean and vast. No policy change is going to close every loophole they can exploit, simple solutions such a revenue tax least of all. There is no doubt, however, that the current system can be made much better.Why should individuals pay a corporation’s taxes? / From William Bigelow, Worcester, MA, USA fair approach to global corporate taxation / From Chris Preston, Cowes, Isle of Wight, UK"
229;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Spotify’s listing puts pressure on group to broaden playlist;Streaming service will have to add more business lines to offset reliance on labels;Grime rapper Stormzy stole the show at this week’s Brit awards with a barnstorming performance on the biggest night of the UK music calendar. The celebratory mood at London’s O2 arena reflected a new optimism that has swept music on both sides of the Atlantic.Streaming has transformed music’s fortunes, with record label revenues soaring thanks to payments from Spotify and Apple Music, setting the industry up for a new growth phase after more than a decade lost to piracy.All eyes are on Spotify, the world’s largest music streaming service, which is due to list its shares in New York in the next few months. The direct listing — existing shareholders will sell equity into the market but no new shares will issued — will give institutional investors their first opportunity to bet on a pure-play streaming company.But with Spotify relying on music labels to supply it with content — it has paid $5bn to rights holders so far — and rivals such as Apple and Amazon using music as a loss-leader for other parts of their businesses, questions remain about whether the company can translate streaming’s growth into long-term profits.Spotify has grown to more than 70m paying customers, part of what it calls a base of 140m “active users” — which includes people who use its free service. Apple Music, which launched in 2015, has amassed about 36m subscribers. By contrast, Netflix, the video streaming service, has close to 120m subscribers — and a market value of $122.5bn.Like Netflix, Spotify has grown rapidly. But while there are some similarities between the two companies, there are also important differences.Netflix built its base of streaming subscribers by offering a library stocked with content provided by other companies. This was expensive but since 2012, when it launched political drama House of Cards, it has reduced its reliance on third-party content by commissioning and producing its own.This is no less expensive. It is spending billions of dollars a year on what it calls “Netflix Originals” — series such as Narcos and Stranger Things, or movies such as Bright, starring Will Smith. But owning the content outright means the company can control how it amortises its costs. Crucially, it also means these costs are relatively predictable: as it adds subscribers, its margins go up.Spotify’s cost structure is more complicated. Unlike Netflix, its costs are not fixed: its deals with the largest music labels — Universal Music Group, Sony Music and Warner Music — are pegged to consumption: the more that the music it has licensed is streamed, the more it pays out to its suppliers. It has built “margin relief” clauses into its contracts with the labels, which mean royalty fees will be reduced when it meets certain subscriber targets. This should go some way to prevent margins being depressed. But investors in a publicly quoted Spotify — which has never made a profit — will want margins to grow.This is not to say investors will avoid the Spotify listing. The biggest music labels are either private, such as Warner, or part of larger companies: Universal Music Group is owned by Vivendi, the French media conglomerate and owner of pay television company Canal Plus, while Sony Music is part of the Japanese consumer electronics group. Spotify will be the only pure-play music company with tradable equity and will appeal to investors keen to ride the streaming wave. “If you are an institutional investor and your board wants to have a play in music, then Spotify is the only place,” says Mark Mulligan, analyst with Midia Research.Over the longer term, expect Spotify’s relationship with its suppliers to come under strain. If the company copies Netflix’s model and tries to develop its own content, it is likely to get into a face-off with the biggest labels that dominate global recorded music, both with new acts and in catalogue titles. Spotify has already moved into podcasts — a relatively cheap way to get subscribers spending more time on its platform. Could it eventually start vying with labels for the rights to top acts and become a label itself? Such a move would be loaded with risk.Spotify’s executives know they need to develop other lines of business to reduce the company’s reliance on the labels: the company is reported to be exploring a move into hardware, for example. As it looks to the future as a public company, its executives know they need other cards to play.matthew.garrahan@ft.com

American investors should be wary. Intense competition for viewers in China is even more fierce than it is in the US.Baidu shares have rallied a quarter since June — including Tuesday’s after-market announcement. Markets have given credence to the group’s goal of becoming a platform for autonomous driving as well as for voice control for smart devices. Net income has recovered from last year. The company, which runs China’s largest search engine, had previously risked losing relevance to Alibaba and Tencent.The Beijing-based company has announced annual revenues of Rmb84.8bn ($13bn) a fifth more than the prior year. More than a quarter of this came from paid-for content and traffic acquisition.Even so, Baidu’s gross margins continue to decline — down 30 percentage points to 49 per cent of revenues in five years. One reason: Baidu’s content costs have swollen to 16 per cent of revenues. This is mainly because of iQiyi’s increased spending. Add traffic acquisition costs, paid to websites that place Baidu’s ads, and reimbursements exceeded a quarter of sales.Both Alibaba and Tencent operate competing video platforms. However Baidu’s had the largest share of monthly video consumption in September at 28 per cent, according to Jefferies. Heavy spending was rewarded by a partnership with Netflix, good news given the latter’s dominant position among US video streaming consumers.An IPO of the video unit would give Baidu additional resources to invest in its artificial intelligence ventures, which will then help iQiyi. Analysts think it generated Rmb17.5bn of revenue last year. At its US partner’s price-to-sales ratio of 7.5 at the end of last year this would imply a hefty $21bn valuation.

231;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-02-14T05:03:43Z;Netflix signs star TV producer as streaming battle picks up;Group inks deal with Ryan Murphy just as Disney readies rival service;Netflix has struck a blow to Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox by signing Ryan Murphy, the producer of US television hits such as Glee and American Horror Story, in what has been hailed as one of the biggest deals of its kind.Mr Murphy is the latest top producer to swap the traditional Hollywood studio system for the online streaming world after Netflix hired Shonda Rhimes, creator of Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, from Disney’s ABC last August.Netflix has committed a $300m budget to Ryan Murphy Productions over several years to produce TV series and films exclusively for its streaming service.The $300m figure, confirmed by a person familiar with the terms, puts it among the biggest TV production deals ever signed, estimates the Hollywood trade publication Deadline.The producer will be a loss for both Fox’s TV division and for Disney, which is in the process of acquiring the Fox unit. Just last week, Disney said it had signed the creators of HBO’s Game of Thrones to write and produce a series of Star Wars films, as it prepares to launch its own streaming service to rival Netflix.Though Netflix declined to comment on the terms, the deal shows the high dollar value that top Hollywood talent is able to command as tech companies vie with traditional media groups for exclusive programming, bidding up prices in the process.“Ryan Murphy’s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix. “His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the under-represented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.”At a time when Hollywood has come under greater scrutiny for sexual harassment, Mr Murphy hailed the deal as a win for diversity, thanking Netflix for “believing in me and the future of my company which will continue to champion women, minorities and LGBTQ heroes and heroines”.“The history of this moment is not lost on me,” he said. “I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallised and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.”
232;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-02-06T05:00:52Z;Media groups face choice of eat or be eaten;Murdoch’s exit from Fox and the threat from streaming leads smaller players to reconsider deals;Under pressure from technology giants such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix, and the prospect of big traditional players getting bigger — from Walt Disney’s $66bn bid for most of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, to AT&T’s pending purchase of Time Warner — media companies are reaching one conclusion: eat or be eaten.The revelation that Mr Murdoch was seeking an exit from the entertainment business injected a new sense of urgency among smaller media companies — including CBS and Viacom, which last week decided to revisit a combination, having walked away from such a deal just over a year ago.“It’s clear that the message that Disney and Fox are sending is that scale matters,” Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s chief executive, told analysts on the telecoms company’s earnings call last month. Verizon has been pegged as a potential buyer of assets from Fox to Charter, the cable provider. But it is not only scale that is driving what is shaping up to be one of the busiest media dealmaking cycles in recent history.The rise of streaming video from pioneers such as Netflix and Amazon has upended television, eroding audiences and sapping advertising revenue. As the industry grapples with changing viewer habits, big distributors are consolidating and acquiring content owners, leaving TV network owners like CBS and Viacom — which were housed under the same roof from 2000 to 2006 — exposed. “Companies in the middle risk getting squeezed in their economics by the very large guys unless they can figure out their comparative advantage,” says one senior New York banker.The industry has been undergoing a tectonic shift for some time. AT&T, best known as a wireless operator, first signalled its ambitions to scale up in media with its $48.5bn purchase of satellite operator DirecTV in 2014. Two years later, it made an even bigger bet by proposing to buy Time Warner, the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio, for $85.4bn. The Trump administration has sued to block that deal on antitrust grounds and the case is headed for trial in March.Other smaller players have also made moves, from Discovery Communications snapping up Scripps Networks Interactive, owner of the Food Network, for $14.6bn to film studio Lionsgate spending $4.4bn on premium cable channel Starz. Speculation has also swirled around AMC Networks, the company behind hit shows including The Walking Dead and Mad Men.CBS and Viacom last explored a deal in late 2016, when the Redstone family — which holds controlling stakes in both companies — urged them to consider a merger to “respond even more aggressively and effectively to the challenges of the changing entertainment and media landscape”. But discussions fell apart after it became apparent that Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, opposed the combination, say people briefed on the matter. The two companies’ fortunes have diverged in the years since they split in 2006. Viacom’s cable networks, including MTV and Nickelodeon, have been particularly hard hit, and the company is in the midst of restructuring following a messy struggle for control that led to a management shake-up in 2016. CBS, on the other hand, has the US’s most-watched broadcast channel and has sought new sources of revenue by offering its streaming service.Last week’s announcement that the two companies are again weighing a deal suggests that as the circle of possible partners shrinks, they do not want to be left standing when the music stops. Investors were wary, however — CBS shares fell 6 per cent on Friday and Viacom dropped 3 per cent. But media bankers say that any future deals will depend on the regulatory approvals of AT&T’s proposed takeover of Time Warner and Disney’s acquisition.“We believe the outcome of [AT&T-Time Warner] will serve as a litmus test for the rest of the industry and could incentivise and expedite additional dealmaking if approved by the court,” UBS analysts wrote in a recent note.Verizon, in particular, will be watching closely the outcome of AT&T’s court battle with the US Department of Justice.If the AT&T deal falls apart, Verizon — which has thus far focused on acquiring smaller digital media assets such as Yahoo and AOL — could swoop in with a fresh offer for Time Warner, say several dealmakers.Alternatively, these people added, Verizon could move to combine with Charter Communications, the second-largest US cable operator — something it has previously explored. Such a merger would give it a clear distribution channel to better compete with Comcast, the biggest cable company, and AT&T.“Verizon needs to do something big,” says an adviser who has worked closely with the telecoms company. “They either do something with Charter or they risk being bought by Comcast.”Charter and Comcast both acknowledged the more active dealmaking environment on their recent earnings calls with investors.“There may be opportunities for us to create more value for our shareholders, like we did with NBCUniversal [the media group Comcast bought in 2009]. In this respect, it shouldn’t be a surprise that we study every situation that comes along,” says Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast. But, he adds, “I’d say that there’s nothing we feel we have to acquire.”Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter, says: “If there were opportunities for acquisitions at the right price, we’d always be interested in entertaining those.”But even as media and telecoms groups size each other up, they cannot ignore the elephant in the room. Amazon and Netflix are spending heavily to produce more content and steal more eyeballs away from traditional television. Meanwhile, Google and Apple have the financial resources and technological prowess either to swallow or crush even the biggest legacy media titans.Until recently, Mr Murdoch’s legacy had been defined by empire building. Instead, his lasting impact may be the widescale reordering of the industry his exit has triggered.
233;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-02-05T16:46:25Z;Content kings bet that scale is key to survival;A Viacom-CBS reunion would be just the latest flight to scale;When in doubt, be big. That is the motto of the media industry today. There is, without question, lots of doubt around, as the internet-isation of television and film continues to unfold. Once there were movie theaters, cable TV, broadcast TV, and DVD rentals. Content marched through these forums in a sequential, predictable way. Now the DVD is on the wane, and a wilderness of video streaming options have appeared: Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Apple TV, YouTube, and so on. And none of the streamers are content to take programming that cable and broadcast have shown first.In the new world, scale is more valuable. As viewing options have proliferated, content has remained king — but now it is the very best content that rules all. Most of the spoils go to the most popular movies, shows and sports broadcasts. Distributors will only pay up for content packages that contain real gold. And when that great content is for sale, there are more bidders at the table. Some of the bidders — most prominently Amazon and Netflix — are not too concerned with making a strong return on their investment. It is a land grab.So, be big, in order to afford the good stuff. Disney, already huge, wants to buy Twenty-First Century Fox’s film and television assets. The vast US telecom and internet provider AT&T will buy Time Warner if the US government lets it. CBS, a leader in US free-to-air television, and Viacom, a cable television provider, are now in merger discussions. The effect could be seismic: total value of the six companies involved tops $700bn.CBS-Viacom is a special case: a merger will be a reunion, after the two split up in 2006. That a deal would be a complete strategic reversal — and the bankers would make a packet of fees both coming and going — does not necessarily make it a bad option. But it does offer some important lessons.One is that family-controlled companies require special handling. Both Viacom and CBS are controlled by the Redstone family’s National Amusements. It may be that CBS — the stronger of the two companies — has better options for a merger partner than struggling Viacom. But the Redstones have a strong interest in getting Viacom into a stabilising alliance. Minority investors should be asking tough questions.The Viacom-CBS saga also illustrates just how hard it is to predict the future of media. When the two companies decided to break up, the justification was compelling. Viacom’s cable networks had strong potential for growth, it was thought, so its profits were best reinvested. CBS’s free-to-air broadcast business had little growth potential, so its profits were best returned to investors. By separating the two, each half would become more attractive to a specific class of investors, and so more valuable.In the event, Viacom did not outgrow CBS. This is in part because of some bad choices by Viacom — a lousy deal with Netflix, for one — and partly because CBS made some good bets on sport and successfully forced cable distributors to pay for the right to re-transmit its free-to-air programming. But it is also because CBS’ dowdy-looking content proved to have an enduring appeal, and advertisers remained surprisingly keen on the big, heterogenous audiences the best broadcast TV attracts.Who could have foreseen this in 2006? And who can now foresee the shape of the industry in 2030? Netflix looks unstoppable today, and vast size looks like a prerequisite for success. But investors, when placing their bets, need to remember that no industry is more changeable than media.
234;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Patty McCord on voguish HR-speak and life after Netflix;Former chief talent officer talks about her no-nonsense approach to staff management;Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix, was recently contacted by a human resources executive with news of an epiphany. Reading Ms McCord’s book Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility prompted the woman to cancel her company’s annual staff performance review. “Score one for Patty,” she says, emitting a loud, throaty laugh.If it were up to Ms McCord, who joined Netflix in 1998 when it was a start-up, more companies would ditch their performance reviews, and other shibboleths such as signing bonuses, anonymous employee surveys and pay secrecy. She wants to shake up human resources, which has a reputation for being out of touch.Bureaucracies have slowed down innovation“You need to choose the practices rather than just do them because it has been done before,” she says. “The top-down hierarchical model doesn’t work any more,” she tells me over the phone from Texas, where she spent her childhood, though now she lives in California. “Bureaucracies have slowed down innovation.”The 64-year-old writes as she speaks: bluntly. In the book she eschews the language of HR: “A business leader’s job is to create great teams that do amazing work on time. That’s it.” Out are the modish terms “employee engagement” and “empowerment”, which only get bandied around, she says, as workers lack power, and a belief that employees want entertainment rather than results. That is infantilising — and, as she likes to say, she is not “your mom”.Netflix, which pivoted from DVD mailing company to streaming service and then to entertainment producer, has forged a reputation for producing high-quality on-demand programmes such as The Crown.It is renowned for its organisational culture. Company perks include unlimited time off and an expense policy that is simply to “act in Netflix’s best interests”. That is the upside of the culture: treating workers like grown-ups.The flipside is intolerance of anything below high performance. Managers are expected to run the “keeper test” — that is, would a manager try hard to keep an employee from leaving? If not, they should ask them to leave with a pay-off.Ms McCord wrote Powerful as a “how-to for HR professionals”. After she left Netflix in 2012, she went hunting for human resources innovations. “I couldn’t find much,” she says.Instead, all anyone wanted to discuss was how to do the “Netflix deck” (see box below). “It took 10 years to write!” Ms McCord, who now advises blue-chip companies and entrepreneurs on culture and leadership, insists that Netflix’s culture cannot, and should not, be replicated wholesale by every company.But surely HR policies honed over decades are there because they work? Ms McCord agrees, but only to a point.She wants to prompt executives to interrogate “practices rather than just to do them because it has been done before”. They must also be alert to change. “You can’t keep a culture [as it was].”Predictably, Ms McCord argues HR should have greater influence. She says part of the reason for turmoil at Uber, the ride-hailing app, which was criticised last year for ignoring sexual harassment allegations, was because “HR couldn’t speak to Travis [Kalanick, the co-founder and then CEO].” Yet they need to up their game, she argues, by understanding the core operations of a business and its profit and loss statement.The #MeToo movement has underlined the ineffectiveness of HR. While gratified to see women speaking up about harassment and hopeful about an end to the start-up “frat house” culture, Ms McCord worries HR’s image as the “evil mom” is being reinforced.Work is work . . . It’s not always a brilliant life-changing event every dayThe book’s relentless focus on brilliant performance can be exhausting for the reader. Does every employee have to be a star, all the time? “Work is work,” she says. “It’s not always a brilliant life-changing event every day.”But she dismisses the idea that some jobs suit mediocre employees, recounting a conversation with a chief executive, who dared to make such a case. “I asked, ‘OK, who in your company doesn’t need to be brilliant? Like, which job?’”When he tentatively suggested payroll, she replied: “Not every position needs to be filled with Albert Einstein, but they need to be very good at what they do.”On Glassdoor, the job review site, one Netflix employee writes it is “open knowledge that the company isn’t responsible for your career progression”. It is a view championed in Powerful: “We should not make false promises of job security,” writes Ms McCourt. If a good employee no longer fitted their role, Ms McCord says, she has helped them find a new one elsewhere.And so the end came for Ms McCord. In 2012, she got her own severance package. “It was time,” she reflects. “I left as Netflix transitioned to an international streaming model. It was a different phase that I wasn’t suited to . . . they were going into film. It wasn’t a surprise.” For someone who espouses radical honesty, she is touchy on the topic. Reporters, she hits back, are “obsessed with the break-up . . . Of course I was upset. Is life without Netflix unbearable? Hell, no.”In 2009, Netflix’s 124-page presentation on its workplace principles — or “freedom & responsibility deck”, as it became known — went viral when it was published online. Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, said it “may well be the most important document ever to come out of [Silicon] Valley” — unusual for a PowerPoint presentation. An updated version was published last year at jobs.netflix.com/culture

The company has taken numerous financial charges and laid off thousands of employees.Blackstone is expected to deepen the cost-cutting programme that Thomson Reuters management has undertaken in recent years.Under the terms of the deal, Blackstone will acquire a 55 per cent stake in Thomson Reuters’ financial and risk division. The unit will be carved out into a new company, controlled by Blackstone, with Thomson Reuters owning the remainder. Blackstone is working with two of the largest global institutional investors, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singapore state fund GIC.The future of Reuters’s newsgathering business is also secured, because Blackstone will paying a minimum of $325m per year for its services for 30 years as part of the deal.Dimon signs on for another five years at JPMorgan
It was a running joke at JPMorgan Chase that Jamie Dimon was on a rolling plan, writes Ben McLannahan.Whenever people asked how much longer the chief executive planned to stay on, they would get the reply: “Five more years.”Now there is a harder timeline.In 2023 or thereabouts, Mr Dimon would make way, the board said this week, adding that two senior executives — retail banking chief Gordon Smith, 59, and investment banking head Daniel Pinto, 55 — would effectively become his deputies.The statement aligned the bank more closely with peers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, where there are obvious short-term successors and a handful of younger candidates over the longer term.Many always presumed that Mr Smith, in particular, would step up if Mr Dimon — treated for cancer in 2014 — had to stand down. Now it is official.The statement also kept alive the idea that Mr Dimon, 61, has ambitions beyond Wall Street.Over the past few years he has adopted an ambassadorial role, delegating most of the quarterly interactions with analysts to finance chief Marianne Lake, for example.He has been burnishing his credentials as a man of the people, appearing tieless on TV to talk about rebuilding Detroit or lifting wages.This week’s healthcare partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon was in a similar vein: advancing the idea that JPMorgan is tackling the big problems of America.Dimon 2024? Do not rule it out.HBO joins Netflix in shattering subscription records
The shift in television viewing from the traditional cable bundle to digitally delivered programming is accelerating with Time Warner’s HBO channel delivering its best ever results in 2017, writes Shannon Bond.HBO, the premium cable network behind Veep and Game of Thrones, added more than 5m US customers last year, in excess of 1m more than its previous record for subscription growth. HBO subscription revenues gained 11 per cent, the largest expansion in more than two decades.The channel’s improved performance came days after Netflix hit $100bn in market value after adding 8.3m subscribers in the final three months of the year, shattering its previous guidance of 6.3m. The gains of HBO and Netflix stand out in a television industry losing audiences because of the proliferation of digital consumption.HBO has been able to buck the cord-cutting trend with a distribution model that relies as much on pacts with cable and satellite providers as on offering its programming through a wide array of broadband-delivered services that do not require a pay-television subscription.The company’s subscriptions delivered outside the traditional pay-TV bundle now total more than 5m, up from 2m a year ago. Its total global subscriber base is 142m, with Netflix at 117.6m. Time Warner reported higher revenue and profit last year, with additional help from increases at Turner, the home of CNN and TBS, and Warner Bros, where film hits including Wonder Woman and Dunkirk contributed to more than $5bn in box-office receipts.Capita’s profit warning shakes outsourcing rivals
The UK outsourcing group Capita gave a frank assessment of its problems this week, admitting that it was “far too complex”, too focused on the short term and had relied too much on acquisitions for growth, writes Gill Plimmer.The warnings — from Jonathan Lewis, chief executive as of two months — sent the stock tumbling to a 20-year low on Thursday. The reverberations also spread to rival outsourcing companies. Share prices fell at Interserve, Mitie and Serco, highlighting market nervousness following the liquidation two weeks ago of Carillion.To shore up its balance sheet, Capita which, among other things, runs the London congestion charge and handles administrative services for the National Health Service, announced a £700m rights issue and suspended its dividend. It warned its 2018 profits would be far below market expectations.Although trading in its financial year had been in line with its expectations, Capita said profits before tax in 2018 were now likely to be between £270m and £300m, below analysts’ expectations of £400m. The group will end the year with £1.2bn of net debt.Whitehall officials sought to reassure markets that Capita was in a different position from Carillion, while admitting that they had met senior Capita executives on Wednesday after the profit warning.But Neil Woodford, one of the UK’s best-known fund managers, and Capita’s third-largest shareholder, reiterated his support.He said he would hold on to his stock in anticipation of a turnround.Facebook hails its pursuit of health and happiness
Facebook tried to win over investors to its plan for prioritising the health and happiness of its users over their engagement on the social network, arguing that people spending less time on the app would not necessarily mean advertisers spending less cash, writes Hannah Kuchler.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, began the company’s earnings call on Wednesday with his feelings about the state of society, not the state of Facebook’s finances. “The world is anxious and divided and that played out on Facebook. We have a responsibility to fully understand how our services are used and amplify the good,” he said.The challenge for analysts is to understand how sweeping changes to the news feed announced this month — in the name of promoting meaningful content — could affect the business. If people are spending less time on the app, they could see fewer ads and Facebook could make less advertising revenue.Shares were initially hit. Facebook said engagement was already suffering from changes last quarter to place viral videos lower in the feed.It also revealed that the daily user count in the US and Canada, where it generates the most revenue per user at $26 in the last quarter, fell for the first time by 700,000 to 184m. Time spent on the site also declined by roughly 50m hours every day in the latest quarter, about 5 per cent.Facebook also warned that the introduction of the European General Data Protection regulation this May could hit European usage of the app, which will be forced to ask users for consent for every way it uses their data."

Here the Federal Reserve trade model suggests it needs a large 10 per cent trade-weighted index decline to add 0.25 per cent-to-0.5 per cent to the core PCE deflator [the Fed’s favoured inflation gauge] over a year.”Meanwhile, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross held firm on the Trump administration’s tough line on international trade, just a day after the US imposed new tariffs on imported washing machines and solar cells.“Market participants will be closely scrutinising upcoming comments from President Trump at Davos, and in his State of the Union address, to assess if trade will be a more important policy focus this year ahead of the midterm elections,” said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG.“The US dollar sell-off has been relentless since the middle of last month, and there appears no clear catalyst on the horizon to turn the tide in the near term.“It is notable that the US dollar has continued to weaken over the last month or so even as US yields have moved higher. It highlights that the US dollar has become less sensitive to Federal Reserve rate hike expectations and the performance of the US economy.”The dollar index was down 1 per cent late in the session and below the 90 level for the first time since late 2014.The US currency was down 1 per cent against the yen at a four-month low of ¥109.16 while sterling, up a hefty 1.5 per cent, traded above $1.42 for the first time since the UK’s referendum on EU membership in 2016.The euro was up 0.8 per cent versus the dollar at $1.2395.In the fixed-income arena, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury was up 3 basis points at 2.65 per cent, but off an earlier high of 2.665 per cent. The two-year yield was 2bp higher at a fresh decade-peak of 2.08 per cent.The German 10-year Bund yield rose 2bp to 0.58 per cent.The eurozone economy came under the spotlight as the latest purchasing managers’ report indicated that the region made an exceptionally strong start to 2018.“January’s composite PMI hit a near 12-year high, rising to 58.6 from 58.1 and pointing to annualised GDP growth of almost 4 per cent,” said Edoardo Campanella, economist at UniCredit.“All in all, today’s survey corroborates the view that the output gap is closing at a sustained pace, leaving the European Central Bank on track for its process of monetary policy normalisation.”The ECB will announce its latest policy decision on Thursday following a scheduled policy meeting.In spite of the renewed signs of vigour in the eurozone economy, the big rise for euro/dollar helped ensure that the pan-European Stoxx 600 equity index slipped 0.5 per cent, while the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt fell more than 1 per cent from Tuesday’s record high.It was a similar tale in the UK as sterling continued to rally, where the FTSE 100 shed 1.1 per cent.Wall Street showed signs of fatigue after the dollar’s weakness had initially propelled the main equity indices to fresh record peaks.The S&P 500 rose as high as 2,852.97 before going into reverse to stand at 2,838 at the close of play, fractionally down from Tuesday’s record close, which was the 12th so far in 2018.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent, giving back nearly all of Tuesday’s 0.7 per cent gain, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to edge up 0.2 per cent to a record closing high.In Brazil, the Bovespa index leapt 3.7 per cent after a Brazilian court dismissed an appeal by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva against a corruption conviction, dealing a heavy blow to any expectations that he might have made an election comeback this year.West Texas Intermediate, the main US crude oil contract, was up 2.1 per cent in late trade at $65.85 a barrel, its first break above the $65 mark since 2014. Data showed a sharp drop in inventories at its delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma, last week.Brent also struck a fresh three-year high of $70.83 before settling at $70.53, up 0.8 per cent on the day.The sliding dollar helped gold jump $17 to $1,358 an ounce, its highest intraday level since 2016.Additional reporting by Michael Hunter in London and Hudson Lockett in Hong KongFor market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets

It was the second-best performer in the benchmark S&P 500, behind a 17.7 per cent gain for ResMed.That brought Netflix’s gain in 2018 to 30.9 per cent, making it the top stock in the S&P 500, and nearly five times the gain for the benchmark. At Monday’s close, before the release of its December quarter results, the stock was the index’s 10th-best performer.Today’s share price jump pushed Netflix’s market capitalisation through $100bn for the first time, putting it ahead of the likes of Nike and Goldman Sachs, and just behind oilfield services company Schlumberger.Last year, Netflix shares gained 56.4 per cent, while the S&P 500 rose 19.4 per cent.
238;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-23T05:33:49Z;Netflix races to bolster content as former partners become rivals;Company to spend up to $8bn in new content this year as competition ramps up;When the first season of House of Cards made its debut on Netflix in February 2013, pundits wondered whether the video streaming service could really afford the $100m political drama. At the time, Netflix had 33.3m streaming subscribers, many of whom quickly became glued to the tale of Washington DC scheming and intrigue. Five years ago, original commissioning was a novelty for what was only a few years earlier known primarily as a DVD-by-mail business. Then, Netflix was heavily dependent on content distribution deals with traditional media groups including Walt Disney and Mad Men-maker AMC for the vast majority of its online library. Fast-forward to early 2018 and Netflix can afford to write off $39m without Wall Street even blinking. The $39m non-cash charge incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to programming, including two episodes of House of Cards that Netflix commissioned but will never air due to the sexual harassment scandal that erupted around the show’s leading man, Kevin Spacey. That charge was reported alongside another forecast-busting set of results released on Monday that sent Netflix’s market capitalisation soaring above $100bn for the first time, sending shares up more than 10 per cent on Tuesday morning.Annual revenues jumped 32 per cent year-on-year to $11.7bn in 2017, while net income tripled to $559m, thanks to hit shows including Stranger Things, The Crown and 13 Reasons Why. “Given the big beat on subscribers in the quarter — especially for the domestic business, it is hard to argue with Netflix’s statement that they ‘had a beautiful quarter’,” said analysts MoffettNathanson.Tuesday morning also gave Netflix a preview of its most promising Academy Awards yet, as its movie Mudbound received four nominations — its first for a feature film. Other titles brought its nomination total to eight, up from just three last year.Yet as investors cheered Netflix’s accelerating growth to reach 117.6m subscribers globally, the company warned that maintaining its momentum in original content would come at an upfront cost that makes that initial $100m outlay look like a rounding error. Netflix’s liabilities from content pre-payment and debt have increased fourfold in the last five years. The combination of its long-term debt and streaming content obligations has swelled from $6.1bn at the end of 2012, when House of Cards was first commissioned, to $24.2bn at the end of last year. Of that total, $17.7bn is streaming content obligations — what it pays for the acquisition, licensing and production of television shows and movies, sometimes years in advance of broadcasting a show. The other $6.5bn is debt — and Netflix said on Monday that it planned to tap the bond markets again soon. Analysts at Jefferies said in a note to clients that expenses such as marketing spending and programming cost were “higher relative to our expectations”.To justify that $24bn of liabilities, chief executive Reed Hastings is asking investors to bet on Netflix’s success in producing hit shows as it races to fill the programming gap left by the likes of Disney turning from partner to competitor in the streaming market. “We’ve had that track record in the last couple of years at greater and greater scale,” Mr Hastings said in Monday’s quarterly analyst interview, which the company streamed on YouTube. “We are continuing to take it up a notch.” Many analysts agreed, with researchers at Bernstein saying that the results confirmed Netflix’s “flywheel is working brilliantly”, as more content drives more subscribers which fuels further programming investment.“Content and marketing investment is working better than anticipated — so the indicated action is: press the gas pedal,” Bernstein’s Todd Juenger wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Spending more, faster is ironically the less risky path, since the most important key to long-term success is extending the scale advantage as wide and fast as possible.”Netflix executives touted the upcoming launches of Altered Carbon, a science-fiction show, and Everything Sucks, a coming-of-age comedy-drama set in 1990s Oregon, as examples of shows that would continue to attract new subscribers in 2018. The company also plans to commission more programming in languages other than English, from just a handful of shows last year such as Germany’s Dark to more than 30 international “originals” in 2018, from producers in Poland, South Korea and Japan. Alongside that are dozens more full-length movies, after the Will Smith blockbuster Bright proved a hit with viewers last month. In total, Netflix plans to invest as much as $8bn in new content this year — and Mr Hastings warned that the budget would continue to grow. “It will definitely of course be higher in 2019 and 2020,” he said of Netflix’s content costs. “Don’t think of $8bn as some new plateau.” Competition, too, is increasing. Disney is planning to launch new subscription streaming services starting later this year and Hulu, the US internet video service that is jointly owned by Disney, Fox and Comcast, grew to 17m subscribers last year. Anticipation of that competition from traditional media companies was what drove Netflix to invest in its own TV shows in the first place, according to content chief Ted Sarandos. “We have strategically and they have strategically been moving in this direction for a long time,” he said on Monday. “One of the reasons that we entered into original programming was that if we got to the place where networks didn’t want to sell us their content in second [distribution] windows that we would be replacing that by creating our own original programming. And it’s playing out in that direction.”Mr Sarandos added that many Netflix shows that are licensed from or made by Disney, such as Marvel spin-offs Jessica Jones and The Punisher, are locked into long-term deals. “As long as they keep making those shows, they continue on Netflix,” he said.If Mr Hastings was concerned about the impact of Disney’s $66bn plan to buy 21st Century Fox’s entertainment businesses, he did a good job of hiding it when he was quizzed by analysts about it for the first time on Monday. “These kind of big US media company mergers are pretty peripheral to us,” he said. “I was as surprised as anyone else that Fox was willing to sell”. Yet even though Rupert Murdoch has suggested that the competitive threat from Netflix contributed to his decision to sell Fox to Disney, Mr Hastings said he was looking forward to the new streaming services that would follow the deal — as a viewer, at least. “Disney, with its strength of brand and unique content, will have some real success,” the Netflix chief said. “I know I'll be a subscriber of it for my own personal watching.”Classical conditioning and the Netflix viewer / From William Hamilton, Phoenix, AZ, US
239;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix: wearing the Crown;Streaming service’s shares and subscriber figures surge, but so is its spending;"In 2013, chief executive Reed Hastings warned there was “euphoria” and a “hype-fest” around Netflix’s shares. They have since risen 400 per cent.The latest 8 per cent jump came after fourth-quarter results on Monday evening, which took Netflix’s market capitalisation above $100bn for the first time. Almost all of the other companies in that exclusive club make real money; Netflix made just $560m in net income last year. Even the top line of $12bn (though growing at an impressive 30 per cent annually) is a thin pillar to support that valuation. More alarming still, having reported negative free cash flow of $2bn in 2017, Netflix announced the deficit might double in 2018 to Tesla-type levels.The positive news — and why Netflix narcissistically described the quarter as “beautiful” — is that subscribers are eagerly handing over their credit card details. Some 8m net new subscribers were added in the quarter. The pace has increased even as it reaches 118m customers.Netflix uses this to justify ever-increasing content spending, which now exceeds $8bn a year. The biggest budget shows, such as The Crown, are best at luring and keeping customers, Netflix says. Yet it means the path to serious profits is still hazy. On the earnings call, Mr Hastings acknowledged nonchalantly that existing rivals such as Hulu and YouTube were still growing well and that new challengers in streaming, such as Disney, would find a sizeable audience.It would be more reassuring if Netflix were digging a moat. Instead, it is spending heavily with no expectation of achieving dominance. If viewers will pay for multiple streaming services, why will they ever pay Netflix enough to boost profits to levels that would support a $100bn valuation? Netflix can point to the fact that customers absorbed a 10 per cent increase in the US and Europe last year without grumbling. But price and user growth have a long way to go before euphoria is eliminated.Do you want to receive Lex in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly Best of Lex email at ft.com/newsletters."

Shares in the video streaming service hit a record high above $248, before retreating to $246.68.However, it warned that free cash outflows could reach $4bn in 2018, double the $2bn in outflows it reported for last year, as it ploughs more money into content commissioning that may not reach screens for up to three years. That will send it back to the bond markets to raise capital, Netflix said, to add to the $6.5bn it already owes in long-term debt. Price rises in several key markets in October did not prevent Netflix from adding 1.98m subscribers in the US and 6.36m in the rest of the world to take its total for the fourth quarter to 117.6m, about 2m ahead of Wall Street’s estimates. Revenues grew by 33 per cent to $3.29bn while net income was 177 per cent higher at $186m. Earnings per share were in line with analysts’ expectations at 41 cents. Daniel Ives, analyst at GBH Insights, called the results “eye popping”. “The company’s aggressive international expansion strategy is bearing fruit and putting major fuel in the company’s growth engine for 2018 and beyond,” he wrote in a note.The price increases mean that Netflix is now forecasting higher profits in the first quarter, after average selling prices increased by 9 per cent in the last quarter. Net income is likely to jump 51 per cent to $282m and operating margins are forecast to increase from 7.5 per cent to 9.8 per cent in the first three months of 2018, the Silicon Valley-based company said. Netflix’s first-quarter revenue forecast of $3.69bn, up 40 per cent year on year, is also better than analysts had predicted, with subscribers growing by another 6.35m to 124m globally. . . . aggressive international expansion strategy is putting major fuel in the company’s growth engine for 2018 and beyondBecause Netflix is growing audiences faster than it expected, it warned shareholders to brace for even greater investment in content. “We are increasing operating margins and expect that, in the future, a combination of rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spend will turn our business [free cash flow] positive,” Netflix said. It added: “We anticipate continuing to raise capital in the high-yield market . . . High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick.” Netflix also sought to reassure investors as competition with both tech companies and traditional media groups intensifies, including Walt Disney’s planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV assets. “The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,” Netflix said. “In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.”Earlier this month, Hulu — the US TV streaming service in which Disney will become the largest shareholder after the Fox deal closes — reported it had increased its subscribers to 17m last year, with a total audience of 54m unique viewers.
241;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-22T22:59:54Z;Netflix takes $39m hit on Kevin Spacey harassment scandal;Streaming service books non-cash charge for scrapped content;The sexual harassment scandal surrounding Kevin Spacey just cost Netflix nearly $40m.The streaming service said in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday that it took a $39m non-cash charge for “unreleased content we’ve decided not to move forward with”.The figure provides a hint of how much the wave of scandals that followed allegations of sexual harassment against top producer Harvey Weinstein last year might cost Hollywood. Mr Spacey has denied many of the allegations.According to a person familiar with the matter, Netflix’s entire $39m write-off was related to productions that had been shot but not aired starring Mr Spacey, who was first accused in October of making unwanted advances and inappropriate conduct towards several people over many years.The cancelled projects were two episodes of House of Cards, the long-running political drama in which Mr Spacey starred as anti-hero Frank Underwood, and a biopic movie, Gore, in which he played the titular writer Gore Vidal. The movie, which was based on the 2015 Vidal biography Empire of Self and was in post-production when Netflix pulled the plug, had been slated for release this year.In November, Netflix said it would cut ties with Mr Spacey and end House of Cards after the forthcoming sixth season, after suspending production after members of the show’s crew accused the actor of inappropriate touching.House of Cards was among the first of Netflix’s original series to debut and helped cement its reputation as a new creative force in Hollywood. Netflix said on Monday it will spend up to $8bn on original content this year.

243;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-19T18:06:57Z;David Letterman, the chat show host returns on demand;Former ‘Late Show’ presenter fronts Netflix series to woo the online generation;"The former king of late night American television has returned to the small screen, but David Letterman and his impressive Santa Claus beard are shunning the airwaves for digital streaming. Netflix has launched a series of one-hour Letterman interviews that will run without commercial interruption, giving the man who presented a nightly talk show for 33 years a chance to shine for the online, on-demand generation.Mr Letterman has assembled an impressive line up of interviewees for My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, starting this week with former US president Barack Obama, whose interview kicks off a series that will feature, among others, the hip hop star Jay-Z, women’s rights activist Malala Yousafzai and the writer and comedienne Tina Fey. Longer than the bite-sized interviews Mr Letterman is used to, the new series will be a change of pace for the 70-year-old, who has kept a low profile since stepping down as presenter of CBS’s Late Show almost three years ago. “You’re hang-gliding and you’re climbing volcanoes; you’re windsurfing and you’re wrestling sharks,” he says at one point to Mr Obama when comparing their lives out of the spotlight. “I’m at Bed Bath & Beyond picking out wire hangers.”The show marks the latest step in Netflix’s plan for world domination. It plans to spend up to $8bn on content in 2018, producing dozens of original movies and television series aimed for every age and demographic. Its success — it now has more than 110m subscribers around the world — has disrupted broadcast television, hitting ratings and commercial revenues and changing audience expectations.So-called “linear” television — sitting down at a set time to watch programming when it is broadcast — has become anathema to many viewers, particularly millennials raised on streaming: they expect to watch what they want, when they want. Traditional broadcasters now routinely release entire series at once to be “binged” online, while in the US some channels have cut the number of ads they show on air in an attempt to slow the viewer drift to digital platforms.The Letterman series is Netflix’s second stab at a chat show. Its first, starring the comic Chelsea Handler, ended in failure after only two series: Ms Handler said she quit after being “galvanised” by the election of Donald Trump and pledged to focus on becoming a more “engaged citizen”.It is unclear if Mr Letterman will have more success or if relaxed conversation with big names will have the same draw online when the programme is unmoored from a live television schedule. Regardless of whether it succeeds, Netflix can afford to make the bet: its content spend is far more than the programming budgets of most big media companies.The company’s growth has already caused one big media surprise. Last month, Rupert Murdoch shocked friends and colleagues with the decision to break up the entertainment empire that took him decades to assemble, striking a deal to sell most of it to Walt Disney. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Murdoch suggested a motivation to sell was the realisation that he could no longer compete with deep-pocketed, global streaming players such as Netflix and Amazon. “We are living in an age of enormous disruption,” he said.In Mr Letterman, Netflix has signed a treasured television personality. Born and raised in Indiana, his first job was as a weatherman before comedy took him east to New York, where he brought an “aw-shucks” Midwestern sensibility to the stand-up circuit. This led to a break doing comedy segments on NBC’s Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.He graduated to standing in for Mr Carson but was passed over to replace him as the Tonight Show host when the seat became vacant in 1992, his one-time friend Jay Leno getting the job instead. Mr Letterman had assumed he would succeed Mr Carson as the host of America’s most-watched (and revered) late-night show and was devastated to miss out; the decision setting in train a feud with Mr Leno that would last years.He blossomed at the Late Show on CBS, where he vied for the same audience as his erstwhile rival. Mr Letterman’s impact with audiences extended beyond those who just watched him read his top 10 lists, supervise “stupid pet tricks” and banter with his sidekick Larry “Bud” Melman (a former file clerk with a face for radio who was dispatched on televised missions, including handing out hot towels to arrivals at New York’s grim Port Authority bus terminal). “The Johnny Carson show said: ‘Take a break from your weird life and watch these famous people have fun in show business,’” the comedian John Mulaney said when Mr Letterman was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor last year. “Dave’s show said: ‘Your weird life is just as funny as show business.’”His brand of ironic post-modern comedy inspired the likes of Jon Stewart, Judd Apatow and Stephen Colbert and earned him the fierce loyalty of colleagues and friends who will be anxious to see his Netflix foray turn into a global success. “I believe that Dave would run into a burning house to save my children,” his longtime colleague and Late Show bandleader Paul Shaffer told the audience in Washington DC at the Mark Twain Prize ceremony last year. “And I hope and know, Dave, that I would do the same for you, should you some day feel comfortable enough to tell me where your house is.”The writer is the FT’s global media editor"
244;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-15T12:08:00Z;Disney directors: leaned in, kicked out;Are media companies worrying too much about the tech threat?;"Paranoia strikes deep. On Friday evening, Walt Disney said Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey were leaving its board due to increased conflicts of interest.The Mouse had gained tech lustre from hobnobbing with the author of Lean In and the co-founder of Donald Trump’s favourite pressure valve. But recently, the pair had begun to resemble cuckoos in the nest.In anticipation of a fiercer fight with Silicon Valley, Disney is separately paying $66bn to bulk up by acquiring film and television assets from 21st Century Fox. As part of the same frenzy, Citigroup analysts speculate there is a “40 per cent chance” Apple will acquire Netflix this year.If potential conflicts of interest were as serious as portrayed, should Apple not remove Disney’s chief executive Bob Iger from its own board? And why is Facebook allowing Netflix’s Reid Hastings to serve as a director and glean information on its strategy?Perhaps the tech companies are not mobilising after all. Certainly, Apple, always a coy dealmaker, is unlikely to spend $130bn or more on Netflix, a company with just $11bn of annual revenues and $400m of net income. If Apple used some of its $250bn overseas cash pile, even marginally profitable Netflix might be earnings accretive. But it would be a risky, quirky move.Media caution is no bad thing. Amazon already has a big streaming business as part of its Prime service. Alphabet’s YouTube has 1.5bn monthly viewers. Apple, Facebook and Twitter are also experimenting with home-made content and bidding for rights.For years, media companies were blasé about Netflix and paid the price. The likes of Viacom happily licensed their content to the upstart streaming service only to find themselves overtaken. Viacom’s shares are down by a third in five years; Netflix, whose enterprise value overtook Viacom in 2015, is up 1,300 per cent.

245;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-13T02:38:58Z;Facebook’s Sandberg and Twitter’s Dorsey to quit Disney board;Latest sign of competitive tensions between Hollywood and Silicon Valley ;Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter chief Jack Dorsey are stepping down from Walt Disney’s board of directors, the media group said late on Friday, in the latest sign of the growing competitive tensions between Hollywood and Silicon Valley.The move was revealed by the omission in Disney’s annual proxy statement of Ms Sandberg’s and Mr Dorsey’s names from the list of directors standing for re-election.Once seen as allies and advisers to help guide traditional media companies into the digital age, tech executives are now viewed as presenting potential conflicts of interest. “Given our evolving business and the businesses Ms Sandberg and Mr Dorsey are in, it has become increasingly difficult for them to avoid conflicts relating to board matters, and they are not standing for re-election,” a Disney spokesperson said. Disney is preparing to launch online streaming services starting later this year that will compete not only with the likes of Netflix but also the growing online video offerings from social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.Technology companies including Apple, Amazon and Facebook are together pouring billions of dollars into original content commissioning, often bidding against traditional networks for the rights to new shows and live sports broadcasts. Neither Facebook nor Twitter had any comment beyond Disney’s statement. Ms Sandberg, who is Facebook’s chief operating officer, had at one time been seen as a potential successor to Disney chief executive Bob Iger. However, Ms Sandberg ruled herself out of the running in 2016 when she told a Recode conference: “I don’t want another job . . . I love Facebook and my team.” At that time, Mr Iger had been planning to step down later this year but as part of Disney’s move to acquire 20th Century Fox, announced last month, he extended his contract as chairman and chief executive until the end of 2021. Disney considered buying Twitter in 2016, Mr Iger has subsequently admitted, as the media group looked for new ways to build a direct relationship with consumers.Given our evolving business and the businesses Ms Sandberg and Mr Dorsey are in, it has become increasingly difficult for them to avoid conflicts relating to board matters . . .Despite Disney’s claim of a conflict of interest, it is not unusual for tech and media executives to serve on each others’ boards. Mr Iger is an Apple director, while Netflix chief Reed Hastings is on Facebook’s board. Disney’s sports streaming service based on its ESPN network of channels is scheduled to launch later this year, while a family entertainment online video service is set to follow next year. Last May, Twitter announced 12 new collaborations to bring “hundreds of hours” of live programming, including sports, to its rapid-fire communications platform, including PGA Tour golf and Major League Baseball. In September, Facebook launched Watch, a new tab dedicated to a wide range of original video, and the social network is said to be planning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars on content this year. Alongside revealing news of Ms Sandberg’s and Mr Dorsey’s board departures in March, Disney’s filing also said two other directors would step down. Orin Smith, its lead independent director, is retiring at the age of 74. The statement also showed that Mr Iger’s total compensation fell by 17 per cent to $36.3m last year, because of a smaller performance-related cash bonus than he received in 2016.
246;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-10T05:00:35Z;Big bet by telecoms companies on exclusive content comes at a cost;BT, Altice and others spent billions on sporting rights and have seen shares fall;Over the past five years, some of the biggest European and US telecoms companies have moved into the media world by scooping up exclusive sports rights and content businesses.Those efforts have largely been applauded as bold and disruptive, with companies such as BT, Altice, Verizon and Telefónica making big bets. They have spent billions of dollars in the belief that broadcasting high-end content could be the tonic needed to avoid their businesses becoming utilities offering no more than “dumb pipes” for other media and technology companies to use.The push has culminated in AT&T’s blockbuster $85bn tilt at Time Warner which, if concluded, would mean that popular television shows such as Game of Thrones and Curb Your Enthusiasm are produced by a telecoms company.Yet the expensive push into content has come at a cost for those that have placed the biggest bets. European companies with telecoms-media strategies lost 40 per cent of their stock market valuation on average over the course of 2017, according to Stephane Beyazian, an analyst with Raymond James. Meanwhile, AT&T’s deal for Time Warner is in danger of being blocked after the Department of Justice sued to stop the takeover.By contrast, those that have taken a back seat in looking for exclusive rights have started to outperform those that have. Both Vodafone and Orange have upgraded profit forecasts as their focus on network investments has started to pay off.Orange was one of the early movers in content when it bought exclusive rights to French football matches in 2008 and launched a pay-TV cinema service backed by deals with Warner Bros, MGM and Lionsgate, the film studios. Within two years, however, the French company had retreated from exclusive content.The user does not want to be in jail with content. The user wants the best possible range of content at the best possible priceStéphane Richard, chief executive, now stresses the benefits of the aggregator model, whereby the company offers TV services to 2.7m consumers by partnering with media companies such as HBO, the US cable network, to stream their programming.“The user does not want to be in jail with content. The user wants the best possible range of content at the best possible price,” he told investors in London in December.Ramon Fernandez, deputy chief executive of Orange, adds that it is “convergence” in mobile and fixed telecoms networks, not media, that will drive growth. “It’s not this pseudo telecoms-content convergence that makes the difference,” he says.A similar tone has been adopted by Deutsche Telekom. Tim Hoettges, chief executive, boasted at the Morgan Stanley telecoms investor conference in November that rather than investing in expensive rights or “buying Time Warner”, his company was “building fibre like hell”.The German group has a lower-risk TV strategy in which it signs deals with other companies such as Netflix, the streaming service. “In some areas, we could buy exclusive content if it is a good deal but it is not my primary intention,” he said.The contrast with BT and Altice, the French telecoms and cable group, is stark. Mr Beyazian calls the two companies “flagships for the telecoms-media convergence” but both have had a turbulent 12 months: Altice lost more than half of its value while BT has dropped by a quarter.Vodafone, which dropped plans to launch a UK pay-TV service earlier this year to focus on customer services and network strength, has conversely risen 17 per cent.BT is under pressure to prove that its model works given that subscriber growth has stalled since it started charging customers for BT Sports, especially with a new auction for English Premier League rights set for February.Mr Beyazian says the company is spending £900m a year on sports, including production costs, but only generating direct sales of £450m. BT struck a cross-licensing deal with Sky in December that also signalled the company has ended its ambitions to challenge its pay-TV rival outside the sports market.The problem is even more acute for Altice. It has spent €1bn on content rights including the French football league rights that Orange abandoned earlier this decade.Founder Patrick Drahi has said that SFR, its French telecoms unit, made a “double mistake” with its sports strategy by raising prices for all customers rather than charging a premium for users who were particularly interested in sports content.Mr Drahi has ruled out more content acquisitions in the near term and this week carved out its pay-TV operations into a separate division. Altice said it was also moving away from exclusive content to partnerships and would look to offer its content on other platforms.Despite these struggles, not everyone thinks content is dead.Telefónica has invested in fibre but also spent €2.4bn for exclusive rights to Spanish football matches in 2016.Verizon, the US telecoms group, recently signed a new five-year deal to stream live NFL games and is reported to have paid more than $2bn.Telecom Italia is trying a slightly different tack. It has formed a joint venture with France’s Canal+, the pay-TV arm of its largest shareholder Vivendi, to create content. That tie-up could soon include Mediaset whose chief executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi said it was “very interested in an agreement” with Telecom Italia.Dhananjay Mirchandani, an analyst with Bernstein, says that the push into content has helped reduce churn for telecoms companies but the risk is that having established a foothold in media, the pressure to keep buying the rights at higher prices kicks in. The operators “get hooked . . . and any weaning-off is plainly painful”.This article has been amended since original publication to correct the labelling on the football chartWhile many telecoms groups pull back on content, others are launching production plans with smaller budgets than they did in the past.Orange, for example, has committed to spending a modest €100m over the course of five years on TV content. That is about the same amount that US network HBO spent on the first season of Vinyl, its 2016 rock drama which it cancelled.This month will also feature the debut of Telefonica’s La Peste, a thriller set during the bubonic plague that is estimated to have cost €10m. The Spanish company has wider plans to develop original content and has budgeted €70m this year to kickstart pay-TV growth in its home market and sell it internationally.The company’s latest foray into content is a much more modest effort than it pursued at the turn of the century when it spent €5.5bn to acquire Endemol, the maker of the reality TV show Big Brother. The deal was part of a major international push to drive into the media and internet realms under Juan Villalonga, its former chairman.However, the strategy backfired and Endemol was sold off in 2007 for €2.6bn by Mr Villalonga’s successor César Alierta. He deemed Telefonica’s TV arm to be non-core and invested instead in telecoms assets, including acquiring O2.
247;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix shares jump on Letterman talk-show debut date;;Get the popcorn ready.Netflix shares are up 1.4 per cent to a new all-time high of $208.73 on Friday after the video-streaming service announced a January 12 premier date for the new show from longtime talk-show host and comedian David Letterman, as well as its first guest — Barack Obama, the former US president.In a tweet, Netflix announced other high-profile guests for the show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman, including rapper Jay-Z, radio personality Howard Stern, comedy star Tina Fey, activist Malala Yousafzai and actor George Clooney.The show will differ from Netflix’s usual binge-able original content in that new episodes will be released once a month, rather than all at once. Nevertheless, Wall Street seems to be buying the hype, along with fans eager to see Mr Letterman — who spent several decades as one of the top late-night TV hosts before retiring from the small screen in 2015 — back in action.
248;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2018-01-03T00:01:15Z;UK music sales hit high note as streaming services boom;Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer drive record growth as vinyl continues comeback;Music sales in the UK have risen at the fastest rate since the turn of the century, driven by the continued boom in streaming services and led by artists such as Ed Sheeran.The BPI, the music industry trade body, said that services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer drove a 9.5 per cent rise in music consumption in 2017, with the 68.1bn songs streamed last year accounting for more than half of overall music consumption.The most streamed artists include Sheeran, Little Mix and Kendrick Lamar although the overall charts included older acts such as Roy Orbison and George Michael, who died at the end of 2016, among the top sellers.Geoff Taylor, BPI chief executive, cautioned that the latest figures did not signal that the sector had secured a sustainable future following the disruption caused by digital services. “The music industry still has a long way to go to recover fully. Structural challenges must be overcome if long-term growth is to be sustained,” he said.The Entertainment Retailers Association said sales of overall entertainment products, which include music, video games and movies, also hit an all-time high of £7.2bn sales last year with digital services accounting for 71 per cent of that. However, music accounted for just 16 per cent of the UK entertainment market.The BPI said vinyl had continued its comeback, with sales up £88m to their highest since 1991. The old-fashioned album now accounts for one in 10 albums sold in a physical format.Sheeran topped the vinyl charts for 2017. The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Fleetwood Mac also featured, with heritage acts continuing to sell well on the older format.Kim Bayley, chief executive of the ERA, said a physical product was most popular when it “offers something distinctive and additional to the content, whether it be the tactile experience of vinyl or the simple fact that physical objects work well as gifts”.
249;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-28T12:19:18Z;Winners and losers in the sharing economy;We are entering an era in which consumers will value access over ownership;Who remembers the sound of unwrapping a new record album, the smell of a new car or the thrill of opening the front door to a newly purchased home? At different points in my life, each one stood for the joy of possession, and the sense of having really arrived.My teenaged children and their peers do not see things the same way. They would rather pay for Spotify and Netflix subscriptions that let them play selections from huge online music and video catalogues than purchase DVDs or permanent downloads of a smaller selection of titles.Streaming is at the forefront of a trend that threatens to upend a much wider range of industries. Technology-based groups are encouraging consumers to rethink their approach to everything from textbooks and party dresses to housing and transportation. The changes come in several categories. Platform apps are linking owners of goods and services — bicycles, spare bedrooms, even solar energy — to a host of potential users. And companies that traditionally focused on selling their wares, including clothing retailers and carmakers, are now exploring subscription and rental options.Taken together, the growth of these services suggests that we are entering an era in which consumers will value access over ownership and experiences over assets. The new US tax reform law may well help push the process along because it shrinks the two biggest tax breaks that encourage Americans to own their homes — homebuyers will only be able to deduct the interest on the first $750,000 of the mortgage on their houses and the deduction for state and local property taxes is capped at $10,000. Without those benefits, people who live in high-cost, high-tax areas may well decide to keep on renting. The cresting of British house prices at levels that are not affordable for most ordinary people is likely to have a similar effect in parts of the UK.This transformation has a precedent. Many companies shifted to an asset-light model years ago — supermarkets and professional services firms sold and leased back their stores and offices, airlines started leasing rather than buying aircraft, and big tech groups such as Apple hired other companies, most notably Foxconn, to make iPhones.Companies that traditionally focused on selling their wares, including clothing retailers and carmakers, are now exploring subscription and rental optionsFor the most successful companies, the decision to focus on intangible assets, such as intellectual property, has been a huge boon. The move allows them to grow rapidly without having to invest in building factories or hire enormous amounts of staff. But for those at the other end of the scale, the lack of real property leaves them with little to borrow against or sell when they run short of cash. When British budget airline Monarch collapsed in October, its main asset turned out to be its UK landing slots.“Once companies go asset light they can scale up tremendously. But I don’t think people have really thought through the implications of consumers being asset light,” says Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College, who has co-written a book on the subject, Capitalism without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy. “Consumers will be able to be more flexible but they will also have to change their lifestyle.”Those consequences are likely to be profound for both consumers and the companies that supply them.First of all, when companies are supplying services rather than tangible goods, the relationship between consumers and the things that they use becomes infinitely more complex. If I have a record album on my shelf, my husband can clearly play it. But when I link our Amazon Echo speaker to my son’s Spotify account, I have no idea whether I am violating one of the thousands of terms and conditions he agreed to with his account. Furthermore, does that act give Amazon the right to send him advertisements based on the songs we play? “Consumers are going to have to deal with the contested nature of assets. They need to figure out their rights,” says Prof Haskel.In many cases, the shift to a sharing economy will also affect the nature of the goods that are being shared. Currently, most cars spend most of the time sitting idle. If drivers stop buying their own cars and instead sign up for a rental service or use Uber’s ride-hailing app, each individual vehicle will receive a lot more use. That means carmakers will face pressure to produce fewer, better-made cars that are able to withstand constant usage. The obvious parallel would be to supplying a laundromat versus a home: commercial machines must be faster, heavier and stronger.Increasing the usage of durable goods such as washing machines, cars and bicycles would clearly be good for the environment and should also benefit consumers by bringing down their overall costs. It would also fundamentally reshape the broader employment market. In the sharing economy, the winners will be companies that can effectively match people and resources, rather than simply those that can sell the most goods. Jobs, meanwhile, will shift away from manufacturing and into tech and services.No wonder carmakers Ford and General Motors have invested in Uber’s US rival Lyft, and Daimler last week snapped up French ride-booking app Chauffeur Privé. If they succeed, I may never inhale that new car odour again.brooke.masters@ft.com
250;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
251;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-22T15:39:54Z;UK equities: Rick role;Investors should do well with Astley’s approach of ‘Never gonna give you up’;In contrast to paeans sung about tech companies and bitcoin, any tune accompanying UK equities would merit a minor key. True, holding the All-Share index and all its dividends in 2017 would have made you a decent investment return of over 12 per cent. Nearly every other big index did better.One year of slack performance can be forgiven. A longer stretch deserves critical attention.Start 30 years ago, when Rick Astley was high in the charts, and the gap is as dire as the singer’s bubblegum pop — 275 percentage points below MSCI’s all-country index. The UK’s All-share has also trailed since the 2008 crisis. Performance really deteriorated when commodity markets rolled over after 2013. Since then, the All-Share has lagged behind by 38 percentage points. A preponderance of energy and mining companies helps explain the slide.Metals and crude prices have pogoed in the past 18 months, yet still the All-share looks decidedly backward. This despite the compounding effect from high yields. According to Datastream, the UK’s yield (now 4 per cent) has exceeded that of the world index over two decades. The yield spread has widened in recent years to almost 1.5 percentage points.The success of US tech stocks skews the data, giving the US domination in the world index. Even so, Germany’s DAX index has managed to outrun the broader benchmark over time, as have emerging markets. And earnings expectations do not fully explain why the UK is at a five-year low on a price to earnings valuation relative to the world index. Based on forward profit estimates, UK earnings should grow twice as quickly over the next few years as the rest of the world.“Never gonna give you up,” Rick sang. That resolve should start to make sense for investors in UK equities next year. Compared with rival investments — and even allowing for Brexit uncertainties — the UK market is cheap.Are UK equities doomed to underperform? Or will 2018 be their year, finally? Please tell us what you think in the comments section below.
252;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-18T00:00:26Z;Disney and Hulu face battle to close the gap with Netflix;Study shows scale of struggle by streaming service to catch up to industry leader ;"Netflix is widening the gap with its Hollywood-backed rival Hulu in the battle for viewers, researchers said, as Walt Disneymoves to take full control of the smaller video streaming service through its 20th Century Fox acquisition.Netflix’s American audience is approaching the size of the entire US pay-TV market, according to a new survey by PwC, while separate research by IHS Markit suggests the maker of Stranger Things and House of Cards is widening its lead over Hulu in paying subscribers. The findings point to the scale of the challenge facing Walt Disney in the fight to win new subscribers. After its planned $66bn takeover of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment businesses it will become Hulu’s majority owner, as US cable subscriptions continue to ebb. Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, said last week on a conference call announcing its bid for Fox that creating direct-to-consumer streaming services is “vital” to its future and his “highest priority”.He said Hulu would be a “more adult-oriented product” than the family-friendly Disney-branded streaming service planned for launch in 2019, when the first phase of its current content licensing deal with Netflix expires. Disney and Fox are currently joint owners of Los Angeles-based Hulu alongside Comcast’s NBC unit. The three each have an equal stake; Time Warner bought 10 per cent of Hulu last year. “Owning roughly a third of it was great, but having control of it will enable us to greatly accelerate Hulu into that [direct-to-consumer] space and become an even more viable competitor to those that are already out there,” Mr Iger said. Market researchers suggest Disney and Hulu have a long way to close the gap with the industry’s leader, Netflix. Analyst group IHS predicts Netflix will increase its US subscribers to 54m by the end of this year, increasing its lead over Hulu from 33m a year ago to 37m. Hulu does not disclose its paid subscriber numbers but IHS’s estimates are higher than others in the industry at 17m. Other studies also point to Netflix’s growing stranglehold on the market for online video. A survey of about 2,000 Americans in October by PwC found that 73 per cent of respondents subscribe to pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, while 73 per cent also subscribe to Netflix. Netflix reported 53m domestic streaming customers at the end of the last quarter, which is still significantly behind IHS’s calculation that total pay-TV homes stand at roughly 95m. The discrepancy between the reported figures and PwC’s survey responses may reflect the extent of password-sharing among Netflix customers. Hulu was launched 10 years ago as Hollywood’s response to the growth of YouTube. In recent years, it has become the traditional media industry’s best hope against Netflix and Amazon, which are investing billions of dollars to produce their own content and reduce their dependence on Hollywood. “Hulu historically has tracked the major strategic worries of its corporate parents,” said Dan Cryan, research director at IHS Markit. “To grow that business going forward, it is going to need a clear point of differentiation. What is not entirely clear is where that comes from.” To grow [Hulu] going forward, it is going to need a clear point of differentiation. What is not entirely clear is where that comes fromHulu has been best known as a way to catch up on broadcast TV shows that viewers missed, Mr Cryan said, but other US media companies such as NBC and CBS are increasingly building their own standalone apps. Mr Iger said he believes Hulu’s differentiation will come from Disney and Fox’s shows, which are being pulled from rival platforms, as well as Hulu’s own original programming, such as its Emmy Award-winning The Handmaid’s Tale. “Hulu has been increasing its investment in original programming and in licensed programming,” Mr Iger said last week. “If we decide to increase our spending on original content at Hulu, we certainly have the intellectual property-creating capabilities far more than we did before this acquisition.”Disney is also planning a standalone streaming service for ESPN, its sports network. PwC’s study found live sports on cable and satellite are still the main reason preventing most consumers from cutting the cord, with 82 per cent of sports fans saying they would end or trim back their pay-TV services if they could watch the game online. However, hopes in the traditional media industry that consumers will replace their cable and satellite subscriptions with an array of streaming services and online channels may be overly optimistic. Most “cord cutters” and “cord nevers” — youngsters who have never signed up for traditional pay-TV — regularly watch just two services. "

Absolutely not” he said. “We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.”
254;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-15T07:29:10Z;BT, Sky reach pact to supply channels on each other’s TV platforms;;BT and Sky have ended a long-running disagreement in the TV market after signing a reciprocal cross-licensing deal for their respective TV channels including sports.The deal means that BT can integrate Sky Sports, Sky Cinema and Sky Atlantic, home to Game of Thrones in the UK, into its TV products and bundles while Sky can sell BT Sport directly to its customer base.BT said the move to integrate Sky’s Now TV brand de-risks its sports strategy and helps it to compete with companies including Netflix by aggregating more content. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, said: “This is the next logical step for our TV and content strategy. Having built up an outstanding portfolio of exclusive sports rights and a loyal base of customers, we feel that now is the right time to broaden the ways in which we distribute BT Sport.”Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of Sky, said: “This is all part of our stated strategy to enhance our customer offering, to broaden our appeal and to open up new revenue streams for our business.”The reciprocal contract comes a day after Disney agreed to buy Fox, including its 39.1 per cent stake in Sky, but two people with direct knowledge of the situation said that talks over the deal preceded news of the merger breaking.The deal also comes ahead of a fresh auction of Premier League rights covering three seasons. The auction, which will put BT and Sky against one another and could see the emergence of companies including Amazon as a bidder according to speculation, kicks off in February.The two companies, arch competitors in the TV market, have been at loggerheads over a wholesale deal since before the launch of BT Sports four years ago. Their respective customer bases have had to buy channels on top of their existing contracts to access the full range of content from each company as a result. Meanwhile Virgin Media, which has agreements with both companies, has been able to sell all the content as part of one package.The deal effectively means that Sky’s entertainment channels will be BT’s entertainment platform. The telecoms company previously had ambitions to develop a competitor to Sky One but has made little headway beyond its AMC channel which has not attracted many viewers.Talks over a deal have previously broken down over price and a disagreement over how the two companies would sell each other’s product.
255;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-14T23:36:07Z;Big Tech and telecoms face sudden fundamental shift;The first major regulatory blow to the power of platform owners has forever changed the landscape, writes Rana Foroohar;The FCC’s decision to overturn “net neutrality” rules, the principles which stipulate that internet service providers must treat all internet traffic the same, has, in a single vote, suddenly and fundamentally changed the landscape for Big Tech and telecoms.This is a big deal, and something that may be remembered as the first major regulatory blow to the power of the largest platform owners, or “FANGs,” meaning Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.There are immediate winners (AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile) as well as losers (such as Netflix, which streams the most bandwidth intensive internet traffic, which will very likely go up in cost, as well as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Hulu). But there are also larger scale implications to the way we think about the regulatory landscape for Big Tech, which has so far been incredibly light.Net neutrality, a term that was coined in the early 2000s by the academic Tim Wu, the author of The Attention Merchants, has come to be understood as shorthand for the idea that everyone — rich and poor, the start-up company and the multinational conglomerate — should be able to use the internet on an equal playing field.Liberals in the US have supported the idea for reasons of social equity. But some conservatives, as well as some members of the business community, have argued that it is a distorting regulation which prevents the ISPs that are laying the fibre for what is essentially the 21st century railroad from properly monetising their investment.Big tech platform owners, which have been the largest single corporate beneficiaries of net neutrality, have up until now worked both sides of this argument to their own advantage. They and other supporters of the principle — including many start-ups who are worried about being winnowed out of their markets if larger players with deeper pockets can pay to have their data delivered to consumers faster — have pushed not only the liberal social argument, but a business argument that more ISP power would squash innovation.Yet as the FANGs take an ever-greater share of corporate wealth, their economic and political power makes the latter argument harder to justify. Some critics argue that the FANGs are a bigger risk to innovation than the telecoms, which are trying to get bigger in large part to compete with the power of the platforms, as evidenced by the recent AT&T bid for Time Warner. Others have said that net neutrality should include things like search neutrality, or app store neutrality, in order not to over-privilege the largest tech players.The possible sectoral and geographical implications of net neutrality roll back are large, and myriad. One big question now is whether ISPs will rush to invest more heavily in broadband infrastructure, which is sorely needed in the US, since they’ll be able to get more money out of heavy FANG users. Or whether the FANGs themselves will look to get into the broadband game in a bigger way.It is also possible that Europe would follow the US policy lead, which would allow European domestic telecom operators — which have suffered greatly in competition with the FANGs — a leg up by charging much higher prices to US platform companies. It might also add to European tax coffers since it would be easier to tax those local players. All of it has the makings of an unofficial trade war, as well as a big shift in the cost structure of the FANG firms.It may also be the beginning of the long predicted ‘Splinternet’, in which the internet becomes much more Balkanised (with China, Europe and the US going in different directions). I’ll be exploring the topic in more depth in my Monday column.The short FANG and long BAT — meaning Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent — trade suddenly looks more interesting.rana.foroohar@ft.com
256;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-14T08:09:14Z;"Opening Quote: Disney-Fox fairytale; ‘Spectacular’ Sports Direct; Ocado";;Thursday December 14 will go down in history as the day that the Walt Disney Company wrote a new chapter in the history of a once feared empire, and settled the destiny of one who was taught to wield mysterious power by a wise and wizened old master. But enough of Star Wars, Luke Skywalker and his mentor Yoda. In other news, Disney is buying the entertainment assets of the 21st Century Fox empire, and deciding the destiny of James Murdoch, who had run the business for his father: legendary media mogul Rupert.At around 12 noon GMT/7am EST/4am PST, the long awaited $60bn deal is due to be premiered in a much-hyped press release and subsequent media call.If the previews are to be believed, the plot will centre around a $29-a-share price for the Fox entertainment assets, implying an $11-12 a share value for Fox’s remaining US TV assets. Under the terms of the all-share deal, this will deliver the Murdochs, who own 39 per cent of Fox, an equity stake in Disney of less than 5 per cent, according to people briefed on the negotiations. They will not be represented on the Disney board, the people said. But it remains unclear whether chosen one James Murdoch, currently Fox’s chief executive, will join Disney following the deal, or strike out on his own.For Sky shareholders, however, much like fans of Luke Skywalker, today’s new episode also provides some long sought-after answers: the Disney acquisition will include Fox’s stake in Sky, and a UK regulatory decision on whether that deal can go ahead should come before US regulators rule on the sale of Fox to Disney.Mr Murdoch Snr’s decision to sell is deemed a landmark in a career that has created a media empire across the globe. But, after decades assembling the component parts of Fox, industry watchers say he has grown tired of the flat returns generated by the film industry – preferring to return to news and sport.Mr Murdoch and his family will continue to control News Corp, owner of the Wall Street Journal, The Sun and The Times newspapers, as well as the remaining assets of Fox, which include a broadcast network, Fox News Channel and sports cable network.But a combined Disney and 21st Century Fox is expected to form a new entertainment empire that shifts the balance of power in Hollywood back towards traditional media from fast-rising internet streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.These two challengers are now likely to find themselves more reliant on a merged Disney-Fox operation for television shows and movies. Together, a combined Disney and Fox would own 19 per cent of the most popular TV shows available on Netflix in the US, making it the second-largest provider of content to the streaming service after CBS, according to YipitData.Might another US empire be seeking a new partnership? Industry gossip recently suggested that Walmart, owner of the Asda supermarket chain in Britain, had shown some interest in the automated grocery-picking technology of Ocado. This morning, however, Ocado focused simply on continued growth in revenue, and its recently announced partnership with the Groupe Casino supermarket empire in France.In the 14 weeks to December 3, it said retail revenue was up 11.6 per cent to £374m, average orders per week were 11.1 per cent higher at 280,000, and average order size was largely flat at £106.That represented a slight slowdown on the 13.1 per cent retail revenue growth reported in September – an issue that the company blamed on a shortage of delivery drivers.Chief executive Tim Steiner said:A shortage of capacity, with the lack of drivers in certain locations being the largest factor, restricted our sales growth… while this driver shortage has now been largely resolved, there was some short term impact on average orders per week over the period.Mr Steiner, whose business delivers own-branded food as well as groceries sold by Waitrose and WM Morrison, made no reference to other potential partners, but did say: “we remain confident in our ability to sign more deals such as [Groupe Casino] in the medium term.”Ocado has been increasing the grocery picking capacity at its state-of-the-art customer fulfilment centre in Andover, and has increased the number of orders processed there by 50 per cent in the space of 14 weeks. It is now working towards opening a fourth fulfilment centre in Erith, South East London, in 2018.And, finally, another master of high street entertainment has been working his magic this morning. Mike Ashley, chief executive of Sports Direct has hailed a “spectacular trading performance”, which appears to have delivered a 67.3 per cent drop in reported half-year profit. He was, in fact, referring to his preferred “underlying” measure of success – which ignores currency stings, exceptional costs and other one-off hits. On that score, profits grew by 23 per cent to £88m. It seems the force is strong with this one…Today’s Lombard column focuses on the differing margins of contractors Serco and Carillion.Serco’s rail passengers know its Caledonian Sleeper service can often be late — if it’s not the points at Crianlarich, it’s the overhead lines at Carlisle, or the sidings at Crewe. Serco’s shareholders, however, can be grateful for its timeliness in embarking on another protracted journey: £1.5bn of contract writedowns and a £550m rights issue back in 2014, en route to restoring 5 per cent margins. As the outsourcer’s chief executive, Rupert Soames, notes: “We were early adopters of financial carnage”.And on Wednesday, Serco showed the advantage of setting off early, while rival Carillion showed what can happen if you reach carnage too late.Read the rest of today’s Lombard column here.FT Opening Quote, with commentary by Matthew Vincent, is your early Square Mile briefing.

257;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-13T13:02:13Z;Disney-Fox combination changes power balance in Hollywood;Streaming services Netflix and Amazon Prime most at risk of new media juggernaut;The creation of a new Hollywood juggernaut combining Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox would change the balance of power between traditional media and internet streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, who would become more reliant on a single company for television shows and movies if the merger is completed.Disney’s acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets, which was announced on Thursday, follows its decision to end its current movie licensing deals with Netflix in 2019 to launch its own “over the top” streaming services.The two media groups are already shareholders alongside Comcast in Hulu, one of the biggest rivals to Netflix and Amazon in TV and movie streaming.Together, a combined Disney and Fox would own 19 per cent of the most popular TV shows available on Netflix in the US, making it the second-largest provider of content to the streaming service after CBS, according to YipitData, which collects and analyses web data for institutional investors.Their joint share would exceed that of Netflix’s own original series, adding greater urgency to the Silicon Valley company’s multibillion-dollar investment in TV and movie commissioning.The streaming company produces or commissions 15 per cent of TV shows ranked in IMDB’s top 500, according to YipitData research, compared with 12 per cent from Fox and 7 per cent from Disney.At Amazon Prime, the ecommerce group’s video service, Fox and Disney combined would make up about 9 per cent of the same sample of 500 top shows.That would leave both companies vulnerable to a strategic shift away from third-party streaming services by the new Hollywood group but Netflix would be at the greater risk, says Michael Sloan, research analyst at YipitData.“If Disney and Fox come together and want to monopolise their own content by moving it all to Hulu, Netflix has a lot more to lose than Amazon Prime,” he says.YipitData analyses terabytes of information scraped from publicly available websites every day. For this study, it looked at TV series that are listed in IMDB’s top 500 shows and are available on Netflix or Amazon, and grouped them by the original TV network that created them.Netflix has already seen the number of Fox shows on its platform fall by half over the last year, from 39 titles in late 2016 to 20 in October 2017, according to YipitData. This included popular shows such as The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which disappeared from its catalogue even as they remain available on Hulu.However, many of the licensing deals that Netflix and Amazon have signed last for several years. Even if a broadcaster decides to pull its content from a streaming platform, its shows could still be available for up to a decade through different licensing “windows” agreed in the original contract.Some in the streaming industry see an opportunity from the potential merger of Fox and Disney, as integration challenges may distract them from competing more effectively with online upstarts. In the meantime, Silicon Valley companies including Apple, Facebook and Google-owned YouTube are all investing heavily in their own content, outside the traditional broadcast model.Netflix has said it hopes to produce at least 50 per cent of its content in-house or to license it directly from the producer by 2020. The strategy to reduce its dependence on providers such as Disney and Fox for its catalogue began in 2013, as it anticipated growing competitive tensions with its partners in the traditional media industry.The relationship between streaming platforms and traditional media groups is complex, with co-productions as well as competition.“The reality with big media companies is that their interests are diverse and become even more complicated in their international interests,” says Dan Cryan, analyst at IHS Markit. “The narrative that it will be a bloodbath is far too simple to describe a relationship which is very multifaceted.”
258;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Business is becoming a battle of the giants;The rise of Amazon, Facebook and Google means antitrust rules need to be rewritten;"The biggest influence on this week’s $69bn deal by CVS Health, the US pharmacy chain, to acquire the insurer Aetna, went unmentioned. The threat of Amazon selling prescription drugs is shaking up the US healthcare industry.The same goes for US entertainment, with Walt Disney holding talks with 21st Century Fox to buy its film studio and cable entertainment channels. Lurking in the background are Amazon and Netflix, which are revolutionising the way people watch films and television.The common theme — one causing consolidation across a swath of industries — is the belief that to compete with internet giants, companies that are losing revenues to them must turn into giants themselves. The oligopoly of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix (and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China) is begetting others.Australia’s competition authority has launched an investigation into the market power of platforms such as Facebook and Google, which the media buying agency GroupM estimates will attract 84 per cent of digital advertising excluding China in 2017. But this is only one aspect of a broader antitrust challenge — the fact that corporate giants are emerging everywhere.Competition enforcers need to find a way to address it coherently. They are struggling not only because the new economy is a revolutionary phenomenon but because it defies the framework of antitrust law. As Richard Posner, the former US federal judge, once wrote: “This problem will be extremely difficult to solve; indeed, I cannot even glimpse the solution.”The framework rests on the idea that the task of antitrust is not to protect small businesses from big ones, but to maximise “consumer welfare” by reinforcing competition. Robert Bork, the judge and legal theorist who pioneered this in 1978, dubbed it “the antitrust paradox” — large enterprises can be good for economic efficiency.We are experiencing the result of Bork’s paradox. Since Penguin and Random House merged in 2013 to gain the heft to negotiate with Amazon over ebook royalties, there has been a stream of mergers prompted by a need to bulk up against internet platforms.CVS-Aetna is an example. The market values of US retail pharmacies such as CVS and Rite Aid have fallen, along with those of other chains, because of the growth of ecommerce. Their margins will be squeezed if Amazon becomes a cheap retailer of prescription drugs.The merger is an attempt to exploit physical presence by transforming the combination’s more than 9,700 stores and clinics into what it winsomely calls “America’s front door to quality healthcare” — centres at which Aetna members can get medical advice.It is also an effort to strike a deal that will be passed by US antitrust authorities, which have blocked horizontal mergers of healthcare companies in the same section of the market. These included Aetna’s $37bn attempt last year to merge with Humana, another health insurer, and the proposed merger of their rivals Anthem and Cigna, which was barred in April.US antitrust law has been friendlier to vertical mergers among companies in different businesses, such as CVS-Aetna, which Bork did not regard as much of a problem. But the US government is becoming more wary: the Department of Justice is attempting to block AT&T’s proposed $85bn takeover of Time Warner. An approval of CVS-Aetna is by no means assured.This makes for a strangely ambivalent approach towards corporate giants. The US is doing little to curb the biggest internet platforms but is taking action against medium-sized companies that aspire to compete with Amazon, Netflix and others at a more equal scale. Bork’s paradox is starting to bite.The school founded by Bork tends to regard new economy oligopoly as a self-correcting problem. Profitable networks are not “particularly secure against competition” because “the more valuable a hoard of buried treasure is, the more rapidly it will be recovered”, Judge Posner wrote. Companies such as Facebook will eventually be displaced, just as MySpace once was.But as time goes by, Amazon grows stronger, and Facebook acquires competitors such as Instagram before they make enough money for antitrust authorities to care, such confidence looks misplaced. Even if it turns out to be true, it simply involves one internet giant being replaced by another — Facebook’s advertising franchise being captured by a Facebook II.The way in which competition law works in the US gives antitrust officials only two choices. They can leave internet oligopolies alone and hamper the efforts of old economy companies to grow bigger too, or can allow an unfettered battle of oligopolies across industries. Neither of these approaches really suits bodies that are supposed to be against business trusts.Governments have another choice — to recognise that technology has hugely changed the terms of business and that antitrust enforcement must evolve in line with it. This implies a fundamental rethink of how the law promotes competition in the internet age. We cannot submit entirely to giants.john.gapper@ft.com"
259;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-12-01T15:36:06Z;Producer Colin Callender: power behind the scenes;The maker of dramas for stage and screen talks about the industry changes he has seen in his 40-year career;Producer Colin Callender hardly fits the image of someone who has made award-winning dramas for screen and stage for almost 40 years. Although he was knighted last year for his services to British film, theatre and television, he plays down his job as “helping the creative environment”.Yet Callender is a hands-on producer involved with every detail from scripts to casting, and his productions have garnered some 140 Emmys and 44 Golden Globes.The television adaptation of Howards End, currently on the BBC, is one of his. So too was Hilary Mantel’s historical drama Wolf Hall, with Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell, and Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser, directed by Richard Eyre and starring Ian McKellen and Anthony Hopkins.Theatre productions include Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which won a record nine Olivier Awards, and Lucky Guy, Nora Ephron’s play about tabloid journalism, with Tom Hanks in a Tony-nominated Broadway debut. Then there are the award-winning movies and mini-series such as Angels in America, starring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, made under his leadership at HBO Films. He worked at HBO for more than 20 years, from 1986 to 2008.For Playground, the company he founded in 2012, he has just wrapped a production for television of King Lear, directed by Eyre and starring Hopkins, whose performance he describes as “sensational”. His production of the television adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women will be aired by the BBC over Christmas. Beyond its star cast — Emily Watson, Angela Lansbury, Michael Gambon — it reflects Callender’s interest in promoting new talent. He chose a little-known director: “Vanessa Caswill had made one major thing before — Thirteen [a kidnap thriller] for BBC3 — and she’s done a hell of a job. I think we’ve discovered a remarkable new director. She’s taken a story we all know and made it fresh.”Nurturing new talent — actors, writers and directors — is all the more important at a time when “the whole industry is changing, with more platforms and more opportunities”, he says. “The question is whether the talent pool keeps up at exactly the same rate.”Softly spoken, he has an endearing shyness. When we meet at London’s Ivy Club, he squirms over personal questions, swiftly redirecting the conversation to productions and the profession. With a little prodding, however, he mentions that he grew up in London, that his father worked in the City and that his parents were avid theatregoers. As a child, he acted with the National Youth Theatre. “I was a hopeless actor,” he recalls. “First spear carrier on the left — and I usually got those lines wrong. I ended up working backstage. I got the bug then.”At the University of East Anglia, he studied philosophy and politics, and directed “a lot of theatre”. But he was never tempted to direct professionally: “I always felt I could hire a better director than I would ever be.”In the early days, no one would work for us at HBO Films. We were doing things other people weren’tHe began his career as a stage manager at London’s Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, working alongside the then “little-known” American writer-director Sam Shepard and British actor Bob Hoskins, before getting a traineeship at Granada Television. After a period in the US, learning how independent production companies worked, he co-founded Primetime Television in 1978, pioneering the pre-selling and co-producing of UK drama with foreign broadcasters.“We would find scripts or commission something and then pre-sell it internationally. We would use these sales connections to raise money and then we would take it to the BBC or ITV. They would make it and we would have distribution rights for the rest of the world. Back then, no one else was doing that.”When Channel 4 was launched in 1982, he used that experience to put together the financing for the broadcaster’s first commissioned production from an independent company. He produced the landmark nine-hour adaptation of the Royal Shakespeare Company’s The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, winning the 1983 Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries.Until then, Callender recalls, everything had been produced in-house by the BBC and ITV: “I acquired the rights to do the television version of Nicholas Nickleby . . . We put together the financing and then went to Channel 4 and said, ‘We’ve got three-quarters of the financing in place, would you come on board as the UK broadcaster?’ They did, and that’s how Nicholas Nickleby happened.”It was under his leadership that HBO Films changed the landscape of television, introducing the idea of producing programming worth paying for, paving the way for companies such as Netflix and Amazon.“Until that point, television was free . . . So we had to create programming that somehow stood head and shoulders above the rest, that would make people want to pay for it,” he says.Recalling his 21 years with the company, he says: “Back in the early days, we couldn’t get anyone to work for us at HBO Films. No one would return our calls. We were outsiders because we were doing things other people weren’t.”HBO Films pioneered the incorporation of feature film talent in television and, through high-quality productions, transformed itself from “insurgents” to “incumbent”, he says.Setting up Playground was inspired partly by the success of Downton Abbey in using digital platforms. It was sold to more than 250 territories and became a global phenomenon. Callender says: “Audiences suddenly hugely exploded. I felt that there was an opportunity for a new production company with a foot in the American and the British markets to produce top-end British drama that could be co-produced.”His King Lear is for BBC television in Britain and Amazon in the US. “If you make an independent movie, there’s no guarantee that anyone’s going to see it. I don’t know what the audiences will be [for Lear], but I’m pretty certain it’ll be more than if it got a limited theatrical release. The most interesting drama is being made for television. The studios have abandoned drama.”He notes too that the televised King Lear and The Dresser have casts “that you would never see on stage”: “Hopkins won’t do theatre . . . Harwood said he’d never seen the female roles [in The Dresser] played so gloriously because normally those roles don’t attract actresses of the stature of Sarah Lancashire and Emily Watson.”In some ways, his career has come full circle, he says. From Nicholas Nickleby — which involved stage actors, a television director and a film crew — he has sought to bring together the best talents from different disciplines. Ultimately, “it all comes down to the script — great story and great writing”, he says.‘Little Women’ begins on BBC1 on December 26Follow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

260;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Moviegoers boost cinema M&A prospects;Rising box office receipts set the scene for takeover speculation;It shows the number of cinema tickets sold in the UK between 1935 and 2016. The peak year was 1946 when there were 1.64bn admissions. That was followed by a gentle decline for 10 years or so, and then admissions went into freefall in the 1960s and 1970s. The industry hit rock bottom in 1984, when only 54m tickets were sold. Since then there’s been a steady recovery, with 168m cinema admissions last year — setting the scene for potential M&A activity in the sector.Growth of TV ownership played a big role — but this was not the only factor. Cinemas suffered from a lack of investment and many were dingy and dirty. Often the films were not that great either. The most popular film in 1971 was the painfully unfunny On the Buses (if you’ve never seen it, count yourself lucky). Then the rise of VHS video recorders delivered a further blow in the early 1980s.The arrival of the multiplex. More screens meant a much wider choice of films could be shown, and cinemagoers could enjoy a more pleasant environment.“Cinemagoing is a habitual thing. So once people get used to going back to the cinema, they go more often,” says Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association.At the same time, the big Hollywood studios started to invest in big-budget blockbusters. As attendances picked up, more small boutique cinemas were opened, while existing smaller cinemas were often modernised.Ticket sales have been pretty much static since the early noughties. Mr Clapp suggests increased competition from other leisure activities, such as bowling, sporting events and eating out has been a constraint on growth.Box office revenues have risen by 4.4 per cent a year since 2002, even though the number of admissions has been broadly static. Over that period, average inflation has been 2.9 per cent. Cinema operators justify the inflation-beating rise in ticket prices by pointing to the level of investment in the quality of cinemas.Food sales are very important because — unlike ticket revenue — the cinemas don’t have to share any of this income with the film distributors and producers. Even so, ticket sales still account for about 70 per cent of operators’ profits, with about 25 per cent coming from food sales and the rest coming from advertising.And it’s not just popcorn. The Vue cinema chain now offers pizzas and pies at many outlets, while Odeon and Cineworld have been rolling out Starbucks and Costa Coffee shops.In some cinemas, traditional seats are being ripped out and replaced with luxurious sofas and soft seating. This reduces capacity, but operators report it improves occupancy. Another development is “4D cinema” where your seat may move or vibrate at certain points during the film. You can’t get that at home.This is the $64,000 question, according to Sahill Shan, an analyst at N1 Singer. On balance, he reckons that cinemas will not suffer too much “as long as the quality of movies remains high.” He points out that about 55 per cent of the film industry’s revenues still comes from the cinema box office — that puts the cinema operators in a strong negotiating position with the studios.At least one of the big streaming companies is trying to work with the cinema industry, rather than against it. “Amazon sees the importance of cinema raising the profile of its titles and is very supportive of cinema releases,” says Ben Luxford, head of audience at BFI.
261;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-30T05:00:36Z;TV channels have ‘up to 10 years’ to meet tech threat;Public service broadcasters face displacement by Netflix and Amazon;The BBC, ITV and other leading public service broadcasters across Europe face an existential challenge over the next five to ten years from US technology giants such as Amazon and Netflix, television executives have warned.With Amazon, Netflix, Google and Apple pouring billions of dollars into original television production and Facebook luring advertisers — and viewers — away from news providers, concerns are growing across Europe that the central role of public service broadcasters, or PSBs, will diminish.“The growth and dominance of these companies is a threat to our entire media ecosystem,” said Noel Curran, director-general of the European Broadcasting Union, which represents PSBs. “Everybody in European media needs to ask: where are we going to be in five to 10 years?”In Britain, programming delivered via broadband and made available on-demand has shaken television’s hierarchy, under which PSBs were the first ports of call on a television’s remote control and were easily regulated.“What we have taken for granted as critical to the health of UK television is coming under serious threat,” said Jonathan Thompson, chief executive of Digital UK, which is owned by the BBC, ITV and Arqiva, the company that owns and operates the national transmitter network.Under UK broadcasting regulations, public service channels must be prominently displayed in the electronic programme guides of cable and satellite providers.But no such regulations exist for programming viewed on-demand: global digital subscription services such as Netflix “with deep pockets and big ambitions . . . are quickly muscling their way into prime position,” Mr Thompson said.The digital subscription services “are seeking to influence the way in which their TV content is discovered by viewers on smart TVs and other devices — potentially at the expense of easy access to UK content.”There are other consequences to the growth of digital services. In the UK, PSBs have quotas to fill on local production and must provide news programming but the new generation of global digital services have no such obligations.In the UK, commercial broadcasters are also regulated by Ofcom, the industry’s media watchdog, over issues such as fairness in news programming and the broadcast of content that might be unsuitable for children at certain hours.In a speech last week Jeremy Darroch, chief executive of Sky, pointed to the disparity in regulation between television networks and online operators.We are facing a significant threat to the amount of homegrown content, made in — and about — the UK“We are regulated because of our impact on society, yet their impact on society today is arguably much greater,” he said. “Yet [the online operators] face none of the scrutiny or regulation that broadcasters meet. It’s a lopsided contest and, left unchecked, represents a real challenge where European champions and national broadcasters, be they public or private, will suffer.”The digital services have built inroads in the UK with Netflix and Amazon combined already amassing more than 10m subscribers to their UK services. They have also invested heavily in UK programming: Netflix paid more than £100m for the critically acclaimed The Crown, while Amazon bought The Grand Tour, the spin-off series featuring Jeremy Clarkson and the other stars of Top Gear.But even with this investment, projections for the total amount spent on UK programming are gloomy over the next decade, according to analysts at research firm Mediatique. It is forecasting a £500m shortfall by 2026 as pay-TV operators and commercial channels reduce spending on programming in line with audience share lost to their online rivals.“We are facing a significant threat to the amount of homegrown content, made in — and about — the UK,” said Tony Hall, the BBC director-general, in a speech this month. He added that investment by the likes of Netflix was “increasingly likely to focus on a narrow range of very expensive, very high-end content — big bankers that they can rely on to have international appeal”.This could have a profound impact on the selection of programming available in the UK, where locally produced content, be it Strictly Come Dancing or Sherlock, regularly attracts the largest audiences. “We have to face the reality that the British content we value, and our audiences love and rely upon, is under serious threat,” Lord Hall said. “Increasingly, it is decisions taken on the west coast of the US that are shaping our TV landscape here.”Unlike commercial PSBs, the BBC has guaranteed income in the form of the licence fee, which generates £3.7bn a year. But it must find annual savings estimated at £800m to absorb inflation in the cost of sports rights and drama productions as well as a commitment to fund free television licences for the over-75s.With digital players breathing down their necks, the budget pressures faced by the BBC and its rivals take on greater significance. “It is open to question whether, in a decade’s time, the UK’s PSBs can retain sufficiently large audiences to attract the advertising revenues required to fund high quality and popular content,” Enders Analysis, the media research firm, wrote in a recent note.New devices and digital services “pay little or scant regard to PSB status,” they added. “Combined with almost infinite content choice, this will undoubtedly lead to PSB content being less accessible, less viewed and hence generating less revenue for the commercial PSBs to invest in new content.”It is unclear what levers broadcasters in the UK and Europe can pull to ward off the incursion by US digital players. In the UK, PSBs are pushing for Ofcom to secure prominent spots for their programming in on-demand services.Freeview, the UK’s free digital television service owned by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Arqiva, is working towards getting its Freeview Play, a live and on-demand service, built into every TV set sold in the UK — which would ensure that viewers have easy access to PSB channels and the programming they produce.Meanwhile, the BBC is moving full series of its programming to its iPlayer service to better compete with the vast content library on offer from Netflix. It is also merging its BBC Studios production arm with BBC Worldwide, the corporation’s commercial division, which sells and distributes its content — a move that aligns it with other leading broadcasters.
262;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-23T18:13:27Z;Net neutrality rules are worth keeping — for now;Competition and technology have not yet made the regulations obsolete;Fairness and equal treatment are not always the same. It is not fair to pay a star worker the same as an incompetent one, for example. But equality always has a nice ring of justice to it, which creates a problem for Ajit Pai, the chairman of the US Federal Communications Committee and a Donald Trump appointee.Mr Pai wants to roll back the “net neutrality” regulations passed by Mr Trump’s predecessor. The rules require that America’s internet service providers — telcos such as AT&T and Verizon, and cable companies such as Comcast and Charter — treat all types of internet traffic the same. “Fast lanes” for favoured companies (or the ISP’s own content) are forbidden, as is throttling back the unfavoured.The arguments for keeping the rules in place are vivid. Very large companies — Google, Netflix, Facebook, and so on — could afford to pay for blazing-fast service from the ISPs. Smaller competitors could not, putting them at a disadvantage and entrenching the vast incumbents even more.The spending power of big tech companies has already given them superior access to the customer. Their computers are linked directly into the ISP’s networks, giving them a huge speed advantage. Many maintain internet cables of their own. Big tech is already driving in a fast lane. Rolling back net neutrality can only increase this advantage.ISPs could also disadvantage products that competed with their own offerings — most obviously video streaming products that compete with the expensive pay TV bundles offered by all the ISPs. Comcast has stated that it would not block or throttle any lawful content if the rules are lifted. But this is meaningless. For the purposes of competition, there is no difference between speeding up one class of content and slowing down another.Only half of American households have more than one ISP to choose from. Most of the rest are served by lazy duopoliesThe FCC recognises this risk, and argues that customers offered a two-speed internet will defect to other ISPs, and that beefed-up antitrust enforcement will prevent the worst offences. These are not strong arguments. Only half of American households have more than one ISP to choose from. Most of the rest are served by lazy duopolies.Superior wireless internet technology may enrich the competitive environment before long. For now, though, consumers are mostly stuck with what their ISP gives them. Better antitrust enforcement would be welcome, but takes too long to protect many fragile tech start-ups.The FCC is however quite right to point out that the equal treatment mandated by net neutrality creates unfairness. Just two companies, Netflix and YouTube, consume half of internet bandwidth. Yet the ISPs are not allowed to make them pay a toll for hogging the road. If they could, they could use the additional revenue on infrastructure improvements.The service provided by the ISPs has made staggering profits possible for big tech. Why should consumers, and not the tech companies themselves, pay the bill for that service? And if the next innovation — think of driverless cars— requires dedicated superfast connections to be useful and safe, it would surely make sense for the companies that will profit from that innovation to pay for the network that supports it.The dilemma is real. The best scenario is that better technology and increased ISP competition makes net neutrality obsolete. Encouraging such competition should be a policy priority. The US is not there yet, though. A weakly regulated ISP oligopoly could make already dominant tech companies invulnerable. The imperfect net neutrality rules should remain in place a little while longer.
263;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-10T18:00:26Z;Media stocks turn higher as shake-up looms;;A busy week for media companies is ending on an upbeat note.Shares of major media companies including Walt Disney, News Corp, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Cable were clocking solid gains on Friday, signalling tentative optimism about how the impending industry shake-up will ultimately play out for some of the industry’s largest players.Walt Disney — the owner of movie studios, theme parks and television channels including ABC and ESPN — was initially hit in after-hours trading on Thursday after reporting quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations. But the losses were reversed on Friday morning, with Disney shares rising 2.5 per cent to $105.28, putting shares on track for their biggest one-day gain since July.For Disney, the gains are less about its present business than its future prospects, as it forges ahead with plans to launch its own streaming-content service to compete with Netflix, as well as its upcoming Star Wars release set for December. It is also planning a new trilogy of films in the Star Wars franchise, which has a large and devoted fan base that spans generations.Disney executives also “left the door open” on reports from earlier in the week that it had held preliminary talks about buying most of the assets of 21st Century Fox, according to UBS analysts. Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has also benefitted from the speculation, and its shares were up 1.4 per cent on Friday to $29.12 — bringing its week-to-date gains to 16.7 per cent, its best weekly jump since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data.Another Rupert Murdoch company, News Corp, was also having a good day on Friday, with shares up 7.7 per cent following a solid quarterly earnings report on Thursday evening. That puts the Wall Street Journal publisher on track for its best one-day gain since 2014.Meanwhile, Time Warner was up 4.45 per cent, on track for its best day since October 2016, according to Thomson Reuters. The media company has been at the centre of a whirlwind week in which the Financial Times reported that US antitrust officials were seeking the sale of its cable news channel, CNN, to receive approval for its $84.5bn deal with AT&T.
264;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-10T16:57:19Z;Japan: ganbare!;Despite a stellar run, Tokyo stocks still have room to rise;Technology stocks in the US have taken over the world. The total market value of the Faangs — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (Alphabet) — exceeds 70 per cent of all of Tokyo’s first section. Even as Japan’s Topix index touches highs not seen in more than a quarter century, Japan’s share of global benchmarks shrinks. It deserves more space in investors’ portfolios.The country has plenty of its own technology companies. Most of them actually make stuff, rather than dominating the intangible world of cyber space. That Japan does not have its own Faangs is partly down to the infancy of its bull run. It is also, smirks Pelham Smithers Associates, because tech goliaths such as Keyence, Tokyo Electron and Fanuc all start with consonants. Technology accounts for about 13 per cent of Japan’s market, high for almost any country bar the US, which has nearly double that proportion.Japan’s heavy weighting to manufacturing cyclicals, such as Toyota and Hitachi, helps explain why the market looks cheap relative to the US. Such asset-heavy groups will never deliver the kind of returns on invested capital seen in the US, where ROIC is roughly double Japanese levels. But share prices reflect that. Even after surging a third in the past year, Japan trades at 14 times forward earnings — more than a fifth lower than the US.That rating could rise further, and not just because of the exchange rate. A stable Japanese government and better governance embedded into Japanese corporate law will continue to pay dividends for patient bulls.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

Tuesday brought the third successive earnings report to miss Wall Street’s estimate since its March initial public offering, sending its stock plunging to below $13.Wednesday morning then saw a slight reprieve. Snap’s quarterly regulatory filing revealed that Tencent, the Chinese internet group behind WeChat, had quietly built a 12 per cent stake in the Los Angeles-based company, worth more than $2bn.Both the reaction to Monday’s outage and Tencent’s investment show that, despite a loss of faith on Wall Street that has sunk its shares almost 25 per cent below its $17 IPO price, there are still believers in Snap’s story.“A world without Snapchat is not a world I want to live in,” tweeted @alisdirections when the service was offline. But even though American teenagers continue to adore Snapchat, opening the app as many as 25 times a day, according to the company, much of the rest of the world remains befuddled or indifferent.Evan Spiegel, the Los Angeles-based company’s co-founder and chief executive, acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Snapchat, which added just 4.5m new daily active users in the past three months, was attracting new users at a “lower rate than we would have liked” and that the app could be “difficult to understand or hard to use” for many people.Read the full story here.AT&T has been told by the US Department of Justice that it needs to sell CNN, Time Warner’s cable news channel, to get its $84.5bn acquisition of the media company approved, according to three people with direct knowledge of the negotiations. The FT has the scoop here. Uber has added Los Angeles to the list of cities where it will test its aerial taxi service in coming years. The air transport service, which is also being piloted in Dallas and Dubai, is seen as a possible antidote for urban gridlock. Aliya Ram has the story here. The FT's special report on cyber security look at why companies bring in cyber bounty hunters; the growing cost of cyber attacks; and what makes the iPhone so safe. See the full report here. Facebook has asked users to upload naked photos of themselves as part of a pilot to fight ""revenge porn"", which refers to the posting of sexual photos without the subjects' consent. The Guardian has the story here.Jack Dorsey's payments company, Square, reported earnings that were better than expected on Wednesday. The payments unit has seen its share price surge in value this year.Silicon Valley is innovative in many ways but, when it comes to Hollywood, tech companies are being pretty conservative, writes Tim Bradshaw. Apple, Facebook, YouTube and others are planning to spend billions in the hope of emulating the success of Netflix and Amazon on commissioning new content for online streaming. Most of them are looking to recreate traditional 30- or 60-minute shows in familiar genres. The pinnacle of their ambitions, it seems, is to produce a hit on the scale of HBO’s Game of Thrones. For a different approach to mobile TV, take a look at HQ — a quiz show app that is a mix of Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Snapchat, Candy Crush Saga and Facebook Live. HQ combines some of the winning formulas of traditional TV quiz shows — an energetic presenter and “appointment-to-view” programming at the same time every day — with the fast-paced interactivity of a video game. Every viewer becomes a contestant, competing for a cash prize. And it is free to enter.Read Tim’s review here. "
266;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-09T05:02:05Z;Wanted: crime, history and science experts for TV side-hustle;Drama producers seek advice for accuracy — professionals can help;"Students have one important question for Hannah Greig, a historian who specialises in early modern Britain: has she met actors Aidan Turner or Kit Harington?This query is not completely offbeat. Ms Greig, a senior lecturer at York university, has acted as a historical consultant to the hit television series Poldark, starring Mr Turner and broadcast by the BBC and Amazon. She also worked on the BBC’s Gunpowder, which tells the story of the 17th century plot to blow up parliament in London and kill the king, and which features Game of Thrones star Mr Harington as Robert Catesby, the plot’s gentleman mastermind.Ms Greig says such expertise is increasingly in demand. “Production values have changed. We now expect cinema quality on television.”The proliferation of streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix has boosted commissions for television shows. Netflix announced that next year it will have a $7bn-$8bn budget for original content. Apple has hired Jay Hunt, a former controller of BBC One and chief creative officer of Channel 4, to be its creative director in Europe. The company has a $1bn budget for original series next year. The increased number of TV shows means that competition for viewers has become fiercer and production values slicker.In response, television and filmmakers require specialist expertise to make sets and storylines as authentic as possible. For Gunpowder, Ms Greig together with John Cooper, another early modern specialist, would suggest details for interiors, such as the kind of paintings that might hang on walls, the words a crowd might shout, the view from a 17th century window.Police and forensic experts help creators of crime dramas. Scientists are asked for advice on superhero films as well as animated feature films. Adam Summers, a marine biologist whose focus is fish movement, consulted on the animated films Finding Nemo and Finding Dory. (He has been described as Pixar’s “fabulous fish guy”).The US National Academy of Sciences runs a Science and Entertainment Exchange programme, which matches scientific advisers to filmmakers.David Kirby, senior lecturer in science communication studies at Manchester university, says: “Audiences are very sophisticated and have a greater expectation about what should be in a show. The internet pokes holes in things.” He points to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson’s tweets that picked apart Gravity, a film about two astronauts stranded in space: “Mysteries of #Gravity: Why [Sandra] Bullock’s hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.”Alex Perry, a former foreign correspondent for Time, has worked with television dramas on a variety of topics, including the mafia. He has been impressed with screenwriters’ appetite for detailed storytelling. “We’re in a weird situation where drama is as real as possible. Whereas journalism is unanchored in reality [with the proliferation] of fake news.”Scientists have long complained about inaccuracies in films and television series. So when Donna Nelson, professor of organic chemistry at the University of Oklahoma, read that Vince Gilligan, director of the TV series Breaking Bad, was seeking constructive remarks from a chemically inclined audience, she got in touch.Professor Nelson became the go-to chemist for the hit AMC series, which chronicled the transformation of a high-school chemistry teacher with inoperable lung cancer into a drugs manufacturer and big-time dealer. At first, scriptwriters questioned Prof Nelson about what type of people are scientists, and how they act. “Some of these things I had never thought of,” she says. “We have similarities — we are normally mathematically inclined, we like to solve problems. We enjoy and are capable of working independently.” But she felt compelled to point out that scientists, like lawyers and hairdressers, have many kinds of personalities.Scriptwriters worked with drug enforcement agents on meth-making methods. Prof Nelson is keen to point out that she knows nothing about it, and ignores students’ queries about synthesising cocaine. “DEA agents had seen these things. I had always avoided any discussion of anything illegal in my classes. I always wanted to be a good role model.”Initially she received some criticism from her scientific peers because it looked like she was glamorising drugs. “They told me they were ashamed of me . . . I had brought shame on the profession.” But as the series progressed and became darker, criticism faded.With an episodic series like Breaking Bad, there was nervousness about letting Prof Nelson see advance scripts. “I was given pages on a need-to-know basis. Eventually they got to know they could trust I wouldn’t sell it on eBay.”She was conscious of coming across as a killjoy. “I bore in mind that this was drama; the writers know how to make this appeal to a TV audience, and I had to respect their expertise.” She learnt to read the script for cadence and alliteration, and make suggestions that might fit with the dialogue rather than deadening it with facts. In turn, that helped improve her own writing.Mr Kirby believes that a good consultant is “someone willing to understand that when you walk out on a TV set, the director is an expert on something too. The [adviser] shouldn’t prioritise their expertise over someone else’s expertise.”Paula Frew, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, who has advised on the CBS series Madam Secretary, has been asked for advice on infectious disease scenarios, including HIV. “You have to understand that you can’t micromanage the process and control the outcome. You offer credible information, source material when needed or appropriate so you can back up your claims, as well as give the writers the latitude to research a topic and enhance their knowledge around a storyline.” It is important, Ms Frew says, to remain somewhat detached from the final product.And, as Ms Greig points out, you do not have the benefit of footnotes in TV.Many academics give their services for free, seeing this as part of their public communications remit. For this reason, Hannah Greig advises her York university students not to see historical consultancy as a full-time career. “It’s not very often that your era comes around. There might be one 18th-century drama every three years. Period dramas go in waves of fashion.”Greg Jenner describes himself as a public historian and has not completed his PhD. However, he has pieced together a portfolio of work, including historical consultancy to the children’s show, Horrible Histories, where he is responsible for the factual accuracy of sketches and songs. While it is not particularly lucrative work, he says, “it’s important and fun”.It feels like an “exciting time”, he says. “Historians are doing more public history and being slightly less stuck in the ivory tower. A lot of younger academics are really pleased [to] engage with pop culture. This is not dumbing down; it’s informing the next generation of historians and informing the public.”"

The equally-weighted basket is up 58 per cent in the year to date, compared to a 16 per cent gain for the S&P 500 stock index.It is the latest instance of a derivatives market trying to cash in on excitement happening outside its gates. Last week CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange operator, said it planned to offer bitcoin futures as prices for the cryptocurrency soar.ICE will next year lose the right to list futures on the Russell 2000 small-stock index as they migrate to CME. The Russell index family is owned by London Stock Exchange Group, an ICE competitor. The FANG+ index is controlled by ICE.Trabue Bland, president of ICE Futures US, said his company invented NYSE FANG+ in response to customer demand. Futures volume had topped 40 contracts at midday in New York.“We were out talking to customers about equity indexes, and this was the product that came back the most. It was the stocks that people were most excited about, and most excited about trading in one basket,” Mr Bland said.In addition to the four stocks captured by the Fang acronym, the equally weighted ICE index includes Apple, Alibaba, Baidu, Nvidia, Tesla and Twitter. The total market value of the 10 stocks is $3.5tn.Nicholas Colas of DataTrek, a research company, said it was unclear what question the product was supposed to answer or who the main users of the product would be, and called the US-listed stocks in the index “remarkably geo-centric”.He was amused by the “trade the top of tech” announcement. “Is it really the top of tech, like 1999?” he asked.Equity investors can already trade the stocks individually or gain similar exposure through exchange traded funds, baskets of securities that trade as a single name on a stock exchange. Last summer an ETF launched with the ticker “FNG” holding many of the same names.In contrast to ETFs or cash equities, trading futures only requires traders to post margin against their positions, tying up less capital. ICE described its products as a “hedging mechanism to quickly increase or decrease tech exposure in equities portfolios”.

269;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-03T16:47:06Z;The Centre Will Not Hold, Netflix — gripping but fragmented Joan Didion documentary;Griffin Dunne’s film excels at giving a sense of the writer’s careful, reserved personality;Actor and director Griffin Dunne interviews his now very aged aunt Joan Didion extensively for The Centre Will Not Hold (Netflix), a fragmented but gripping documentary about her life and writings. The title comes from WB Yeats’s foreboding poem “The Second Coming”, which also gave Didion the title of her book of caustic essays, Slouching Towards Bethlehem.Dunne’s film excels at giving a sense of Didion’s careful, reserved personality. Slouching was born of her feeling out of joint with the hedonistic 1960s, as though everything she thought she knew was melting into uncertainty. There’s marvellous archive footage of her early years as a journalist and classy commentator on America, writing cerebral pieces for a perhaps somewhat surprised US Vogue readership. Didion married the writer John Gregory Dunne and moved to California, where she cut a chic, Jackie O-style figure in huge sunglasses with ever-present cigarette, turning out intricately wrought novels and journalism.Dunne’s approach to the story is rather oblique. Didion’s coverage of the Manson Family trial needs no editorial gloss, but details of the Central Park jogger case are less well-known. Family holiday photos are especially poignant when they feature Griffin’s sister Dominique, who was murdered at 22. Didion and her husband adopted a daughter, Quintana, and the mood of the film, always sombre, plummets further with the circumstances surrounding Didion’s most famous book, The Year of Magical Thinking, a memoir about grief and bereavement. There are hints that the Didion-Dunne marriage was uneasy, and a stray reference to Quintana’s problems with alcohol, but Griffin tempers intimate family access with reticence. While occasionally frustrating, this seems appropriate: Didion herself faces triumph and despair alike with a resolute and unblinking fortitude.★★★★☆Follow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

The claims caused Netflix to suspend filming of the sixth series of House of Cards in which Mr Spacey has a starring role.In a statement ING said: “In view of the commotion caused by allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding Kevin Spacey, ING has decided it is no longer desirable to have him speak at the BusinessBoost Live event.”The bank, which is the largest in the Netherlands, said Mr Spacey’s presence “could distract from the aim” of the event later this month and made the decision to cancel his appearance in consultation with the actor’s management.Mr Spacey was accused of making sexual advances towards the actor Anthony Rapp at a party in 1986, when Mr Rapp was 14. Mr Spacey said he did not remember the incident but apologised to Mr Rapp, saying he was “beyond horrified to hear his story”.This week Mr Stacey was dropped by the talent agency CAA and his publicist Staci Wolfe, who released a statement on the actor’s behalf saying he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment”.He is the latest public figure to be caught up in escalating public outrage over sexual harassment and assault in the wake of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the powerful movie producer accused by more than 50 women of serial abuse.The Weinstein scandal has sparked a reckoning across industries and countries over the behaviour of powerful men and the persistence of sexual misconduct in workplaces and the broader culture.It has been followed by the firing or resignation of several prominent men accused of bad behaviour, including Amazon Studios head Roy Price, political journalist Mark Halperin and literary editor Leon Wieseltier.Image source: AP
271;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-11-02T20:35:53Z;CBS sales boosted by growth in affiliate, subscription fees;;CBS reported higher third-quarter revenue and net income thanks to growth in affiliate and subscription fees, which offset drops in advertising and content licensing revenue.Net income rose 23 per cent to $592, or $1.46 a share, from $478, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. That included a non-cash gain of $100m related to CBS Radio, which the company is selling. Adjusted earnings of $1.11 came in ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.07.Revenue rose 3 per cent to $3.17, below Wall Street’s forecast of $3.26bn.Advertising revenue dropped 5 per cent to $1.11bn from the third quarter of 2016, due to lower spending on political ads and one fewer National Football League game. Content licensing and distribution revenue fell 22 per cent to $860m, mostly due to the timing of domestic TV licensing sales.Affiliate and subscription fees jumped 52 per cent to $1.15bn, boosted by the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing match on Showtime and growth in CBS’s streaming video services.The company’s Simon & Schuster publishing imprint got a 1 per cent boost in revenue to $228m thanks to bestsellers including Hillary Clinton’s What Happened.Investors have been waiting to see the impact of lower television ratings, particularly for American football, on media companies.NFL ratings are down across networks this season, which some executives have blamed on too many games being made available on television, digital platforms and social media. Broadcast television is seeing broader viewing declines amid growing competition from online rivals including Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and YouTube.Through week seven (ending October 23) of the league’s season, NFL ratings are down 5 per cent from a year ago, while primetime broadcast viewing is down 8 per cent, according to Nielsen.Image via AP

Including foreign exchange effects, the increase was 1.8 per cent.Revenue on a constant currency basis was up 0.3 per cent to €5.76bn, below analysts’ estimates of €5.85bn. Including the impact of the weaker dollar, revenue fell 1.8 per cent.The group’s adjusted ebidta margin rose 1.5 percentage points from 2016 to 41 per cent, led by the US with expansion of 6.1 percentage points to 44.9 per cent. The margin in France dropped 0.7 percentage points to 36.6 per cent.Performance continued to diverge between Europe and the US. At SFR, the second-largest telecoms operator in France, adjusted earnings fell 3.2 per cent to €1bn and revenue was down 1.3 per cent to €2.76bn. SFR added a net 16,000 mobile subscribers in the quarter.In Portugal, adjusted earnings were down 1.3 per cent to €265m on a 3.1 per cent drop in revenue to €566m.Altice USA adjusted earnings surged 18.9 per cent to $1.04bn, or €885m, as revenue rose 3.2 per cent to $2.33bn, or €1.97bn.US pay-television operators are being squeezed by the growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter have all reported subscriber losses in the third quarter. Altice USA shed a net 33,000 pay-TV subscribers, but that was fewer than the 40,000 it lost a year ago. It added 16,000 broadband customers.The company said it will begin rolling out a new “home entertainment hub” in the US next week, replacing traditional cable boxes, modems and routers with a cloud-based service that combines its video, broadband and phone offerings.
273;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-31T21:00:54Z;Spacey allegations cast doubt on final ‘House of Cards’ season;Claims of sexual misconduct against star of series create uncertainty for Netflix;The future of the final season of House of Cards, the first streaming hit of Netflix, is in jeopardy following allegations of sexual misconduct by its star, Kevin Spacey, as the scandal over harassment and assault in Hollywood widens.The video company suspended filming of the show’s sixth season on Tuesday, two days after BuzzFeed reported accusations against Mr Spacey, who plays the political drama’s anti-hero protagonist, Frank Underwood.Netflix is the latest company to be caught up in escalating public outrage over sexual harassment and assault in the wake of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the powerful movie producer accused of serial abuse by more than 50 women.The Weinstein scandal has sparked a reckoning across industries and countries over the behaviour of powerful men and the persistence of sexual misconduct in workplaces and the broader culture. It has been followed by the firing or resignation of several prominent men accused of bad behaviour, including Amazon Studios head Roy Price, political journalist Mark Halperin and literary editor Leon Wieseltier.Mr Spacey was accused of making sexual advances towards the actor Anthony Rapp at a party in 1986, when Mr Rapp was 14. Mr Spacey said he did not remember the incident but apologised to Mr Rapp, saying he was “beyond horrified to hear his story”.In a statement Mr Rapp said he had been emboldened by the accusations against Mr Weinstein. “I came forward with my story, standing on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out, to shine a light and hopefully make a difference, as they have done for me,” he said.In a joint statement with Media Rights Capital, the producer of House of Cards, Netflix said it had decided to suspend production “until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew”.The suspension came a day after Netflix said the sixth season, which is due to air in 2018, would be the last. The decision to end the show was made before the allegations became public, according to a Netflix spokesperson.On Monday, Netflix and MRC said they had sent executives to the shoot in Baltimore “to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported”. Mr Spacey was not currently working on set, the company said.Netflix is now facing questions over whether and when it will resume production, and how it will promote the final season given the serious claims against its most visible figure. The Hollywood trade magazine Variety reported that Netflix and MRC are exploring potential spin-offs focusing on other characters.The uncertainty may cast a shadow over the legacy of House of Cards. The show, an adaptation of the 1990 BBC drama of the same name, was Netflix’s first investment in original programming and the cornerstone of its transformation from mail-order DVD business to a streaming video powerhouse that is disrupting Hollywood.At the time its first season debuted in 2013, House of Cards was the most expensive original internet video series ever produced. Netflix outbid cable television stalwarts including HBO for the programme, paying a reported $100m for the first two 13-season episodes.Its success has served as a template for the company’s ballooning investment in content in recent years: today, Netflix spends upwards of $6bn a year on original programmes. And while it does not own worldwide rights to House of Cards — Sony Pictures Television controls global distribution — Netflix has snapped up global deals for more recent hits including The Crown and Stranger Things, as it has taken its service around the world.As Netflix weighed its options, others in the entertainment industry distanced themselves from Mr Spacey. The International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said it would not give the Oscar and Tony winner its founders award at its upcoming International Emmy Awards ceremony.London’s Old Vic Theatre, where the actor served as artistic director from 2004 to 2015, called for people to contact it confidentially with any complaints against Mr Spacey and said it had retained external advisers to deal with any information received.“We are deeply dismayed to hear the allegations levied against Kevin Spacey,” the theatre said. “Inappropriate behaviour by anyone working at The Old Vic is completely unacceptable.”
274;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-31T18:12:18Z;Netflix suspends production of ‘House of Cards’ amid Kevin Spacey controversy;;Netflix has suspended filming of the sixth and final season of its hit drama House of Cards as the fallout from sexual misconduct claims against Kevin Spacey, the show’s leading man, widens.The streaming video company and Media Rights Capital, the programme’s producer, issued a joint statement on Tuesday saying: “MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.”The suspension comes a day after Netflix said the sixth season, which is due to air in 2018, will be the series’ last. House of Cards was Netflix’s first investment in original programming and its success has served as a template for the company’s ballooning investment in content over the last six years.Mr Spacey has been accused of making sexual advances towards the actor Anthony Rapp at a party in 1986, when Mr Rapp was 14.

Mr Weinstein has denied non-consensual sexual contact. The growing scandal has shined a light on the persistence of the entertainment industry’s “casting couch” culture and the routine harassment women and many men face in the workplace.Image via Reuters
275;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
276;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-30T20:59:07Z;Netflix folds House of Cards;;Netflix is ending House of Cards, the drama that put the streaming service on the map, after its upcoming sixth season.The show and its star, Kevin Spacey, were drawn this week into the uproar over sexual harassment and assault that is roiling Hollywood in the wake of allegations against the producer Harvey Weinstein. On Sunday, the actor Anthony Rapp alleged Mr Spacey had made sexual advances at him at a party in 1986, when Mr Rapp was 14. Mr Spacey said he did not remember the incident but apologised to Mr Rapp.The decision to end the show was made before the allegations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sixth season is being shot at the moment in Baltimore and will air in 2018.In a joint statement with Media Rights Capital, the production studio behind House of Cards, Netflix said it was “deeply troubled” by the claims against Mr Spacey.“In response to last night’s revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time,” the companies said.In the weeks since scores of women accused Mr Weinstein of serial sexual harassment and assault (he denies non-consensual sex), public accusations have been made about multiple men in the entertainment and media industries.House of Cards, an adaptation of the BBC miniseries, was Netflix’s first foray into original programming and the first big hit for the company as it transformed its business from sending DVDs through the mail to streaming video over the internet. The company now spends $6bn a year on original content.
277;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-26T11:02:41Z;Comcast posts profit beat as internet growth trumps cordcutters;;Comcast reported earnings ahead of analysts’ forecasts despite posting lower than expected revenue in its third quarter, as growth in its broadband business offset declines in pay-television subscriptions.Shares rose 1.8 per cent in pre-market trading.Net income at the largest US cable group, which owns the NBC TV networks and the Universal Pictures film studio, rose 18.5 per cent to $2.65bn, or 55 cents a share, in the third quarter, from $2.24bn, or 46 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of 49 cents, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Revenue fell 1.6 per cent to $20.98bn, but excluding the impact of the 2016 Olympics, which lifted results in the third quarter of last year, revenue rose 5.8 per cent. Wall Street had expected revenue of $21.05bn.In Comcast’s biggest business, cable and internet, revenue rose 5.1 per cent to $13.2bn and adjusted earnings grew 5.2 per cent to $5.24bn.The company gained a net 115,000 customers across all its products, compared with 217,000 in the same period a year ago. It said the impact of tropical storms and hurricanes that hit the southern US in the quarter had depressed subscriber additions by 35,000.Comcast lost 125,000 video subscribers, compared with 32,000 added in the same quarter a year ago. However, that decline was less steep than the 150,000 executives had warned might drop their cable television packages. Higher pricing boosted video revenues 4.2 per cent to $5.83bn.The growing popularity of online video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are weighing on traditional pay-TV operators, leading to declines at companies such as AT&T and Verizon. Comcast now counts more internet subscribers than video customers, however, which executives say positions it to weather increased cord-cutting.The company added 214,000 broadband subscribers, down from 330,000 last year, with revenue up 8.9 per cent to $3.71bn. Business services also contributed to revenue growth, up 12.6 per cent to $1.58bn.At NBCUniversal, revenue dropped 12.7 per cent to $8bn from the third quarter of 2016, which included the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue rose 6 per cent. Adjusted earnings rose 6 per cent, or 20 per cent excluding the Olympics, to $2.27bn.Revenues at NBC’s cable networks fell 11.5 per cent, but rose 3.7 per cent excluding the Olympics, to $2.6bn. Broadcast revenues dropped 31 per cent, but rose 12.3 per cent excluding the Olympics, to $2.1bn. Advertising sales sank 45.6 per cent in broadcast to $1.24bn and 16.5 per cent in cable to $787m.At Universal, filmed entertainment revenue fell 0.5 per cent to $1.78bn.Image via Reuters
278;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;AT&T falls after sales drop more than expected;;AT&T reported third quarter sales that missed expectations on Tuesday as a series of natural disasters in the US and Mexico hurt its results.For the three months to end of September, revenue fell 2.9 per cent to $39.7bn amid continued decline in its traditional landline business while hurricanes and the US and earthquakes in Mexico damaged network infrastructures and disrupted services.Analysts had expected revenue of $40.1bn. Although AT&T reiterated its full-year guidance, shares in the group fell 1.3 per cent in after market trading.Net income was 9 per cent lower at $3bn, or 49 cents a share, during the quarter compared to the prior year period. Stripping out one off items, adjusted earnings per diluted share was 74 cents, in line with consensus estimates and the same as in the year-ago quarter.The rise of online video services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon are weighing on traditional pay-television operators. AT&T warned earlier this month that it lost 390,000 video subscribers in the quarter, reviving investors’ fears over the health of the pay-TV market. That was somewhat offset by 300,000 new subscribers to its less expensive DirecTV Now streaming service.The company’s announcement sparked a sell-off in its shares and those of competitors including Comcast, Charter, Dish and Altice USA. Comcast, which reports earnings on Thursday, has said it could lose 150,000 subscribers this quarter.AT&T is seeking to offset the pressures on its legacy video and wireless businesses with an $85bn bid to buy Time Warner, the owner of HBO and the Warner Bros film studio – a move that will turn AT&T into a media and entertainment juggernaut.AT&T said on Monday it had extended the deadline to close the deal “for a short period of time” to get final regulatory approval from the US Department of Justice. The deal, announced a year ago, originally had a termination date of October 22. Last week, the transaction was approved by Brazil’s antitrust authority.
279;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-24T19:44:03Z;Fox veteran Randy Freer takes chief’s role at Hulu;Mike Hopkins leaves to run Sony Pictures TV as companies face Hollywood competition;Streaming video service Hulu is making changes at the top as it faces intense competition in Hollywood from Netflix and other Silicon Valley tech companies.Mike Hopkins, its chief executive of four years, is leaving to run Sony Pictures TV. He is replaced by Fox veteran and Hulu board member Randy Freer.Both Hulu and Sony are jostling for talent and profile in Hollywood with the likes of Netflix, Apple and Amazon. Hulu has said it will spend about $2.5bn on content this year, twice as much as Apple but under half of Netflix’s $6bn budget.Mr Freer is leaving his role as president and chief executive of Fox Networks Group to take up the Hulu CEO post. Fox is one of Hulu’s largest shareholders, alongside Walt Disney and Comcast’s NBCUniversal. With 47m monthly viewers, Hulu is riding high on its Emmy-winning original series, The Handmaid’s Tale. In May, it expanded with a new $40-a-month live TV bundle targeting cord cutters. Sony’s PlayStation Vue, SlingTV and YouTube are all offering similar live streaming services, in an effort to supplant traditional cable bundles, though none has yet gained significant scale. “Hulu is at the centre of transformation in entertainment,” Mr Freer said in a statement. “Hulu’s management team and employees have positioned Hulu to be a leader in defining the future of content creation, distribution and monetisation — all while putting the viewer first.” At Fox, Mr Freer was responsible for revenue, distribution and strategy, including handling its sports rights negotiations. Live sports and news broadcasting will be key to Hulu’s differentiation from its main rival Netflix. The two pioneering streaming services are fighting for attention from both audiences and Hollywood showrunners, as a growing number of tech companies pile into “over the top” video. I’ve known Mike for years and can think of no better person to lead our television businesses during a time of such extraordinary evolution and opportunityMr Freer is Hulu’s third chief executive since it was created by a consortium of traditional media companies in 2008. Time Warner took a stake in Hulu last year in a deal valuing the company at almost $6bn. Mr Hopkins took over from Hulu’s founding chief Jason Kilar in 2013. As part of a reorganisation at Sony Pictures Television, Mr Hopkins will lead its TV production, distribution and marketing operations globally, reporting to Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman and chief executive, Tony Vinciquerra. “I’ve known Mike for years and can think of no better person to lead our television businesses during a time of such extraordinary evolution and opportunity,” said Mr Vinciquerra, who succeeded Michael Lynton at the top of Sony’s movie studio and TV production business in May. In June, Apple poached two of Sony TV’s top executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to run its new original content team in Los Angeles. Apple is joining YouTube, Amazon and Facebook in a headlong rush by Silicon Valley into TV and movie commissioning, increasing prices and competition for the likes of Hulu and Netflix. Amazon Studios has seen a wave of staff departures after its head Roy Price resigned last week amid allegations of sexual harassment.
280;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-23T22:31:53Z;Netflix to finance new shows from $1.6bn bond sale;Deal lands in market judged by some investors to be frothy;Netflix borrowed $1.6bn on Monday to fund its investment in original movies and television shows as bankers wrapped up the company’s biggest bond sale.The deal, following stronger than expected subscriber growth in the third quarter, will help finance a growing $7bn to $8bn budget for original content next year as the streamed entertainment provider behind shows such as Stranger Things and House of Cards expands its movie and TV line-up.The new 10.5 year bonds, which mature in 2028, priced with a yield of 4.785 per cent, according to two investors following the sale.That was in line with prices marketed to investors earlier in the day and slightly above the company’s existing dollar-denominated debt that matures in 2026, which changed hands on Monday with a yield of 4.4 per cent. Two investors said bankers had marketed order books for the $1.6bn transaction reaching about $2.5bn.“The timing is perfect,” said Rahim Shad, a senior analyst with Invesco. “They are coming off of very strong numbers. The market is completely open. It is a great deal for the company and equity investors if they can tap the bond market at these levels but as a creditor you always think about the underlying risk.”The deal lands in a market that several well-known investors have judged to be frothy, as benchmark stock indices hit new records and risk premiums on low quality debt approach levels rarely seen since the financial crisis.“We have been concerned about valuations for a while,” Mr Shad added. “Valuation is just one common concern that you’ll hear no matter where you go these days.”Valuation is just one common concern that you’ll hear no matter where you go these daysCompanies have raised more than $1.4tn in the US so far this year, a record pace, according to Dealogic.But the heady headline figure, boosted by large banks raising capital, belies the lacklustre new issuance in the junk bond market, where companies have raised $215bn in 2017. That is the second-slowest figure since 2011.While flows into high-yield funds have been volatile, investors have shown a strong preference for fixed-income assets this year. US bond funds have counted $182bn of inflows this year, according to EPFR.Kapil Singh, a portfolio manager with DoubleLine Capital, added that with redemptions and upgrades of high-yield bonds out of so-called speculative territory, the market for junk debt has shrunk.“We are underweight high yield for various reasons, valuations being the main one,” Mr Singh said. “As a firm [our] belief is rates are rising. Risk assets could potentially get more volatile.”Although Netflix’s stock has rallied more than 50 per cent this year, its B1 rating from Moody’s and B-plus opinion from S&P Global put it squarely in junk territory.Neil Begley, an analyst with Moody’s, warned that measures of Netflix’s indebtedness would continue to rise this year before falling by the end of 2018.Mr Begley said that he expected earnings growth to outpace the company’s rising debt levels next year as Netflix begins to profit from its expansion outside of the US.S&P analyst Jawad Hussain, by contrast, said his assessment of the risks of Netflix’s business had “improved due to its strong subscriber growth”.But he cautioned that the “company’s comfort with growing negative free cash flow from its large original content investments” weighed on its rating.If subscriber growth slowed or margin improvement stagnated, it would imply that the company’s spending on programming was “outpacing its ability to grow its subscriber base, which could hamper its access to capital markets and pressure liquidity”, Mr Hussain said.Netflix said last week that it anticipated free cash outflows of up to $2.5bn in 2017. As some media groups that were once partners, such as Walt Disney, stop licensing their content to Netflix, the Silicon Valley-based company must invest in new TV shows and movies to keep subscribers loyal.The cost of that content is borne before it airs, and amortised based on estimated viewing over time, usually between six months and five years.That model leaves Netflix with high upfront capital requirements and it has warned investors that it expects to see cash outflows for “many years” to support its growth around the world.It is presently pushing hard into full-length movies, expecting to release 80 films next year, up from just eight in the most recent quarter and many more than most traditional Hollywood studios, as well as TV shows in new languages, including Italian and German.Morgan Stanley led the bond sale for Netflix on Monday, alongside Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo and Allen & Company.
281;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix: debtmogorgon;All will be well at the streaming company as long as debt investors plug the hole;"With meagre profits and negative free cash flow, Netflix has always been the odd one out of the “Fang” family. Amazon takes in plenty of cash despite billions of dollars of investment. Facebook and Google/Alphabet make large profits, partly because they get most of their content for free.Content is an organism as hungry as Demogorgon, a monster from Netflix series Stranger Things. Some $7bn-$8bn of costs should flow through the income statement next year, the company said during quarterly results on Monday.Yet the other way Netflix distinguishes itself from other high-growth internet companies is an even stronger share price. In five years, Alphabet is up almost 200 per cent, Amazon up more than 300 per cent, Facebook up 800 per cent, but Netflix is up more than 2,000 per cent.Even as it reported its 11th straight quarter of negative free cash flow, totalling -$3.1bn over that period, the stock hit a fresh record. The streaming service has a $92bn enterprise value supported by less than $1bn of annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.The nervously inclined might see a bottomless money pit, with Netflix forced to throw in more for its own shows as traditional suppliers flee. Disney, for example, has said it will stop supplying Netflix as it launches its own direct-to-consumer service.Netflix offered some comfort: outside the US, Disney content has only been available in three out of almost 200 countries where Netflix operates. That does not move the needle on an international revenue growth rate of 33 per cent.The real challenge is maintaining the impressive run of original hits, which has included House of Cards and Stranger Things. Few studios manage this over the long-term. And there is still that troubling funding need. More important than shareholder loyalty is the tolerance of debt investors to keep buying Netflix’s junk-rated bonds to plug the gap. In the current yield-starved market that is possible; if the rate environment changes or Netflix has a self-inflicted wound, it could change quickly."
282;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-17T00:02:17Z;Netflix subscriber growth tops estimates;Shares reach new high despite lift in content costs to $7bn-$8bn in year ahead;Netflix attracted more new subscribers than expected in the third quarter, driving its shares to a record high, despite flagging an uptick in its content investment costs to up to $8bn next year. The number of global subscribers rose by 5.3m to 109.3m, almost 1m more than Netflix and Wall Street analysts had forecast, for a 29 per cent increase in net additional subscribers so far this year.That growth is set to continue into the fourth quarter as Netflix predicted net additions of 6.3m subscribers, even after the price rises in several markets that it announced earlier this month. Netflix is targeting “slow and steady” price increases, which it hopes to justify by increasing its library of original content. “Price is all relative to value,” Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said on Monday. “We are continuing to increase the content offering and we are seeing that reflected in viewing around the world. We try to maintain that feeling that consumers have that we are great value in the amount of content that we have, relative to price.”Revenues at the US-based streaming service rose 30 per cent year-on-year to $2.99bn, exceeding analysts’ forecasts, while net income jumped 150 per cent to $130m. Netflix’s shares rose as much as 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading before settling to be 1.5 per cent higher at $205.65 — a new record. Shares in the company this year have risen more than 60 per cent.To fuel its growth, Netflix has been spending billions of dollars on original content, from TV shows such as The Crown and Stranger Things, as well as forthcoming Will Smith movie Bright and its first series in Italian and German, Suburra and Dark. Netflix said its content budget would range between $7bn-$8bn next year, up from $6bn this year and higher than its executives had forecast for 2018. It said it will release about 80 original movies next year, up from only eight in the last quarter.However, Mr Hastings effectively ruled out buying The Weinstein Company, which is facing an uncertain future after allegations of serial sexual harassment by its co-founder Harvey Weinstein. “It would be extremely unlikely for us to be a bidder for the firm,” Mr Hastings said. Netflix has made $17bn worth of content commitments over the next “several years”, as it plans for the day when the library of older TV shows and movies that it licenses from traditional media companies dries up.“While we have multiyear deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear,” Netflix said. “Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.” That investment in content will contribute to free cash outflows of up to $2.5bn this year, in line with its previous guidance. Netflix said it expected to turn to the debt markets to finance those costs.The Silicon Valley-based company noted that competition was heating up, after The Walt Disney Company announced plans to launch its own streaming services and Facebook recently launched a new Watch tab for original videos. Last week, Apple secured its first TV series commission with Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories. In its quarterly recorded conversation with an analyst posted to YouTube on Monday, Mr Hastings played down the affect of Disney content being pulled from Netflix. Disney shows and films are only available on Netflix in a handful of countries around the world, he said, which has not impeded global growth. 
283;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-16T22:52:33Z;Netflix rules out bid for Weinstein Company;;Netflix has effectively ruled itself out of bidding for the Weinstein Company, which is desperately seeking a lifeline after allegations of serial sexual harassment by its co-founder Harvey Weinstein.Asked about any potential impact from the fallout of the Weinstein crisis by an analyst during its discussion of its quarterly quarterly earnings, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said: “It would be extremely unlikely for us to be a bidder for the firm.”Despite the continuing fallout from the recent revelations, the Weinstein Company still owns a rich library of film and television content, some of which Netflix already shows on its streaming video service.Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s head of content, described its business with the Weinstein Company as “pretty arm’s distance”. “It’s not material in either way,” he said. “There’s a lot of smoke to clear from what’s happening there.”Earlier on Monday, private equity firm Colony Capital said it would make an unspecified “capital infusion” to the Weinstein Company. The deal could lead to a sale of some or all of the film group. Harvey Weinstein was fired last week and the company has been hit by a wave of cancelled projects following the allegations made against him.
284;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-16T20:46:47Z;Netflix subscriber growth tops estimates, revenue jumps;;"Netflix posted a 30 per cent jump in revenue to $2.99bn in its third quarter, beating analysts’ forecasts and providing a further boost to a stock price that was already trading at record highs.
Net income jumped 150 per cent year-on-year to $130m, as it posted a larger-than-expected net 5.3m increase in global subscribers to 109.3m. That was higher than the about 4.5m increase that analysts had forecast, according to FactSet data. Netflix saw its shares rise by as much as 3.6 per cent in after-hours trading.The streaming video service also forecast net subscriber growth of 6.3m for the fourth quarter that was just ahead of Wall Street expectations, despite announcing a new set of price hikes in several markets earlier this month.“Relative to our guidance of 4.4m net adds, we under-forecasted both US and international acquisition,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders. “Year to date net adds of 15.5 million are up 29 per cent versus last year.”The company added that while it expected margins to dip in the fourth quarter as it invests in marketing to promote new shows, such as the latest series of Stranger Things which debuts later this month, Netflix pledged a “steady improvement in international profitability and a growing operating margin”, as it pushes further into Asia.By increasing prices for its HD and 4K plans, Netflix said, it would increase revenues to “help us grow our content offering and continue our global operating margin growth”.At the same time, Netflix is stepping up its investment in content, as it plans for a time when the library of older TV shows and movies that it licenses from traditional media companies starts to wane. Netflix said it would spend up to $8bn on content next year, with $17bn in content commitments over the next “several years”.“While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear,” Netflix said. “Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.”That investment in content will contribute to free cash outflows of up to $2.5bn this year, in line with its previous guidance. Netflix said it expected to turn to the debt markets to finance that investment."
285;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall St trims gains after hitting fresh highs;;Wall Street jumped to fresh record highs on Monday as telecoms and financials rebounded before giving up some of the gains.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.3 per cent to 2,559.47 — led by a 0.9 per cent advance in telecoms and a 0.5 per cent rise in financials.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.3 per cent to 22,945.57, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed as high as 6,632.50.The moves came as a gauge of manufacturing in the New York region jumped to it highest level in 3 years and as earnings season continues apace.Video streaming site Netflix is set to report results after the bell on Monday. The stock climbed above $200 for the first time last week after analysts at Goldman Sachs argued the consensus forecast for Netflix’s subscriber growth remains “too low” especially in light of the company’s growing investment in original content.Apple shares rose 1.5 per cent to $159.37 after the stock was upgraded to “overweight” from “sector weight” by analysts at KeyBanc arguing that the newer and more expensive iPhone models, like the new iPhone X, will help boost the company’s bottomline.Elsewhere, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, rose 0.1 per cent to 93.17, while the yield on the US 10-year Treasury, which moves inversely to price, rose 1.8 basis points to 2.29 per cent.
286;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-13T15:07:57Z;Netflix climbs past $200 for first time after bullish Goldman note;;Shares in Netflix briefly crossed the $200 mark for the first time on Friday as a bullish note from Goldman Sachs helped send the stock to a fresh record high.The video streaming company behind hits like Stranger Things and Narcos, which has seen its shares nearly double over the past 12 months, rose as much as 2.5 per cent to hit a new peak of $200.82.The move comes after analysts at Goldman raised their price target on the stock from $200, to $235 — the highest among Wall Street analysts. The team said in a note to clients that despite the stock’s blistering run this year, they believe there is still more upside growth thanks to recent price increases to some of its subscription plans and strong subscriber growth.In particular, Goldman argued that consensus forecast for Netflix’s subscriber growth remains “too low” especially in light of the company’s growing investment in original content, which it said has a strong correlation to user growth.Goldman predicts Netflix will add 13.9m net subscribers during the second half of this year, compared to market consensus of 10.8m.…content remains the primary driver of subscriber growth and engagement (and the pricing power that comes with it)…While we are considerably above consensus…and don’t expect management to guide to our forecast, we do believe management is likely to exceed those forecasts.Earlier this month, Netflix unveiled a new pricing scheme, which will see the cost of its mid-tier plan go up by $1 from $9.99 to $10.99 a month. Its top-tier “premium” plan will now cost $13.99 a month, a $2 increase over its previous price tag of $11.99. The bottom-tier “basic” plan is unchanged at $7.99 a month.Goldman reckons the price increases could add as much as $0.89 to Netflix’s average revenue per user (ARPU) in the US by the first quarter of 2018.“We believe this strategy reflects both strong engagement trends and an effort to monetize widespread password sharing,” said Goldman.The bank is also forecasting Netflix to reach 130m international subscribers by 2020, a sharp jump from the 52m recorded in the second quarter this year. As it noted:We continue to believe that Netflix’s content spend is the most important driver of incremental subscriber growth, particularly as we near the two year mark since the last international expansion. From both a breadth and quality perspective, the company’s content slate is well-positioned to drive subscriber growth.Netflix is scheduled to report third quarter earnings next Monday, October 16 after the market close.
287;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix and eBay find the holes in the UK tax net;A 19th-century regime cannot handle 21st-century companies;The numbers look odd. According to its annual report, eBay had sales of $1.3bn (£1bn) in the UK last year. Yet, as the FT reported this week, the company’s filings with the UK tax authorities showed revenues of £200m. Profits were just £7.6m, creating a UK tax liability of just £1.6m. What explains the £800m sales gap between the US and the UK reports? Furthermore, on the revenue reported in the UK, the profit margin is just 4 per cent. The company as a whole has a pre-tax profit margin closer to 30 per cent.If that is not strange enough, consider Netflix, which has an estimated 6.5m UK subscribers. Given its prices, that ought to translate to something in the order of £400m in UK revenue. For UK tax purposes, however, Netflix reported revenue of £30m and negligible profit.The problem seems simple. Both companies, by any normal standard, do a lot of business in the UK. But when tax time comes, their businesses suddenly become small. It thus looks — to anyone but a tax lawyer — like Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs is simply getting swindled.Yet the problem is not simple, not limited to the UK, and much larger than two companies. Every country has a distinct tax regime. These regimes were developed when companies were less global and most of their activity involved physical goods. This opens the field to limitless strategies for avoiding tax. Incorporating in a low-tax jurisdiction is only the first. The real trick is not creating taxable corporate beachheads in high-tax regimes, and where that fails, making sure that profits never appear in them.When a company from country A sells something in country B, it is only liable for corporate taxes under B’s laws when it has (in the argot) a “permanent establishment” there. With trade in physical goods, this means, paradigmatically, a store. A store has employees, assets, a building. Where is Netflix’s UK store? It has only 14 employees in the country. Amazon or eBay have the problem of warehouses. But it is almost reasonable for them to argue that these are not generating taxable profit. The value is in the software, which sits in a server somewhere else. And if profit does appear to arise, then it may have to be paid — as a fee for the use of intellectual property — back to a Swiss or Irish subsidiary. Neither eBay nor Netflix is breaking the law. They are taking advantage of the antiquity of the concepts used in the tax code.Recently mooted calls in some European capitals for a revenue-based tax, or one that applies only to digital companies, would create more problems then they would solve. Ultimately a solution to the creaking tax system will depend, first, on the US — home of the digital giants — reforming its tax system. Profits earned in international subsidiaries of US companies are not taxed until repatriated, so in many cases they are not taxed at all. The recent Republican tax proposal aims to change this, but in such vague terms that other loopholes loom.Next, there needs to be an internationally co-ordinated reconfiguration of the tax base. EU proposals are a first effort in this direction. This does not mean that all countries should have the same tax rates, but rather should aim to agree about what taxable events are and where they occur. This will mean replacing the antiquated notion of a “permanent establishment”, with its focus on assets and employees, with something fit for the digital age. The new rules will be imperfect. Companies are, after all, in large part legal fictions. As the examples of eBay and Netflix show, however, the current system is manifestly unsatisfactory.
288;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-12T11:37:33Z;David Fincher on his new Netflix series Mindhunter and what’s gone wrong with film-making;‘There’s no time for character in movies,’ says the director of ‘Se7en’, ‘Fight Club’ and ‘Gone Girl’;"“Have we got a show?” David Fincher asks. He is joking, but not really. The show in question is Mindhunter, a new drama Fincher has created for the all-powerful Netflix. The setting is a non-specific late 1970s, the principals a pair of FBI agents at the dawn of modern criminal psychology. Fincher, an executive producer, also directed the first two and last two episodes. When we meet in a starched London hotel, these are all that have been shown to a small group of journalists. Through scarcity alone, my opinion is valued. I tell him the truth — I found it very moreish — and he nods. “OK. Good. Good. You just never know.”For much of his career, Fincher has enjoyed a reputation for a certain spikiness. Now, at 55, his goatee beard has silvered to the point of a minimalist Santa Claus. At times he almost seems avuncular. Santa, however, never brought anyone the kind of visions on which Fincher made his name. While his movies have been many and various, the best of him has surfaced in tales about the most depraved human behaviours, the horrible brilliance of Se7en and Zodiac now joined by another story of serial killers and those who pursue them. I ask when Fincher first became aware of what in Mindhunter are still called “sequence killers”?“Zodiac,” he says, the alias for the Californian killer — never arrested — active while Fincher was growing up in the state. He remembers being on a school bus, a police car trailing behind. It was October 1969, a few weeks after his seventh birthday. When he got home, he asked his father what was happening. “He said: ‘Oh. That’s right. There’s a guy who’s been killing people, and he’s written a letter saying he’s going to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tyres of a school bus and pick off the kids as they come out.’” Fincher smiles a little smile. “My dad was pretty dry.”His father was a writer, his outlets including the magazine Psychology Today. By the era captured in Mindhunter, the younger man was a teenager, besotted with film, working after school as a projectionist at a scruffy movie house. But psychology — “sorting through the walnut” — always fascinated him. Not just him. I wonder aloud if with Mindhunter, Fincher is circling back to the unfinished business of Zodiac, a slow-burn modern classic that sank at the box office in 2007. Maybe too, I say, he keeps returning to that seven-year-old boy wanting to know why a stranger planned to shoot him. Journalists, I say in the moment of silence that follows, often fancy themselves as amateur psychologists. Another smile. “Highly amateur psychologists.”If you want to make studio movies, you stay in their lanes, which are romantic comedy, affliction Oscar bait, Spandex summer, superhero tentpole, moderately budgeted sequelHis version of events begins more simply with the book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit, a non-fiction history of criminal profiling given to him by the actress Charlize Theron, now his co-producer. His response was tepid. “I said ‘Serial killers? Charlize, please.’” They, he insists, are of limited interest.“But what did intrigue me was the idea of these FBI guys, blunt instrument G-Men from this monolithic post-Hoover bureaucracy, wrestling with psychology at a time it was still seen as the province of pipe-smoking Freudians.”The show was originally destined for cable network HBO, until it became clear that the company’s hugely successful True Detective series presented a possible problem of house space. In short order, Fincher and his series arrived at Netflix, his one certainty that this had to be a TV show — and not a movie.“Because it’s about character,” he explains. “There’s no time for character in movies.” He flatly leaves it there. In movies now or movies full stop? “No, now. Look at All The President’s Men — everything is character. Now, movies are about saving the world from destruction. There aren’t a lot of scenes in movies, even the ones I get to make, where anyone gets to muse about the why. It’s mostly the ticking clock. And in this show it’s hard to find the ticking clock. But the thing is: I don’t care if the whole scene is five pages of two people in a car sipping coffee from paper cups as long as there’s a fascinating power dynamic and I learn something about them. And I do not care if the car is doing somewhere between 25 and 35 miles per hour.”The subtext is that he would only get to make something this good on Netflix. And it is good, glinting with deadpan wit. As the streaming giant knows, there is a particular kudos to Fincher joining their displaced army of movie directors. That start in the projection booth — baptised into what he calls “the religion of film” — led to a career making some of the most vital, slickly unnerving American movies of the last quarter century. You may have your own favourite, perhaps the grand guignol horror of Se7en or the rat-tat-tat Facebook biography The Social Network. (Fincher, as honest about his own work as any critic, defends the “horribly misunderstood” Fight Club while sniffing at Panic Room.) But he has also always been an early adopter. In 2013 he produced a series for Netflix, again directing the first two episodes — the political drama House of Cards, in which Kevin Spacey gave Machiavellian congressmen a bad name.Four years on, the world is changed. Netflix has gone from upstart disrupter to market dominance. As Fincher notes, where he once made films, he now creates “streamable chronological narrative content”. Still, he and Netflix make a good couple — they with their massed pinpoint data about viewing habits, he a famous stickler, his films delivered to budget and on time.“I see Netflix as people who are bold enough and interested enough to build a playground between film and television. And that playground can be a safe haven for adult drama, which has been squeezed out of the multiplex. With Mindhunter, I just wanted something a little bit ruminative. As the guy who sold Paramount and Warner Bros on Zodiac, that’s not something I would do again. I don’t think movie studios have the stomach for it.”There is a pause, the sound of a caveat being drafted. “Look, many people at studios are still fighting the good fight. There are executives there who are friends of mine. But if you want to make studio movies, you stay in their lanes, which are romantic comedy, affliction Oscar bait, Spandex summer, superhero tentpole, moderately budgeted sequel.” Even his recent Hitchcockian smash hit Gone Girl, he says, took a hard fight to get financed at $65m, before going on to make $370m. “I’m 55 years old. I want to be directing stuff, not auditioning it.”The typical analysis of the decline of modern Hollywood has it that the crash of 2008 suddenly left studios terrified of risk. To Fincher, now on a roll, the crisis goes back further. “For 25 years, cinema has been distilling down to this thing we have now. ‘We know what you want. You want a lot of movement, a lot of colour, objects twisting and flaming through space. You want to see people fall and catch hands at the last minute and dangle over the lava.’ There’s been this balsamic reduction of that into exactly what will justify you spending 14 bucks.”But in the promised land of peak television, Fincher is aware he has to compete with an epidemic of rival content. “It’s why I get so anxious about marketing. The risk with our show is people seeing it as an entire season of conversations at stainless steel picnic tables. We have to catch people’s attention. If you miss that you’re just left with the historical perspective.” He makes that sound dark and cold indeed.Watching Mindhunter, what strikes you aside from how simply gripping it is is how it feels like a fractionally new artform — scenes as meticulous as anything in Fincher’s films rub up against touches that must have been tailored to viewing on a phone, place names announced in full screen capital letters (QUANTICO, VIRGINIA). If this is the future, it feels bracing. And Fincher seems braced too.The magic aura of a live movie audience still enthrals him. “The gasp. I know. But it’s changed now. The cinema isn’t dead. It just does something different. The place is still filled with kids, it’s just they’re all on their phones. It’s a social event like a bonfire, and the movie is the bonfire. It’s why people gather but it’s not actually there to be looked at.” He smirks and shrugs, a man who learnt at seven years old to accept uncomfortable realities. “Because the bonfire is always the same.”‘Mindhunter’ debuts on Netflix tomorrowFollow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

289;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-11T18:19:47Z;Ebay and Netflix pay total UK tax of less than £1.9m;Fresh questions on global tech company structures that divert revenues;Netflix and eBay, two US technology groups with millions of British customers, collectively paid less than £1.9m in UK tax last year, raising new questions about how multinationals structure their businesses to minimise their tax bills.Ebay’s UK business paid £1.6m in tax on £7.6m of profits and £200m of revenues last year, according to the e-commerce company’s latest filings with Companies House. However the online retailer had previously told US authorities it registered more than $1.3bn of revenues in the UK in 2016.The revenue figure reported in the US appears to include commissions eBay received on sales in the UK, but those figures are not included in the UK accounts. Instead, the UK subsidiary describes its revenue as coming only from providing marketing and advertising services to eBay’s Swiss entity, eBay International AG.Separately, Netflix’s latest UK filings show the video-streaming service registered a 39 per cent fall in its UK tax bill to less than €300,000 last year, while its UK revenues and profits nearly halved to €22m and €1m.The California-based company, which is thought to have roughly 6.5m subscribers in Britain, books all of its subscription revenue from UK users through its parent company Netflix International BV, which is based in the Netherlands.Ampere Analysis, a London-based research firm, estimated Netflix made $520m of subscription revenue last year in Britain on the basis of estimated UK user numbers and monthly subscription pricing. By contrast, the company reported UK revenue that was one 20th of this amount, all of it from marketing activities.Jolyon Maugham, a UK tax barrister, said eBay’s UK accounts suggested its British “tax liabilities are not a function of the profits that they make on their UK-based sales”.“This illustrates how divorced our corporate tax system has become from the world in which it is supposed to operate,” Mr Maugham said. “You have a tax system that only nods in passing to the activities taking place.”The issue of US tech giants using complex corporate structures to avoid large tax bills in Europe has become the subject of increasing political controversy, with the European Commission earlier this month taking Ireland to court for failing to collect €13bn in back taxes from Apple and accusing Luxembourg of giving Amazon preferential treatment.Netflix is contributing to the UK economy in many different ways, including corporate and other taxes, remitting millions in VAT, employing staff directly and funding dozens of UK productions for hundreds of millions of poundsLast year, George Osborne, then UK chancellor, faced harsh criticism for striking a deal with Google that allowed the California group to pay £130m in back taxes despite earning $5.6bn in UK revenues in 2013.“This is the same debate we have with Facebook, Google, Airbnb and Uber,” said Mr Maugham. “To most people [these companies’ tax payments in the UK] are an outcome that feels counterintuitive or grossly unfair.”Ebay declined to comment on the reason for the different UK and US revenue figures. “In all countries and at all times, eBay is fully compliant with national, EU and international tax rules including those of the OECD, including the remittance of [value added tax] to the appropriate authorities,” a company spokesperson said.A Netflix spokesperson did not comment on the UK revenue estimates but said: “In 2016, our UK entity reported €22m revenue and €21m operating expenses on marketing activities, with a profit before tax of €1m and an income tax charge of €269,000. [This makes] an effective tax rate of approximately 27 per cent.”“Netflix is contributing to the UK economy in many different ways, including corporate and other taxes, remitting millions in VAT, employing staff directly and funding dozens of UK productions for hundreds of millions of pounds.”Labour MP Caroline Flint said of both companies’ UK tax payments: “[These figures suggest] diverting profits to low-tax or no-tax states is widespread. This will be offensive to many customers, and is grossly unfair to many UK-based businesses who pay their taxes and reject using profit-shifting or shell companies.”The UK government attempted to encourage companies to pay more tax by introducing in 2015 a “Google tax” on profits diverted overseas. Profits caught by the levy are taxed at 25 per cent, compared with the current UK corporation tax rate of 19 per cent.Some lawyers have questioned the success of the new UK levy, which was intended to encourage companies to restructure their businesses to pay more corporation tax in the UK, although few have done so.Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: “[These companies’ tax payments are] another example of international companies being able to bypass British tax legislations. There needs to be reform of company taxation so that it tackles levels of activity, not just declared profits.”Despite its growing subscriber base in the UK, Netflix operates on razor-thin margins, spending huge amounts on acquiring and creating programmes for its streaming service.“Perhaps unlike some other tech companies, which are obviously shifting money from country to country to minimise [their] tax burden, Netflix is still in expansion mode and is only marginally in profit globally,” said Richard Broughton, research director at Ampere Analysis. “But of course, recently announced price rises, even of 50 cents, will impact top-line revenue by three-quarters of a billion dollars.”This article has been amended to make clear that marketing activities were the source of revenue that Netflix reported in the UK
290;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-10-05T17:15:51Z;Netflix’s shares surge after move to increase prices;Group looks to cover investment in content amid competition from rival services;Netflix is increasing prices in the US and UK by as much as 17 per cent, as it looks to cover its growing investment in original content. The move sent shares in the video streaming service to a record intraday high.Netflix plans to spend $6bn this year on original shows and movies that include Okja, Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black. That investment will grow to $7bn next year, executives have said. Netflix is racing to fill up its library, at a time when some former media partners, including the Walt Disney Company, are pulling their catalogue to launch rival streaming services. It also faces growing competition from the likes of Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, Facebook and Apple, who are all investing in original content for streaming. Netflix’s total global subscribers exceeded 100m for the first time in recent months amid the content push, but another price rise could cause a slowdown in growth, as it has after previous increases. While its lowest-cost “Basic” plan will remain at $7.99 a month in the US and £5.99 in the UK, its most popular “Standard” tier that includes high-definition video will cost a dollar more at $10.99 (up 50p in the UK to £7.99). A “Premium” subscription, which includes simultaneous viewing on four screens and ultra-HD 4k video will rise from $11.99 to $13.99 in the US, and from £7.99 to £8.99 in the UK. Customers will begin to receive notifications of the price increase later this month. The increases for both existing and new subscribers in two of its largest markets follow rises in Australia, Canada and Brazil earlier this year.“From time to time, Netflix plans and pricing are adjusted as we add more exclusive TV shows and movies, introduce new product features and improve the overall Netflix experience to help members find something great to watch even faster,” Netflix said.The world’s largest subscription video streaming service last announced a price increase in October 2015 for new customers in the US, with the rise kicking in for existing customers a year later. Since then, it has introduced new features such as downloading shows to watch offline and pushed beyond traditional TV series into more movies and stand-up comedy. The new series of Netflix’s Emmy Award-winning Stranger Things debuts later this month. However, even as it raises prices, analysts say the total number of hours available for viewing on Netflix has shrunk in recent years. A Netflix spokesperson declined to say whether its catalogue size has increased or decreased since the last price increase. Netflix prefers to be judged by membership growth and engagement, rather than the raw volume of content available on its service. In a recent note, UBS analysts said they believed Netflix had sustained its subscriber-growth momentum through the third quarter, “despite what appears to be a weaker original content slate vs [the third quarter of] 2016, suggesting growth is being driven more by the overall breadth of content on Netflix, streaming hitting critical mass in many international markets and strong marketing/tech execution”.Over the past 12 months, the company’s shares have risen more than 80 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data. After the price changes were revealed, Netflix shares rose 4.25 per cent to $192.29, putting them on track for their best one-day gain since July.

293;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-09-21T17:25:16Z;Disney should sell ABC and go full stream ahead;Its new services are only a first step towards TV’s future;From Mickey Mouse and Iron Man to Han Solo and Buzz Lightyear, Walt Disney owns some of the most valuable entertainment properties on the planet. So when its chief executive Bob Iger recently revealed what he called “ a major strategic shift”, its rivals sat up and listened.In 2019, Disney will launch a pair of streaming services carrying some of its most highly prized content. One will be aimed at sports fans and feature programming from ESPN, its sports cable network. The other will cater to families and carry Disney animated movies as well as titles from its Pixar, Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm divisions.The shift Mr Iger referred to was towards owning the relationship with its viewers and controlling the distribution of its content, rather than being disintermediated by third parties, such as cable or satellite companies. By going direct to its consumers, Disney will be betting that there are enough potential customers willing to shell out a monthly fee for its service alongside their subscriptions to rivals such as Netflix, Amazon or Hulu, the streaming service that just won the Best Drama Emmy for The Handmaid’s Tale.Disney’s ESPN streaming service should start from a strong position because it has a large audience of passionate viewers. But the prospects for its entertainment offering are harder to assess. It plans to supplement its blockbuster movies with programming from the Disney Channel and a handful of original television series. In a crowded streaming market, will that be enough?In the five years since subscription streaming took off, the services with the widest array of programming have endured. Netflix has content aimed at kids as well as a vast selection of original shows for all age groups. But subscription services aimed at more narrow audience interests have struggled: Seeso, a comedy service launched last year by NBC, recently said it would be closing down.Broad therefore looks best and there is one way Disney could make its subscription offering one of the broadest around. It could shift the programming it makes for its ABC broadcast network to the new streaming service — and sell off ABC itself.Disney bought ABC for $19bn in 1995, a deal that gave it a truly national platform. The network has been the home of multiple big hits over the years, from Lost and Desperate Housewives to Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy. But some analysts believe that the growth of broadcast television has come to an end. If that is the case, it would be more profitable to use the series being developed by the network to drive streaming subscriptions instead.The network has its own production capability — ABC Studios — which Disney could keep. The rest of the business — the television stations ABC owns and the affiliate agreements it has with other stations around the US — could be sold for a hefty sum. Valuing the business is tricky, because the network’s performance is wrapped up inside the rest of Disney company. But a look at CBS, probably the closest comparable listed company to ABC, offers a guide. CBS has an enterprise value of $32bn and is trading at 9.3 times its 2018 earnings. It has a different asset mix to ABC, because it owns the Showtime cable channel and a larger portfolio of television stations. When these are stripped out, making it resemble ABC more closely, it generates about $2.3bn of annual earnings. Multiply that by 9.3 and you have a company worth around $20bn.ABC is a remarkable promotional platform for other Disney-owned businesses. Its live events, including college football and its annual Oscars broadcast, attract tens of millions of viewers. It also continues to throw off significant cash from advertising and carriage agreements with distributors, which is not to be sniffed at.But Wall Street values companies based on their future earnings, and in the media industry, the future is all about digital streaming. If Disney wants to create a streaming service that can compete with Netflix and Amazon, bold action and selling ABC would fit the bill. Television is evolving at a rapid clip. By announcing its plans for the two streaming services, Disney has taken a step into the future. It will have to decide whether it is ready for another one.Matthew.Garrahan@ft.com
294;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-09-12T17:55:21Z;Apple unveils new version of Watch, higher-resolution TV box;;Apple has unveiled a new version of its Watch with cellular wireless connectivity and a new higher-resolution TV box.Apple Watch wearers will be able to take calls, stream Apple Music and talk to Siri when out on a run or at the beach.The new Apple TV box features 4K, also known as ultra-high definition, and high dynamic range, for richer and more vivid images on compatible TV sets. 4K movies will be available for download on iTunes for the same price as a standard high-definition film. Streaming companies such as Netflix will also support the upgraded box.The new Apple TV 4K will cost $179 when it goes on sale later this month.The Apple TV box has lagged behind rivals such as Roku, Google’s Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV, which already offer 4K in certain models.Apple Watch, on the other hand, has seen a steady improvement in sales in recent quarters, recently overtaking Fitbit to become the top-selling wearable device. The new version could help to maintain that momentum by untethering it from the iPhone for the first time.“Now you have the freedom to go anywhere with just your Apple Watch,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, introducing “Series 3” of the device on stage on Tuesday.The new model looks the same as its predecessors apart from a slightly larger bulge on the inside of the Watch to allow for a larger battery. A bright red spot on the “digital crown” button denotes the new version.The price with a cellular chip is $399, or without cellular $329, while the older Series 1 is still available for $249.Tim Cook, chief executive, claimed Apple’s wrist computer has now become the top selling watch in the world, ahead of Rolex, Fossil and Omega. Apple did not provide a source for the data, however.“Adding LTE capabilities will open Watch to a new kind of buyer and will likely spur upgrades of current users who can see the value of being fully connected without an iPhone,” said Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.Apple shares pushed higher as the launch event unfolded, up more than 1 per cent on the day so far.
295;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Amazon and Netflix pitch cricket in Indian media push;US giants field expensive dramas against established local networks in online battle;"Its plot is as Indian as they come, featuring murky dealings behind the razzmatazz of a hugely popular cricket league.But the drama series Inside Edge, launched by Amazon to rave reviews in June, is proof of a rising foreign presence in India’s fast-growing online entertainment business.US giants Amazon and Netflix are both ramping up investments, creating expensive new Indian content in the hope of capitalising on the explosive recent growth in smartphone penetration and data consumption. Yet they face stiff competition from India’s established television companies, which are investing in online platforms of their own — and whose executives warn that the US groups will struggle to apply their standard playbook to frugal Indian consumers.Inside Edge was “certainly more expensive” than the “much lower quality” television shows previously produced in India, says James Farrell, Amazon’s head of video content for Asia-Pacific.It is available, along with a suite of international and Indian films, as part of Amazon Prime — the service that also offers perks such as faster delivery of products. Prime membership costs $99 a year in the US — but less than a tenth of that in India, the lowest rate offered in any market, as Amazon tries to lure viewers who could become loyal customers of its broader ecommerce business.“Now more than half our new customers are coming from the video service . . . and the Amazon universe is pretty fantastic once you get in,” Mr Farrell says. The aggressive pricing is part of Amazon’s intense expansion drive in India, even at the cost of heavy operating losses for the foreseeable future, after it was relegated to a marginal role in China. The US group has committed $5bn in funding to its Indian entity, which is in a battle for supremacy with Indian ecommerce unicorn Flipkart.Netflix has also been building its presence in India since launching there in January 2016. This month, it announced plans to film two new Indian drama series: one, like Inside Edge, focused on cricket and corruption, and a second about a female homicide detective in New Delhi. It had previously bought the exclusive streaming rights to wrestling movie Dangal and historical epic Baahubali 2, two recent releases that are the highest-grossing Indian films in history.But Netflix, which, unlike Amazon, has not slashed its subscription rates, will find India an utterly different proposition to the US and other developed markets, says Sudanshu Vats, chief executive of Viacom18, one of the country’s largest television networks. Netflix’s basic monthly subscription charge of $8 represented a huge discount from traditional television pricing in the US, Mr Vats notes — but the opposite is true in India, where monthly cable television charges are typically less than half the cheapest Netflix option.“If they continue to have global pricing in India,” Netflix might attract a maximum of 3m subscribers, Mr Vats predicts. “That’s still a very small number in the Indian context; it’s scratching the surface. It’s a very good business model but it doesn’t scale.”Jessica Lee, Netflix’s head of communications for Asia, says that it is targeting “the top end of the market” with its pursuit of “strong, quality titles”.“At this point, we are keeping pricing fairly consistent across the world . . . India is a massive market and there's still a big potential with early adopters, world travellers,” she says.While they have attention-grabbing “marquee shows”, Netflix and Amazon are unlikely to be able to match the sheer volume of local content offered by in-country rivals, says Uday Shankar, chairman of Star India, which claims 650m monthly viewers for its 58 television channels.“We at Star create almost 18,000 hours of content every year,” he says. “Clearly that's not a model that [Amazon and Netflix] can sustain very easily.”Star has rolled out its own digital platform, Hotstar, offering a huge library of films and drama series from the US and India for about $3 a month — as well as a free, advertising-supported service with more limited content.For now, Hotstar’s growth is subsidised by Star’s traditional television services, and Mr Shankar sees little chance of the former overtaking the latter in the foreseeable future. Perhaps 1m to 2m Indians are currently willing to pay for online content, ""and I struggle to think that number could jump to 20m or 30m in the next five years,"" Mr Shankar estimates. Many Indians, he says, are highly conscious of the cost of mobile data usage — meaning that “they don’t even consider YouTube free — because it costs them money for data”. Data consumption is surging, however, amid a price war in mobile services instigated by Reliance Jio , backed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani. Jio claims that in the six months since its September launch, it helped drive national mobile data consumption from 200m gigabytes to 1.2bn per month, with Jio subscribers alone consuming 1.7bn hours of video each month.For some in the industry, the intensifying competition is unalloyed good news. Eros International, a Mumbai-based film distributor, has seen an opportunity to take advantage by pursuing sale talks on its library  of more than 3,000 films, at a reported asking price of $1bn. It has made contact with potential buyers including Apple, offering the US company an opportunity to expand its catalogue of Indian film content, says a person with knowledge of the discussions.Returns for the mainstream media industry have long been held back by what consultants at Deloitte described in a recent report as “rampant piracy”. They estimate that the problem costs the sector Rs190bn ($3bn) a year, with films downloaded in their millions from websites based mostly in North America. Many Indians prefer to buy pirated content on memory cards from local merchants, to save on data costs.“Piracy is a big problem but you have to live with it,” says Sushilkumar Agrawal, chief executive of film distributor Ultra Media. “We’re not going to go into the street and fight with people, and this is at the bottom of the police’s list of priorities.”Still, Mr Agrawal views the US groups’ arrival as an exciting potential source of new funding for Ultra’s expansion into production. “Amazon are paying good money to the content owners — and they're going for new productions, so we have the opportunity to produce more and more content for them,"" he says.But despite the ever-expanding feast of online video options, he warns, this industry faces a long struggle to build awareness and supersede traditional television, in a heterogeneous developing country of 1.3bn people.“Even in Mumbai, some people don't know how to do anything except switching the channel — so forget about connecting a smartphone to the TV,” he says.While Netflix seeks to profit from bringing foreign movies to Indian viewers, the local film industry is eyeing the money to be made from sending films in the opposite direction.Dangal, a Hindi film based on the true story of two sisters who became wrestling champions, has been one of the most popular films in China this year, grossing a reported $190m at the box office. That helped to make it one of the top five non-English language films in history by global theatre earnings.Its success came alongside that of Baahubali 2, an epic tale of violence surrounding an ancient South Indian royal court, which at one point ranked third in the US box office charts.Despite these encouraging breakthroughs, industry executives remain acutely conscious of the difficulty of marketing Indian films abroad. Dangal may have succeeded in China, but it is a formidable challenge just to win permission to screen an Indian film in that country, which allows just 34 foreign films to be shown in cinemas each year. “It’s an extremely low number, and that includes the Hollywood numbers,” says Sneha Rajani, head of motion pictures for Sony Pictures in India, who tried unsuccessfully to secure a Chinese release for Sony’s hit comedy Piku, a blend of toilet humour and family values. In Western markets such as the US, meanwhile, Indian films are still seen principally by the large South Asian diaspora. Baahubali 2, despite its box office success, was mostly ignored by the film reviewers at major US newspapers. Indian actors trying to break through abroad are similarly at risk of being pigeonholed, says Anjula Acharia, the agent of Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra, who recently set her sights on breaking through in Hollywood. “People were saying: ‘Can she play her accent up a bit?’” she says. “Priyanka had to turn down a lot of roles because of this.”Ms Chopra’s US career is progressing, however, with a role in the successful drama series Quantico, as well as three feature films. And film companies back in India are taking a long-term perspective as they aim to build on the industry’s recent successes to build a broader international market.Sony has marketed its new romantic comedy Mubarakan in “a hell of a lot of countries including Russia, Belgium, Botswana, knowing full well that the returns will not be anything to write home about,” says Ms Rajani. “But we need to ensure that our movies start travelling.”"
296;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-09-01T23:36:18Z;Roku highlights its plans to go public;Video streaming platform seeking to ‘connect the entire TV ecosystem’;Roku, the video streaming platform, has unveiled plans to go public in what could be the first high-profile US listing of the post-summer season.The group gave the traditional $100m place holder for the amount of the deal in paperwork filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but no further details were available on the size of the offer or the prospective valuation.Riding the growth of streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, Roku has come to dominate the US market for watching internet video on full-size screens. It sells a range of set-top boxes and lower-priced dongles, as well as integrating its technology into TV sets themselves.Anthony Wood, Roku’s founder and chief executive, said that its “mission” was to become the “TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem”, as the media industry reaches a “tipping point” of online viewing.“I believe that just like mainframe operating systems didn’t transition to PCs, and just like PC operating systems didn’t make the transition to phones . . . TVs will be powered by a purpose-built operating system optimised for streaming,” he wrote in a letter to potential investors.The streaming trend has propelled Roku to rapid but unprofitable growth over its 15-year existence. For the six months ended June 30, Roku listed total net revenue of $199.7m, up from $162.3m in the same period a year ago. Losses from operations narrowed to $24.2m from $33.2m.Roku has been lossmaking since it was founded in 2002 and warned potential investors that it expected to incur “significant losses in the future” because of the costs of going public and expanding its operations.While it has found success as a relatively neutral player amid the warring factions of Apple, Amazon and Google, Roku is finding itself increasingly in competition against the very companies upon who it relies for content and data. Some of Roku’s most popular channels limit access to viewing data, which reduces its ability to target advertising based on user behaviour.In a recent research report, analysts at eMarketer estimated that Roku leads the US market for connected TV devices with 38.9m active users, but with Google’s Chromecast and Amazon’s Fire TV close behind. At the same time, Google’s YouTube and Amazon Video are among its most popular channels, while Apple does not allow videos purchased on its iTunes content store to be viewed on devices other than its own.Smartphones and tablets such as iPhones and iPads, where Roku has a less significant presence, make up an increasing portion of online video viewing. Nonetheless, Roku is far ahead of Apple in the TV box market, with eMarketer finding the iPhone maker placed a “distant fourth”.Maintaining close relations with Netflix will be important for Roku, as the streaming service — which has 104m subscribers — accounts for as much as a third of all the hours of video watched on its platform. Roku is in the “final year” of its current distribution deal with Netflix, and if it does not strike a new agreement in time, it could have to remove its most popular channel.“Although Netflix is the largest provider of content across our platform, revenue generated from Netflix was not material to our overall revenue during the six months ended June 30 2017, and we do not expect revenue from Netflix to be material to our operating results for the foreseeable future,” Roku added.The US listings market faced a downturn in 2016, with the fewest listings in years. While issuance has picked up this year, two companies with well-known brand names that went public in 2017 have seen their shares fall.Snap, the owner of Snapchat, listed in March at $17. After an early rally to as high as $29.44, the shares have since fallen sharply on heated competition from Facebook. Snap shares closed on Friday at $14.27.Blue Apron listed at $10 in June, but the meal kit delivery service now trades at about half that price.Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were listed as the lead underwriters for the Roku IPO along with Allen & Company and RBC Capital Markets. Officials for the banks were not immediately available to comment.
297;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-31T22:48:04Z;New high for Apple leaves tech stocks as August winners;Investor enthusiasm ahead of the new iPhone drives share price;Investor enthusiasm ahead of the launch of the new iPhone lifted Apple shares to a new record high, and helped make technology the best performing sector of the US market in August.The upswing marked a sharp turnround from earlier in the month, when the sector had been weakened by bouts of profit-taking, especially for the so-called FAANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, which was formerly known as Google. The sector has led the market this year with a gain of more than a fifth.The renewed buying also pushed the Nasdaq Composite to a fresh closing high on Thursday.Investors attributed the gains of recent days to various factors, including a spillover of momentum from Apple shares, which have jumped on news that the new iPhone will be unveiled on September 12. Its stock added more than 10 per cent in August.For some investors, the interest in tech was a case of FOMO — fear of missing out.“If tech is the gainer, I don’t want to be the loser,” explained JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “I don’t want to miss an up move on these stocks.”One catalyst on Thursday, Mr Kinahan said, was word that the Trump administration plans to release a more detailed tax plan in the next few weeks, according to an interview with Steven Mnuchin, US Treasury secretary, in the Wall Street Journal.“If the hunch is that there is going to be something in that tax plan about repatriating money [held by US companies overseas], that sector [tech] will benefit most,” Mr Kinahan said.Others pointed to a return of the “risk on” trade, a reversal of a move by investors this month to what are perceived as stable, dividend-paying areas, such as utilities. As recently as a few days ago, utilities shares were on track to be the top monthly performer in the S&P 500 for the first time since September of 2015.“It was ‘risk off’, then we saw a re-risking in the last few days,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations. “Apple, Facebook — those are the go-to names in the risk-on mentality.”Mr Underhill also said that concern about the negative effect of Hurricane Harvey on US economic growth has driven investors back to tech, which offers the hope of growth regardless of the underlying economy.Tech also benefits from growth outside the US.“It has to do with making up lost ground, strong earnings growth and it is the most internationally exposed place to be,” said Burns McKinney, a portfolio manager with Allianz Global Investors. “You have had European growth that has been solid, China has actually had good GDP numbers and . . . Japan posting 4 per cent GDP growth.”
298;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-22T04:03:59Z;Iflix entrepreneur targets Asia with Netflix-style service;Video-streaming platform claims price and local content gives it a competitive edge;When you run a business called iflix that streams movies and box-sets into homes from Iraq to Indonesia, being known as the “Netflix of emerging markets” is inevitable. But it is an inevitability that causes co-founder and chief executive Mark Britt to bristle. Rather, he prefers to highlight the similarities to Spotify — content on both the music streaming service and iflix is curated by celebrities and aficionados.Certainly the battles facing Mr Britt, an Australian based in Kuala Lumpur, in building the two-year-old company are far removed from those faced by his opposite number at Netflix. Reed Hastings never had to work out a way of collecting money without credit cards, or to fret about data servers — actual physical boxes holding 170 terabytes of House of Cards et al — being stranded at ports.And Netflix makes money. Iflix, valued at about $600m and backed by Rupert Murdoch’s Sky TV and Liberty Global, is generating annual sales of $100m. “Are we making revenues? Absolutely. Are we making money? No,” says Mr Britt, speaking in Hong Kong at the Rise technology conference last month.Price and local content is iflix’s competitive edge on Netflix, argues Mr Britt. Yet building the first emerging market video platform has entailed some unconventional methods. By way of market research Mr Britt, a lawyer by training, talked to stores selling pirated DVDs, assuming they would know what was hot.His hunch was correct: people prepared to pay for pirated DVDs were equally happy to pay $2 to $3 a month (depending on the market) to have the films streamed on to their phones or into their homes. But these customers were also used to receiving a top service. One store in Kuala Lumpur had a loyalty programme and a storekeeper who called his customers with personalised recommendations.Historically, Asia, home to almost two-thirds of the world’s population, has not had much success taking home-made television programmes and films to western screens. Not even many of its actors do — Korean-American Randall Park has variously played a North Korean (The Interview) a Taiwanese (Fresh Off the Boat) and Chinese characters. But now a host of new content is bringing more Asian actors and content to screens further from home.So popular are South Korean soap operas that media companies hire teams of translators to switch them into Chinese, Japanese and other languages.Chatri Sityodtong, a former hedge fund manager and internet entrepreneur, is rolling out the glitzy One Championship mixed martial arts competition. Asia has one of the world’s oldest sports, he argues, and it is time to take it to the screens.Mr Britt’s research yielded some surprising cultural insights. Who would have guessed the top-selling DVD in Ghana is Korean? Or that 70m Indonesians watch football every week and Mr Robot is big in Vietnam?“When the internet replaces piracy it’s an $8bn opportunity — you can watch a movie for the cost of a pirated DVD,” says Mr Britt. Consumers spent $6.2bn on pirated DVDs globally, excluding China, in 2015, and the iflix founder is confident that market is within his grasp. The forecast size of the global video-on-demand sector by 2026, according to Ooyala, the analytics company, is $100bn.Mr Britt’s leap from corporate lawyer to entrepreneur was triggered by his experience working with internet companies in London. “I saw people who loved what they did every day, and lawyers who were tired and depressed,” he recalls.The former lawyer is not the first, and will not be the last, to turn to the growing wealth of emerging markets. When he began his career, he says, just 5 per cent of the Fortune 500 hailed from emerging markets. By his retirement — he is now 41 — he believes it will be half.He applies similar arithmetic to iflix, which now boasts 4.2m customers and will reach — he hopes — 3bn people coming online over the next 15 years.Not all the maths has stacked up so neatly. Mr Britt initially solved the problem of collecting payment from customers who lacked credit cards, bank cards and PayPal by sending motorbikes round to collect fees door to door, but that meant spending $2 to collect $2 or $3.So he switched to working with the telecom companies who can add on a fee — bundling packages in much the same way as cable television companies do.In some markets, iflix streaming has been kiboshed by bandwidth. “Getting 80 terabytes of content into Myanmar does not work,” Mr Britt says. “You have to ship it into the country.” Which brings its own problems: he had data servers beached in Iraq at one point, awaiting customs clearance.There have been other unanticipated hurdles. When iflix kept crashing the data was offering up any number of reasons. The truth, it turned out, was prosaic: jailbroken phones — devices where the restrictions of the operating system have been removed — are pervasive in emerging markets and the traditional digital rights management solutions, which protect content being redistributed, do not work with such devices.“We wasted six months of our lives getting great insights from data and did not even understand the problem,” says Mr Britt. “Not forgetting your customer will still tell you more than your data will.”As part of a breed of entrepreneurs looking towards Asia, Mr Britt notes that the US does not have a monopoly on great ideas. Referring to the Indonesian ride-hailing app that also does food delivery and other services, he says: “My hope is that someone someday will call Uber the Go-Jek of America.”
299;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-18T13:09:47Z;Podcast and spoken-word apps experiment with paid-for model;While some subscription services exist, the medium is yet to solve its ad problem;My recent move to Los Angeles has given me a new appreciation for in-car audio. Whereas I biked around London and San Francisco — when listening on headphones can make an already hazardous commute even more dangerous — the “city of stars” is also a city of cars. Lots of them.Much of my time has been spent catching up with the podcasts that my family and friends had been telling me I ought to listen to, but for which I never seemed to find the time. But bingeing on Radiolab, S-town, Adam Buxton and Stuff You Should Know has brought home one of the format’s biggest drawbacks: advertising.I cannot enjoy the ad-free experience I have become accustomed to by watching NetflixBy now, my unprompted awareness of certain meal-delivery services, email newsletters and simple website creation is at saturation point. My tolerance is steadily lowering for the vocal gyrations hosts go through to tout their sponsors in “natural” conversation — a style pioneered by American public radio to avoid a canned ad break.Yes, most podcast players have an easy way to skip ahead a few seconds past the ads, but I do try (really, really hard) not to play with my phone while driving.All of which got me wondering: why isn’t there a Netflix or Spotify for podcasts? A monthly subscription service that shares its income with podcast producers, without them having to shill for mattress start-ups, stamps or razor blades every half-hour.Some podcast providers have already started to experiment with a paid model. Acast offers a $2 “show pass” to some individual podcasts, including the Football Ramble and Another Mother Runner, alongside the usual ad-supported offerings. This mixed model has the advantage of putting everything into one place. But it also means I cannot enjoy the ad-free experience I have become accustomed to by watching Netflix.In the past few months, a few “spoken word” services have popped up that do charge a subscription. Instead of regular podcasts’ chatty hosts, apps such as Audm and Curio.io use professional voiceover artists to read out written articles from newspapers, magazines and websites. Publishers receive a slice of the subscriptions, which are less than $10 a month. Medium, the online publishing service founded by former Twitter executive Evan Williams, also offers audio versions of some articles as part of its new $5 membership scheme.Audm, which is currently going through Silicon Valley’s much sought-after Y Combinator accelerator programme, carries about half a dozen selected features each week from The Atlantic, Wired, Foreign Policy, the London Review of Books and Marie Claire. Each tends to take between 20 minutes to an hour to listen to, although there are options for accelerated playback.The appeal of Audm was it solved two problems in one — filling time in the car while also getting to those long-form articles that tend to pile up in my “to read” list on Instapaper. On the six-hour drive between San Francisco and LA, I enjoyed Wired’s tour of the new Apple campus and The Atlantic’s rundown of “how to deal with North Korea”. The latter left me better informed, if not particularly reassured.Another feature of Audm’s iOS app is that the article’s full text scrolls by as the audio plays — admittedly less useful in the car — allowing you to switch between reading and listening modes, or to skip ahead with more context than the regular slide-the-dot-along-the-bar “seek” model.For those with a shorter attention span (or faster commute), Curio.io has a larger collection of newspaper-length stories lasting 10 minutes or less, as well as longer features. Publications providing content include the Guardian, the Idler and Lapham’s Quarterly, as well as the Financial Times. Its app lets users select not just by source but by narrator, time and “vibe”, from “analytical” and “opinionated” to “meditative”. Curio.io also offers an Alexa “skill”, meaning it can be accessed through Amazon’s Echo speakers.These extra listening options, however, could not make up for the fact that — with, ahem, certain exceptions — Curio.io’s content struggles to match Audm’s impressive line-up of publishers.There are some downsides to this “read aloud” model. Compared with podcasts’ radio-style back-and-forth, listening to a single narrator for an hour can get a little monotonous, especially if the original article lacks the narrative flow of an audiobook. It also sounds a little weird in an interview-centric piece not to hear the voice of the interviewees themselves.If you do like the audiobook format, though, it is worth noting that Amazon-owned Audible has recently branched out into podcasts, too. Its roster includes news articles from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, and original audio series such as Butterfly Effect, by Jon Ronson. The Audible Channels service is available as a standalone offering for $5 a month, or as part of the regular $15 monthly audiobook subscription.Ryan Wegner, Audm’s co-founder, says that he plans to move into the more traditional style of podcasts, too — just without those annoying ads.“Our sense is that the winner in this space is going to be the one who has the best bundle, which includes spoken-word articles from top publishers, premium podcasts, etc, for its subscribers,” he says.It took a long time for some online news outlets to migrate to a paywall model and given podcasting’s radio heritage, many hosts may prefer the scale of the free model. But unless the advertising experience for listeners improves, I am rooting for whoever wants to become the Netflix of podcasting.
300;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-14T14:57:49Z;Netflix has nothing to fear from Disney’s Magic Kingdom;The history of TV is not one of quality — the bottom-feeder niche is lucrative;"The news that Disney is pulling out of Netflix to start its own streaming service should surprise no one. For years, the two companies have been infringing on one another’s turf. Disney has accumulated controlling shares in several different streaming technology companies; Netflix now leases more than 45,000 sq m of Los Angeles studio space. Some time this year, the Hollywood legend and the Silicon Valley upstart realised they were wearing the same dress to the party. Now it’s war.Netflix is facing a formidable opponent. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has been a canny buyer of media assets: to his company’s classic properties, he has added Pixar, the Muppets, Marvel Entertainment and, through Lucasfilm, the Star Wars extended universe. From Mickey Mouse, Indiana Jones and Buzz Lightyear to the Lion King, Nemo and Darth Vader, the Disney empire can be summed up in two words: childhood, incorporated.These beloved characters and many others from the Disney realm will now begin to vanish from Netflix and live as hostages behind the Magic Kingdom’s paywall.And yet, after a sharp initial dip, Netflix shares have mostly recovered since the announcement. In fact, Disney shares are down more. And, in my dual professional capacity as a historian of media technology and an American who watches too much television, I think I know why.The current streaming economy might be likened to a fish pond. Standing above the water are the content creators, pitching crumbs. HBO, just under the surface, gets the good stuff, spending big money to option the most promising scripts. Below that are Amazon Prime and Hulu, feasting on network leftovers and middlebrow TV serials. Alone at the bottom, like a catfish, there’s Netflix, rebooting Full House, renewing Ashton Kutcher sitcoms, optioning Girlboss, and sucking up all sorts of other garbage that no one else will touch.At home, with the clicker in hand, Disney’s cherry-picked collection of immortal media assets can’t compete with Netflix’s sprawling mountain of garbageBut guess what? The bottom-feeder niche is a healthy one — that is why there are so many catfish. People love garbage. I love garbage. Scroll deep, if you dare, into the Netflix show gallery, and you will find one of my favourite shows, a half-hour documentary series called Border Security: Canada’s Front Line.The dramatic arc of this show is always the same. A traveller lies on his visa application, then is caught by a stern but exceedingly polite customs official, who delivers, without fail, the following line: “I’m sore-y, sir, but I cannot permit you to enter Canada at this time.” Netflix streams more than 20 episodes of this show, and I’ve watched them all.On Netflix, too, I have seen every episode of Tiny House Hunters, a documentary series in which thrifty couples attempt to save on mortgage costs. Again, every episode is identical. A man drags his wife to see a house the size of a toaster oven, and she purses her lips and delivers the following line: “Um, it’s smaller than I expected.” I could watch this show until the end of time.Netflix is safe. The history of television is not a history of quality, and streaming won’t change that. I suspect Netflix executives figured this out after they spent millions developing a sophisticated crowdsourced rating system, only to learn that their subscribers enjoyed watching one-star shows as much as five-star ones. Of all the major streaming services, they are the only one that knows how to pander.Disney cannot get away with this. It has a reputation to protect. It’ll roll out an impressive line-up of new shows and classic movies, but it will always be a premium service — something you buy in addition to Netflix, not as a replacement. Why? Because it is too proud to stream a day-long binge of Canadian border patrol alongside Fantasia. It won’t let its precious crumbs float down and touch that muck at the bottom of the pond. In the theatre and at the theme park, Disney can bring the magic. But at home, with the clicker in hand, Disney’s cherry-picked collection of immortal media assets can’t compete with Netflix’s sprawling mountain of garbage.Netflix isn’t really in competition with Disney. It’s in competition with the undifferentiated blob of basic cable crap that people say they “never watch”. It has been around the longest and its data set of viewer habits is the deepest. It knows that people don’t desire entertainment, but stupefaction. It knows their subscribers don’t watch TV because the shows are good, or because the characters are compelling. They watch because it’s on.The writer is author of ‘How Music Got Free’"
301;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Facebook Watch fights for eyeballs from YouTube;Social media group draws publishers into producing viral videos for new platform;Publishers from Condé Nast to Hearst are launching shows on Facebook’s new video platform Watch, trying to replicate the success of short, viral videos that were once homemade.Facebook wants to increase engagement on the site by becoming a home for social video, where people exchange views in their communities about shows, using its network as a competitive advantage against YouTube.New shows include Condé Nast’s “Virtually Dating”, where two people go on a blind date in virtual reality, and Tastemade’s “Kitchen Little”, where a child explains a recipe to a chef and “it doesn’t always go as planned”.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive, explained why the company is trying to enter a crowded online video market that stretches from Netflix to Snap.“We believe it’s possible to rethink a lot of experiences through the lens of building community — including watching video,” he said. “Watching a show doesn’t have to be passive. It can be a chance to share an experience and bring people together who care about the same things.”Publishers are eager to experiment on Facebook’s new platform, in the hope it expands their reach to more of the social network’s 2bn users and may even be money making — the company has agreed to share advertising revenue, paying 55 per cent of the proceeds from ad breaks in the videos to the publisher.Troy Young, president of digital at Hearst Magazines, which has pushed into emerging video platforms including Snapchat’s Discover, described the move as “a big shift for the industry and for Facebook” that will help shape a new form of serialised, short-form entertainment.“What’s cool is they’re paying content creators,” he said. “Every publisher has struggled with video. Users want it, advertisers want it, but publishers don’t have tools to monetise it. Facebook is saying ‘we get that, we will pay you a small amount of money to get a series going and share in the upside if it takes off’.”The Watch platform could also help publishers escape the tyranny of the news feed, where users will only happen upon the videos if people share them or if the user regularly consumes content from that page. Now users will be able to add a series to their Watch list, so it is shown consistently.The Atlantic magazine is creating two series for the platform, one on new discoveries in the animal kingdom and another debunking errors taught in US classrooms.“In the Facebook feed, you follow brands,” said Kim Lau, senior vice-president of digital for The Atlantic. “A big difference in Watch is wanting to drive repeat behaviour of users seeking out shows. We’re excited about Watch because it gives us a chance to think about developing content specifically for this use case and specifically for this platform.”Facebook has been expanding the amount of video in the news feed as smartphones and telecoms networks have become able to cope with people watching snippets at the bus stop. With Watch, it hopes to expand even further the amount of time people spend in app and the number of higher priced video ads it can serve them.“There is a massive shift of video consumption towards mobile so I think there’s a huge opportunity to capture share in a rapidly growing market,” said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.But while some expected Facebook to introduce more long-form, premium content, most of what has been announced so far does not appear to compete with Netflix, Amazon or even HBO, he noted.“It feels like much more of a direct attack on YouTube than on Netflix. YouTube has a huge lead with a billion and a half people watching an hour every day so this is no easy task,” Mr Greenfield said.Facebook has been funding some publishers to create original content — but the money it is spending is unlikely to make a huge impact, argued Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. “They need to call us when they get to a billion dollars of annual investment. Then it might be worth paying attention to,” he said.Many large media owners may be able to resist the temptation of striking a deal with Facebook because they can generate more revenue from their own site or from uploading to YouTube, where people watch for longer now that it is available on smart TVs. Disney has just pulled its movies from Netflix to launch its own streaming services.“Facebook just isn’t the only game in town,” he said.
302;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-13T12:42:24Z;Short sellers target high-flying US technology stocks;Investors ramp up bets against Google, Apple, Facebook and Netflix;Investors are ramping up bets against high-flying technology stocks including Google, Apple and Netflix despite short sellers nursing losses of almost $8bn already this year.The S&P 500 technology index suffered a setback last week, but has still climbed more than 21 per cent in 2017, driving this year’s broader stock market rally. The so-called Faang stocks — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google — account for much of those gains.Yet some investors are sceptical the rising valuations can be sustained, and are ratcheting up their shorts — betting on share falls by borrowing shares to sell them and rebuy at a later date — on a host of big names.“A lot of the tech names have led the market all year, and people are getting a little concerned,” said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer of ICMA-RC, a pension fund. “Tech tends to lead the market up, but also down, and it wouldn’t be surprising if we start seeing some weakness.”Tech companies account for half of the 20 most shorted names in the US stock market, with the level of short interest in the “tech 10” rising another $1.4bn in the past month to $41bn, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics company.Google, Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Intel and Facebook are all in S3’s list of the 10 most-shorted US stocks. IBM, Microsoft, Priceline and Nvidia are in the top 20. If electric carmaker Tesla, comfortably the most shorted stock in the US, is counted as a tech company, the short interest would rise to more than $50bn.“We’ve never before seen half-trillion dollar companies growing at these rates, so people are still in disbelief about this,” said Eric Bannasch, founder of Cadian Capital, a tech-focused hedge fund. He points out that many tech companies are growing at a robust clip, but “understands the scepticism” around Tesla in particular.Dan Loeb’s Third Point’s has ditched its stake in Snap, the company that owns messaging app Snapchat, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday. Snap’s shares have dropped about 30 per cent since listing in March.Betting against the tech industry has mostly been painful this year. Despite the losses several big tech stocks suffered last week, S3 estimates that the “mark-to-market” losses on the 10 biggest tech shorts now stand at $7.7bn this year. Tesla alone has inflicted a $4.5bn loss on bearish investors in 2017.Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn is one of the hedge fund managers who has bet against Tesla and a broader number of stocks he has called “the bubble basket”, but admitted this year that “it’s painful for the shorts”.Tesla founder Elon Musk has occasionally taunted short sellers: in April he tweeted “stormy weather in Shortville”, and this summer he said “these guys want us to die so bad they can taste it . . . Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me.”
303;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-11T17:55:56Z;Netflix’s rivals take aim at its stream of success;The online entertainment service has rapidly become a dominant maker of films and TV shows, but established players are hitting back;The trailer for Will Smith’s latest movie looks like a blockbuster-in-waiting for the Hollywood star. Set in a Los Angeles of the future where aliens live alongside humans, Bright has car chases, explosions and witty quips from Smith’s cop character. It also has a big studio budget: the film, which premieres in December, cost a reported $90m to make.Yet Bright will not be released in cinemas. Instead, it will be available only on Netflix, the digital streaming service that is shaking up Hollywood’s hierarchy and television networks by offering on-demand entertainment to subscribers around the world.Netflix is a relatively new buyer of original material but is spending more than $6bn a year on content, regularly outbidding traditional Hollywood studios and TV networks for the most sought-after scripts and ideas. This year its shows won 91 Emmy nominations — second only to HBO, the cable channel that has long dominated the TV awards. It announced this week a first TV foray by film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, a six-part Western. “We are streaming motherfuckers,” the brothers said.The company has emerged as one of the juggernauts of the entertainment industry in a very short period. Netflix started life as a DVD mail service and gradually moved into streaming. By 2012, the year it released its first original series, the Kevin Spacey-starring remake of House of Cards, it had 30m subscribers.Since then expansion around the world and hits such as Orange is the New Black, Narcos and Stranger Things have pushed it past 104m subscribers in more than 190 countries. Describing that tally as a “good start”, the company said recently “some day we hope to entertain everyone”. That growth has propelled its market value to $74bn, more than big media companies such as Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox or Sumner Redstone’s Viacom.It has also given Netflix a place at an elite table beside Facebook, Amazon and Google — the so-called “Fang” technology stocks that have wildly outperformed the rest of the market.Such a rapid rise prompts an inevitable question — can it be sustained? Some of the companies that have traditionally dominated the production and distribution of entertainment are trying to fight back against a company that relies heavily on leverage to fuel its expansion.Walt Disney, the world’s largest media company, announced this week that it will pull movies it has licensed to Netflix in 2019 and put them on a new streaming service that it is developing itself: the titles will include movies from Pixar and Disney’s own animation division, such as upcoming sequels to box office favourites like Frozen and Toy Story.Deep-pocketed rivals, such as Amazon, compete with Netflix for many of the best scripts, stars and programme ideas, which has driven up the cost of buying and making content.Netflix has used debt to finance the production and acquisition of films and series such as the acclaimed The Crown, which cost an estimated £100m. While annual revenues have grown sharply to $8.8bn and the company is profitable, it borrows heavily, which has alarmed some analysts.Their fear is that it will be held back by the high cost of expansion and the need to pay the highest fees for the best content. “The current model is akin to a new restaurant serving the best filet mignon for $10 per steak and watching happy patrons fill every seat,” Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, wrote in a research note. “At some point, the restaurant’s owners, and lenders, will start asking for a return on that investment.”Regardless of Netflix’s long-term prospects there is little doubt the company has played a leading role in a TV revolution that is ushering in a new era of video entertainment. It introduced viewers to “binge-watching”, whereby entire series can be watched at once or in succession, rather than having to wait for episodes to be screened at an allotted time. “It has also permanently altered people’s desire to watch advertising,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, pointing out that, unlike most commercial TV, Netflix programming is ad-free.Its rise in popularity in the US has coincided with the emergence of “cord-cutting” — the cancellation of subscriptions to cable and satellite services after decades of soaring growth. Consumers, Mr Greenfield says, are turning away from large bundles of channels that they rarely watch in favour of on-demand, digital viewing.“Netflix has changed people’s desire to watch linear TV,” he adds, referring to traditional broadcast or cable TV where viewers tend to tune in at particular times. “And it has killed the concept of channel brands.” Viewers, he says, “no longer know or care” which channel their programmes come from after “decades of broadcast and cable networks trying to build brands”.Top stars have embraced streaming, largely because Netflix has been so willing to pay more than traditional broadcasters or movie studios.Comedian Dave Chappelle was paid a reported $60m for recording two stand-up comedy concerts for the streaming service while actor Adam Sandler is on course to earn $80m for four lowbrow comedy films he starred in and produced for Netflix (the three released so far have been panned but are among the company’s most popular titles).This week it bought Millarworld, the Scottish comic book publisher behind Kingsman, Kick-Ass and Wanted, all of which eventually became big budget films.It is unclear how much Will Smith will be paid for Bright but he and the film’s director, David Ayer, who made Suicide Squad for Warner Brothers, praised Netflix’s hands-off approach, which Smith suggested was a contrast to other studios. “I’m sure this will end soon, but they just give you the money and say, ‘go make a movie’,” he told an audience at Comic-Con in San Diego last month.Not all of Hollywood is on board with the company’s approach to producing and distributing movies. Unlike Amazon, which made this year’s Oscar nominated Manchester by the Sea, Netflix does not release its movies on hundreds of cinema screens, preferring instead to debut its titles on its streaming service — and keep them there. For some actors and directors, this is unacceptable. “If you make a theatrical film, it’s to be played in theatres,” Christopher Nolan, the director of Dunkirk, said recently.Still, judging by the Oscar nominations garnered by its documentaries, such as Ava DuVernay’s 13th, and the recent round of Emmy nominations, Netflix has established itself as a critical force. “Netflix has proven to talent that you don’t have to be on legacy TV to create great content,” says Mr Greenfield.Yet fears persist that Netflix’s debt splurge could become problematic — particularly if subscriber growth slows unexpectedly or its borrowing costs substantially rise. Netflix says it could trim content spending if it needs to and that it is relaxed about how much it spends — so much so that Reed Hastings, its chief executive, recently said its borrowing levels pointed to positive future performance.“The irony is the faster that we grow and the faster we grow the owned [original productions], the more drawn on free cash flow that we’ll be,” he said on the company’s recent earnings call. “So in some senses, negative free cash flow will be an indicator of enormous success.” Not everyone is convinced.“Netflix is an amazing consumer product,” Mr Nathanson says. “As a business model we think the jury is still out.”Now Disney has Netflix in its sights. The owner of characters from Mickey Mouse to Han Solo once considered a bid for Netflix with the aim of plugging its films and TV programming into the company’s digital network. But it did not make an offer and the private view within Disney is that it missed its moment: Netflix has become too expensive.Disney’s plans for its own streaming services and its decision to pull its animated movies from Netflix had only a muted impact on the company: Netflix shares fell this week but rallied after the Disney announcement. This may be because Netflix has survived the loss of what looked like must-have content in the past, moving away from licensing film and TV programming to producing and owning its own.“They have built up so much of their own content that it has mitigated their risk,” says Mr Greenfield. As for the cash it is burning through, if Netflix was not choosing to expand internationally, “they would be making more money”.“By the end of 2019 we think Netflix will have 158m subscribers and Disney will be starting from scratch,” he adds. “Netflix knew Disney had to [launch its own service] at some point but its lead is insurmountable.”Yet there are plenty of threats for Netflix in what has become a crowded streaming market. Few companies have more resources than Amazon, which competes with Netflix around the world, while CBS, the US broadcast network, revealed this week that its streaming service had hit 4m subscribers three years ahead of schedule. HBO’s digital service is also expanding — and if, as expected, regulators approve the sale of its parent company, Time Warner, to telecoms group AT&T this year, HBO is likely to have more financial firepower.Despite the challenges, the company that started the streaming revolution continues growing. But there is a target on its back — and it is getting bigger.
304;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-11T15:36:51Z;Marvel’s The Defenders, Netflix — stylishly shot;Four superheroes from previous series converge to form a supergroup;"Bulletproof Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is recently out of jail and already do-gooding in his Harlem hood; sourpuss PI Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is drinking hard and wondering whether to take on a boring missing persons case; “Iron Fist” Danny Rand (Finn Jones) is newly back from Cambodia with sidekick Colleen; and blind Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) is working as a pro-bono prosecutor and trying to forget the devil suit in his attic. After four previous series, one each, this is the moment they all converge to form a supergroup in Marvel’s The Defenders (from Friday, Netflix). But fans will have to wait a while for that to happen.With four stories to follow, the action is diffuse. Jones realises the case of missing architect John Raymond is more interesting and hazardous than she’d anticipated, while Cage is on the trail of a man in a white suit recruiting young black men who are later found dead. Only Danny Rand puts the disparate pieces together to form a vast conspiracy.The big draw here is Sigourney Weaver, revelling in the role of chief naughty lady as the immaculately dressed and enigmatic Alexandra. If you’ve waited an aeon to see her wrestle something wet and slippery, your day has come. Alexandra was last in Istanbul when it was called Constantinople; that tedious film trope of the character who suddenly reveals an unlikely ability to speak fluent Japanese, Russian or Turkish at least makes sense if they’ve had centuries to learn. But when Rand starts chatting in Chinese, it’s just annoying.The notion of the billionaire superhero is interrogated in line with contemporary pieties, when Cage delivers a stinging lecture to pouting Rand on being born into privilege. Superheroes are a downbeat lot nowadays.It’s all stylishly shot, although you want to shout “put the lights on!” in every interior scene. The main problem is the hackneyed dialogue. “I’ll be back. You won’t like me then!” Riposte: “I don’t like you now.” As soon as you see a polished boardroom table, you know someone will soon be thrown along it. And why, in martial arts training montages, are there always so many fighters eager to be sliced up, one after another?★★★☆☆"
305;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-11T11:06:14Z;Scottish comic book king achieves superhero status with Netflix deal;Mark Millar expected to provide global movie hits for video service;Mild-mannered university dropout from deprived Scottish town conquers America — add the ability to fly and some theatrical violence and it would make one of the superhero stories that are comic book writer Mark Millar’s stock-in-trade.Netflix’s purchase this week of Mr Millar’s publishing business Millarworld — the streaming video company’s first-ever acquisition — has crowned the remarkable career of the Glasgow-based author who hails from the nearby former industrial town of Coatbridge. The deal was prompted by Mr Millar’s success in developing his own comic franchises, after previously revitalising existing superheroes such as Marvel Entertainment’s Avengers, who have since become some of Hollywood’s hottest properties.The creativity that resulted in Kick-Ass, Kingsman and Wanted — three Millarworld comics already turned into major films — was apparent from an early age, recalls Kevin O’Brien, an English teacher at his Coatbridge high school. “Some people would have said: ‘That’s not real literature’, but I would say that all literature is good and the more you read the better you get at it,” says Mr O’Brien, who allowed his pupil to submit comic scripts instead of standard prose. The teacher says that even when Mr Millar borrowed a story from classic British comic 2000AD for a piece of homework writing, he did so with “his own take on it”. Few would have bet on the young comic fan from strongly Catholic and working class Coatbridge to make an international mark. Mr Millar’s mother, a cleaner, died when he was 14. Mr Millar dropped out of Glasgow university after his father, a labourer, passed away four years later. But a willingness to bring fresh ideas to characters and stories, originally created by others, was to serve Mr Millar well.He began work as a writer for 2000AD in his teens, but his biggest break came at 30, when he was asked by US powerhouse DC Comics to take on an existing comic, The Authority. Sales soared and Mr Millar was headhunted by Marvel. John McShane, a Glasgow comic book editor and historian who published one of Mr Millar’s early works, says he is able to find a fresh angle on an established superhero. In Superman: Red Son, for example, he wrote a graphic novel based on the idea that the infant superman landed from space in Ukraine rather than Kansas.Though some of his most famous works feature extreme violence and strong language, Mr Millar likes to explore moral and political themes, Mr McShane says.“Mark’s still very Catholic in his outlook,” he says, citing works such as American Jesus and Marvel’s Civil War, which saw superheroes come into conflict with each other and bore the strapline: Whose Side Are You On?Civil War became a major source for the film Captain America: Civil War, which sold more than $1bn in cinema tickets worldwide. And Mr Millar’s knack for thinking in both print and cinematic terms is illustrated by his unauthorised use of the features of US film star Samuel L Jackson for a previously white Avengers character. In one episode, the character even insists that only Mr Jackson could play him in a movie. The real life Mr Jackson contacted the studio to express interest — and got the job.Mr Millar says seeing his work turned into a movie remains a huge thrill. “It’s the closest thing a man can get to giving birth to a baby,” he says, in an exhibition of collaborator and noted comic artist Frank Quitely’s work showing at Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Art Gallery. But Mr Millar’s desire for ownership led him to set up Millarworld, a comic book company in which writers and artists share creation rights, nearly 15 years ago. “This was a chance to control the characters created and reap the rewards from any future movies, TV or merchandise that ever came from those characters and books,” he said this week. Millarworld has cemented Glasgow’s place as a comics powerhouse, a source of pride in the city. Mr McShane says it can claim to have produced the first comic magazine, The Looking Glass, in 1825, with such classic features as word balloons and “To be continued…” signoffs. Netflix will now be hoping that Mr Millar’s winning streak can continue, particularly after Walt Disney, which owns Marvel Entertainment, announced it would stop providing content to the streaming company and launch its own services instead. Millarworld must also hope that the audience’s appetite for superhero exploits remains undimmed. Mr Millar, who has joked that his autobiography will be entitled Genius, is untroubled. “This is going to be brilliant,” he says.
306;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-10T18:33:46Z;Disney and rivals risk turning off subscribers to new TV world;Viewers face fatigue as media companies break up and stream their content;Bundle, unbundle, rebundle.That cycle repeats itself endlessly in the media world, as new technologies pick apart existing products and services, while giving an opening for newcomers to repackage material in ways that make it easier to buy and consume.The only question during a period of transition is who the next dominant bundlers are, and how successfully others can navigate the churn.If anyone can handle the cross currents, it should be Walt Disney. No other company has the range of entertainment brands to leverage, and the depth of experience and partnerships across the industry. So when Disney acts, it is not surprising that it sends reverberations across the landscape.On the face of it, this week’s news that it is planning to launch two streaming services of its own in 2019 looks like a radical shift.Taking its movies off Netflix, and making the ESPN sports network available beyond existing pay TV bundles, are direct-to-consumer plays that put Disney in opposition to both old aggregators (the cable TV companies) and new (Netflix).But it is worth keeping things in perspective. This looks like a classic defensive hedge, positioning Disney in case of more rapid deterioration in one media bundle (pay TV subscriptions) and giving it an alternative to the next dominant aggregators.Disney is treading carefully. Much of ESPN may be escaping the bounds of pay TV, but not its crown jewels in the US: the NFL and NBA. And the streaming movie service it is planning will not include Marvel or Star Wars. Disney is quite capable of playing this game from both sides at once: Marvel’s successful co-production deal with Netflix shows both have much to gain from future co-operation.All of this helps to explain why this week’s move, though seismic, has had only modest impact on Netflix’s stock price. It has navigated the first two stages of growth: first building a massive audience on the back of other companies’ content libraries, then becoming a successful producer in its own right.The next challenge is to maintain its lead, at a time when many more subscription video bundles are on offer.Though talk of “subscription fatigue” is common, it is important to distinguish between three types.One stems from being required to pay a monthly subscription for something you once bought only once. This is the kind of fatigue many customers of the software industry are facing, as paying for a licence gives way to cloud services. Parents of young children will know the feeling: where they could once occupy their offspring cheaply by playing the same DVD of The Lion King many times over, they are one day likely to be paying for monthly access.A second type of fatigue comes from the tendency of subscription businesses to keep raising the price. The formula, as perfected by cable TV companies: add more to the bundle to justify raising the price, until customers balk. Then offer a discount — before raising the price again.The average monthly cable bill in the US is now over $100, up from around $71 at the start of the decade. This is often listed as a source of customer anguish. But it is also a hugely positive sign for the industry, showing that people have been willing to allocate a larger share of their disposable income to entertainment.The third type of fatigue is caused by managing too many different subscriptions. It is not just that paying a la carte risks costing customers more. The job of selecting the services to subscribe to, and switching each time more attractive shows appear, is a time-consuming headache.This is also a problem for the entertainment companies, forcing them into much higher spending on customer acquisition and creating churn. That, of course, is one of the main reasons why rebundling inevitably follows.Deeper disruption may still come from elsewhere, of course. Outsiders with different business models play by different rules. They include Amazon, which bundles video with its Prime service to support ecommerce, and Facebook, which is about to experiment with a new short-form video service called Watch to capitalise on the largest audience of all.But that is a different story. As long as couch potatoes remain happy to pay up for movies and TV shows, companies such as Netflix and Disney have much to gain from the combination of co-operation and rivalry that will shape the post-TV world.richard.waters@ft.com
307;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-09T19:03:46Z;Netflix down, but not out, after Disney announces pullout plans;;Netflix shares fell to a three-week low of $170.01 on Wednesday after Walt Disney said it would not renew its content deal with the online video streaming company and announced plans to launch its own services.However, analysts have been largely sanguine over Disney’s surprise move, with many saying it is unlikely to have much of an impact on Netflix’s subscriber growth.Morgan Stanley, which has a $210 price target on Netflix, noted that the company has been aggressively building up its own backlog of original contents for years now with hits like Orange is the New Black and Ozarks. It took another step in reducing its reliance on licensing characters and franchises from third parties this week with the acquisition of comic book publisher Millarworld.While Millarworld’s roster of titles – such as Kick-Ass and Kingsman – might not be household names in the same way Disney’s X-Men or Star Wars franchises are, Netflix has proved itself adept at leveraging its production know-how and transforming lesser known titles into successful films and TV series.“Netflix may be losing content from its most important supplier in Disney, but its strategy to pivot to originals, build its own global content brand, and vertically integrate into self production mitigate this loss,” said Morgan Stanley.The view was echoed by Todd Juenger over at Bernstein Research, who argued that the Disney disappointment is more than offset by news that David Letterman, the former CBS Late Show host is returning to television with a new Netflix series.“Losing Disney movie output doesn’t necessarily have any visible impact on subscriber growth, as long as the entirety of the service is a good value proposition to consumers,” he said.“As of now, the only content Disney is pulling from Netflix is the US rights to future theatrical output from the Disney and Pixar studios, beginning in calendar 2019… This only affects Netflix in the US, whereas the vast majority of Netflix sub growth, both near term and long term, is international.”Netflix shares fell as much as 4.7 per cent on Tuesday, before paring their losses to trade 2.3 per cent lower at $174.27. The stock is still up more than 40 per cent so far this year and hit a record high of $191.50 a share last month.
308;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-09T14:30:36Z;Disney takes on Netflix with streaming services;"Internet rival will lose new Disney films from 2019; ESPN web channel also planned";Walt Disney has taken a big step towards blowing up the traditional “bundle” of channels sold by cable and satellite operators and taken sharp aim at Netflix, with plans to launch a pair of streaming services that would deliver its films and sports programming direct to consumers.The launch of two “over the top” services, which are planned for 2019, are a clear response from the world’s largest media company to the digital disruption that has upended the traditional television hierarchy.Cable and satellite viewers are continuing to “cut the cord”, cancelling pricey subscriptions in favour of cheaper, online alternatives. The subsequent declines in viewership of traditional cable television have hit network advertising revenues and sparked consolidation across the media sector, even as cable providers launch so-called skinny bundles of channels that are cheaper than a traditional multichannel subscription.Content groups are combining in response to the shift. Discovery Communications, the owner of channels such as Eurosport, TLC and Animal Planet, is buying Scripps Networks, owner of the Food Network, for $14.6bn, with the aim of having more heft in negotiations with distributors. Digital disruption was also a big factor in the proposed acquisition of Time Warner, the owner of HBO and Warner Brothers, by US telecoms company AT&T. The $85.4bn bid is being scrutinised by regulators.Disney, which in the past has been linked with a bid for Netflix, has persisted with the traditional cable and satellite model in recent years, but this week unveiled what Bob Iger, its chief executive, called a “major strategic shift” in how it would distribute its content.“It’s been clear to us for a while that the future of this industry will be forged by direct relationships between content creators and consumers,” Mr Iger told analysts. “When you have a strong fan base like Disney has, or ESPN, that creates all forms of other opportunities in terms of tapping into customer passion for the brand and connection to the customer.”The company is not abandoning traditional television distribution. Yet its plans for two new streaming services had an immediate impact on Netflix shares, which fell as much as 7 per cent in after-market trading on Tuesday.Netflix has built a global streaming business with 100m subscribers and a $75bn market capitalisation that has eclipsed traditional media groups, such as Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. Its growth has coincided with subscriber and viewership declines in traditional television.“Removing Disney content will be a setback for Netflix,” commented Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at CCS Insight. “ If anything, this places more importance on Netflix’s own investment in original content and puts into context Netflix’s recent acquisition of comics publisher Millarworld.”“Disney’s decision to shift its distribution strategy towards a direct to consumer model leans into the accelerating shifts in video consumption,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research note, adding that the company was “laying the groundwork for a stronger future”.Its new strategy will give Disney full control over how it distributes some of its biggest brands in the age of streaming video. Instead of offering new movie releases on Netflix, from 2019, Disney and Pixar films will be available online only on Disney’s own streaming service.Subscribers to Disney’s new entertainment streaming service will be able to watch animated and live-action films, including the forthcoming sequel to the hit Frozen, Toy Story 4 and a live-action version of The Lion King. Disney will also invest in original films, TV series and short-form video exclusively for the service, which will launch in the US before expanding to other countries.The new service will not include Marvel superhero films or Lucasfilm’s Star Wars franchise. Mr Iger said the company was weighing whether to create standalone services for those brands, include them in other offerings or continue licensing them to platforms such as Netflix.The decision to take ESPN outside the cable bundle is a big change for the network that generates most of Disney’s profits. Live sport was long thought to be a firewall against cord-cutting and analysts have closely monitored ESPN as a proxy for the health of the broader TV industry.But in the past two years, ESPN has come under intense pressure, with consumers balking at the cost of a cable subscription. The network has lost 12m subscribers since hitting a 100m peak in 2011. In April, Disney cut about 100 jobs at ESPN.The aggressive push into digital video has been made possible by Disney’s move to acquire majority ownership of BAMTech, a video technology group it first invested in last year. The company is paying $1.58bn to increase its stake from 33 per cent to 75 per cent. MLB Advanced Media, the digital arm of Major League Baseball, and the National Hockey League will continue to be minority owners.“This move gives us immediate access to the team and the technology we need to deliver the highest quality direct-to-consumer experience, which ultimately gives us much greater control of our own destiny in a rapidly changing market,” Mr Iger said.Media companies have been testing the digital waters for some time. In 2015, Disney launched a streaming service in the UK that bundled its books, music and movies. On Monday, CBS, the US broadcaster, unveiled plans to take its All Access internet TV offering to international markets and to introduce an online sports channel.Analysts cautioned that Disney’s move to sell its content direct to consumers was not without risk. Plans to launch an ESPN service were a “response to a business under pressure”, Cowen analysts wrote in a note.But the second service it has planned, which will bring together Pixar and Disney movies with original Disney television programming, “is taking a very successful and settled part of the business model . . . and putting it at risk in the hopes of building an asset with more long-term value”, they warned.With its plans to launch a pair of “over the top” streaming services, Walt Disney is gatecrashing a market that is increasingly cluttered with products from rival companies.Whereas consumers once watched television for free or paid a monthly subscription for a bundle of channels, the proliferation of streaming services has created a crowded and increasingly competitive market.The largest and most popular operators have scale of distribution and enough compelling programming to convince consumers to subscribe for a monthly fee. Netflix and Amazon are the biggest players on the global stage, with Netflix spending $6bn a year on producing its own content. Amazon is investing comparable amounts: its service, which has produced critical hits such as Transparent and this year’s Best Actor and Original Screenplay winner at the Oscars, Manchester by the Sea, is bundled with its Prime delivery service.Rivals, such as Time Warner’s HBO, have taken a hybrid approach, launching a direct to consumer offering aimed at “cord-cutters”, while signing new deals with distributorsThe battle is raging most fiercely in the US, where Hulu, which is owned by media companies that include Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and Disney, is competing with Netflix, HBO and Amazon — as well as traditional channels such as FX and AMC — for the best scripts and projects. Hulu recently scored a critical hit with The Handmaid’s Tale, an adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s book.YouTube is also vying for consumer attention with Red, its own subscription service. Its latest project is a TV series based on the Karate Kid films featuring some of the original cast.
309;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-09T01:18:05Z;Disney: skinny profits;The media company should be able to grab share in spite of Netflix;Netflix has proved that a thrusting media upstart can reach real scale distributing video content online. Walt Disney is going to try the tricky feat of disrupting its own business in the same manner.The “major strategic shift” of distributing content directly to consumers looks late. Having defended cable television distribution for years, while spurning non-cable arrivistes such as Sling, Disney’s TV business is obviously suffering as households ditch their bloated expensive packages in favour of so-called “skinny bundles”.ESPN, the flagship sports network, once again came up short against expectations when Disney reported second-quarter results on Tuesday evening.Netflix has already captured almost half of US households and boasts strong retention. However, there is life in the old mouse yet, as shown by the 3 per cent fall in Netflix’s share price following Disney’s announcement of a direct-to-consumer customisable sports package and a cartoon channel, which will be the exclusive home for films such as upcoming sequels to Toy Story and Frozen.Netflix has planned for this. It sucked up other companies’ content to fuel its growth and then pivoted to making its own shows to avoid disaster if supplies from outside were cut off. Moreover, it might be doubtful that customers will sign up to additional video services, when 52m US households already shell out for Netflix and even more are estimated to have access to Amazon’s TV service via its Prime programme.Yet recent evidence suggests they will. CBS said this week that it would soon have more than 4m subscribers for its direct-to-consumer service, ahead of target on a 2020 goal of 8m. Lions Gate said on Tuesday that it had 2m direct subscribers to its Starz channel, again ahead of expectations. With its own compelling content, Disney should easily dwarf those numbers.This level of competition suggests a confusing world for consumers and a low-margin one for the streaming services. That is uncomfortable for Disney, which indicated it would be opting for cheap pricing to grab scale.

310;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-08T20:36:41Z;Disney makes a big move into online video with plans for sports, film services;;Walt Disney will launch a standalone ESPN sports streaming subscription next year and a separate video service for its films in 2019, neither of which will require a pay-television subscription.The aggressive move into online video comes as the US entertainment company will pay $1.58bn to acquire majority ownership of BAMTech, a video technology group it first invested in last year.It also marks the end of Disney’s relationship with Netflix: the company said it would end its distribution agreement with the internet video service for streaming of new releases in 2019, and Disney chief executive Bob Iger confirmed in an interview with CNBC that the company intends to pull all of its movies from Netflix.“The media landscape is increasingly defined by direct relationships between content creators and consumers, and our control of BAMTech’s full array of innovative technology will give us the power to forge those connections, along with the flexibility to quickly adapt to shifts in the market,” said Mr Iger.“This acquisition and the launch of our direct-to-consumer services mark an entirely new growth strategy for the company, one that takes advantage of the incredible opportunity that changing technology provides us to leverage the strength of our great brands.”Netflix shares fell more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement.The moves came as Disney reported a 9 per cent drop in profit in its fiscal third quarter, due to higher programming costs and fewer subscribers at ESPN, its cable sports network, and lower box office receipts for its films.Shares fell 2.8 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.Revenue in the three months ending in June dipped slightly to $14.24bn from $14.28bn a year ago.Net income dropped to $2.37bn, or $1.51 a share, from $2.6bn, or $1.59 a share.Analysts expected earnings of $1.55 a share on revenue of $14.4bn, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.At Disney’s television networks, its largest division, revenue fell 1 per cent to $5.87bn and operating income sank 22 per cent to $1.84bn, dragged by the decline at ESPN.Analysts have been closely watching ESPN as a proxy for the health of the broader television industry. ESPN generates most of Disney’s profits, but it has come under pressure as consumers drop pricey pay-TV subscriptions in favour of digital streaming services and “skinny bundles” of fewer channels delivered over the internet. In April, the company cut about 100 jobs at the network.At the movie studio, revenue fell 16 per cent to $2.39bn, and operating income was down 17 per cent at $639m.Disney’s theme parks and resorts were a bright spot, thanks to increases in Shanghai and Paris. Revenue rose 12 per cent to $4.89bn and operating income was up 18 per cent to $1.17bn.
311;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-07T16:31:02Z;Netflix adds to its muscle with deal for new cast of superheroes;Streaming company acquires Millarworld, Scottish publisher behind Kick-Ass and Kingsman;"Netflix plans to beef up its original content with a new cast of superheroes after buying Scottish comic book publisher Millarworld, the streaming video company’s first acquisition in its 20-year history.Millarworld, the company behind the comics Kingsman, Kick-Ass and Wanted — all of which have become big budget films — has agreed to be bought by Netflix for an undisclosed sum.The deal comes as Netflix ploughs money into its own content to attract more subscribers around the world. Existing and new Millarworld characters and storylines will be used to make films, TV series and children’s shows exclusively for Netflix.In snapping up a comic book publisher, Netflix is following a well-worn Hollywood path. In 2009, Walt Disney bought Marvel Entertainment, whose characters include Spider-Man and the X-Men, for $4bn, while rival DC Comics, home of Superman and Batman, is owned by Time Warner’s Warner Bros film studio.“This is only the third time in history a major comic book company has been purchased at this level,"" said Mark Millar, Millarworld founder. “I’m so in love with what Netflix is doing and excited by their plans. Netflix is the future and Millarworld couldn’t have a better home.”The purchase of Millarworld does not include two of its best-known franchises, Kingsman and Kick-Ass, both of which have deals with other studios.Before founding his own company, Mr Millar spent eight years at Marvel where he worked on storylines that inspired the films The Avengers, Captain America: Civil War, and Logan.“Mark is as close as you can get to a modern day Stan Lee,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer, a reference to the creator of Marvel characters including Spider-Man, the Hulk, and Iron Man.Netflix’s investment in original content is ballooning as the company faces competition from rivals including Amazon and expands rapidly around the world.Last month it passed 100m subscribers globally and is ramping up spending on local content and production studios in Europe. It has earmarked $6bn to spend on content this year alone. Morgan Stanley calculates that Netflix’s $11bn worth of net content assets as of the end of last year are worth more than the net book value for established broadcasters Viacom, Discovery, AMC Networks and Scripps combined.The company argues that owning intellectual property, rather than licensing it, benefits the company over the long term. While warning that the high upfront costs of creating original programming will lead to up to $2.5bn in free cash outflows this year, Reed Hastings, chief executive, told analysts last month that negative free cash flow is “an indicator of enormous success” for Netflix."
312;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-04T10:10:42Z;Jason Bateman on Trump, Hollywood and his dark Netflix hit ‘Ozark’;The ‘Arrested Development’ star talks to Shannon Bond in New York;"Jason Bateman is not afraid of biting off more than he can chew. The actor is crunching on a mouthful of Pennsylvania Dutch-style hard pretzels and it’s hard to understand what he’s saying. He shakes the bag of salty snacks in my direction, gesturing for me to try one. Around my own mouthful of pretzel, I ask what drove him to take on so much in his latest project. Bateman is not only the star and executive producer of the new Netflix crime drama Ozark, he also directed four of its 10 episodes.It was “the challenge of directing a 600-page movie — basically, directing five movies at once,” he says. In fact Bateman’s original plan was to direct the entire TV series, until he got some timely advice. “I had a really quick conversation with Cary Fukunaga at a party about how he was able to direct all eight episodes of [the first season of] True Detective”, the HBO drama. “He said, ‘Don’t.’“That helped me throttle back a bit,” Bateman says. In his navy T-shirt, trim-fitting jeans and blue Golden Goose trainers, he is relaxed, but with an underlying energy, perching on the edge of a coffee table in a light-filled New York hotel room. He ended up directing the first two episodes of the show and the final two. “It just felt like a great workout, it was really challenging but you could see progress right away.”Ozark is dark in both its colour palette — murky blues and greys — and its subject matter. Bateman plays Marty Byrde, a Chicago financial planner who launders money for a Mexican drug cartel. After his partners are caught skimming and murdered, Marty relocates his family to the Lake of the Ozarks in rural Missouri, where he has three months to wash $8m for the cartel, or be killed along with his wife and two kids.In concept and execution Ozark is not unfamiliar: an anti-hero struggling to stay one step ahead of the consequences of his increasingly ill-judged actions. Think Breaking Bad meets Bloodline. The performances rise above the material, however.Critics have singled out for praise Laura Linney’s turn as Wendy, Marty’s frustrated, unhappy wife as well as Bateman’s simmering portrayal of Marty’s escalating desperation as he juggles family drama, federal agents and local criminals who are not keen on him invading their turf.“I wasn’t looking for something that was unsettling, but I am super attracted to those things, just as a viewer,” he says. The role — and his directorial success — is only the latest phase of a nearly four-decade long career that has been marked by reversal and revival.Bateman may not have been born in Hollywood, but he spent most of his childhood and his whole adult life in the entertainment industry. Born in Rye, New York, to a “writer-director-producer” father and a Pan Am flight-attendant mother, he moved around the country with his parents and older sister, the actor Justine Bateman, before settling in Los Angeles.“My dad would take me to the movie theatre instead of the park,” Bateman smiles wryly at the memory. “He would tell me what’s good acting and what’s bad acting and why, and what’s good directing, what’s bad directing and why. So [directing] was always on my radar from the age of 10 when I started acting. I would watch on the set. I would watch this process of creating fake life, what it takes to do the magic trick.”Bateman was 12 when he made his TV debut in the 1981 drama Little House on the Prairie, in which he played an orphan adopted by the Ingalls family. Teen heart-throb status would arrive later in the decade, when he starred in the sitcoms Silver Spoons, It’s Your Move and The Hogan Family and in the box office flop Teen Wolf Too. But, like many a child actor, his star faded as he entered his twenties. He spent more time partying than working: his filmography from the 1990s is studded with made-for-TV movies and short-lived series.Things changed in 2003 when he starred in Arrested Development, the much-loved Fox comedy that had low viewing figures when it first aired but went on to become a cult hit. As Michael Bluth, the ostensibly least crazy member of a family of narcissists, Bateman found the role that has defined his adult acting career and won him a Golden Globe. He was the long-suffering straight man surrounded by clowns, the viewer stand-in who telegraphs his deadpan reactions with the understated twitch of an eyelid.“I like to play somebody who is very easily relatable and tangible to the audience, somebody who could really actually be them. I’m the proxy,” he says. Bateman has reprised versions of this brown-haired, blue-eyed everyman persona ever since: in a slew of middling films including Horrible Bosses, Horrible Bosses 2, The Switch, alongside Jennifer Aniston, Identity Thief, co-starring Melissa McCarthy, and, in a resurgence of the role that inspired them all, in Netflix’s re-commissioning of Arrested Development.Now he is parlaying his repolished Hollywood star into creative control. Over the past few years, the 48-year-old has been steadily mapping out a new character arc. He has taken on darker and more serious roles, and directed (and starred in) two movies: Bad Words, about a spelling bee, and The Family Fang, a black comedy with Nicole Kidman.Ozark is both the continuation of this strategy, and a step change in the trajectory of Bateman’s career. The gritty drama is a hard break from the comedy that has been the actor’s bread and butter. More significantly for his own aspirations, it is a project he owns. “What attracts me about directing is that you’re shaping the audience’s experience, you’re shaping every part of it. You’re controlling what they’re seeing, what they’re hearing, what they’re feeling. As an actor that’s a limited or smaller lane of influence,” he says.When Ozark came around, Bateman was not looking for a new TV series. “[My agent] said that he read two of the best scripts he’s ever read in his life, the first two episodes of this series . . . I said, we’re not looking for a series, we’re looking for the third film to direct. Because I really had the time of my life directing these first two movies, and we were looking for something that would be an escalation in challenge and scope.”But his agent pressed him to read the scripts, written by Bill Dubuque, who wrote the Ben Affleck film The Accountant. For Bateman, Marty Byrde, a character trying to hold things together in a sea of chaos, was familiar territory. “He’s very close to the character that I like to play. But what was different about this one is that he’s doing that from kind of a dramatic place . . . He’s the smarter, craftier everyman — or the guy who thinks he’s smart enough or crafty enough. In that hubris lies this opportunity for some nice, unpredictable dramatic moments, when he’s just not smart enough to get out of it, or he’s arrogant enough to make a bad decision and overplay his hand.”At this point, we’re interrupted by a knock at the door — room service has come to deliver lunch. Bateman makes a point of making firm eye contact and thanking the staffer who has come to deliver it. His publicist will later tell him he has just two minutes to eat it before his next engagement. As we resume our chat, I say I have to ask about Donald Trump. Six months into this unprecedented presidency, it is virtually impossible not to see any work of art or fiction through the fractured lens of politics, especially when you’re in a swanky hotel in Manhattan’s trendy Tribeca neighbourhood — the epitome of liberal America.Ozark was filmed primarily in Atlanta, but shot for a week on location in the Ozarks, deep in Trump-supporting territory. The president won each of the four counties surrounding the Lake of the Ozarks by more than 75 per cent in November’s election. “It’s a really mysterious place, because it’s populated with a very colourful, quiet yet proud group of people that can be offputting, because there’s kind of a dangerous indifference to a lot of people down there,” Bateman says. “They’re comfortable, they’re happy down there, and there’s no real need for them to adjust or pivot to anybody else’s agenda.”Does the show tell us something about the state of this country? “I think so,” he nods. “The middle of the country has to be reckoned with. They’re the majority in so far as they got this guy elected. Perhaps people on both coasts might come out a little bit more in earnest next time and exercise what might be the majority — at least it was in the popular vote . . . But they can’t be ignored, they can’t be belittled . . . They just do things differently and different things are important to them. There’s got to be a way to braid the two things together.”He compares the lessons learnt by Ozark’s protagonist with those that challenged Hillary Clinton. “Marty Byrde is trying to figure out what that balance is. He can’t come in and big-city all these people. Hillary can’t just roll in and expect to get votes because she’s sane and he’s crazy. He’s not crazy in their eyes, and Marty Byrde doesn’t have the great plan and the fix-all for everything in their eyes. They’re fine with the way they do things and he’s got to learn to adapt or get the hell out and risk having his family killed. So he’s got to pivot. I think the coastal elites have to figure out how to do that as well. I think the Democrats in Congress have to do that, and the Republicans are seeing right now that they’ve got to do some of that as well, and you can’t sit on opposite sides of the street and expect to have anything happen.”The Trump era has also brought new resonance to Bateman’s best-known hit. Arrested Development’s three seasons on Fox, where it ran from 2003 to 2006, and a 15-episode run on Netflix in 2013, chronicle the lives of the dysfunctional Bluths, a wealthy family in the real-estate business that cosies up to autocrats, tries to build a wall between the US and Mexico, and dabbles in “light treason”. This month, the cast is reuniting to film another season, which will hit Netflix in 2018. “We’re all so grateful, so thankful to that show for doing for our careers what it did do — that to go back and do more of it is just an easy yes,” Bateman says.“It’ll be so simple in comparison [with Ozark]. It’ll be a vacation. We all love each other so much and we make each other laugh 24 hours a day. The workload is pretty light because it’s an ensemble, so you’re only talking a couple of times each page. And you’re working in LA, which is a real luxury,” he says, noting he will be close to the home he shares with his wife, Amanda Anka, and their two young daughters.If Arrested Development rekindled Bateman’s career, it is Netflix that is powering his next chapter. The streaming video service, along with Amazon, is reshaping the way Hollywood makes TV and movies, ploughing billions of dollars into content that may never appear on traditional television or cinema screens. Bateman says the changes wrought by digital disruptors both “help and hurt” the industry.“You’re not obligated to put 12 million people in the tent. You can have a successful show and only have three or four million people see it. That by definition allows you to be much more specific with your content and, as a result, have that content be better. You’re not having to round the edges and be safer in the way in which you kill that character or do that love scene or have that difficult monologue where it gets to somebody’s soul. Things can spike a bit.”On the other hand, he says, the explosion of content means some projects will suffer. “The negative side is that the talent pool for writers and directors and actors has been thinned out so much because there are so many jobs out there.”Netflix is famously tight-lipped about viewer figures for its shows. How much do they tell the people who make them? “Nothing. But it’s good,” he replies. “You hope it’s all in the merits that you get picked up or not. They’re not an advertising-based platform so as long as a certain number of people are watching, they can equate that to retention, and that’s the name of the game for them . . . It’s a simpler formula, I think, as opposed to just creating a spectacle, such that a bunch of eyeballs have to get on it and Crest toothpaste wants 40 million people to see its commercial instead of 20 million people over on this thing, even though this show might be better, but this one’s just louder.”I’ve been a good boy for a bunch of years as far as staying out lateThose industry-wide changes parallel Bateman’s own shift in perspective wrought by career renewal and fatherhood. He says that having a family “has reaffirmed my — I don’t know if strategy is the right word, but what I perceive to be the fuel that gets me that kind of longevity that is not something that can be counted on. I need to stay employed, I need to provide for my family, and pursuing work that garners respect — as opposed to fame, notoriety or money — is really the way to go. Things that might not be as loud but are quality are the things that I’ve found, just in observing this business and also just trying it — those are the things that get you the next job.”These days Bateman’s sober self-restraint even extends to Twitter — the place where so many celebrities go to mouth off and find trouble. I’ve noticed he doesn’t tweet very often, I tell him. “No, I just don’t feel like anybody really cares what the hell I’m doing in traffic tomorrow.” I suggest that this view is not shared by a lot of other actors. “No, it isn’t, but that’s why I don’t hang out with a lot of actors,” he says, laughing.While Bateman has no plans to stop acting, it is clear that he wants to spend more time behind the camera. “I’m a father and a husband and I’ve been a good boy for a bunch of years as far as staying out late, and I’m really, really committed to my work. I’m incredibly appreciative of the fact that my access is equal to my ambition right now. I realise what a gift that is, that I’m able to work as hard as I want to work right now. This business is not famous for that.”Shannon Bond is the FT’s US media and marketing correspondent. “Ozark” is available now on NetflixPhotographs: Ben Rayner/ Bernstein & Andriulli; NETFLIX; Rex Features "
313;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-08-03T14:59:52Z;Icarus — amazing viewing;An enthralling documentary that lifts the lid on drug use in sport;Icarus may be the best nonfiction movie of the year. Bryan Fogel’s film about drug use in sport was praised at Sundance, then bought by Netflix in a record deal for a documentary. $4m: easy to see why. The film is a corker. Or an un-corker — of chastising yet cathartic truths. Though it can’t be seen in theatres, it should be sought and seen anyway. And anywhere.As a Sundance reviewer rightly noted, the film starts like Morgan Spurlock and ends like Laura Poitras. At the beginning Fogel is filmmaker-as-guinea-pig, supersizing his athletic prowess to enter an international bike race under a performance-enhancing drugs regime (chronicled as it goes). By mid-movie he is in CitizenFour mode, sheltering and interviewing real-life defector Grigory Rodchenkov, the one-time anti-doping chief in Russian sport.Holed up in Shakicam City — let’s bestow that name on Bryan and Grigori’s succession of secret apartments and hotel rooms, shot with handheld cameras — they blow the cover on a drug scandal that ascends to Putin. Rodchenkov is a showboating stick of nerves with a pot belly and greying Chaplin ’tache. In idiomatic English he says, “I could be tossed to the bus any time.”He could. Back in Russia he attempted suicide. He has now left behind his children and wife, fleetingly glimpsed on Skype. His and Fogel’s account of the lengths to which a country went to “game the system” makes amazing viewing — and listening. Early summarisation by Rodchenkov: “The system in place to test athletes . . . was bullshit.” By most of the evidence, Icarus makes clear, and God knows makes enthralling, it probably still is.
314;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Index trackers break basic rules of prudent portfolio management;John Plender warns of dangerous concentration risk in some ETFs;In the great passive versus active management debate, it is beginning to feel like game, set and match to the index trackers. But notwithstanding the formidable advantages of passive management, most notably the much lower fees, the outcome of the game is not yet conclusive. Nor could it ever be. A market dominated by passive investors would distort the price-discovery process to the point of creating serious market anomalies for active managers to exploit.Equally important, at this late stage of the post-crisis equity bull market, is that the lessons of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s need to be re-learned. Back then, index trackers contributed to overvaluation because they were forced buyers. As money flowed in they were obliged to buy already overweighted, overpriced stock. The implicit destabilising effect was revealed when the bust came.Today, after years of phenomenal growth of index trackers and exchange traded funds, this problem of enforced momentum trading will be proportionately greater when disaster strikes. A downturn will also expose the extent to which investors in passive funds have been giving insufficient attention to diversification, liquidity and risk control.There is a widespread assumption that indexed funds look after these things for investors and ensure that they are immune from company-specific risk. Not so. Investors in these funds often unwittingly break some of the most basic rules of prudent portfolio management.Take the Nasdaq 100 index on which the popular PowerShares Nasdaq 100 ETF is based. It has almost $50bn of assets, making it one of the 10 largest ETFs in the US. Steven Bregman, co-founder of Horizon Kinetics, the investment adviser, highlights that just the top five holdings in the Nasdaq 100 — Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook — comprise 41 per cent of the value of the entire index. If an active manager took on such a concentration of risk it would be regarded as daring, bordering on reckless. And as Mr Bregman points out, in some jurisdictions it would violate regulations. Concentration risk that is forbidden to an active manager is considered reasonable and permissible if it happens to be an index. This is dangerous nonsenseA case in point is Europe, where Ucits1 funds cannot have more than 40 per cent exposure from position sizes of 5 per cent or greater. To do so is indeed considered reckless. Yet, the Nasdaq 100 is available via the iShares Nasdaq 100 Ucits ETF and has more than $1.1bn in assets under management in the UK alone. In other words, concentration risk that is forbidden to an active manager is considered reasonable and permissible if it happens to be an index. This is dangerous nonsense.Similar considerations apply to smart-beta strategies, whereby the fund manager recalibrates broad indices to reflect factors such as growth, value, low volatility, dividends or momentum. Backtesting of these strategies throws up favourable results partly because they tend to have a bias towards value and small-capitalisation stocks, which academic research suggests outperform over the long run.How they will look in tougher market conditions remains to be seen. They are also questionably passive because their deviation from the broad indices is a discretionary judgment of the manager. So will that manager turn out to be any better than the active managers who are currently underperforming?Then there is the vexed question of what will happen in a downturn to ETF investors in less transparent markets, such as high-yield debt and local-currency emerging market debt. Investors who believe that ETFs can provide liquidity when the underlying assets they hold are illiquid could be in for a shock.Often overlooked is a worrying agency problem in the ETF world. The funds’ low-cost, low-fees business model means the managers seek scale. For that, argues Howard Marks, co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, the US alternative investment manager, they are likely to rely heavily on the largest-capitalisation, most-liquid stocks. For example, having Apple in your ETF allows it to get really big, he says. Thus Apple is included today in ETFs emphasising tech, growth, value, momentum, large-caps, high quality, low volatility, dividends and leverage. This all-singing, all-dancing Apple phenomenon does, among other things, add greatly to the destabilising potential of forced buying.My suspicion is that the rise and fall of active managers is a cyclical phenomenon. Much of their underperformance is probably due to inadequate exposure to the Faangs — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet). In considering the bloated valuations of these seemingly impregnable tech giants, it is salutary to recall that in December 1999 the largest market capitalisation in the world belonged to AOL.

315;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-21T10:17:15Z;The BBC faces down the digital disrupters;Netflix and a new financial settlement pose a historic challenge to the corporation;"I help teach an annual session with history undergraduates at Cambridge university about the role of the BBC since its foundation in 1922, and what strikes me ever more forcibly is how resilient the organisation is. It goes through wars and national crises, it enrages politicians, it faces an inquiry here and a commission on its future there, its licence fee goes up or down in real terms — and yet it still emerges in pretty much the same shape.After the best part of a century, the BBC continues its mission to inform, educate and entertain; and it remains the dominant broadcaster in the UK, with a sizeable global reach, too. So the corporation will not be overly troubled by this week’s controversy about its top presenters’ pay, revealed for the first time, although the gender gap is unquestionably awkward. It has survived far greater embarrassments. It is an adept political operator and displays ruthless competitive instincts when needed. This was the organisation that, as far back as 1955, killed off a leading character in its popular radio series The Archers to draw attention away from the launch of ITV.The corporation always scans the horizon for threats, and many never materialised: Sky hasn’t become the great content producer in drama and comedy, Channel 4 didn’t move into radio, and John Birt’s visionary approach to the internet means that the BBC seized first-mover advantage and has turned a vulnerability into a strength — so far, at least. But there are signs of deeper cracks appearing in the corporate edifice, and the Beeb’s powers of survival are going to be tested as never before.The wolf may really be at the door. Ofcom’s survey this week showed approval ratings for Netflix were higher than the BBC’s and younger audiences are shifting to online video in place of linear channels, where their viewing has dropped by a third this decade.Those figures confirm the anecdotes I hear from my students. They see Netflix, costing a fiver or so a month, and with all their favourite American shows plus some BBC content, as better value than the licence fee at double that and with too many programmes aimed at older viewers. Yet a change to a subscription model for the BBC would destroy its tradition of offering something for everyone.There’s certainly nervousness among my former colleagues in Broadcasting House. “This is the worst new charter in the BBC’s history,” says one senior figure; and the argument is persuasive. The charter, which came into effect on January 1, is underpinned by one of the toughest licence fee settlements, with the corporation becoming responsible for funding the free licences given to over-75s.When the settlement was announced, the BBC claimed it wasn’t a cut and simply meant a flat income for five years; but there was some wishful thinking based on commercial revenues and the other variables being favourable. In practice, the BBC faces a financial squeeze with insiders believing that the sharpest pain is yet to come.This is accompanied by more government tinkering that requires, for instance, that 60 per cent of radio should be considered for independent production by 2022 — a daft idea that could destroy in-house expertise for little or no financial gain.The warning signs can be seen in television where ranks of specialist producers are being axed, as BBC heartland programmes such as Songs of Praise have been lost to indies, and a new commissioning-production divide looks as if it is heading towards the Channel 4 model. The corporation’s response has been to launch BBC Studios as a wholly owned programme-making subsidiary charged with winning commissions from BBC controllers and from other broadcasters too. It is a gamble that has to pay off.In truth, the corporation can be confident of holding its position in radio and in news, where it has an enormous share of the UK broadcast market. But that is dwarfed by the scale of the challenge in the big-money world of TV. Drama costs have soared, which is how HBO’s Game of Thrones and Netflix’s The Crown cut through.The BBC has clung on with smart co-productions such as The Night Manager, but it needs to invest serious money in drama — and, crucially, retain the production and commissioning talent that can create a hit. That means ignoring this week’s brouhaha and being prepared to spend more on the right people. It also faces struggles in entertainment, where hit formats — notably The Great British Bake Off and The Voice — are whisked away by the production companies that own them; and where in-house alternatives have struggled to make an impact.The debate within the BBC is about whether to try to seize the digital future by casting away more of their linear broadcasting: the iPlayer would become the main destination for viewers. But the residual strength of channels means there is no alternative but to ride two horses for now. Who would have predicted, in an age of Spotify, that Radio 2 would persistently increase its audiences? Pruning TV channels too early is risky, as proven by the loss of younger audiences following the demise of BBC Three.And Netflix would, of course, kill for the kind of impact that a BBC One 9pm Sunday night drama has by virtue of the strength of the channel portfolio. That signals why the corporation remains so important for the country. It is still, for now, the place that provides the national talking points and the shared experiences. So when it also brings us together to moan about some of its practices, we shouldn’t mistake the big picture. Britain will be diminished if the BBC is allowed to decline.The writer is master of Selwyn College, Cambridge and a former BBC editorial director"
316;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-20T12:20:36Z;Netflix looks to become world’s entertainer as it hits milestone;Online video streamer passes 100m subscribers;2007 was a vintage year for technology. While there has been plenty of coverage of the iPhone’s 10th anniversary, the same year also saw Netflix, best known then for renting DVDs by post, launch another novel product: online movie streaming. At the time, some Netflix investors fretted about the expected $40m cost of launching its streaming service during its first year.A decade later, Netflix’s share price performance has far exceeded even Apple’s 700 per cent increase since 2007, with the internet TV group’s stock skyrocketing by more than 6,000 per cent in the same period. This week added another 15 per cent to those gains, after second-quarter results showed its total subscribers had reached 104m, shooting through Wall Street forecasts.Netflix described the symbolic milestone of exceeding 100m members as “a good start”. “We connect people with stories,” its recently redrawn mission statement says. “Someday, we hope to entertain everyone.”Despite their products’ shared birthdays, Netflix’s latest statement of values draws a clear line between the cultures that shaped it and Apple. “The legend of Steve Jobs was that his micromanagement made the iPhone a great product,” Netflix says, noting that many traditional Hollywood studios work in the same way. “We do not emulate these top-down models because we believe we are most effective and innovative when employees own decisions.” Both approaches have proven successful in their respective fields but the comparison is timely now that Apple is following Netflix, along with Amazon and YouTube, into original online content creation. Apple recently hired the two top Sony Pictures Television executives responsible for shows such as Breaking Bad and The Crown. Social networks Snap and Facebook are following similar paths. As Netflix itself noted in its quarterly letter to shareholders this week: “Creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app.” The question facing the TV streaming pioneer is whether its main competition for the next 100m subscribers will come from traditional cable and satellite operators around the world or the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon, who also happen to produce many of the devices Netflix customers use to watch more than 1bn hours a week of shows such as House of Cards, Stranger Things and Glow every week. Asked by an analyst this week how Netflix plans to maintain its lead, chief executive Reed Hastings simply replied: “More watching, less sleep.” Shifting that balance requires ever more content. If investors were anxious about $40m a few years ago, Netflix’s soaring share price now suggests they are more relaxed about its $6bn investment in content this year alone. Morgan Stanley calculates that Netflix’s $11bn worth of net content assets as of the end of last year are worth more than the net book value for established broadcasters Viacom, Discovery, AMC Networks and Scripps combined.The upfront costs of creating TV and movies, especially “owned original” shows such as Stranger Things, which are produced in-house, will lead to up to $2.5bn in free cash outflows this year, Netflix has warned. Unconventionally, Mr Hastings views these losses as a badge of honour because they show it is able to keep investing in its own shows, which are more valuable in the long run. “The irony is, the faster we grow and the faster we grow owned originals, the more drawn on free cash flow we’ll be,” he told analysts this week. “So in some senses, negative free cash flow will be an indicator of enormous success.” Yet that success only lasts for as long as Netflix keeps making popular shows. “Netflix has had an incredibly good track record of hits over the last four to five years,” said Mike Vorhaus of Magid Advisors, a media consultancy. “Nobody I’ve seen in 23 years of doing media analysis has ever been able to keep up that track record forever. They are going to end up having a string of flops and it’s going to cost them money.” Maintaining that early lead is only going to become more challenging for Netflix, as it relies on international markets for more of its growth. At the end of last year, Amazon expanded its Prime Video service to a total of more than 200 countries. In the US, many of Netflix’s rivals in online video are also adding live TV, such as Sony’s PlayStation Vue, Dish’s Sling TV, Hulu and YouTube. Netflix has resisted adding such services, despite concern that it is reaching close to saturation point in the US with its existing offering. Netflix argued this week that while competition is “intense”, the market is “vast and diverse”. Dan Cryan, analyst at IHS Markit, agrees that the battle between Netflix, Amazon and other technology companies for consumers’ entertainment time need not be a zero-sum game because they often have different content libraries. However, Mr Cryan adds, Netflix is racing against deeper-pocketed rivals such as Amazon to establish itself all over the world, including commissioning the local content that is required to win local audiences in each region. “If you are trying to grow the brand, you probably have to fight it in all territories, otherwise you are coming from behind,” he says. “Playing catch-up can be quite difficult if you leave it too long.” Ten years after Netflix first started to move away from DVDs, some analysts still foresee a huge opportunity for further growth in TV and movie streaming. RBC Capital Markets compares an estimated 1bn pay-TV subscribers worldwide to around 150m who pay for internet TV today. In a “dramatic secular shift away from linear TV”, RBC says, “these numbers could meet.” Silicon Valley’s new TV production frenzy comes as analysts see the long battle between “over the top” content (online video) and traditional television entering a new phase. “For the better part of 15 years, pundits have predicted that cord-cutting was the future,” media industry analysts Moffett Nathanson wrote in a recent research note. “Well, the future has arrived.” The shift is even more dramatic in Europe, where Netflix reported particularly strong growth in the past quarter. As analysts at Barclays noted this week: “Instead of pay TV penetration rates trending to US levels, Europe is in many ways moving from broadcast straight to OTT.”Younger viewers are especially likely to turn to smartphones and internet-connected devices for entertainment: 18- to 34-year-olds spend 27 per cent less time watching traditional TV than people aged 35 and older, according to Nielsen, the research group. The explosion of viewing options has made pricey cable or satellite TV subscriptions less appealing. Pay-TV executives have long dismissed the idea that cord-cutting would significantly disrupt their businesses. But this year, the phenomenon is accelerating: US cable and satellite providers lost 732,000 customers in the first quarter, a decrease of 2.4 per cent — the steepest annualised decline on record, according to Moffett Nathanson. “Netflix is a contributor to cord-cutting because it’s driving video consumption outside the pay-TV box and attracting eyeballs outside traditional linear television,” said Corey Barrett, senior media analyst at researcher M Science.A recent report from M Science, however, suggests that Netflix may not be the biggest driver behind more people ditching pay-TV subscriptions. Netflix subscribers pay about $1 a month less for their cable subscriptions than the average cable customer, M Science found. In contrast, subscribers to Hulu, the US streaming video site jointly owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, pay an average $10 to $15 a month less than the average cable customer.Mr Barrett attributed the difference to the fact that Hulu streams many shows just a day after they are shown on broadcast or cable TV, while Netflix often does not get new seasons of TV series until a year after they first air. “The content is much more real-time. It’s a more natural displacer of pay-TV,” Mr Barrett said. M Science also found that while more than 80 per cent of Hulu subscribers also subscribe to Netflix, on average, Netflix subscribers are less likely to subscribe to Hulu. “Netflix is still the gateway service,” Mr Barrett said. 
317;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix: powerful streams;Forget the tax code, give executives some proper incentives;"In Europe, banks have paid higher base salaries to get around caps on bonuses. In the US, it works the other way. But a law aimed at limiting executive pay is ineffective and outdated. The case of Netflix shows why it needs to be rethought.President Bill Clinton tried to curb executive pay by limiting corporate tax deductions to salaries of $1m or less. Since keeping pay below $1m was anathema to US boards, companies often opted to keep salaries at less than $1m but diverted cash to “performance bonuses”. The point of these is that they must be based on metrics that are not certain to be achieved.But Netflix, a fast-growing business whose quarter-on-quarter performance is often volatile, has picked the one metric that it has shown it can predict with remarkable accuracy. The streaming video group this week reported new subscriber numbers 60 per cent better than it had forecast. Informed by this number, its forecast for the following quarter’s streaming revenues — if form is any guide — will be on the money.Streaming revenue is the metric for the bonus plan. And executives have hit their targets in seven out of the last eight quarters (in the one they missed, revenue was 99 per cent of target). The company says the result is “not a foregone conclusion” and achievement of the target is the result of “management skill”. Whether or not the Netflix bonus plan is in compliance may not be the most salient detail. The rule is cumbersome and ineffective. Michael Doran, a professor at the University of Virginia, wrote in a recent paper, that the provision had been a “spectacular policy failure”. He and others would prefer to see it repealed.And Netflix itself does not need to do this. The group has done phenomenally well; it should be rewarding high achievement using more stretching targets.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

318;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-19T08:25:06Z;BBC admits only one-third of its stars are women;Broadcaster reveals gender gap as it prepares to publish salaries of top presenters;"Only one-third of the BBC’s top talent is female, the broadcaster has admitted, as it prepares to publish the names of all its presenters who earn more than £150,000 a year.The BBC has been bracing itself for a public row both over the pay for its on-air talent and for its lack of gender balance.“Some female presenters have been questioning why there is a difference in fees,” said Sue Ayton, an agent at Knight Ayton, which represents the BBC’s former royal correspondent Jennie Bond as well as the Channel 4 news presenter Cathy Newman.Speaking to staff on Tuesday, Tony Hall, the BBC’s director-general, said he was working to improve the gender gap. “Is that where we want to be? No,” he said, adding that the UK’s public broadcaster wants “all lead and presenting roles to be equally divided by men and women” by 2020.He said that two-thirds of the 96 presenters earning more than £150,000 who have been hired or promoted in the past four years were women, with Mishal Husain, of the Today programme; Laura Kuenssberg, the political editor; and Claudia Winkleman, the presenter of Strictly Come Dancing, likely to be part of that group.Mr Hall told BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday morning that he is “satisfied with all the 96 people on the list and what they are being paid”.The BBC has strongly resisted disclosing the pay of its top stars until now, fearful that the list would hand rival broadcasters a menu from which to poach its staff.It is also fearful of public anger and, ahead of the publication, said it had reduced its overall talent bill by £4m to £194m over the past 12 months, with the number of people earning more than £150,000 a year falling by 13 to 96.The disclosure, part of the new royal charter agreement, forces the BBC to list the names in pay bands of £50,000 and the areas in which they work.With the BBC under pressure to make cost savings, Lord Hall said it tried to pay people at “a discount to the market”.A report in 2015 by independent media consultants Oliver & Ohlbaum concluded that there was “no evidence that the BBC is overpaying” for its talent, a message reiterated by Sir David Clementi, the BBC chairman, in an interview with the Financial Times this month.Britain’s highest-paid TV presenters, Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, recently signed a three-year, £30m “golden handcuffs” deal with ITV to front shows including Britain’s Got Talent.By comparison, the BBC will say that only two people earned more than £1m last year, although in 2016 seven people earned between £500,000 and £5m.“The BBC does pay less than the competitive market rate,” said Jonathan Shalit, chairman of the talent management firm Roar. “But that’s generally been the case for a long time and is widely accepted.”Recent defections from the BBC to rival channels appear to support this theory. In an interview with The Times last year, the BBC’s former economics and business editor Robert Peston revealed that he received a pay rise of more than a third when he moved to ITV last year.The arrival of digital rivals, such as Netflix and Amazon, which are both ploughing billions of pounds into new content, is also placing the BBC under pressure when it comes to retaining shows and star presenters.“We are in a market that is more competitive than ever,” said Lord Hall. “A decade ago it might have been just ITV or Sky or commercial radio, but now it’s Netflix, Amazon or Apple.”For many broadcasters, the choice is between the greater reach and profile offered by the BBC, which takes a larger share of audience than rival channels, or more money.Gary Lineker, the BBC’s main sports anchor who presents the football highlights show Match of the Day, told the FT last year: “I know I could have earned more elsewhere but at the same time I love working for the BBC.”On Wednesday morning, Mr Lineker, who is expected to be among the BBC’s top earners, tweeted: “I blame my agent and the other TV channels that pay more. Now where did I put my tin helmet?”"
319;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-18T17:10:32Z;Netflix executives keep hitting bonus bullseyes;Uncanny accuracy is being achieved on targets set by often volatile video streamer;"Netflix executives are hitting bonus targets with almost uncanny accuracy, raising questions among investors and tax experts over whether they are a fait accompli.Whether the awards are truly performance-based is important for Netflix’s compliance with the US tax code, which allows bonuses for highly paid executives to be deducted from corporate taxes — but only if “the outcome is substantially uncertain”.The US video streaming service behind House of Cards is known for its volatile performance: This week, it reported 5.2m new subscribers in the second quarter compared with its own prior estimate of 3.2m. “Our business is a little bit tough to predict,” chief financial officer David Wells said, on a call to discuss the better than expected results. But while its profits and subscriber numbers often differ hugely from company forecasts, Netflix has a much better record of predicting streaming revenues once it knows the number of subscribers it has at the start of a quarter.Streaming revenues have been used since 2015 as the metric in a bonus plan for three top executives: Neil Hunt, chief product officer until he left the company this month; Greg Peters, who led international development before succeeding Mr Hunt; and Ted Sarandos, chief content officer.Regulatory filings show the three executives have hit the target squarely in seven out of eight quarters between the beginning of 2015 and the end of 2016, never exceeding it, and missing by just one percentage point in the other quarter. Last year’s overall revenue target of $8.276bn was exceeded by $12m, or 0.14 per cent. The near-perfect precision means that, out of a target pool of $18.75m, the three men collected $18.7295m, according to regulatory filings. “The intellectual framing of a bonus is that you’re targeting ‘stretching goals’ that you get paid for delivering,” said one top 10 shareholder. “Your salary is what you get paid for doing a good job when you come to work. The stretch is the bonus.”The US tax code was changed in the 1990s to try to curb executive pay by limiting tax deductions to the first $1m of executive salaries, a provision known as 162(m). Companies are allowed to deduct performance bonuses above the $1m threshold, but the measure requires the outcome of the targets to be “substantially uncertain” when set.Netflix said its bonus scheme was compliant with the tax code.“We set the targets early in the quarter on the upcoming quarter's global streaming revenue within the deadlines set by 162(m),” Netflix said. “The fact the targets are set during guidance makes them inherently uncertain, and not a foregone conclusion. To hit the target, it requires effort and management skill by the executives. It is also a benefit to the company as we receive a tax deduction.” Netflix added that its subscription revenues were “fundamentally less volatile than other business models”.Steven Balsam, professor of accounting at Temple University, said Netflix appeared to have “picked a metric which is very easy to predict”. He added: “What is also unusual and more troublesome is the reliance on one metric — most companies these years use multiple measures.”"
320;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-18T00:17:48Z;Netflix boosted as viewers outside the US tune in;Group’s shares race higher as subscriber growth beats expectations and earnings rise;Netflix now has more subscribers outside the US than in its home market, the internet television service reported on Monday, contributing to better-than-expected audience growth and a near-11 per cent after-hours jump in its shares.Amid the streaming service’s rapid expansion in Europe, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s co-founder and chief executive, insisted that his company would escape the sort of regulatory censure that has hit other Silicon Valley companies such as Google and Facebook in the region.Because it is making “big investments” in local content and production studios in France, Germany and Spain, Mr Hastings said he hoped Netflix would see a “really different dynamic” with regulators concerned about US tech’s growing influence in Europe.“Think of us much more as trying to curate some of the world’s best content and share it with the world, versus the moniker of being a disruptive tech company,” he said in response to an analyst’s question on Monday.The latest seasons of House of Cards and Orange is the new Black, accompanied by new hit 13 Reasons Why, drove Netflix’s streaming video subscriber base from 83m a year ago to 104m in its second quarter. Net additional subscribers of 5.2m were 2m more than Netflix had forecast three months ago and exceeded analysts’ forecasts.“In Q2, we underestimated the popularity of our strong slate of content which led to higher than expected acquisition across all major territories,” Netflix said in its shareholder letter. Its shares rose more than 10.7 per cent in after-hours trading to $178.98.Overall revenues grew 32 per cent to $2.79bn, just ahead of Wall Street’s $2.76 estimate, with net income up 60 per cent to $66m. At 15 cents per share, earnings were 1 cent below consensus forecasts but in line with its own guidance.In April, Netflix surpassed 100m subscribers for the first time. Nonetheless, audience growth was ahead of analysts’ expectations both at home and abroad, as “over the top” TV viewing catches on in Europe. Netflix recorded 1.07m net adds in the US and 4.14m internationally.That meant Netflix’s 52m international streaming subscribers overtook its 51.9m domestic members for the first time. In another first, Netflix also said that its international business would be profitable this year.Netflix is forecasting continued momentum into the third quarter. It said it expected 4.4m net additional subscribers, with revenues of $2.96bn, net income of $143m and earnings of 32 cents per share — all ahead of Wall Street’s current consensus.After the success of shows including Stranger Things and Master of None, Netflix’s original programming was nominated for 91 Emmy awards last week. However, all that content comes at a heavy cost. Netflix said it anticipated free cash outflows of up to $2.5bn this year as it continues to borrow money to plough into new TV and movie commissioning.As a result of the popularity of its “owned originals” — content produced in-house rather than acquired from an outside studio — Netflix said it still expected to be “free cash flow negative for many years”.
321;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-17T17:01:59Z;New ITV chief faces ad slide and digital threat;McCall will also have to find new hits and review production strategy;Dame Carolyn McCall will take charge of ITV next January, armed with an impressive record at easyJet and an understanding of the media and advertising business following her time running the Guardian Media Group.Although her appointment was widely welcomed by analysts and media executives, the boss of the no-frills airline will nevertheless need to steer the UK’s biggest commercial broadcaster through some potentially turbulent times.Here are her five biggest challenges:1. The advertising slumpUnder former chief executive Adam Crozier, ITV reduced its reliance on the cyclical advertising market by expanding its production division, ITV Studios, to become a major player in the international content business.But advertising still made up 47 per cent of ITV’s revenues of £3bn in 2016, and the problem for Dame Carolyn is that she is taking over just as the ad market heads into its most severe downturn since the financial crisis of 2009.In May, ITV predicted an 8-9 per cent fall in the first half of 2017, with analysts of the opinion the market could get worse before it gets any better.“TV revenue is heading into the unknown,” said Claire Enders, a media analyst. “And there’s no end in sight to the decline of the core TV business.”ITV and other broadcasters are being hit not only by a short-term downturn driven by the uncertainty caused by the UK’s vote for Brexit, but also by longer term structural issues. These are being caused by competition from new digital competitors such as Netflix and Amazon, as well as social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook which are pushing into video.Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group, said the question facing Dame Carolyn was whether “network TV can adapt to and compete with over the top [streamed internet content]?”2. Digital transitionIn the face of the challenge posed by online streaming services, ITV and other traditional broadcasters have been looking to grow their own on-demand platforms and develop their digital ad revenues.Viewing of the ITV Hub on-demand service grew 42 per cent year on year in 2016, as people shifted their habits from live TV to catch-up viewing or watching via handheld devices.So far rivals like Channel 4 and Sky have led the way in developing targeted advertising for customers. The challenge now is to develop ITV’s own smart TV ads to offer an alternative to the internet giants who are hoovering up the vast majority of new online spending.Alan Rusbridger, former editor-in-chief at the Guardian, who worked closely with Dame Carolyn when she was chief executive of the newspaper group from 2006 to 2010, said: “Crucially Carolyn understood early on the importance of digital.”3. Keep the hits comingFor well over a decade, ITV has been reliant on its hit entertainment shows such as X Factor and I’m A Celebrity: Get Me Out Of Here to drive big peak-time audiences.While these programmes still do well, the new ITV boss will have to consider whether to rethink the formats as younger viewers show less appetite for traditional “appointment to view” TV.“There’s no impending crisis,” argues one production executive. “X Factor has been in gentle decline for the last six or seven years, but you would be brave to replace it.”Keep up to date on M&A with the day’s top stories and analysis of global deals and dealmakersAt the same time, the cost of producing original dramas like Broadchurch and Victoria is being pushed up as the likes of Netflix and Amazon increase their investment in content.ITV’s programming budget last year was £1bn — a healthy amount compared to other domestic TV players — but a fraction of the $6bn Netflix will spend this year.The bet ITV made under Mr Crozier was that it could also benefit from the boom in content production that was being driven by increased competition from new digital players.4. Should ITV keep buying production companies?To deliver on Mr Crozier’s plan to turn ITV into an international production house, the company embarked on a spending spree, acquiring 17 businesses in the space of five years.But some executives argue the strategy has had mixed results.Michael Grade, former chairman of ITV, says Dame Carolyn will have to “take stock of the acquisitions ITV has made. I am not sure how successful they have been.”5. Will ITV become a takeover target again?In the immediate aftermath of Brexit, ITV was widely seen as a takeover target for a big US media group, as the fall in the value of sterling and a sudden drop in the broadcaster’s share price made it look cheap.But while Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox took advantage of the shift in the market to launch his latest bid to buy Sky, ITV was left on the shelf.Since then takeover speculation has all but disappeared, even though Liberty Global, the John Malone-owned media group, continues to hold 9 per cent of the company and is seen as a potential buyer.“The question for any big US company is do they want to spend a lot of money on a bet on the UK economy and the UK advertising market,” says one investment banker. “It’s a lot of capital to put in one market, when most are taking a global view.”
322;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-13T04:01:34Z;HBO battles ‘Game of Thrones’ chill with subscriber growth;New distribution deals help Time Warner-owned channel weather the digital storm;Winter is coming to Westeros, bringing terrifying “white walkers” to the fantastical setting of Game of Thrones — bad news for the Starks, Lannisters and other feuding dynasties yet to meet a grisly end in the blockbuster series.For HBO, the Time Warner-owned channel that broadcasts the hit show, the outlook is rather sunnier. Game of Thrones begins its seventh and penultimate series this weekend, its return coinciding with a string of new distribution deals that are driving HBO subscriber growth, at a time when technology is disrupting the television industry.Cable television is under pressure like never before, with many viewers “cutting the cord” to go with digital players such as Netflix and Amazon. Yet HBO has continued to add subscribers, increasing revenues from them by 5 per cent in its most recent quarter.As an à la carte “premium” network, HBO is less susceptible to cord-cutting, because it is not part of the main US cable and satellite channel “bundle” that viewers are increasingly rejecting.But the network behind hits such as Westworld, Silicon Valley and Veep has also targeted cord-cutters with HBO Now, its standalone streaming product.The move ruffled the feathers of traditional cable distributors when Richard Plepler, HBO’s chairman, launched the service at an Apple event two years ago.“Incumbents can get worried and not like change,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice-president of internet software and services, told the Financial Times. “I thought it was going to be good for everybody.”So far, there is no sign that HBO Now, or the availability of HBO programming on digital platforms such as Amazon, has hurt its distribution among traditional cable and satellite providers.The company says it is approaching 3.5m broadband-delivered subscribers, part of a total global subscriber base of more than 131m. Netflix, by way of contrast, recently hit 100m subscribers around the world.Mr Plepler says HBO has embraced a “multilateral” distribution model, whereby HBO is available as a standalone digital service, as part of an add-on to a bundled package sold by a cable, satellite or telecoms provider, or in licensed form, as its programming is taken internationally by distributors such as Sky.In the US, still its biggest market, HBO typically negotiates distribution deals with cable and satellite operators every few years, but in 2016 found itself needing to strike three new agreements at the same time.Media sector consolidation was a factor in the timing shift, with the acquisition by Charter Communications of Time Warner Cable and the purchase of DirecTV, the satellite group, by AT&T bringing forward the timing of the new deals. HBO’s distribution deal with Comcast, America’s largest cable operator and the owner of NBCUniversal, was also up for renewal.“Normally these deals are staggered, but we had 80 per cent of our revenues up for renegotiation in an 18-month period,” Mr Plepler said. “That’s anomalous, but was largely the result of the Charter and AT&T mergers.”The deals were structured differently to previous renewals, which tended to be characterised by fee increases, effectively making HBO more expensive for consumers.“The number that kept me up at night had to do with increasing the wholesale price that we knew was being passed on to our consumers via distributors. What we needed to do was build volume-based incentives, which motivated our partners to grow with us.”So, this time round, HBO moved from a standard annual rate increase to a revenue-sharing model, with the distributors getting a larger share of subscriber fees the more HBO subscriptions they sell.“There are incentives for us to grow the business together so both companies benefit,” said Tom Rutledge, chief executive of Charter, which is backed by cable billionaire John Malone. “It’s slightly different from the way the legacy Charter businesses worked with HBO.”The shift in approach was partly driven by the performance of the players in the round of consolidation that swept the sector two years ago, with Charter and AT&T having much higher HBO penetration among their customers than Time Warner Cable and DirecTV, according to Mr Plepler.“Our performance with the acquiring companies was substantially better than with the distributors they acquired. Logic would tell you there’s an opportunity in that,” he said.With the deals done, HBO is expecting a hefty uptick in new subscribers: typically distributors put channel marketing efforts on ice during negotiations but with agreements in place they are aggressively pushing the service.Some analysts have urged HBO to go direct to consumers with its programming all over the world, rather than sell its channel through cable or satellite distributors.“It would be the right move long term and would mean they get to keep all the data and own the customer relationships,” says Richard Greenfield, analyst with BTIG Research. “But it would take a lot of capital and a lot of effort.”It would also mean turning down the hefty fees the company gets from distributors that pay it hundreds of millions of dollars each year to carry HBO.While the HBO Now service is available in the US, its international distribution is more limited: in the UK, for example, HBO programming is distributed by Sky via its Sky Atlantic channel.Keep up to date on M&A with the day’s top stories and analysis of global deals and dealmakersCould the strategy change again? Time Warner, HBO’s parent company, is in the midst of being acquired by AT&T for $85.4bn and Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, has been vocal about the value of HBO content in driving adoption of new mobile telephony services.HBO generated $1.9bn of operating income in 2016, equivalent to 25 per cent of Time Warner’s annual profits — but only about 6 per cent of the operating income of a combined AT&T-Time Warner.“I wonder if Richard will reconsider things when he is in a bigger company and there is less reliance on him and HBO,” says Michael Nathanson, analyst with MoffettNathanson. “Will they get more aggressive by going direct to consumers around the world? That’s what I would consider.”Mr Plepler declined to comment on anything related to the AT&T takeover, citing regulatory restrictions.But he said the multilateral model was working, leaving HBO free to concentrate on what it does best — programming.The company has a new series of Westworld in the pipeline — the first broke audience records for a debut HBO season — and has cast Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in a third series of True Detective. It is also working on Succession, a new drama about a fictional American media family.“We have to keep the heat on the brand,” said Mr Plepler. “We curate excellence and we create great quality . . . we have to keep delivering that.”
323;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix CEO Reed Hastings on conquering Europe;The entertainment boss runs his online streaming company like a champion sports team;For the co-founder of a company that warns new staff that “adequate performance” will result in a “severance package”, Reed Hastings does not come across as a typical tough guy. Breezy and relaxed, the 56-year-old chief executive of Netflix delivers chilling statements with unnerving warmth.“We are modelled on sport and if you want to win a championship you have to have an incredible player in every position,” he explains. “It’s not for everyone. If you want job security you don’t go into sports — and you don’t join Netflix.”Even Mr Hastings admits the culture creates “pockets of fear”. But a decade after he reinvented his DVD rental business as a global online streaming network, it seems to be working.At the end of April, Netflix broke through the symbolic barrier of 100m members across the world. To celebrate, Mr Hastings posted a picture of himself on Facebook eating a steak alone in a branch of Denny’s, the US restaurant chain (he did the same when the company signed up 1m members).For the first three months of 2017, the company reported revenues of $2.64bn, a 34 per cent increase year on year.Meanwhile, the entertainment group, best known for big budget hit shows such as House of Cards, Narcos and The Crown, says it will invest $6bn in content this year as it continues its drive to upend traditional TV network programming.It has been a dizzying ride, but Mr Hastings insists it is just the beginning.“If you think of any night this last month when you did not watch Netflix what did you do?” he says.“Sports, gaming, watching linear TV . . . we compete with all of that. We even compete with sleep. We are just a very small player in the market for time and entertainment.”The streaming market is becoming crowded, with Amazon vowing to spend $4.5bn on acquiring and commissioning programmes this year, and other rivals such as Hulu, owned by a consortium of US broadcasters including Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox, spending on content and launching a live service in May.“As long as you do great unique content, there’s a market for you,” Mr Hastings adds.Having signed up more than 50m households in the US, he wants to grow Netflix in Europe. Appropriately, we meet at the Booking Office, a grand restaurant which looks out on to London’s Eurostar terminal at the renovated St Pancras Station. Next stop: dinner in Paris before going on to a celebration with staff in the Netherlands.Since 2012, Netflix has invested £2bn in original and acquired European content. It recently announced 400 new jobs at its Amsterdam office (Netflix has 3,000 staff globally) and has been launching original shows across the continent, including Las Chicas del Cable — the first original Spanish series — and the Dogs of Berlin, which will be written, produced and shot in Germany.The European push is timely as the EU considers an overhaul of its rules on video content, dragging technology and streaming groups into the same framework that already exists for traditional broadcasters.For Netflix this could mean payments to local culture funds in France, for example, and having to meet quotas of locally produced content across the EU, something Mr Hastings seems characteristically relaxed about.“It’s not going to be hard for us to meet those quotas,” he says, adding that the investment in Europe is “95 per cent consumer driven”. The other 5 per cent, he adds, is political. “If we are seen as an outside exploiter we will have problems.”Mr Hastings hails from Boston, Massachusetts, but has become one of the biggest names in Hollywood.His first glimpse of the international power of TV came during his time as a maths teacher in Swaziland 30 years ago. “While I was travelling around Africa, I saw how people loved television,” he explains.“You could be in the middle of nowhere but having a TV was a prized possession.”The journey from itinerant maths graduate to media mogul is unlikely but his enthusiasm for show business is clear. One of his favourite programmes at the moment is 13 Reasons Why, a controversial US high school drama that has been accused by some critics of romanticising suicide. “We say it’s an honest discussion of what’s going on in adolescent life,” he says.Mr Hastings’ first company was a software development business called Pure which he founded in 1991 before selling it six years later. He says the Netflix corporate culture was partly shaped by the mistakes he made as a young tech entrepreneur.Early success has its problems, he says, when I mention Travis Kalanick, the Uber chief executive who was forced out last month after a series of crises, including accusations of sexism.“There are a lot of lessons for the young founder experiencing incredible growth,” he replies, careful not to mention Mr Kalanick by name.“You are young and a lot of things hit all at once. Those are challenges much like a movie star who gets famous at a young age. Those who make it through like Facebook and Google are fantastic.”Such praise for Facebook is unsurprising — in addition to running Netflix, Mr Hastings is also a member of the Facebook board, allowing him to see some of the broader political and regulatory challenges facing the disruptive technology groups as they expand beyond the US.But while Netflix has been grouped together as one of the FAANGs (the big five tech groups that also includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google), Mr Hastings does not see the company as part of Silicon Valley.Asked to choose between being a tech or an entertainment company, he says: “If we have to choose, we are more entertainment. But we should aspire to be great at both.”Tim Davie, chief executive of BBC Worldwide, says Reed Hastings has transformed the broadcast industry with his bold risks. “He has earned universal admiration for the way he and the Netflix team got the disruptive power of the internet quicker than anyone,” Mr Davie says.“The ‘Netflix effect’ is having a profound impact in all areas of the industry: from commissioning through to financing, production, distribution, scheduling and marketing.”Screens instead of sleep defies all lifestyle logic / From Richard Ullyett, Vienna, Austria
324;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-07T18:11:27Z;Traditional TV becomes turn-off for young viewers;Switch to online streaming services and social media accelerates;Young people in the UK are watching a third less television through traditional free-to-air channels like the BBC and ITV than they did in 2010 as they increasingly turn to online streaming services and social media.According to a new report on the state of Britain’s public service broadcasters by media regulator Ofcom, there is a widening gap between older viewers, whose habits have hardly changed in the past year, and children who are turning their backs on traditional TV.The report comes as all traditional broadcasters confront the growing threat from video-on-demand platforms such as You Tube, Netflix and Amazon, who are investing billions of pounds in original content and changing the way people watch television.Ofcom found that while overall viewing is “resilient” with 85 per cent of people with a TV watching public service broadcast channels, 16-24 year olds watched an average of 1 hour and 54 minutes per day in 2016 — 43 minutes less than in 2012.Viewers aged 65 and over watched an average of 5 hours 44 minutes per day in 2016, just three minutes less than in 2012.The report adds that between 2015 and 2016, average daily viewing among children and 16-24 year olds each fell by 10 minutes, whereas viewing by the over 64s increased by two minutes.Although Ofcom did not publish data for on demand viewing among younger people, it said: “Watching on-demand television is increasingly popular, especially among younger viewers.”Earlier this week, Tony Hall, the BBC’s director-general, used the launch of the broadcaster’s new annual report to signal that the BBC needed to reinvent itself for a new generation.“Younger and older people’s consumption habits are increasingly different,” said Lord Hall. “Younger people watch less television than older people. They listen to less radio. And where young audiences go now, older audiences will probably follow.”But it is not just the BBC. Since the start of the year Channel 4 has seen a 6 per cent decline in viewing among 16-34 year olds. Although C4 is confident the figures will improve as the year goes on, finding ways to engage with younger audiences through new programming and via C4’s on-demand services will be one of the priorities for Alex Mahon, the new chief executive.Mathew Horsman, an analyst with the research firm Mediatique, said: “It’s still extraordinary given all the things they could be doing that young people watch any TV at all.“The BBC, in particular, has an issue because it cannot abandon its older licence fee payers who over index, but they have to do things to bring the next generation along.”The report also found that public sector broadcasters spent a total of £2.6bn on original programming and content in 2016, a figure inflated by the amount of money spent on showpiece sports events such as the Rio Olympics and Paralympics and the European football championships.
325;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
326;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-07-03T12:06:23Z;Echoes of Wall Street in Silicon Valley’s grip on money and power;Widespread cognitive capture of decision makers leaves ordinary people behind;Have we reached a market top in technology stocks and, in particular, those of the Fangs: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google? That is the question many investors are asking, not only because their valuations seem so high but also because it seems Big Tech has become the new Wall Street and the prime target for a populist backlash in a world increasingly bifurcated, economically and socially.When Donald Trump tweets about Amazon avoiding sales tax (incorrectly, not that it has ever stopped the US president), the trend shows that it has reached critical mass. Meanwhile, the industry generates its own terrible PR: see the most recent complaints from numerous women about sexual harassment by tech investors.What is most interesting is that Silicon Valley remains in a cognitive bubble, reluctant to engage with legitimate public worries over monopoly, privacy and tech-related job disruption, not to mention its own culture.When I ask most techies about these concerns, reactions tend to range from defensive to naive to clueless: “Politicians don’t understand the Valley”, or “Universal basic income will make work irrelevant” or, worst of all, the patronising smile or exasperated look that says: “You’re not a tech insider, and thus you just don’t get it.”It all seems too familiar. I am old enough to have lived through one big boom-and-bust tech cycle. Indeed, I worked for a high-tech incubator in London from 1999 to 2000, when venture capitalists would hire journalists to scout “pan-European B-to-C media deals”, a sign of froth in the market if there ever was one.Big technology talks mainly to itselfLevels of hubris today are similar but, more pernicious, given that the largest technology companies have become the systemically important institutions of our day. Like the big Wall Street banks, they hold vast amounts of money and political power and even greater troves of data. Facebook has more users than China has people. Yet unlike Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chief executive, they are not joking when they say they are doing God’s work.Silicon Valley operates more or less exclusively on the notion that it is making the world more free and open, despite growing concerns that social media has eroded democracy and predatory algorithms are targeting the weak and vulnerable, in the same way that pre-crisis predatory lending did.The Valley has clearly moved away from its hippy, entrepreneurial roots. Big Tech chief executives are as rapaciously capitalist as any financier, but often with an added libertarian bent in which anything and everything — government, politics, civic society, and law — can and should be disrupted.“Demos — society itself — is often viewed as being ‘in the way’,” says Jonathan Taplin, a professor at the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab in California, and the author of Move Fast and Break Things, which tracks the evolution of the Silicon Valley political economy.Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor and noted Big Tech critic, cites a telling example of this attitude. “I once had a conversation with a Silicon Valley consultant about search neutrality [the idea that search engine titans should not be able to favour their own content]. And he said, ‘We can’t code for that.’ I said this was a legal matter, not a technical one. But he just repeated, with a touch of condescension: ‘Yes, but we can’t code for it, so it can’t be done.’ The debate would be held on the technologist’s terms, or not at all.”All this reminds me of the cognitive bubble that financiers were in before (and in many cases after) 2008. Like the tech industry today, finance did a good job of using its money and political power to hold the debate over reform hostage to its own interests. Policy conversations were made as complicated as possible to keep “insiders” in control, even though the simple questions — is the financial system helping the real economy and society or not? — were often the best and most important.Cognitive capture of decision makers was rife because financiers and regulators lived and worked in the same echo chamber. Many bankers I knew seemed befuddled about why people were so angry with them. No wonder — they had never met any ordinary people before.All this is true when it comes to Big Tech today. “Silicon Valley talks mainly to itself,” says Vivek Wadhwa, a software entrepreneur and fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. “It’s all about connections here, and nobody wants to take on the big issues for fear of offending someone important.”Indeed, too many attempts at public “engagement” just end up making Silicon Valley executives seem more, rather than less, out of touch (think not only of Uber’s epic mistakes, but also of more subtle examples such as Mark Zuckerberg’s rambling, 6,000 word letter addressing the topic of fake news).The public worries about the economic and social effects of technology, and those worries are not going away. Some investors are even baking them into the valuations.“Big Tech and Silicon Valley have been among the most politically insulated sectors in the S&P 500, while financials and energy have been among the most closely scrutinised. Investors would be well-advised to think about how these roles may reverse in the current administration,” read a note from Strategas Research put out last week.

327;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-06-19T21:24:14Z;US tech stocks bounce back for best day of the year;Investors dive back into companies hit by recent sell-off;US technology stocks enjoyed their best day of 2017, as investors took advantage of the recent sell-off to dive back into some of the companies that have powered most of the stock market’s gains this year.Tech shares — especially big blue-chips such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft — have been the biggest driver of the US market’s climb to record highs this year, but suffered last week as some investors worried that they had become overvalued.After falling almost 4 per cent since June 8 in what some analysts dubbed a “tech wreck”, the S&P 500 technology index bounced back with a 1.7 per cent gain on Monday, its best daily rise since December 7 and extending this year’s rally to 19.1 per cent.Apple, the biggest listed US company, gained 2.9 per cent, chipmaker Nvidia rallied 3.8 per cent and Facebook rose 1.5 per cent, making tech the day’s best-performing sector and helping the broader S&P 500 index to a new record close.“We think the latest pullback in tech is more likely to represent a pause that refreshes some excess optimistic sentiment than it is the start of something nastier,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in a note.“Today’s tech companies look nothing like many of their 2000 counterparts, some of which were valued on silly things like ‘eyeballs’ given they had no earnings, and little prospect of ever having an earnings stream.”Investors have in recent years mostly fastened on to the “Faang” stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — as powerful growth stories, making their shares soar. But some analysts have advocated replacing Netflix with the much bigger Microsoft, a more important driver for the US stock market as a whole.The overall market capitalisation of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google now stands at just under $2.9tn, compared to the FTSE 100’s dollar value of $2.57tn, and the combined value of France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s Dax of almost $3tn.Some analysts and fund managers remain cautious, arguing that the optimism of equity investors stands in sharp contrast to the pessimism of bond markets. Peter Tchir, at Brean Capital, said that while the resumed tech rally was “key for the broad market resuming its upward trend”, he was still sceptical that it could last.“Today is positive, but such a big move on no news says more about broader liquidity than the fundamentals being solid,” he added.
328;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Facebook takes on TV and YouTube with long-form video push;Social network is wading into a crowded field in quest for eyeballs and ad dollars;"Video flooded on to Facebook three years ago when celebrities from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to talk-show host Oprah Winfrey had a pail of cold water poured over their heads. The “Ice Bucket Challenge” saw many more film themselves getting drenched, all to raise millions of dollars for research into the rare disease ALS, at the same time inadvertently changing how billions of consumers used the social network. Now, Facebook is searching for its Ice Bucket Challenge moment for longer-form video. The company is trying to convince users to watch programmes on the platform, as it hopes to compete with television and the plethora of online video platforms — from YouTube and Snap to Netflix and Amazon — for eyeballs and advertising dollars. The world’s largest social network is wading into a crowded field by funding original content, in an effort led by Ricky Van Veen, co-founder of comedy site College Humor. The company has also signed deals to stream live baseball in the US and football in Mexico, and launched a Facebook app for Apple and Android smart TVs. Facebook has already seen more users watch longer videos since it changed the news feed’s algorithm to prioritise them in January, the company told the FT. The app now also has a video tab in the US, where users can find video instead of having to flick through the news feed, like they would when searching YouTube. “What people do with the news feed a lot of the time is they have a few free minutes or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session, see everything that’s going on in the world. You don’t have a specific intention to watch a specific type of content,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, on the company’s last earnings call. “There’s this whole other use case around content, which is going . . . to the app or sitting down at TV because there’s some content that you want to watch and you want to go directly to it. And that’s what we’re trying to do with the video tab.”Some consumers may feel overwhelmed by all the content now available, from hundreds of cable channels to award-winning series from Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, YouTube and Snapchat Discover. But for Facebook, maintaining or increasing the time users spend on the network is key. If consumers want to watch more TV online, the social network wants to build a home for it. “We’re in an absolute war for time. This is just one more part of it,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG. Fidji Simo, vice-president of product at Facebook, says the company wants to be the best place to consume video. “What we’re hearing from people is that news feed is a great way to discover videos,” she says. “[But] they also want places they can go to consume this content on a more deterministic basis.” Facebook is funding others to create original content, but at a reported cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per episode, not the millions spent by Netflix. Ms Simo said Facebook was not targeting the “traditional long form model” but instead looking for shows around which it can build a community, just as it has with livestreamed video, such as the Ariana Grande charity concert in Manchester this month.“What is going to work best on mobile, in a social environment where interactivity matters and bringing people together matters? That is the unique angle that is still a very unproven model and that is why we are funding these efforts to figure it out,” explains Ms Simo. Ultimately, Facebook does not want to play the role of production company; it is simply funding publishers to experiment until it finds something that works. Then, it will try to design revenue-sharing arrangements to split money from “mid-roll” ads that look like TV commercial breaks. It is already testing ad breaks in both its Facebook Live streaming service and other video forms with a small number of partners.The social network has been searching for ways to continue to increase advertising revenue by creating new, more expensive formats. This is partly to offset a self-imposed limit on how many ads can appear in the news feed, a policy designed to avoid annoying users. Longer formats have several benefits, says Christopher Vollmer, global entertainment and media advisory leader at PwC, the professional services firm. People tend to be more likely to watch all of an ad accompanying a longer video, he says, and longer content has more capacity to carry multiple advertisements.Mr Vollmer compares the social network’s latest move to the shift made by MTV, the Viacom-owned cable channel, from showing music videos — “the original short form video” — to half-hour and hour-long reality shows including The Real World and Jersey Shore and scripted shows such as Beavis and Butt-Head and Teen Wolf.“For MTV, longer, more lifestyle-focused shows led to higher ratings and more viewing time, which translated into both better advertising monetisation and better branding environments for marketers,” he says.Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of digital marketing agency 360i, says Facebook should be able to offer the “best of both worlds”: a large video audience with precision ad targeting. It will probably not look to create content just for young people — like Snap or the creators that became famous on YouTube — but a range that appeals to its audience of all ages, she adds.Facebook’s interest in more professionally produced content also reflects recent concerns over the quality of user-generated video on the internet. Several global companies pulled advertising dollars from YouTube earlier this year, after their marketing messages appeared next to offensive or extremist content.“The desire of advertisers is quite simple: to go where the audience is going,” says Norm Johnston, global chief strategy and digital officer at WPP’s Mindshare. “The challenge for them is: how do they do that in a way that they are confident and comfortable that the brand is not going to be exposed to something unsafe or inappropriate? That’s where the pause button has been hit this year. They’re willing to resume play, but only where they feel it is safe.“Facebook sees an opportunity to perhaps migrate some of the TV spending into Facebook and also try to take some money away from YouTube and Snapchat.”But changing users’ behaviour could be hard, especially if the company wants to persuade them to watch video as a family on the living room screen. Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, the research group, says Facebook has been successful in pushing people to the smartphone screen, but it might be hard to persuade them to go back to a “lean-back kind of experience of Apple TV, Samsung and Roku.“When I think Facebook, I think connecting with friends and brand pages. I don’t think about sitting down on my couch to watch something on Facebook,” he says. To date, Facebook is being cautious, wary not to start an arms race with a rival like YouTube before it figures out what works for users and advertisers. But it also needs to be careful not to enter the market too slowly, avoiding the example of Yahoo, warns Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. The Silicon Valley pioneer took a $42m writedown on its video division in October 2015, admitting it could not find a way to make money from the cult comedy Community and a couple of other original series in which it had invested. “If Facebook does five programmes, let’s say with 20 episodes over a six-month period of time at $250,000 each, that would be an expense just not big enough to matter,” says Mr Wieser. “It needs to add another zero to that, and then they can qualify as a fourth . . . network [alongside traditional TV networks ABC, CBS and NBC].”Television companies are fighting back against the rise of technology platforms by rushing to follow their audiences to new screens and media sources, writes Shannon Bond.They have launched their own online video services, such as CBS All-Access and HBO Now and joined “skinny bundles” of internet-delivered channels. Skinny bundles such as Dish Network’s Sling TV, AT&T’s DirecTV Now and Google’s YouTube TV offer a smaller set of networks accessed online, without the need to pay for an expensive pay-TV package, at monthly rates that start at between $20 and $40.But TV owners are also pushing back against digital competitors’ claims that online advertising can replace television.“It’s the reach and the engagement that television offers that [makes it] still an incredibly great communication medium,” says Beth Rockwood, vice-president of portfolio research at Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting, whose networks include CNN and TBS.She pointed to research that Turner and Horizon Media, an independent media-buying agency, recently commissioned from Neustar. It found $1m invested in TV advertisements drove more sales and higher brand awareness than the same sum spent on digital advertising. In one example cited in the study, 40 per cent of movie ticket sales were the result of exposure to a television ad.The study also found that ads that ran with videos on social sites, such as YouTube and Facebook, delivered a relatively lower return on investment compared with ads that ran with professionally produced online video — even though the social and user-generated video reached as many as seven times more viewers.“Getting engagement is an art,” Ms Rockwood says. “This does bear out the fact that professionally produced content is just better at capturing people’s attention."
329;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-06-12T21:35:49Z;US tech stocks extend losses despite late recovery;Sector that is leading gains for year pulls back on concerns of stretched valuations;US technology stocks were under further pressure on Monday despite a late recovery from the day’s lows, with investors weighing concerns over a key driver for record-breaking share markets this year.After an abrupt rout on Friday that erased some 4 per cent, or $140bn in market value, from Wall Street’s best performing sector in 2017, technology shares in Asia and Europe buckled on Monday before selling pressure resumed in New York.Market strategists have for some time pointed to potentially stretched valuations for some of America’s biggest tech names, which have enjoyed a blistering rally this year. Until Friday, the S&P 500 tech sector was up 21.9 per cent for 2017, compared with 8.7 per cent for the broader benchmark.The pullback for tech was “way overdue given the extreme outperformance and positioning”, said Michael Wilson, a stock strategist at Morgan Stanley. “We don’t think it’s over and expect some follow-through this week.”However, Mr Wilson added that he would be “surprised” if this were the “end for technology stocks given the very strong earnings growth we are witnessing”.Apple shares slid further on Monday, closing down almost 2.5 per cent to $145.32, after falling more than 4 per cent earlier in the session, while the Nasdaq Composite ended the day down 0.5 per cent after falling as much as 1.6 per cent earlier. Netflix fell more than 4 per cent. Both stocks are trading below their 50-day moving averages, a key technical level that is watched by traders.Volatile Nvidia shares ended the day with a slight gain after falling much as 5 per cent at one point on Monday, following on from a tumble of almost 7 per cent on Friday.Among other US tech companies, Facebook slipped 0.8 per cent to $148.44 and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, was off 0.7 per cent to $942.90.“It is a healthy correction,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at SSGA.He said that tech, and more specifically the sector leaders, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet and Microsoft — known by various acronyms in the market such as Fang, FAANG and now FAAMG — have been contributing “more than their fair share to overall returns this year and they were probably due for a bit of a pullback”.That left tech as the weakest major S&P 500 sector performer on Monday but, as shares recovered from earlier lows, some in the market pointed to buyers entering.“It appears as though buyers have started to come in,” Mr Arone said.However, Peter Kenny, a senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory group, said that he expected “more air to be let out of this trade in coming weeks”. He added that tech remained “expensive” on a valuation basis when compared with other sectors.Before the slide began, tech shares were last Thursday priced at 19 times earnings over the next 12 months, from about 16 times in June 2016, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Investors had pushed valuations to fresh highs as they sought out investments in tech, which is seen as providing strong revenue growth even in a lacklustre economic climate, as expectations faded that a fiscal stimulus plan from President Trump’s administration would galvanise the US economy.The recent sell-off in tech has marked a sector rotation back towards those companies which had underperformed relatively, as investors put some funds back into shares of both energy and financial shares which have suffered selling.Further weakness in US tech on Monday was expected to weigh on the global sector. Across the Atlantic, the Stoxx Europe 600 Technology index, the benchmark for the region, fell 3.6 per cent. AMS, an Austrian supplier of censors to Apple, dropped 8.9 per cent and STMicroelectronics, a Swiss chipmaker, tumbled 9 per cent.In Asia, Tencent, the Chinese social network with the equal-biggest weighting in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, fell 2.5 per cent. Japan’s Topix tech sector closed down more than 1 per cent.
330;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-06-12T03:41:53Z;Asian tech stocks sink after Wall Street sell-off;;Tech stocks are among the worst performers in Asia on Monday after a late sell-off struck their US peers on Friday.The S&P 500 technology sector closed 2.7 per cent lower on June 9, its biggest one-day drop since May 17. At one point, the sub index was down as much as 4.2 per cent, prompting debate among investors as to whether the tech bubble had burst. Stocks such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix were down by more than 2 per cent.Tech stocks have been the big gainers in many global markets this year, and while the reason for Friday’s tumble was not immediately clear, some strategists suggested investors were locking in gains after strong runs.The uneasy sentiment spilled over into Asia today, hitting social network owners, game makers, semiconductor manufacturers and smartphone suppliers.Naver, the South Korean internet portal that owns Japanese messaging app Line, was down 5.3 per cent and the worst performer in the Kospi. Also weak were LG Display and LG Electronics. Netmarble, the recently listed mobile game maker, was also a poor performer, down 4 per cent.The likes of Hon Hai Precision Industry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Delta Electronics, all suppliers to Apple among others and major contributors to the Taiex’s rise to multi-year highs this year, were weighing on the Taiwanese stock market.Chinese social network Tencent, the equal-biggest weighting in the Hang Seng index, was down 1.2 per cent in Hong Kong and among the benchmark’s worst performers. AAC Technologies, an Apple supplier that has been the subject of a recent short seller attack, was worst off in the Hang Seng on Monday morning.Alps Electric, also an Apple supplier, was down 3.2 per cent, while semiconductor manufacturing machine maker Tokyo Electron dropped 2.7 per cent, putting them among the worst performers in the price-focused Nikkei 225.The Nasdaq shed 1.8 per cent on Friday, while the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent.Also lower was SoftBank, down 2.5 per cent. Shares in the telco and internet giant leapt higher on Friday after Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company in which it owns a stake, delivered a gasp-inducing revenue forecast.The tech sector in the Topix, down 1.2 per cent, was the worst performer in the Japanese benchmark. The Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index, a technology-focused benchmark, was down a more respectable 0.1 per cent.The Jasdaq and the Kosdaq, the Japanese and South Korean equivalents of the US’s Nasdaq, were down 0.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively.South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.9 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.2 per cent. Tech was the worst performing sector in the Hong Kong benchmark, down 2.3 per cent.China’s technology-focused Shenzhen Composite was also down 0.7 per cent.
331;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:21:58+0000;US tech shares on track for biggest drop in almost a year;;US technology shares tumbled abruptly at mid-day on Friday, leaving the sector on track for its heaviest drop since the day following last year’s Brexit vote.The S&P 500 technology sector dropped as much as 4.2 per cent, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index down 2.2 per cent.Many of the industry’s biggest names sustained heavy selling. Apple was off 4.2 per cent, Microsoft was down 3.9 per cent, Facebook declined 4.1 per cent, Alphabet dropped 3.7 per cent, Netflix tumbled 5.8 per cent lower, and Nvidia — which saw a 7 per cent rise a day earlier — flipped into the red to trade lower by 10 per cent.Market strategists were not immediately clear on what caused the sharp move, with some investors pointing to profit-taking as a potential rationale.“One theory might simply be that tech is overbought (after the recent rally) and market participants are rotating into financials and other underperforming sectors,” Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald told the Financial Times.Trading activity on one of the largest and oldest exchange-traded funds that tracks many of the biggest US tech groups surged to more than three times the average over the past month amid the abrupt sell-off in the sector.The PowerShares QQQ Trust, which is often just referred to by traders as the triple-Qs, saw its trading volume hit 45.3m shares by 1:56pm in New York. That compares with the 30-day average for that time of day of 13.6m, and total average volume of 23.8m, Bloomberg data show.The ETF tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, which includes the 100 largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq Composite. Among its biggest weightings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet. Those shares, and tech more broadly, have posted big gains so far this year and have helped to drive the broader market higher.“…rates stabilising … combined with the general concern over tech’s ability to continue outperforming goes a long way in explaining the reversal,” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.
332;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-05-29T15:50:21Z;Competition is not for losers — even in the digital era;The ‘winner takes all’ business model is not the best match for our digital futures;Two very different and seemingly contradictory tales are told about the economy: call them the Disrupt and Decay schools of storytelling. The first says that we are living through an era of unprecedented, disruptive change. I heard that story cubed on a recent visit to Silicon Valley, where entrepreneurs enthused about the effect of applying artificial intelligence in different industries. “I try to resist hyperbole,” one investor told me. “But I think AI will be as transformational as fire.”The Decay storytellers counter that the real problem is a lack of innovation rather than a surfeit of it. Contrary to West Coast mythmaking, developed economies are living through one of the least innovative periods in modern history.According to research from the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington-based think-tank, dynamism is in retreat and the rate of new business formation in the US has been declining. Since the great recession of 2008, more firms have died than have been born. That lack of new competition has created the golden age of the corporate incumbent, rather than the insurgent. There has been a marked concentration of market power in many industries and regions. As a result, corporate profits have risen to a record 9.4 per cent of output.Which story we collectively believe has big implications for economic and social policy. If we accept the first tale then there is no need to worry much about competition. If we truly stand on the cusp of revolutionary technological change, then the market should do it all for us. “Competition is just a click away,” as the saying goes.Join us on June 19th for a conversation about automation and what it means for the future world of work.In this world, the main focus of policy should be how to mitigate social risk. Whole regions, and groups of people, are likely to be tossed around or marginalised in this entrepreneurial maelstrom. The public conversation may be about sharing wealth, as much as creating it. That partly explains why so many tech entrepreneurs have come round to the idea of a universal basic income.But the lessons are clearly very different if we believe the second story. In that undynamic world we should be a lot more concerned about creating incentives for greater innovation and be far more interventionist in tackling market dominance.To generalise heroically, the Disrupt story appears to prevail in the US, with the administration of President Donald Trump seemingly committed to a winner-takes-all economic model. That spirit is perhaps summed up by Peter Thiel, the tech investor, who declared that: “Competition is for losers.”But Europe, which has long grown used to a low-growth economy, appears more familiar with the Decay story. The EU certainly believes in a far more activist competition policy. It recently slapped a €110m fine on Facebook for breaking its promises not to share user data following its acquisition of WhatsApp in 2014.At a conference last week for the Oxford Centre for Competition Law and Policy, there was a lively debate about how far competition policy should be rethought for our digital age. Should it be further broadened to encompass concepts of privacy, discriminatory pricing and national data security? Should it even tackle those who seek to game the online advertising market and attract revenue-generating clicks by peddling fake news?From the US perspective, European regulators appear like lion tamers dealing with kittens. The European players in the digital economy do not amount to much. The five US platform companies, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google have a combined stock market valuation of $2.4tn, bigger than France’s CAC 40 or Germany’s Dax.Ariel Ezrachi, an Oxford law professor, argues that policymakers have to recognise that new dynamics of competition are at play.Increasingly, competition in the digital era is between tech company monopolies that have access to massive data sets and vast computing power, creating formidable barriers to entry.“The narrative pushed by some companies is not the least convincing or credible,” says Prof Ezrachi. “No one wants to see competition agencies intervene for the sake of it. But neither do we want them to go to sleep as a result of intellectual or regulatory capture.”Competition policy has long been viewed predominantly as a tool to promote economic efficiency. But it remains a political and social construct. As such it must be reinvented to match the needs of our times, whichever economic story you believe.john.thornhill@ft.comCustomers consider more than price in competition / From Philip Haberman, Radlett, Herts, UK
333;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Controversial EU rules could make life trickier for tech groups;Facebook, Netflix, YouTube and others face being treated like media companies;"Facebook, Netflix, YouTube and the German state broadcaster ZDF are very different businesses. But they may soon all have to abide by the same rule book.A controversial overhaul of the EU’s rules on video content will sprawl across sectors, dragging everyone from public broadcasters to social media into the same regulatory framework, according to draft proposals being negotiated.For supporters of the move, the law would end a regulatory no man’s land for the likes of YouTube and Facebook, obliging them to follow the same rules as normal broadcasters on issues such as hate speech.Critics argue that it is a misguided attempt to rope internet companies into inappropriate rules — potentially throwing media diversity and even freedom of speech into doubt.Internet streaming services such as Netflix, which are already regulated as video providers, will be affected by new rules that dictate that 30 per cent of content on the platforms needs to be European.“Quotas are frustrating for us because there is no real evidence to show that they work,” said Colin Bortner, Netflix’s director of global public policy. “[They] divert investment away from high-quality European films and series that can attract a global audience.”The company also faces paying levies of up to 26 per cent of revenues on its business in France, which it says will decrease the amount it invests in individual European works and distort how much it invests in individual member countries.Mr Bortner says the proposed rate “is fantastically high”, saying that it would mean consumers in one market subsidising those in another. “Ultimately, Spanish consumers would be paying a higher price to meet our levy obligations in France. That’s because we don’t have 28 individual businesses; we are producing content on a pan-European and global basis and what happens in one member state impacts investments and prices in another.”Technology companies that offer video such as Facebook, YouTube and Amazon are also facing an overhaul. All three companies declined to comment.But a last-minute change to draft version being worked on by ministers means that for any platform that uses video content as an “essential” part of the service must abide by rules laid down in the EU’s audiovisual media services directive.“It used to be a directive for sector specific issue,” says one diplomat who opposed the measure. “It will now police any moving picture on any screen.”The consequences for the world’s biggest technology companies that have put video at the heart of their business strategies — including Google, which owns YouTube, Facebook and Amazon — are likely to be significant.For the first time, the businesses would be legally obliged to come up with measures to ferret out videos that contain hate speech, incitement to terrorism or simply harm the “moral development” of children.John Carr, an adviser to the UK government on online child safety, says: “Social media platforms — especially Facebook — must be feeling under siege at the moment. [This directive] is just another trebuchet.”YouTube and Facebook already have some measures in place. Users can flag content as inappropriate, while security services have heaped pressure on social networks to do more to combat use by terrorist groups.Facebook’s own , detailed guidelines on moderating content that ranged from self-harm to Nazi imagery were revealed last week. The measures are generally undertaken on a voluntary basis but these groups now face strict legal obligations — and potential sanctions if they are deemed to be not doing enough.Because the new rule is a directive, individual countries will have to transpose it into national law, leaving scope for countries who want the big platforms to take more responsibility — such as France, Germany and Italy — to introduce stricter rules and sanctions.A minister in Germany, for instance, has already mooted fines of €50m if a social network fails to take down hate speech. France is considering applying a European content quota of 50 per cent for all video services.“The country-of-origin principle is definitely under threat. The EU is moving in a different direction,” says Mr Bortner.Critics argue that the new rules could encourage self-censorship. “You defend yourself with excessively broad terms of service that allow you to delete whatever you want whenever you need it,” said Joe McNamee, executive director of EDRI, a group that promotes digital rights.This leaves internet companies as judge, jury and executioner when it comes to determining whether content is appropriate. “You are outsourcing your law enforcement to private actors,” says one EU diplomat.Social media platforms — especially Facebook — must be feeling under siege"
334;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Social networks face tougher EU oversight on video content;Facebook, Twitter and others may have to abide by same regulations as broadcasters;Facebook, Twitter and other social networks face being roped into EU laws on hate speech, after ministers agreed a controversial overhaul of the bloc’s rules for video content.Social media platforms where video forms an “essential” function will have to abide by some of the same rules that apply to the EU’s broadcasters, giving countries more leeway to crack down on internet companies on issues such as hate speech and incitement to terrorism.The changes to the audiovisual media services directive will also hit video-sharing websites such as YouTube.How much responsibility companies such as Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have for the content that users post has become an intense debate with Brussels pushing for greater oversight of the platforms.Online video on-demand providers such as Netflix will also be affected by new rules that dictate how much European content they show. After last-minute negotiations on Tuesday, ministers agreed that 30 per cent of content on such services must be European.Amendments to rules on jurisdiction mean that Netflix could face paying levies of up to 26 per cent of revenues on its business in France. At the moment, EU law dictates that countries can only charge the levies designed to prop up national film industries on domestic businesses. But the new proposal would allow countries to levy fees simply if a video on-demand provider has customers in that country.Tech industry groups criticised the measure. James Waterworth from the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which counts Google and Facebook among its members, said that the proposal was “vague and unworkable” in parts.Critics also pointed out that there had been no impact assessment on the effect of roping social networks into the rules, which went beyond the initial proposal from the European Commission.The new rules will become law after negotiations between the EU’s member states and the European Parliament, which has backed similar moves. A majority of ministers voted in favour of the position, despite vociferous opposition to the measure from some member states.In a compromise designed to win over critics of the proposal, livestreaming — where people on social networks broadcast themselves — was not included in the proposal.Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s digital chief, said: “We need to take into account new ways of watching videos, and find the right balance to encourage innovative services, promote European films, protect children and tackle hate speech in a better way.”
335;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-05-19T15:14:51Z;Okja — a rollicking fable;Netflix’s Cannes debut includes star turns from Tilda Swinton and a CGI super-pig;It’s just an everyday story of a girl and her flatulent, genetically engineered super-pig. Welcome to the wonderfully imaginative world of Korean film-maker Bong Joon-Ho, who has captivated Cannes (or most of it) with Okja, a rollicking fable that takes in corporate greed, swine husbandry and scattergun scatology. The slapstick comedy, heated confrontation and bestial foot-stamping was not confined to the screen, however. There was some of this too at Okja’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.The first boos greeted the Netflix logo (the streaming giant has been banned from future editions for refusing to release its movies in cinemas). Then there was outright uproar when a projection snafu resulted in Tilda Swinton’s head being cut off. Some of us wondered if this was Netflix getting its own back or Cannes teaching Netflix a lesson about restricting films to undersized screens. It turned out to be a more mundane technical issue — but the offending projectionist would still be wise to keep a low profile.Eventually Swinton reappeared, safely recapitated, and we were plunged into Okja’s world once more. The ever-shape-shifting Swinton, who excelled as a harpyish villainess in Bong’s previous film, Snowpiercer, does so again here as Lucy Mirando, peroxide-haired head of a dynastic agrochemical empire that promises to end global food shortages by cultivating a breed of GM pig.Mirando has sent specimens to various locations across the world to monitor their development, and so we are transported to lush Korean mountains where farm girl Mija (An Seo Hyun) spends her days roaming the hills blissfully with her oversized sow, Okja. She rides it, feeds it persimmons and pats its bottom to aid bowel movement. The CGI beast has a convincing blubbery heft and a bashful expression — like Babe on steroids — and Hyun does a fine job acting opposite God-knows-what.It’s the story that dominated the world’s premier film festival: we discuss how Netflix is reshaping the future of cinemaOkja, it turns out, is the world’s premiere super-pig and is to be honoured at a ceremony in New York. But Mirando is telling porkies: the corporation’s supposed eco-friendliness is pure greenwash, and in fact Okja faces a sticky (possibly barbecue-sauced) end. When Mija gets wind of this, she embarks on a rescue mission, eventually teaming up with a band of animal rights activists led by do-gooder Paul Dano (all melting eyes and dripping sincerity).Bong’s wildly inventive visual style is captivating and as action sequences take over there is never a dull moment and seldom a sane one. Even the more earnest moments of sermonising on animal cruelty are balanced by exuberant humour, often deadpan. At times the more cartoonish elements do get out of control: Jake Gyllenhaal hams it up as a gawky and garrulous TV naturalist who makes Steve Irwin look morose. And the basic set-up — a bond between a child and a big, friendly giant — is familiar from everything from Pete’s Dragon to The Iron Giant and, yes, The BFG. But Bong has such an idiosyncratic vision that Okja always feels fresh. Like Snowpiercer, this brings much-needed new life to a popular cinematic landscape overcrowded with ageing franchises and endless reboots.Quite what Okja is doing In Competition at Cannes is debatable, but if there’s one place it certainly does belong, it’s on a full-size cinema screen.festival-cannes.com
336;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-05-19T13:44:16Z;Director David Michôd on the Netflix effect;The Australian’s latest film marks a further step forward for streaming services;"By the end of 2010, David Michôd felt that something had gone wrong. The disappointment took him by surprise. Earlier that year, the release of the Australian director’s first film, the brutally good crime story Animal Kingdom, had unfolded as the stuff of dreams. While audiences were healthy, the reviews were adulatory. More than one described Michôd as the new Martin Scorsese. Awards piled up. Quentin Tarantino was a vocal supporter. The director waited for the offers of bold and intriguing Hollywood projects.“Then there was this wave of sadness,” he says. “Because it felt like I was having a moment, and it turned out there was nowhere to put it.” Now, Michôd is sitting in a central London hotel, jet-lagged and likeably downbeat. “I don’t want to understate how thrilling it was. But there was this very stressful period seeing what [it] was possible to do next — because I didn’t want to make superhero movies, but I also didn’t want to spend my whole life working with a couple of million bucks and some gaffer tape. And those were the choices.”Seven years later, the eventual solution comes with the film we’re here to discuss: War Machine, a crackerjack satire of the downfall of American general Glen McMahon amid the bedlam of the Afghanistan war. McMahon is the lightly fictional alias of the real-life Stanley McChrystal, whose leadership of the US operation in Kabul ended with an exposé in Rolling Stone by journalist Michael Hastings, painting him as hubristic and his staff boorishly disloyal to then President Obama. The piece became a bestselling book, The Operators. On screen, McMahon is played by Brad Pitt.For both these reasons, you might expect the movie to be coming soon to a cinema near you. Instead, aside from a small theatrical run to allow it to qualify for awards, it will play on the TVs and laptops of subscribers to its backer, the streaming service Netflix.This wasn’t always the intention. Originally, the film was to be produced by Pitt’s company, Plan B, with funds from Hollywood distributor New Regency, whose recent projects include Oscar winners 12 Years a Slave and Birdman. But in 2015, a clash over budgets stalled the movie. The distribution rights were abruptly put back up for sale. Shortly afterwards, amid some raised eyebrows, it was announced that the old-guard New Regency had been replaced as Plan B’s partner by Netflix, paying a reported $60m to come on board. Michôd set to making his film.For Netflix, War Machine is a landmark in the escalation of hostilities with the film business, fuelled by its rejection of cinemas as the place a movie should really be seen. The conflict appears to be coming to the boil. Ahead of the Cannes festival this week, organisers reacted to the presence of two films produced by the company — Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories and Bong Joon-ho’s Okja — by mandating a French cinema release for competition entries. While Netflix executives are famously publicity shy, chief executive Reed Hastings broke cover to bemoan “the establishment closing ranks against us”. Then came the news that head of content Ted Sarandos was bidding to become president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, an idea that American film journalist Anne Thompson described as like a fox in a henhouse.It feels like there is now this avenue to let film-makers realise ambitious visions with the resources we needOn screen — 93m of them, according to Netflix — the battle is about to get fiercer still. In the past, what original films the company produced were distinctly low-profile, Ava DuVernay’s study of race and prison 13th and the story of African child soldiers Beasts of No Nation by some way the most visible among modestly scaled documentaries and Adam Sandler movies. Now, a splashy enough upgrade beckons to suggest a whole new model.Aside from Michôd, Baumbach and Bong, the Netflix production slate has been expensively filled with projects from established directors such as Angelina Jolie and David Ayer (End of Watch), up-and-comers Duncan Jones (Moon) and Jeremy Saulnier (Green Room), and, in the period drama Mudbound from director Dee Rees, a film already installed as an Oscar contender. All this is being overseen by head of production Scott Stuber, newly poached from studio giant Universal.And so, among film-makers, Michôd is one of several canaries down the mine. “Working with Netflix has honestly been nothing but exciting,” he says. “We needed meaningful support to make this, because it’s contentious and unusual and doesn’t lend itself to obvious marketing templates. And they seem to relish that opportunity.” He pauses, aware that he risks sounding like a publicist. “It just feels like there is now this avenue to let film-makers realise ambitious visions with the resources we need. And thank God for it, because there were a couple of years after Animal Kingdom where I thought, I don’t know how to work.”Michôd was 37 at the time of his debut. Once the euphoria faded, he found himself regretting that he hadn’t broken through 10 years earlier, when hip young directors such as Paul Thomas Anderson and Spike Jonze could be funded by the boutique arms of major studios. By 2010, the film business was reshaping as a two-tier world of blockbusters and the micro-budget. Eventually, craving a bigger canvas but unwilling to make a comic-book movie, Michôd’s second film would be The Rover, a fascinating dystopian curate’s egg that cost $8.5m, all the rave reviews in the world barely upping the $5m for which Animal Kingdom had been made.Then Pitt hired him for War Machine. “And Netflix came along with this incredible reach.” Here on the promotional trail, sipping espresso in a plush hotel room, the scene feels like any day in the movie business. But up close, you notice differences in the relationship between Netflix and its film-makers. In cinemas, opening-weekend box office has become Darwinian, films vanishing if they fail to pull a crowd instantly. In theory, Netflix offers a remedy — a long-term place among the “content” avail­able to a huge subscriber base who might not know they want to watch your film, but have logged on to watch something.“Letting a movie find an audience is incredibly hard to do in actual cinemas now,” Michôd says. “With Netflix, the movie lives there. You’re still competing for attention, but as a film-maker it eases my anxiety and makes me braver knowing my whole career doesn’t hinge on how many people I hypnotise into coming on the opening weekend.”For Michôd, it’s a curious turn of events, the price of the big league being the loss of the big screen, well enough funded to make great cinema to then be seen on iPads. But, he says, hasn’t that been the way since the dawn of video? Even on Animal Kingdom, it felt odd spending weeks on pristine sound mixes for high-end cinemas that would, he knew, be enjoyed by a fraction of his audience.“Movies live mostly on TVs, and TVs are pretty good these days. If I’m to be wholly honest, it’s how I watch movies.” Then he smiles ruefully, and says he still signed off on the finished version of War Machine only after seeing it on a giant screen at the Los Angeles headquarters of Technicolor.“I do have to admit,” he says, “that really was a lot of fun.”Photographs: Leo Goddard; Francois Duhamel/Netflix"
337;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-05-17T19:48:06Z;Tech stocks sink amid political turmoil;;The FANGs are getting de-FANGed by the growing sense of unease that the Trump presidency has cast over US markets.The tech sector was the second-biggest laggard on the S&P 500 today, falling 2.35 per cent and being edged out only by financials’ woeful performance.Even some of Wall Street’s favourite tech stocks were feeling the pinch as the Trump administration’s push for business-friendly policies like tax reform and deregulation became overshadowed by the drama surrounding the departure of FBI director James Comey and Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser.The so-called FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet — were all trading lower on Wednesday afternoon. Facebook was down 2.5 per cent, Netflix was off 3.2 per cent, Amazon fell 1.8 per cent and Alphabet shares were 1.8 per cent lower.Even mighty Apple declined 3 per cent, and Microsoft was 2.3 per cent lower. Some of the steepest falls were seen by chipmaker Nvidia, down 6 per cent, and semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices, which was down nearly 12 per cent.The short-circuited performance of tech stocks comes alongside a wider fall in US equities with political jitters taking hold after a steady drumbeat of negative headlines from Washington.
338;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-04-26T16:55:47Z;Netflix’s debut European bond sale draws heavy demand;Investors put aside concerns over group’s substantial cash burn in €1.3bn sale;Netflix saw a flood of demand for a €1.3bn bond sale on Wednesday, as supply-starved junk debt investors put aside concerns around the US streaming service’s substantial cash burn to get a piece of its debut euro deal.The sub investment-grade rated company announced the deal on Monday as a €1bn 10-year bond to help fund its international expansion and planned shift to developing more original content.Netflix then increased the size of the deal to €1.3bn on the back of strong demand on Wednesday, with one investor who bought the bond told that the deal had drawn more than €5bn of orders by midday.The deluge of orders came despite Netflix’s substantial cash burn, overturning the received wisdom that junk-rated borrowers need to demonstrate they can generate enough cash to service their debt.Netflix, whose shares touched a record high on Tuesday, burnt through more than US$1.8bn of free cash flow in the 12 months ending on March 31, according to the bond’s offering memorandum.“The amount they are spending on content is accelerating and they’re going to be burning cash for the next few years,” said Mark Wade, a senior partner at Rogge Global Partners. “And it’s all going to be financed by debt — they’re going to be doing a big benchmark bond at this time of year regularly to fund that.”Netflix has already raised $3.4bn of bond finance in the US high-yield market.The new euro bond deal also lacks key protections that investors usually demand to lend to riskier borrowers. The bond’s terms contain no debt incurrence covenants, which prevent companies from raising more debt than investors think is sustainable.These covenants are usually a standard feature for Single B rated bonds — with Moody’s and S&P rating Netflix’s deal B1 and B+, respectively.Investors buying the deal will look to the US-listed company’s more than $65bn market cap for comfort, however, while yields on offer look generous compared with Netflix’s $1bn note yielding 4.5 per cent that has a narrower spread over the relevant sovereign benchmark.The company began marketing the euro bond at 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent yields on Wednesday, before pricing at 3.625 per cent.While this will hand Netflix its lowest ever coupon on a public debt raise, analysts at research firm CreditSights said in a Monday report titled Buy Netflix and Chill that they thought that the bond would outperform, even if pricing came as tight as 3.25 per cent.Mr Wade also said the yields that the deal was initially marketed at were “more generous than expected”, adding that the deal was likely to perform well in the secondary market.“While it is Single B, the market cap means many guys will view it as Double B, and you’ll get investment grade crossover guys dipping down to buy,” he said.“Also, given the post French election euphoria, people want to get some duration and a 10-year non-call life bond certainly offers duration.”High-yield bonds typically have embedded call options, which allow the borrower to repay them ahead of maturity at a lower than usual cost. In contrast, the Netflix deal’s “non-call life” structure offers investors more upside in the form of price appreciation if the company does well.One high-yield fund manager said that while he had placed an order for the deal given the generous yields, he was particularly concerned that any potential equity market volatility could filter through to bond prices.“There’s a really high chance you come in one day and find the stock down 30 per cent because this is an increasingly competitive space with big beasts such as Amazon and Google getting involved,” he said. “But unfortunately, the bond offers a 90 to 100 basis point spread discount to the dollar notes, and that’s very hard to turn down.”

Two investors said they thought the junk-rated company might also increase the deal’s size, on the back of strong demand.Despite the bond’s sub investment-grade B1 and B+ ratings from Moody’s and S&P, the deal has none of the usual protections that investors often demand to lend to riskier borrowers.Netflix is far from generating the cash needed to service its growing debt pile, burning through more than $1.8bn of free cash flow in the 12 month’s ending March 31, according to the bond’s documentation.Investors buying the deal will look to the US-listed company’s more than $65bn market cap for comfort, however, while yields on offer look generous compared to Netflix’s $1bn note yielding 4.5 per cent that has a narrower spread over the relevant sovereign benchmark.Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are running the deal.
340;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Nasdaq Composite breaches 6,000 for the first time;Fang stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — lead the charge;The Nasdaq Composite breached the 6,000 level for the first time on Tuesday as investors pile into technology and smaller companies with strong growth prospects amid concerns Donald Trump will be unable to spark inflation through tax cuts and big public spending plans.The rally, which extended the tech-heavy benchmark’s double-digit gain for the year, also saw the Russell 2000 index of small capitalisation stocks hit a new all-time peak.Until this month, Wall Street’s post-election rise has been driven by “Trumpflation” expectations that a Republican-controlled Washington will usher in a sweeping pro-business agenda including deregulation, tax cuts and a $1tn infrastructure plan.But recent data showing unexpected weakening in consumer prices and signs Mr Trump is stumbling in his domestic agenda has reset forecasts, leading investors to hunt for companies with underlying growth prospects regardless of the macroeconomic environment.“This is a risk-on rally but not a reflation rally — one of the characteristics of this market year-to-date has been a strong outperformance by growth over value,” said Russ Koesterich, portfolio manager at BlackRock’s Global Allocation fund.Renewed appetite for technology stocks and a rally in the so-called “Fangs” — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet — has spurred a near 12 per cent gain for the Nasdaq in 2017, well ahead of the S&P 500’s rise of 6.5 per cent.Fang stocks have collectively added $245.8bn to their market values since the end of last year. All have hit new record highs this month.

According to Moody’s, the sector accounted for 55 per cent of the $1.3tn in total US corporate cash held overseas in 2016 with companies like Apple reluctant to repatriate profits and face a comparatively high American tax bill.If the cash were moved to the US, it could be used to fund shareholder-friendly initiatives, like share buybacks and dividends, as well as increased capital spending and acquisitions.Tax reform is “acting like a huge carrot” as “lower corporate tax rates help the bottom line and relieve some of the fears of the excessive valuations that are in the market”, said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at RW Baird.Geopolitical risks have also receded, with investors welcoming the likely victory of centrist Emmanuel Macron, a mainstream economic reformer, over rightwing populist Marine Le Pen in next month’s French presidential run-off.Wall Street investors will also closely scrutinise earnings from technology companies, with reporting picking up steam towards the end of this week.

Such optimism is understandable when you can also boast, during first-quarter earnings, that Netflix subscribers had spent more than 500m hours “enjoying the films of Adam Sandler”.Even resuscitating the career of Mr Sandler is simpler than defying the limits of the US population, however. There are about 117m households in the US, not all of them interested in spending at least $8 a month on streaming television and movies. Netflix reported 51m US memberships during Monday night’s results, up an impressive 1.4m from the end of last year, but the wall is real.To give a sense of potential international growth, Netflix pointed to the billions of users of Google and Facebook. But those are ad-supported. There is no precedent for a paid subscription service conquering the world, the way Mr Hastings envisages. That does not diminish the success in attracting 48m non-US subscribers, up 3.5m in three months.New viewers are attracted by Netflix’s original content such as House of Cards. This is mind-bogglingly expensive. Netflix this year intends to burn $2bn of cash, net of incoming cash, mainly on making and buying new TV and movie content, compared with negative free cash flow of $2.8bn over the past two years.At the same time, it faces an ever stiffer challenge from Amazon, which gives video streaming to members of its Prime shopping service, makes and sells its own TV streaming devices, and has deeper pockets thanks, in part, to its highly profitable Amazon Web Services division.Even if Netflix does manage to keep growing, the fiercer competition could delay or derail entirely its opportunity to make serious profits. Yet on Monday evening the shares hit an all-time high, giving Netflix an enterprise value of more than $66bn on $822m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the past 12 months. Investors share Mr Hastings’ optimism. Like the title of Mr Sandler’s first, lesser-known movie, they are all Going Overboard.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
343;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-04-17T23:56:09Z;Netflix nears 100m subscriber milestone;Company to spend more than $1bn marketing content as growth in members slows;Netflix is closing in on 100m subscribers and will spend more than $1bn this year marketing programmes such as House of Cards, The Crown and Orange is the New Black to keep reeling in new viewers.But with subscriber gains slower than expected in the first quarter of the year, the streaming video company is urging investors to stop judging it based on member growth and instead focus on revenue and global operating margins to measure progress.“We have come to see these quarterly variances [in subscription growth] as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV,” said Reed Hastings, chief executive, in a letter to shareholders.Ten-year-old Netflix has expanded aggressively across the globe and spends lavishly to produce original TV shows and films as it faces growing competition in digital video. It has promised “material profits” this year, but is also facing a slowing rate of new member sign-ups to fund its content costs a year after it made a big push into 130 new markets.Netflix on Monday said that it added 4.95m members in the first three months of the year, fewer than the 5.2m it had forecast.Additions were slower than expected in both the US, where 1.42m new subscribers signed up, and internationally, where it added 3.53m new members. In the first half of the year, Netflix expects to add 8.15m net new subscribers, compared with 8.42m in the same period in 2016.Shares initially dipped 3 per cent in after-hours trading in New York, before recovering to rise 1.3 per cent to $149.15. Netflix stock has gained 55 per cent from a year ago when the company first said it would cross the 100m subscriber mark “some time” in 2017.The slower subscriber growth was partly because of the mix of programming in the quarter, Mr Hastings said. For example, the new season of House of Cards, which last year debuted in the first quarter, has been pushed into the second quarter this year.“Though the quarter included several solid new shows, it seemed to lack a strong universal new hit,” said William Power, analyst with Baird, in a note ahead of the earnings announcement.Still, lower content costs in the first three months of the year helped Netflix achieve its most profitable quarter ever. It also marked its first quarter of international profit.Overall, net income rose more than six-fold to $178.2m, or 40 cents a share, from $27.7m, or 6 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts had forecast earnings of 37 cents a share, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Revenue rose 35 per cent to $2.64bn from $1.96bn a year ago, in line with analysts’ expectations.The market is just so vast. Think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. Really, we’re competing with sleepThe streaming video industry has become more crowded in recent years as companies from Google and Amazon to AT&T and Dish have begun offering streaming video, with many services including live television channels that do not require expensive pay-TV packages.Hulu, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner, is getting ready to unveil its own live TV offering.Netflix has been ploughing money into original content to keep viewers tuned in, and expects to spend another $6bn this year. It expects to have negative $2bn in free cash flow this year and said it “anticipate[s] negative free cash flow to accompany our rapid growth for many years”.Amazon has also emerged as a force in entertainment with original programmes such as The Man in the High Castle, the Oscar-nominated film Manchester by the Sea, and a new deal to stream National Football League games. It is expected to spend $4.5bn on video this year, according to analysts from JPMorgan.Asked during Netflix’s earnings call with analysts about competition from Amazon, Mr Hastings said: “The market is just so vast. Think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. Really, we’re competing with sleep.”

Netflix stock has gained 55 per cent from a year ago when the company first said it would cross the 100m subscriber mark “some time” in 2017, boosted by an ambitious expansion to 130 new countries.The company added 4.95m members in the first three months of the year, fewer than the 5.2m it had forecast.

345;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:28+0000;Watch it while it lasts: our golden age of television;A revolution in the way we watch has led to a creative renaissance in TV, from The Sopranos to Transparent;"For David Chase, HBO was the last port of call. He had spent the previous year shopping his idea for a new drama series to the big broadcasters. One by one, they passed. Fox wanted simpler storylines. CBS asked why the main character had to be in therapy. ABC said there was too much swearing. All of them found it hard to imagine audiences warming to the show’s protagonist, a surly gangster called Tony Soprano.HBO, a cable network, had less money, fewer viewers and lower prestige than the broadcasters but was willing to take a risk on The Sopranos. Its executives were unsure about giving the show’s creator the control he sought over the project, however — until HBO’s key decision-maker, Chris Albrecht, agreed to hear Chase out in person. “He talked about his vision,” Albrecht told the writer Brett Martin. “By the time he was finished, I thought, ‘Wow.’”HBO’s bet proved one of the most lucrative in television history. The Sopranos, which ran for six series and won 21 Emmys, drove up subscriptions and earned the network millions in DVD sales. Within three years of the show taking to air in 1999, the upstart cable channel was more profitable than any of the broadcasters.The Sopranos didn’t just transform its parent channel, it transformed TV. Today, HBO competes with FX, Showtime, Netflix, Amazon and others in a creative race to the top. “Our job is not to get people to watch the 8.30pm lead into the 9pm news,” Joe Lewis, head of original programming at Amazon Studios, told me. “Our job is to make the greatest TV shows on the planet.”Chase originally conceived of The Sopranos as a movie. For more than 20 years, he had worked as a writer and producer of TV drama but had come to hate its suffocating formal constraints. In middle age, he yearned to satisfy his artistic soul. At the time, that meant making feature films, in the tradition of his idols: auteurs such as Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick and Roman Polanski.Today, a writer who cherishes a personal vision would have no qualms about taking it to the small screen. TV is the place to go if you want to make art and money at the same time. Paul Weitz, a screenwriter and director whose credits include American Pie and About a Boy, is currently at work on the fourth season of Mozart in the Jungle for Amazon Studios. “Your agent used to say, ‘Don’t do TV, it will hurt your film career,’” he recalls. “Now it’s the other way around.”Every creative industry is engaged in a civil war. The creatives — whether writers, painters or musicians — want to play with new forms of expression; the capitalists prefer to go with what worked last time. But sometimes the two sides come together, on equal terms, in gloriously fertile equilibrium. We call these periods golden ages.***Fabien Accominotti, a sociologist at the London School of Economics, has studied the Paris art market between 1870 and 1930, when a succession of radically innovative movements emerged — Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism — along with a new class of superstar artists, such as Monet and Picasso. Reading art history books, it is easy to assume that this flourishing was a happy accident coinciding with the arrival of some exceptionally gifted artists. Accominotti argues that to understand the art, you need to follow the money.The Parisian golden age emerged out of the collapse of a system that penalised artistic innovation. For most of the 19th century, the Académie des Beaux-Arts, a state-sanctioned institution, dominated the production and consumption of French art. A jury of academicians decided which paintings were exhibited at the Salon, the main forum for collectors to view new work. The academy set strict rules on artistic expression, and preferred idealised scenes from classical mythology to anything resembling contemporary life. For the most part, the art that resulted was staid and predictable, painted by skilled but anonymous technicians.Since the academy decided which paintings made it into the Salon and how prominently they were displayed, any artist trying to make a living from his work had little choice but to follow its rule book. But the rapidly growing population of young artists in Paris chafed against such strictures. After a loose-knit group of renegades, later to become known as the Impressionists, began staging their own exhibitions, the academy’s monopoly was supplanted by a decentralised network of galleries, dealers, critics and artists. Paris’s golden age began.Commercial galleries sprang up around town, increasing more than twentyfold over the period studied by Accominotti. The galleries, each with their own distinctive character, served as shop windows for artists to display their work to a new audience of middle-class collectors.Independent critics became highly influential, since they helped customers discern who was doing the most exciting work. A new breed of dealers, such as Paul Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard, temperamentally sympathetic to artists, acted as middlemen. The artists themselves, liberated from the constraints of the system, were free to pursue radical new ideas. Individual artists were celebrated — and remunerated — as they never were under the reign of the academy. Paris became a global magnet for artistic talent. Creative originality became a route to commercial success instead of a barrier to it.***The current golden age of TV also emerged from a crumbling system. Since its beginning, the US TV industry had been dominated by NBC, ABC and CBS (the “big three” were joined by a fourth, Fox, in 1986). The broadcasters had a template for storytelling that they expected writers to adhere to. The action had to be shaped around an invisible grid of ad breaks and schedules. A drama series needed to be a string of self-contained narratives that could be watched in any order (hence the prevalence of shows set in police stations and hospitals — a crime can be solved, a patient saved, within the hour). That made it easier to sell the series on, since whoever bought it could air it out of sequence, and viewers could dip in and out as they liked. Since many of a show’s viewers arrived by accident, and there was every chance they would leave at any moment, it was crucial they should never be made to work hard. The more familiar the storylines and character types, the better — hence the prevalence of mavericks who get results. Some creatives were able to smuggle in depth and novelty but, for the most part, they were required to deliver the least objectionable work rather than the best. No wonder a writer with creative ambition dreamt of making movies.By the 1990s, the broadcasters’ hegemony was threatened by a convergence of new technologies. Cable and satellite channels were multiplying, and DVD viewing was increasingly popular. The first TiVo boxes — digital video recorders — shipped in 1999. A sea change in TV viewing was under way. As Laura Kennedy, an executive vice-president at Lionsgate, put it: “Streaming started with DVDs. That’s when people started to get used to viewing content in multiple bites, and on their own terms, rather than on the schedule of a broadcaster.”Viewers who chose what and when they wanted to watch were more likely to demand something extraordinary, and to pay it close attention. This mode of viewing was terrible news for the broadcasters, who relied on large numbers of people watching whatever was on that night — including ads. “Television’s economics were eroding from underneath it,” says John Landgraf, then at NBC, now chief executive of the Fox-owned cable network FX. “People wouldn’t watch repeats, which was how the broadcasters made money.”If a large and inattentive audience was more valuable to broadcasters than a small and loyal one, then for HBO it was the other way around. Funded by subscription, it didn’t have to worry about ratings but it did have to make viewers feel it had something worth paying for. The rise of what the cultural critic Anna Leszkiewicz calls “the avid viewer” therefore represented an opportunity. HBO already had a niche in the market; now there was a market in the niche.455: Scripted original programmes aired on US TV in 2016. That number is expected to rise this year.24: Hours per week the average British adult spends watching TV93 million: Netflix subscribers across the world23 million: Average multiplatform viewers per episode of series six of Game of ThronesHBO sold itself directly to viewers. Basic cable channels, such as FX or AMC, did so indirectly, charging carriage fees to cable service providers such as Comcast, which meant they were dependent on viewers demanding their brand as part of a package. For the cable channels, just being there wasn’t enough; they needed to offer something special. Until The Sopranos, however, they relied largely on a mix of old movies, repeats and wrestling. “Americans did not sit down at the end of the day and turn on cable and expect to see something new,” says Amanda Lotz, professor of communication studies at the University of Michigan.It took David Chase’s creative ambition to explode the latent commercial possibilities of pay-TV. “The Sopranos was a form-breaker,” says Landgraf. “Every now and again in TV a new form is invented: the first game show, the first late-night talk show. The Sopranos opened up a whole new way of storytelling.” Chase melded TV with the kinds of movies he loved, like The Godfather, where the fundamental narrative involves the development of a central character. Sure, viewers might want to watch a standalone episode of The Sopranos but true satisfaction came from following the journeys of Tony Soprano and those around him. Chase’s novelistic, multi-layered narrative perfectly answered the needs of TV’s new audience. Avid viewers were more receptive to storylines that unspooled across several episodes rather than playing out within one. They enjoyed grappling with complex, difficult characters, and genre-busting shifts in tone. Crucially, they were also willing to pay for this kind of storytelling. The Sopranos was not just a new form, it was a new business model. “It was like finding an oilfield nobody had drilled in before,” says Landgraf.In The Sopranos’ wake, FX took a gamble on The Shield, a series whose central character was a corrupt and violent cop. AMC made Mad Men, created by Matthew Weiner, an alumnus of The Sopranos’ writing room, and followed it with Breaking Bad. These shows did not reach big audiences on first airing but the acclaim and attention they received transformed the reputations of their parent brands, who were then able to raise their fees to cable providers.Every now and again in TV a new form is invented: the first game show, the first late-night talk show. ‘The Sopranos’ opened up a whole new way of storytellingThe cable channels could not offer creative talent the prestige, or budget, of a broadcaster or movie studio but they could offer them freedom. Executives advised on, but did not interfere in, storylines or casting decisions; plotlines were not picked apart by focus groups. Chris Albrecht, who greenlighted The Sopranos at HBO (he now heads the cable network Starz), told me: “Our strategy was simple. Find creative people and give them a platform to realise an idea they’re passionate about.” The term “showrunner” became used to describe someone who not only creates the show but oversees its production.Just as Parisian artists were able to take their work to dozens of galleries instead of one institution, writers and production houses now had many more buyers for even their craziest ideas. Since nobody really knew what worked or didn’t work, it made sense to experiment. Shows that did not win big audiences would get renewed if critics feted them or a small but vociferous audience of loyalists made itself heard online. A frontier spirit prevailed.In 2013, just as things threatened to get predictable, Netflix, the online streaming service, decided to make its own shows. For all the hype around its data-driven methodology, it essentially adopted the HBO model: invest in creative talent, give it free rein, and seek out passionate niches. House of Cards, a political drama starring Kevin Spacey, transformed Netflix’s reputation from a DVD rental company into a TV brand. Netflix was soon joined by Amazon Prime, which competed for critical kudos by creating its own award-winning shows such as Transparent — a groundbreaking, tragicomic series about a transgender parent.“Streaming is the culmination of a change that has been coming for decades,” Joe Lewis, of Amazon Studios, told me. “If there are just three TV networks, and one TV in the house, then your goal is to get viewers to not turn you off. When there’s a huge number of great shows worthy of your time, and lots of TVs, or TV-enabled devices, in the house, the challenge becomes getting someone to turn your show on — which means turning that person on.”Lewis is a businessman who speaks with unabashed fervour about creativity, like a latter-day Vollard. “I tell my executives to think like artists who fight for truth. We want to make things that last. Any true work of art accrues value and meaning over time. Transparent will still be valuable in 10 or 20 years, like The Godfather is now.”***When Chase’s movie heroes made their best work, Hollywood was in the midst of its last golden age. The Godfather, Taxi Driver and Chinatown emerged from the “New Hollywood” era of the 1970s, which saw a profusion of innovative, challenging films, many of which are now regarded as classics. I tell my executives to think like artists who fight for truth. We want to make things that lastToday, more than ever, the movie industry is dominated by one, highly formalised genre: the multi-sequel blockbuster. In 1999, when The Sopranos was first broadcast, the list of the year’s most successful movies was topped by Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Toy Story 2 but also included The Sixth Sense, Shakespeare in Love and Analyze This. Blockbusters mingled with adult dramas and comedies. In 2016, by contrast, every one of the top 10 grossing films was a sequel, spin-off, superhero movie or cartoon. Only two original movies have been number one in the past decade: Frozen and Avatar. As Amanda Lotz puts it: “Hollywood has a story problem.”Blockbusters require skill to make, and can be fun to consume, but they operate within a set of tightly drawn narrative rules. If you have artistic ambitions, that can get very dull. In a 2010 interview with The New York Times, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner bemoaned the film industry’s creative impoverishment: “It’s a bummer to see movie after movie where . . . so much money is spent, and they’re just bland, lifeless, familiar, fake.” Films, he said, did not speak to him any more. “I’m not a superhero, it’s not one of my interests.”***Golden ages contain the seeds of their own demise. Towards the end of the period studied by Accominotti, the rate of artistic innovation in Paris slowed. Accominotti argues that this relative decline was the function of a more settled market. A hierarchy of galleries had become established, with the big ones exerting disproportionate market power. Artists were snapped up by dealers when they were young and encouraged to develop distinctive, consistent styles. This made them easier to market to top galleries, and better off, but less likely to engage in the kind of collaborations with fellow artists that spawned new movements. In short, once the dealers and the artists figured out reliable ways to make money, the art became more predictable and less interesting.We’re not seeing any slowdown in the appetite for new contentNew Hollywood was born from the collapse of the old studio system, which required creative talent to follow tried and trusted templates. By the late 1960s, box office revenues were cratering. Colour television had given people a reason to stay home in the evening, and the Woodstock generation wasn’t interested in another Doris Day and Rock Hudson movie. In desperation, Hollywood’s executives handed money and control to a new breed of talented and wilful directors.Amid the creative free-for-all that resulted, a new formula for success materialised. In 1977, Star Wars, created by George Lucas, became the biggest grossing movie ever. It featured dazzling special effects and characters who made for great toys. Star Wars showed the business that an ascent to the mythic realm of comic books, and away from fine-grained depictions of American society, was a safer route to success. In the following decades, the movie industry slowly but inexorably consolidated around the formula Lucas invented, a process that has accelerated in recent years, as non-western audiences, particularly in China, have become more important to Hollywood’s business, putting further emphasis on splashy effects and archetypal characters that travel easily. These global blockbusters are prohibitively expensive to make and market. Meanwhile, DVD sales, an important secondary source of income for the studios, have been devastated by on-demand services. In response, the studios are making fewer and more costly films. “Each theatrical release is now a very big bet,” said Laura Kennedy of Lionsgate. “There’s a lot more pressure on it to work — and that puts pressure on the creative content.”William Goldman’s famous maxim about moviemaking (“nobody knows anything”) is incomplete: nobody knows anything for sure. Studios know that if the last movie in a series was successful it’s a fair bet the next one will be too. It is possible Rogue One: A Star Wars Story could have flopped but, as an investment, Rogue One was a lot less risky than handing $200m to today’s equivalent of the young George Lucas and telling him to make something up. Creative innovation is now a risk the movie business cannot afford.So is talent. Fewer movies has meant less work for big-name actors and directors. There has been a steady migration of high-profile creatives from one side of Hollywood’s storytelling business to the other. This year, Joel and Ethan Coen, perhaps Hollywood’s last auteurs, announced they were making a TV mini-series, while Peter Morgan scripted Netflix’s £100m-budget series The Crown. When Martin Scorsese was making the pilot of HBO’s Boardwalk Empire, he told a friend: “I feel like I’m back in the ’70s, doing my own thing.” Young talent, such as the Duffer Brothers, the twins who created Netflix’s retro sci-fi hit Stranger Things, is bypassing the movie industry altogether.In the long run, an industry hostile to new ideas and talent will either die or be reinvented. If it is the latter, a moment of crisis may be necessary. Laura Kennedy told me there was a sense in which the movie business had not been disrupted enough. “The economic model has barely changed, compared to TV. People still go to movie theatres, even if they go less often. The industry hasn’t been forced to undergo a technology transition.” No matter how smart it gets about distribution or marketing, the industry requires a visionary to solve its story problem. Golden ages are kickstarted by someone brilliant and cussed enough to invent the future, like a late-career writer who needs creative fulfilment more than a pay cheque.***We used to complain that there was never anything good on TV. Now we complain about the opposite. Spoilt for choice as we may be, we should not forget to be astonished that an industry once regarded as an artistic wasteland has turned itself into the world’s most prolific source of new stories. Whether we are in the middle or nearing the end of television’s golden age is hard to tell. Our sense of being overwhelmed by new shows is not illusory. According to FX Networks research, in 2016 there were 455 original series in TV, up from 182 in 2002. Yet we haven’t necessarily reached what John Landgraf has called “peak TV”. “We’re not seeing any slowdown in the appetite for new content, from all kinds of buyers,” says Laura Kennedy.But the US cable business, which led the revolution, is facing a shakeout. Growing numbers of households with broadband are cancelling their cable subscriptions or not getting one in the first place. “The number of cable networks will shrink dramatically,” Erik Brannon, an analyst at IHS Technology, told me. Netflix and Amazon may find themselves coming under more financial pressure too unless their giant bets on the future pay off soon.The stakes are rising and, amid fierce competition for the attention of critics and viewers, the market for more subtle ideas may be shrinking. An executive at a London production house, who asked not to be named, told me that while there were plenty of buyers for new shows, the specs were getting tighter. “Everyone wants something high concept: an idea that can be summed up in a headline. They always ask, ‘Will it cut through?’” The search is on for a storytelling format that minimises risk. HBO’s Game of Thrones has shown the industry that expensively produced shows set in mythical realms, with global appeal, can be enormously profitable. “People like me make creative decisions, and we’re also responsible to shareholders,” says Landgraf. “Right now, those two goals are in harmony. But when they conflict, capital will have its way. It has to.”Only when nobody knows anything does a creative industry bet on its creators. Golden ages come to an end when everybody knows something.

Amazon is the largest member by weighting, making up 30 per cent of the index.It came as weak sales and the announcements of store closures from companies like Sears and Macy’s have heightened investor nerves over the sector.“The retail apocalypse in the US has reached a tipping point where consumers are largely going online and Amazon is probably the biggest recipient of more ecommerce transactions and a move away from bricks and mortar,” said Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Company, who upgraded the company on Monday morning.And the trend shows no sign of abating. Mr Rice cited figures from eMarketer in his report that predicted ecommerce as a total of retail sales in the US will expand from 8 per cent in 2016 to 13.5 per cent by 2021.The US is still Amazon’s biggest market, contributing roughly 70 per cent of its total ecommerce revenue. Outside the US, Amazon still has further disruptive potential, added Mr Rice.“Internationally there is a long way to go when you think of ecommerce adoption,” he said. “There is a lot of opportunity for Amazon to grab market share.”Amazon’s gain coincided with Netflix, a rival in the online streaming of television, which ended the day 0.5 per cent higher at $143.85, after recovering from a more than 1.3 per cent fall in early morning trading.The earlier dip came alongside the departure of Neil Hunt, Netflix’s chief product officer, who will step down in July after 18 years at the company.Analysts said Netflix and Amazon were less rivals to each other and more united in changing the way consumers interact with television.A Morgan Stanley survey released on Monday put Netflix as the leading online video service in the US but also noted that about 45 per cent of Netflix users also use Amazon Prime Video, and about 60 per cent of Prime members also use Netflix.“Both Netflix and Amazon can have good growth,” said Laura Champine, an analyst with ROE Equity Research.The S&P 500 index slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,357 in New York on Monday. Energy stocks led the index, benefiting from a rise in oil prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was barely changed at 20,658 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1 per cent to 5,880.
347;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-03-10T05:00:43Z;Netflix seeks European crown in local content push;Internet TV streamer looks for subscriber boost as it competes with Amazon and Sky;A former grain depot in Berlin was the unlikely venue last week for an offline premiere by media streaming service Netflix of its European content offerings — the audience seated on couches equipped with headphones that piped in dialogue in four different languages.Stars of English-language hits such as Orange Is The New Black, Better Call Saul and the talk show Chelsea joined German, Italian and Spanish TV creatives gathered to launch three drama series for 2017 in their native languages.The day-long promotion of the platform’s aggressive European strategy is a sign of the increased competition among traditional and internet broadcasters to succeed with local content, helping them find new audiences and satisfy regulators.In Europe in particular, the EU revealed plans last year that could force internet TV providers to devote “at least” 20 per cent of their catalogues to European films and TV shows, as part of an overhaul of broadcasting rules. Members of the European Parliament are trying to push the minimum to 30 per cent, according to people close to the discussions.“We are one of the most active supporters and financiers of European content,” Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, told the Financial Times in Berlin.Since 2012, it has ploughed $1.75bn into licensed, co-produced and original content on the continent, and is working on 90 original productions both individually and with local partners such as the BBC, Channel 4 and Canal Plus.The glitzy event in Berlin was also the Californian company’s effort to brand itself as a global TV company that could appeal to audiences from Budapest to Bangalore.“Because we are purely on the internet, we can scale productions that aren’t mainstream and still be very successful,” Mr Hastings said.“For example, we launched 3 Percent, a Brazilian original series in Portuguese, and it’s been hugely popular in Germany. We try to make a show with a passionate following, as opposed to watering it down so it would be easy for many people, which is what broadcast television has to do.”Successful cult series and the growing internationalisation of its content helped Netflix blow past estimates for new customers in its past quarter, adding a record 7m subscribers, with 5.1m of them coming from outside the US, beating its own projections for 3.8m.More than half its audience of nearly 100m is outside the US now, and expanding this group is its major focus.In Europe, Netflix will have to woo viewers away from several powerful competitors. Sky, for instance, will spend £6bn on content here in 2016-2017. “That’s more than Netflix spends globally,” Mai Fyfield, Sky’s chief strategy and commercial officer, said at an investor day in October last year.“We are the biggest content business in Europe. Collectively, [our] brands reach 56m homes across Europe and 130m individuals. Latest data say the European market has overtaken the size of the US market.”If 21st Century Fox’s £11.7bn bid for the 61 per cent of Sky it does not own goes ahead, then Sky will be in an even stronger position to repel the advances of streaming services like Netflix.“We love competition. We like a good scrap. Netflix is a very big company. I’m very lucky because I don’t worry if Orange is the New Black is relevant in Kuala Lumpur. We just make Babylon Berlin relevant in Berlin,” said Gary Davey, Sky’s managing director, content. “It’s a great advantage against any global competitor. I don’t feel threatened.”Meanwhile, Amazon spent a reported $4bn on video content in 2016, and has deep enough pockets to ramp up heavily in 2017.“In terms of original content, it does seem like Amazon is a more concerted effort than Netflix. In India, they’re doing eight separate programmes. They’re really looking to localise their content rather than what could be considered window dressing,” said Tom Harrington, researcher at media analyst Enders Analysis.While Netflix may not be able to outspend Sky and Amazon on content acquisition, it is aiming to grow by piggybacking on European cable networks and working on partnerships.Today, it has 40 co-production deals, a number that is climbing steadily. “A year or two ago, when we were first investing in The Crown [drama on the life of Queen Elizabeth II, media companies] were all like ‘Oh shit!’ But we are co-producing with them more and more, now there is a different perception of us,” Netflix spokesperson Jonathan Friedland said.Netflix has also signed deals with telecoms companies such as Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media in the UK, and Norway’s Telenor, to be included on customers’ TV set-top boxes in dozens of countries. Although Sky has so far chosen not to put Netflix on its own set-top box, “that may happen at some point”, Mr Hastings said.For broadcasters, the partnership helps to take advantage of viewers’ inevitable march away from linear television, while for Netflix, it is a route to supercharged expansion.“When we make partnerships with broadcasters, both international and domestic, that helps us grow,” Mr Hastings said.“We are a little under 100m subscribers today. YouTube has nearly 2bn people using it, watching 1bn hours of video a day. We have a long way to go.”
348;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-03-01T13:18:06Z;Netflix increases investment in European TV content;US internet TV group reveals plans for shows with BBC and Canal Plus;"Netflix will co-produce three new series with the BBC and Canal Plus as part of an expansion of its European content business to drive customer growth in local markets in the region.The US internet TV group has invested $1.8bn into licensed, original and co-productions in Europe since 2012, and will continue to spend more on new shows this year.These will include two productions with the BBC; Troy: Fall of a City and Black Earth Rising, and a third new series, The Spy, which will be co-produced and released on French cable network Canal Plus. The company is also pushing ahead with plans to bring Netflix to TV set top boxes with operators in Europe. “We have integrated Netflix with operators like Orange, Vodafone, Liberty Global and BT, signed a deal with Telenor to bring Netflix to their box. Today, we are bringing Netflix in Germany to Unitymedia subscribers,” said chief executive Reed Hastings in Berlin. Netflix’s announcement comes on the back of EU pressure on on-demand services to invest more in local content and productions. Last year the EU revealed plans that could force internet TV providers, including Netflix and Amazon, to devote “at least” 20 per cent of their catalogues to European films and TV shows, as part of an overhaul of broadcasting rules. The negotiations are continuing, with MEPs trying to push the minimum to 30 per cent, according to people close to the discussions. The law would also require promotion of European content on web services’ homepages. Netflix has warned Brussels that the rules would distort the market, even while arguing that it already met the metrics. “Rigid numerical quotas risk suffocating the market for on-demand audiovisual media services,” Netflix wrote in its response to the commission. “An obligation to carry content to meet a numerical quota may cause new players to struggle to achieve a sustainable business model.”It is also concerned that the rules on prominence of European content would interfere with its “personalised” algorithmic approach to surfacing the most relevant content for each user, according to the video streaming company.Earlier this year, Netflix beat its own estimates for new customers in the fourth quarter, adding a record 7m subscribers, with nearly half of Netflix customers now outside the US. The company’s shares have risen by more than a third in the past seven months, fuelled by fast customer growth and deals with US and European pay-TV companies."
349;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-02-17T11:44:05Z;Disrupting Hollywood: Amazon goes to the Oscars;Digital disrupters are closing in on the Oscars — but can they reshape the entire film industry?;"Making movies is in Roy Price’s genes. His late grandfather, Roy Huggins, created television series such as The Fugitive, Maverick and The Rockford Files. His mother, Katherine Crawford, was an actress. His father, Frank Price, as a head of Columbia Pictures, oversaw classics such as Kramer vs Kramer and Tootsie. At next Sunday’s Oscars, the younger Price has his own opportunity to write his own name into Hollywood lore.The 49-year-old Los Angeles native, who is rarely photographed without his trademark leather jacket, runs Amazon Studios, the film and television programming arm of Jeff Bezos’s online retail giant. It has gatecrashed the Oscars in its first full year of releasing original movies, picking up seven nominations, including a Best Picture nod for Kenneth Lonergan’s haunting Manchester by the Sea. It is the first ever Best Picture nomination for a digital streaming service but with Amazon, its rival Netflix, and other digital players such as Hulu now firmly in the business of buying, developing and producing original movies, it is unlikely to be the last.Silicon Valley is not just straying into traditional Hollywood territory. It is launching a full-on incursion as the digital disruptive forces that have revolutionised the music industry now threaten the mighty movie business. Netflix will spend approximately $1bn on producing and acquiring original movies over the next three years, while Amazon is releasing around 15 a year, with budgets ranging from $5m to $40m. Google is commissioning original series for its YouTube Red subscription service, while Apple is having ongoing discussions with Hollywood executives about original film and TV productions: it recently sounded out Imagine Entertainment, the company founded by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, about a possible takeover.Price, unsurprisingly, is not shy of laying out his ambitions. Amazon is going after the independent film space — edgy, provocative pictures that used to be associated with companies such as Miramax, he tells me. His favourite movies are character-driven pieces such as Network and Withnail and I, but the big studios in Hollywood have largely abandoned those for “big, spectacle movies”, he says. “There’s an opportunity there.”Whether the established studios — companies such as Warner Bros and 20th Century Fox — welcome the move by Amazon and its rival Netflix is another matter. Hollywood has tended to resist outsiders — except when they come bearing money. International companies have over the years pitched up in Los Angeles from countries such as Japan, France and, more recently, India and China with bold plans to remake the movie industry, but they have invariably been parted from their cash by studio executives and talent agents unable to believe their good fortune. The arrival of deep-pocketed technology giants from the north — Amazon is based in Seattle, Netflix in Silicon Valley — changes the equation because they are directly challenging the studios’ hegemony. Instead of handing over their money to the studios, as some naive international players have done before them, the streaming services have set themselves up as competitors. They are buying scripts, developing material and outbidding the studios and their subsidiaries for the most hotly anticipated independent films at festivals such as Sundance and Toronto. In short, they are doing all the things that traditional movie studios do.And now, with the nomination for the Manchester by the Sea, Amazon is on the verge of cracking the Oscars. “It’s a highly significant moment,” says Tim Mulligan, a media analyst with Midia Research. The nomination shows that creative excellence is not the preserve of established movie studios, he adds — which, needless to say, is causing no end of anxiety among the established studios. “The streaming services are dangerous . . . people are scared of them,” one studio executive told me. “They are the 800-pound gorillas.”***They may have become Hollywood’s new heavyweights, but Amazon and Netflix have taken quite differing approaches to the buying, production and distribution of movies. Before last year, Amazon wasn’t really even in the film business. “We went from not existing theatrically to releasing 15 movies and having seven Oscar nominations,” says Jason Ropell, Amazon’s worldwide head of motion pictures.All of those films, starting with Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq and including last summer’s critical hit Love & Friendship from Whit Stillman, were released in cinemas before making their way to Prime, the Amazon streaming service, where viewers can watch the company’s productions alongside films licensed from other companies such as A24, which produced the Oscar-nominated Moonlight, and TV shows such as the Golden Globe-winning Transparent. Netflix, conversely, likes to release its movies straight to its own platform and doesn’t usually bother with a cinematic release. “We are making movies for where the audience is, and increasingly that audience is at home and on Netflix,” says Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer.Sarandos is the mastermind behind Netflix’s original content strategy — one that has arguably changed the way we watch TV. He bought House of Cards and made the entire first season available at once, as he did with other Netflix productions such as Narcos, Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things. This, and the availability on Netflix of full series of non-Netflix shows such as Breaking Bad and Mad Men, spawned the so-called “binge-watching” phenomenon, where viewers immerse themselves in a series, watching episode after episode.Sarandos has pushed cinema chains to be more flexible with the way they release titles. Ideally for Netflix, the chains would screen the streaming service’s original films the same day that it makes them available for viewing online — known in Hollywood as a “day-and-date” release. But the big chains don’t want to play ball: they want to preserve what is known as the “theatrical window” — the period when a film is only available to view on the big screen, before it is released on other platforms and services. Without it, they argue, cinema attendance would wither.Sarandos has so far been unwilling to budge: he has been putting most of the movies Netflix buys and produces straight on to his service, eschewing a theatrical run. The cinema chains argue that a theatrical window drives a movie’s popularity when it is released on pay-TV or to rent online. But Netflix does not need the exposure and word of mouth of a theatrical run to drive viewing: with more than 93m subscribers and an algorithm-powered recommendation engine that suggests shows and films based on a viewer’s other choices, it can propel plenty of viewing on its own.With this in mind, Sarandos has been able to make calculated bets on splashy movies, such as the four-film deal it agreed with the comedian Adam Sandler. Sarandos will not comment on budgets but one person with knowledge of the deal told me that each of the films is costing about $60m, which includes the star’s eye-watering $20m per movie fee. The company is shelling out a similarly hefty amount for Bright, an original sci-fi film that reunites Will Smith, one of Hollywood’s best-paid stars, with his Suicide Squad director, David Ayer: the Deadline Hollywood news site revealed last year that Netflix would spend more than $90m on the movie, after seeing off other buyers for the project in a two-week bidding war. “It is as big a summer blockbuster as any studio would have made,” Sarandos says.Some Netflix films have been released in cinemas in order to qualify for Academy Award consideration. The company is in the Oscars race next week with 13th, Ava DuVernay’s acclaimed documentary about the mass incarceration of African-Americans: the film had a limited theatrical release last autumn to ensure it qualified. Similarly, Beasts of No Nation, Netflix’s awards hopeful from 2015, had a limited theatrical run to ensure Oscars consideration and received rave reviews but was ultimately snubbed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Bright will have a limited theatrical release this summer: it will screen on the streaming service at the same time as it hits a small number of cinemas. But Sarandos is adamant that Netflix will not play ball when it comes to the theatrical window. “I don’t want to hold back movies from our subscribers,” he says.What if the film-makers want the movies to play on the big screen? “There’s no question there’s a romance with the old model. But the fact remains that people watch movies at home.” The theatrical window “is increasingly out of step with the global audience”, he adds. “Buying movies and releasing them in theatres? There are plenty of people doing that. We’re not interested.”And yet the silver screen retains its allure for many film-makers who still want their work played in cinemas. “Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I like my films to be in a theatre first before people watch it on an iPhone,” Spike Lee said last year, when Amazon released Chi-Raq. Kenneth Lonergan, who earned a Best Director nomination this year for Manchester by the Sea, has a similar view. “The [film’s] theatrical release was crucial,” he told me. “There’s TV, there’s the computer and there’s movies. I come from a pretty traditional background and wanted it to be in theatres.”This is not an uncommon view, according to Chris Silbermann, managing partner of ICM, the agency that represents stars such as Chris Rock. “Talent want the movies to be in theatres,” he says, pointing to The Birth of a Nation, Nate Parker’s slave drama, which wowed audiences at Sundance last year and which was the subject of a fierce bidding war (plagued by controversy, however, it later flopped at the box office). Netflix bid a reported $20m; Fox Searchlight, which is part of Rupert Murdoch’s 20th Century Fox studio, offered around $16m. “They took the lower offer from Searchlight because Netflix wasn’t going to do a theatrical run.”***Manchester by the Sea, which stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, is the sort of challenging material that the big studios have all but given up on in favour of comic-book adaptations and science-fiction blockbusters. It has played on up to 1,200 screens in the US and has brought in about $45m at the box office. Lonergan says it was “heartening that Amazon would chose a movie like mine as their flagship film. For people like me who want to make personal movies . . . it’s all for the good.”Roy Price says Amazon is unlikely to deviate from the template it has created of personal, character-driven films: it won’t be getting into the sci-fi or superhero business anytime soon. “The studios do a good job with that kind of movie,” he says. “I’m not sure that if we entered that segment, we would be solving a problem the world has.” His colleague Jason Ropell concurs. “We’re in a space that major studios have by and large vacated.” The films it wants to release “are auteur films and visionary films by visionary directors”.Still, Amazon could one day find itself taking on more of a studio-like role than it has done so far. “We don’t have a physical production set-up,” says Ropell. “But maybe one day [we will]. The future could hold many delights, and hopefully we will grow to a size where we need to do that.”Amazon’s spending on movies and television programming represents a tiny fraction of the revenues generated by its core retail operations, which topped $135bn in 2016.Maybe it’s a function of working for the world’s largest retailer but when I spoke to Price and Ropell, they separately referred to making films for “customers” rather than viewers. This, after all, is the underlying point of Amazon’s video service: film and television programming help it forge a closer bond with people who are already Amazon customers — customers who will ultimately buy more products on Amazon the longer they stick around watching movies and TV series.This goes some way to explaining how Amazon Studios can afford to knock out the competition each time it is bidding for a hot movie project. “Amazon’s accounts look the same as Netflix except they have an extra line,” says a rival studio executive. “That line is for all the toilet paper, clothes, cleaning products and books that they sell to the person who watches their movies.”Ropell says the company often offers more for movies because it is buying global rights — rights that have traditionally been sold to regions separately by producers trying to cover their costs with multiple distribution deals. “It’s a broader scope of rights,” he says. “That doesn’t mean that we distort the market by overpaying.”Buying movies and releasing them in theatres? Plenty of people are doing that. We’re not interestedStill, there is no doubting Amazon’s and Netflix’s impact on the independent film sector. The Sundance and Toronto film festivals are showcases for awards-worthy movies that have not yet secured distribution deals, and both “were incredibly fallow for the four or five years after the financial crisis, when they really fell off a cliff,” says Chris Silbermann. But in the past two years Amazon and Netflix “have really ignited the market”.The rival studio executive says independent film prices have “become exorbitant. And it’s all because of Netflix and Amazon driving them up.” He points to The Big Sick, which Amazon bought at Sundance last month for $12m. “Five years ago that movie would have sold for $3.5m. Maybe in a crazy bidding war it gets to $5m. The fact that it sold this year for $12m is insane.”Mudbound, a drama starring Carey Mulligan about feuding families in postwar Mississippi, was sold for a similar amount to Netflix. “How does the marketplace handle this?” the executive asks. Rival buyers are having to spend more to stay in the game, with Fox Searchlight shelling out $4.5m for Step, a documentary about a high school dance team. “They had to pay that much for a documentary! And all because Netflix and Amazon were in the mix . . . they are driving prices up to unrealistic levels.”***Price is right that Amazon is making the kinds of movies that no longer interest the big studios. The economics of film-making have changed in recent years to the extent that the biggest returns can only be generated by the splashiest blockbusters and their sequels. Edgy, character-driven dramas that might make $40m or $50m at the box office no longer really cut it.And yet Amazon’s and Netflix’s move into film still has big implications for the century-old business of moviemaking. The studios and their subsidiaries still invest in “prestige” pictures — the kinds of films that contend for Oscars. They have to: if they cease to be known as homes for top talent, they will struggle to attract the next generation of star directors, writers and actors. “It’s not that the streaming services are going to put the incumbents out of business,” says Barry Diller, who ran Paramount Pictures in the 1970s and these days controls a digital empire that includes Expedia, the online travel operator. “But they are a significant threat to their ability to grow.”What can the incumbents do? The executive who has bid for films against Amazon and Netflix tells me that studios and their subsidiaries hoping to buy finished films need to start developing and producing more of their own material if they are to stay relevant. They don’t have many other options, because other technology companies from the north are likely to gatecrash the Hollywood party. Like Amazon and Netflix, they will be coming to Hollywood to win, he says. “What happens when Apple and Google enter the fray?”Matthew Garrahan is the FT’s global media editor"
350;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-02-16T12:53:52Z;Apple’s stalled talks with Ron Howard flag content confusion;Tim Cook involved in discussions with company but Hollywood deal still fails;"Apple was an early pioneer in the digital distribution of music and video with the iTunes store. But will it be a player in the next phase of content distribution?The iPhone maker has been stalking Hollywood for more than a year, talking to leading industry players while it tries to formulate a cogent video strategy. It has considered a range of acquisitions and targets including, most recently, Imagine Entertainment, the Hollywood production company owned by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, according to several people briefed on the discussions.The talks were serious enough to involve Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, and Eddy Cue, its senior vice-president of internet software and services. The talks included a possible “first look” distribution deal of Imagine movies and television shows, as well as an investment by Apple — or even a full purchase. But, as with many other potential deals involving Apple, the discussions fizzled out.Imagine, the producer of films ranging from Apollo 13 and The Da Vinci Code to television shows such as Empire, recently came to the end of a long-term production and distribution deal with Universal Pictures, which is part of Comcast’s NBCUniversal group. A tie-up with Apple, on paper, at least, would have made some sense.But then, Time Warner, which Mr Cue approached last year about a possible takeover, would have made sense too. Must-have Time Warner content, like HBO’s Game of Thrones, or hit Warner Brothers movies, could have underpinned an Apple video subscription service, strengthening the link between the device maker and its customers.Apple has continued to have discussions with potential Hollywood partners. But instead of buying a company, it has put its efforts into just a couple of original series: Carpool Karaoke, a spin-off of the popular segment on James Corden’s Late Late Show, and a reality show called Planet of the Apps. Apple will use the shows to differentiate Apple Music, its streaming service that competes with Spotify.At the Code Media conference in southern California this week, Mr Cue played down the notion that Apple would ever buy a media company. “We’re not out trying to buy a bunch of shows, we’re trying to do some things that are creative, that can, we think, move culture,” he said. On Apple’s recent earnings call, Mr Cook said the company has a “toe in the water” in terms of original content.This approach has many in Hollywood scratching their heads. Apple’s rounds of meetings with various entertainment industry players suggest it has not yet decided what its strategy should be.It has the firepower to do something meaningful in content production and distribution — a space that is increasingly dominated by Netflix and Amazon. They have each invested billions of dollars in original programming: Netflix has built a global subscriber base of 93m while Amazon’s Prime service and its exclusive original content make people likely to spend in its online store.Apple could get up to speed by buying a company. Or it could follow Amazon’s model: hire the right talent and give them the backing to get the ball rolling. Amazon made no films in 2015; it released 15 in 2016 and has seven Oscar nominations to show for it, including a best picture nomination for Manchester by the Sea.Apple’s stock recently hit an all-time high — and a market value of $700bn — on hopes that the launch of a new iPhone will drive a sales “supercycle”. The prospect of its $230bn overseas cash pile being repatriated to the US under the new Trump administration is also fuelling investor optimism.The company has set a target of doubling its revenues from services, such as the Apps Store and Apple Music, to about $50bn in the next four years.It is hard to believe it will reach that target without doing something more meaningful in video. But it may have missed a trick, given broad, global changes in audience behaviour. People increasingly get their entertainment from video subscription services — and they need devices like those made by Apple to watch them.The late Steve Jobs always envisioned a closed environment where Apple’s software platform and device were tightly integrated. In not being more aggressive in video in the past two years, Netflix and Amazon have stolen a march on Apple. Will it come to regret it?matthew.garrahan@ft.com"

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
352;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-01-26T12:59:48Z;Investing under Trump: political contagion;US president’s ostensible pro-business tilt is deceptive;The juxtaposition was striking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finally cracked the 20,000 barrier after rallying a tenth since the US presidential election. On the same day, some of Donald Trump’s views, which tend to be contentious, gained the force of law through executive orders. The extremism of Mr Trump’s social policies appeared entirely disconnected from his pro-business economic proposals.Some commentators are already lamenting bosses who dismiss their consciences and enthuse about a 20 per cent tax rate and rising equity prices.But chief executives hardly need to be bleeding hearts to be concerned. Mr Trump’s repeated and arbitrary interference in business should alarm every board and stock picker.Ritual humiliation has become routine. Mr Trump either summons the bosses to his office or blindsides them with a tweet (naturally Wall Street has created algorithms to profit from the president’s social media invective). Companies then provide some form of tribute. Examples include a jobs pledge from Amazon and a commitment for a cheaper aircraft from Boeing). This daily intervention by the US head of state with specific companies is unprecedented. It also amounts to picking winners and losers.CEOs tolerate the ignominy, fearing the consequences of dissent or valuing the trade-off of lower taxes or regulatory relief.Rule of law and respect for existing regulation, however tiresome, fosters predictability and stability. Nine years after Dodd-Frank, US banks have adapted. They are not necessarily looking for these prudential regulations to be ditched. Similarly, a quick abolition of the Affordable Care Act would wreak havoc in insurance markets. Regulation itself can also foster competition, with accompanying financial returns for innovators. Open internet standards called “net neutrality”, whose days may be numbered, have allowed upstart internet media companies such as Netflix to take on television and movie studios.Another kind of neutrality — the political sort — is required from CEOs of listed companies tempted to criticise publicly an elected president on moral grounds. They would be right to harbour deep private qualms at the politicisation of business under Mr Trump. This leaves the price rally in many stocks only shakily underpinned. Stability is under-appreciated until it crumbles.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Last year’s best picture, Spotlight, also made it to the big screen without help from a major studio.Amazon’s Manchester by the Sea, directed by Kenneth Lonergan, became the first movie released by a streaming service to land a best picture Oscar nomination. Amazon and Netflix have been pouring money into movie production, upsetting Hollywood’s status quo and challenging the tradition of theatrical release “windows” which insist that films show exclusively in cinemas before appearing on other platforms.Along with independent studios, the streaming services have given writers and directors another outlet for their work at a time when big Hollywood studios are focusing on more splashy franchise movies and comic book adaptations.Films made by black directors and featuring black talent did well in the nominations. Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight, a coming of age tale about a gay black man, scored the second highest total with eight nominations, while there were also nods for Denzel Washington’s Fences, the adaptation of August Wilson’s 1983 play, and Hidden Figures, Fox’s story about the previously unheralded black women of the Nasa space programme.The success of black talent follows controversies of previous years when black actors were omitted and which sparked the #OscarsSoWhite protest, which was started by the activist April Reign. Last year the Academy hierarchy took steps to increase the diversity of its largely white, ageing membership, adding 683 new members, with 46 per cent of them women and 41 per cent non-white.This year also marks the return of Mel Gibson from exile — with the star receiving his first nomination, for best director of Hacksaw Ridge — since he was shunned by Hollywood after he made anti-Semitic remarks to a policeman in 2006. His film also picked up a nod for its star, Andrew Garfield.Success at the Oscars can often reignite a film’s performance at the box office and prolong its life on DVD and on streaming services. Movie studios prize the awards because success at the Academy Awards with their movies can increase their appeal to top talent.
354;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-01-20T22:10:40Z;Week in Review, January 21;"US bank earnings; BAT-Reynolds deal, Luxottica, Pearson and Netflix also in the news";"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Ardour for banks fades as Goldman disappointsShares in the big US banks had an indifferent time of it over the past week, losing about 2 per cent against a flat market, writes Ben McLannahan in New York.But that was little to do with fourth-quarter results, which were basically fine. It reflected a headlong dash into bank stocks by all manner of investors since the election of Donald Trump, which promised to usher in a world of higher interest rates, lower taxes and lighter regulation.After a 24 per cent run-up in the KBW Banks index, some of the newcomers might have been dismayed at the humdrum full-year figures from Goldman Sachs, for example, where revenues slipped 9 per cent to $30.6bn. Profits rose about a quarter — but only thanks to a lack of huge legal settlements.It seemed “like a dull party that all of a sudden got really popular as it began to trend on social media, but once everyone arrived they wondered what all the fuss was about”, wrote Marty Mosby, Vining Sparks analyst, in a note.The results were best in trading, where fixed-income units, in particular, showed real signs of life. But investment banking was patchier. In retail, too, margins were still pinned back by low interest rates, despite talk of Trumpflation. The good news is that credit quality is good, with only minor disturbances in commercial real estate and car loans.There are lingering worries over litigation, especially as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — which has been threatened with ex­tinction by the new Republican regime — tries to protect its reputation for vigorous enforcement. This week the agency sued TCF Bank of Wayzata, Minnesota, accusing it of luring consumers into costly overdraft services. One detail: the chief executive called his boat The Overdraft.Still, thanks to Mr Trump, it is possible to pitch bank stocks once more. And for the analysts that have spent the past few years trying to wring fresh themes out of uninspiring outlooks, that is sweet relief indeed.● Related Lex note: Goldman, sleek geek

More than 2.5bn are still in need, according to industry data.Leonardo Del Vecchio, Luxottica’s chairman, said that there was a solid business case for the merger: “We have the brand. What was missing was the quality of the lenses.”Analysts said it also provided Mr Del Vecchio with a succession plan in the shape of Mr Sagnières.Both companies said that part of the rationale for the deal was to develop innovative products, emphasising connected glasses as a key mission for the new group, EssilorLuxottica.This comes two years after Google pulled its experimental Google Glass eyewear from the shelves following a consumer backlash.● Lex note: Vision thing

At the time, people briefed on the negotiations said that while Reynolds was open to a deal, it wanted its London-listed rival to raise its cash-and-stock offer.BAT won over Reynolds’s board with an improved offer of $24.4bn in cash and the rest in shares, valuing its US rival at more than $85bn.The acquisition, which is still subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, will see BAT return to the US market more than a decade after it folded its US subsidiary, Brown & Williamson, into Reynolds in exchange for a large minority stake.Reynolds, which makes Newport, Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes, is the second-biggest tobacco group in the US, behind Altria, with a market share of more than one-third. Analysts said the deal was likely to lead to more sector consolidation, with other big groups looking to tap into the US, where low prices, a dominant ecigarette market and waning worries about litigation costs are expected to drive growth.Pearson to offload Penguin stake after profit warningShares in Pearson lost more than a quarter of their value this week, after the education group issued its fifth profit warning in four years and said it planned to sell its stake in book publisher Penguin Random House, writes David Bond in London.The group said it experienced “an unprecedented decline” in its US higher education courseware business, with sales falling by 30 per cent in the last three months of 2016.The unexpected decline wiped £180m off its expected profitability in 2017, forcing it to slash its dividend this year and revise its profit forecasts for the next two years. Chief executive John Fallon admitted he had got “two big calls wrong” on college enrolment in the US — a key driver of demand for its printed and digital textbooks.Pearson is being hit by a structural shift in the education sector as more students shun traditional printed textbooks and turn to free or rented digital alternatives.Leading shareholders rounded on him for failing to act quickly enough, with one saying: “I don’t think he can survive this.”To try to speed up Pearson’s transition to a digital business, Mr Fallon announced plans to increase its presence in the online rental market.The German media group Bertelsmann, which already owns 53 per cent of Penguin Random House, said it was “open” to increasing its stake in the book publisher.Pearson will now enter a period of exclusive negotiations with Bertelsmann to see if it can reach a deal for the business, which most analysts valued at between £2.8bn and £3.2bn.● Inside London: Pearson’s mistake

The company is well on track to reach its goal of 100m subscribers this year.Netflix, and its digital video content rival Amazon, has prioritised global expansion, with analysts predicting the next big growth area will come from consumers cutting out traditional TV in countries outside the US.Netflix revenues grew by more than a third to $2.48bn in the quarter, helping net income grow to $0.15 a share, topping Wall Street forecasts.On an earnings call, Netflix executives highlighted the success of original hits such as The Crown and the reprise of Gilmore Girls as drivers of growth. The company is on course to invest another $6bn into producing and licensing original programmes this year, ramping up to more than 1,000 hours of original shows, from 600 hours last year.Reed Hastings, chief executive, said the gains were “somewhat influenced by the content in the short term”, but also more broadly as part of the “big adoption of internet TV”.● Lex: square eyes, strong jaw"
355;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Netflix: square eyes, strong jaw;Real danger to streaming service has little to do with its rivals;"The nonchalance must be particularly unsettling to Netflix’s rivals. After announcing record quarterly subscriber growth of 7m, the internet television company said on Wednesday that “since our global expansion is proceeding well” margins would increase “for many years ahead”.Simple. This year, Netflix forecast that the operating margin would rise from 4 to 7 per cent and then continue to rise along with revenues.It has to, of course. In 2015, Netflix’s market capitalisation overtook Viacom’s; last year it surpassed Twenty-First Century Fox. After an 8 per cent jump in after-market trading on Wednesday, Netflix’s valuation reached $62bn, even though it makes less than $200m in net income.Like Amazon, itself no stranger to a price/earnings ratio of 300, Netflix does not need bumper profits today but does need to show it can crank up margins and avoid slower growth.Although it is continuing to invest heavily in making its own shows — original content is expected to reach 1,000 hours this year compared with 600 last year, including expensive blockbusters such as The Crown — the costs associated with entering new countries are in the past, while the company says its content is translating well across borders, giving more bang for the buck.Growth was strong in the fourth quarter: not only outside the US where subscribers rose by 5m to 44m but much perkier at home, adding 2m to reach 49m. Only 500,000 US subscribers had been added in the previous two quarters combined.It is becoming harder to see Netflix going off the rails. It could invest in dud TV shows, though the company’s refusal to provide audience numbers would make it hard to see. Traditional networks or digital upstarts could improve their offerings. Viewers could rediscover their love of live sports, which Netflix does not offer.A more present danger is a reversal under the Trump administration of net neutrality rules which prevent internet providers from charging extra fees to bandwidth hogs such as Netflix. That would crimp those expanding margins. There is little else to disrupt the rise of the television disrupter."
356;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2017-01-18T23:30:28Z;Netflix on track to hit 100m customers after record growth;Video streaming group’s shares jump 8% after surge in international audience;Netflix blew past estimates for new customers in the fourth quarter, adding a record 7m subscribers, as the video streaming company builds on the demand for original hit shows such as The Crown and Stranger Things.Growth was led by countries outside the California company’s home base, where new customer gains have slowed among American households. Netflix signed up 5.1m customers internationally in the three months ended December, beating projections for 3.8m — with nearly half of Netflix customers now residing outside the US. Reed Hastings, chief executive, said the gains were “somewhat influenced by the content in the short term”, but also more broadly part of the “big adoption of internet TV”. Netflix shares jumped more than 8 per cent to $143.80 in after-hours trading, an all-time high. The company’s shares have risen by more than a third in the past six months, fuelled by fast customer growth and fresh deals with pay-TV companies such as Comcast delivering Netflix to viewers’ homes. The on-demand video service in total added 19m new customers in 2016 to reach 93.8m customers across the world — putting it on track for its goal of 100m customers this year. Netflix has dominated the race to capture digital audiences, although it faces increased competition from Amazon and Hulu, as well as big broadcasters and premium cable operators that have launched subscription video services. Netflix has focused on building out its production house as it looks to reach new customers globally. The company is on course to spend $6bn on original content to make more than 1,000 hours of original programming this year. The push internationally comes as “we expect linear TV to collapse outside the US”, which benefits companies such as Netflix, said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG, while raising his price target for Netflix to $170 a share. The company’s revenues climbed more than a third to $2.48bn in the quarter while net income grew to $0.15 a share — slightly above analyst forecasts and up from $0.10 a year ago.The company highlighted the success of original hits such as The Crown, which won two Golden Globe awards this year, and the reprise of Gilmore Girls, which was well-received in Europe and the US. Netflix’s additional 7m subscribers in the fourth quarter beat its previous guidance of 5.2m. Netflix also addressed potential risks from Donald Trump’s administration, which analysts speculate might reverse the broadband policies of the Obama administration. The company said any weakening in US net neutrality law “is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable”.

The company is on course to spend $6bn to produce and license original content in 2017, building on demand for hits such as House of Cards and The Crown.

Mark Zuckerberg’s social media site added $31.9bn, the largest gain in absolute and per cent terms.Fang stocks hit the ground running, advancing, on average, 6.6 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent drop over the same period in 2016 as fears of a US recession and skittishness about the Chinese economy drove broader US equities and the Fangs lower at the start of last year.Investors also soured on the Fangs and the broader S&P 500 technology sector in the week after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. The sell-off was fuelled by concerns that his immigration policies could hurt these companies because the groups rely on highly skilled workers from abroad. Mr Trump’s campaign policies on trade also made investors antsy because of their international supply chains as did uncertainty about his stance on net neutrality — the idea that all traffic on the internet should be treated equally.But a conciliatory tone struck by the president-elect during a mid-December meeting with Silicon Valley chief executives, including Jeff Bezos and Larry Page, helped alleviate some of those concerns. And by the time the new year rolled round, Fangs appeared to have shaken off those concerns.Their advance has been driven in part by a broader rally in the Nasdaq Composite that has pushed deeper into record territory — hitting three all-time highs already this year. But part of the gains have also been driven by improving outlook on the companies.Douglas Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan, said Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, remained their “favourite names” among large-caps this year. He said enthusiasm towards Facebook, his top large-cap pick, “remains somewhat muted” amid fears about ad load growth, potential for slower revenue growth and slowing engagement. However, he said: “We believe these fears are largely overdone and continue to create a good buying opportunity”.Mr Anmuth also said Netflix’s membership price changes pushed through last year, stronger original content that was set to surge and increased global profitability mean he expected the stock to outperform this year.Meanwhile, sentiment on ecommerce site Amazon has been aided as US consumers spent a record $91.7bn online during the November and December holiday period, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That was an 11 per cent increase from the year-ago period. Amazon also dominated the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, with its virtual assistant, Alexa, which carmaker Ford picked to be the voice-activated digital assistant in its cars.The advance this year in Fang shares compares with a 1.6 per cent gain in the S&P 500 to 2,275.3 and a 1 per cent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to 19,954.2 over the same period. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has jumped 3.4 per cent to 5,563.6.

Fears of a US recession and skittishness about the Chinese economy drove broader US equities and the Fangs lower at the start of 2016.But this year, they managed to shake off some concerns that had bogged them down after the election of Donald Trump late last year.

That was an 11 per cent increase from the year ago period.Analysts at JP Morgan picked Facebook as their value internet play for the year, noting that fears about ad load growth and slowing engagement are overdone and that these created a good buying opportunity.

A motley squad of small-town schoolchildren; an enigmatic heroine who appears out of nowhere into their midst; a journey into the supernatural punctuated by several unexplained nosebleeds. Haven’t we seen this before?On paper, it almost looked as though Netflix had given the internet the Christmas present it had been crying out for: another season of the sci-fi hit that earlier this year made overnight stars of the kids at its centre and overnight kids of its grown-up audience. But when The OA debuted last Friday — in a surprise music-industry-style “drop” release — it turned out that, in fact, it hadn’t. The surreal new sci-fi series is one of the most original Netflix “originals” yet — a spectacular experiment that toys as nerve-janglingly with our faith in its narrative acrobatics as it does with the lives of its subjects.Brit Marling, who also co-created the series, is the “OA” of the title (the meaning of the two letters goes unaddressed for much of the season), a streaming-era Laura Palmer who vanishes from a Twin Peaks sort of US town only to return to it without explanation — and having regained her long-lost power of sight — seven years later. (To offer any further details of the plot would be to diminish the experience of watching it unfold; the intricate and multi-layered storyline is, in the retelling, essentially one long spoiler.)We first glimpse the elusive OA in the show’s opening seconds: a pale, pixelated streak caught through the quivering lens of a phone camera, dashing across a busy highway as if trying to slip out of shot. And indeed the rest of the series is spent trying to bring her into focus. As she gradually recounts the events of her absence to a group of baffled local kids, we are led along a great narrative ellipse that loops repeatedly back in time, episode by episode, to illuminate a rich and disturbing picture of the present.If Stranger Things was an exercise in nostalgia, a warm quilt stitched together from fragments of 1980s cinema, The OA is a leap forward. Marling and her co-creator Zal Batmanglij have drawn on their background in indie films to embark on a brave and at times unwieldy venture, applying a quiet interiority to the small-screen thriller to create a show that is as emotionally rich as it is binge-watchable.Though it occasionally loses its grip on its lofty material (brace yourself for the religious references), and skids a little in its narrative chicanes, The OA is quite something to behold: a strange and strangely beautiful thing."
361;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Tech stocks rally ahead of Trump meeting;;Talk about a Trump bump.The market value of the S&P 500 information technology index climbed by $61bn and that of the so-called FANGs – Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google rose by $26.6bn — a day before president elect Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with tech leaders.Indeed technology stocks led the rally on the benchmark S&P 500, rising 1.3 per cent, ahead of Wednesday, when the who’s who of the tech world — including Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Oracle Co-CEO Safra Catz and Cisco’s head Chuck Robbins — will meet with Mr Trump in New York.The meeting is expected to focus on US job creation and how the companies can work with the government to help improve efficiency. But investors are hoping that the talks could also help smooth over some concerns the tech community has over some of Mr Trump’s campaign promises.Technology stocks have underperformed since Mr Trump won the presidential election — with the S&P 500 technology index rising just 2.8 per cent since then, compared with a 6 per cent rise in the broader S&P. And part of the reason for that has been Mr Trump’s tough stance on immigration and trade as tech companies often rely on highly-skilled workers from abroad and their international supply chains.However, some have noted that tech groups stand to benefit if Mr Trump does lower the tax rate that US companies would need to pay when they repatriate foreign profits.
362;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-31T05:55:17Z;The future of television: plotting its comeback;Innovation and evolving services mean TV is not such a turn-off;Television was supposed to be dead by now, killed by the internet. Yet as we enter the eighth decade since its mass adoption as the primary form of home entertainment, the glowing box in the living room is showing that rumours of its demise may have been premature.In the past few years the increase in the popularity of streaming services such as Netflix, together with a shift by younger viewers towards digital platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, has hit TV audience ratings and advertising revenues.Still, for the main US broadcast networks, 2016 is shaping up to be a solid year.Like many commodities, television advertising in the US is sold via a futures market — the upfronts — where advertisers can lock in prices for the slots they buy. There is also spot buying, known as the “scatter” market, where unsold inventory is auctioned off throughout the year, and where price moves dependent on demand.This year, concerns about whether the ads are being viewed and measurement of digital advertising sent brands scurrying back to the relative safety of broadcast television. Les Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, summed up the situation earlier this year. Broadcast television remained “the single best and most effective medium” for brands, he said. Digital advertising “sometimes lacks accuracy and credibility . . . as a result, there is a clear shift in advertising back to network television”. That shift resulted in significant gains for CBS and rival networks with this year’s upfront as much as five percentage points up on last year’s sales. Across cable and broadcast, total sales were close to $19bn.But when data were analysed in the second quarter of the year the picture was less rosy. “TV’s share gains look fleeting,” Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, wrote in a recent research note. “The narrative of TV taking back share from online could start to unwind.”In cable television, the advertising picture is not particularly clear. Some networks, such as Turner Broadcasting, which is part of Time Warner, have taken steps to run fewer ads on channels in order to retain viewers and offer advertisers more prominence and less clutter, as well as supporting ad rates in a weak market. After fewer ads ran on Animal Kingdom, a new drama series from Turner’s TNT network, the company says the ads were more effective because viewers were more likely to remember the brand and to say they would buy a product or service.The pace of television advertising innovation has been faster in the UK. Sky, the UK pay-TV group in which Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox owns a 39 per cent stake, has developed a proprietary targeted advertising system that means one Sky customer could see one set of advertisements in its programming and the house next door could get another.The technology has created new revenues from brands that want to target a particular region, or from local companies, such as car dealers seeking to market special offers to a defined location.These campaigns can generate “three or four times what we would charge just through a standard, untargeted ad”, Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this year. He wants to bring the technology to the company’s other territories, such as Germany and Italy.In the US, a consensus is emerging about the future of the costly packages of channels, or “bundles”, which are distributed and sold by cable and satellite operators. For decades the bundle has generated billions of dollars for media companies but there are signs that consumers are losing patience with having to pay for channels that they may not want. Many have “cut the cord” and cancelled their subscriptions in favour of cheaper, lower cost alternatives such as Netflix.Such services are built around on-demand programming: viewers watch what they want, when they want. But there is still interest in the more passive experience of watching scheduled TV — “lean-back” viewing — which explains why so many efforts are under way to create cheaper packages of channels to be delivered to viewers digitally.Hulu, an on-demand streaming service whose owners include 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney, is at work on such a service, as is YouTube, the world’s largest video site. Pluto TV, a free internet service that recently raised $30m, is also betting on audience interest in a viewing experience that is delivered digitally but resembles television. “One of the things [TV] has got right is it makes it easy for you to get a broad range of viewing options in one place,” Tom Ryan, chief executive, recently told the FT.This new wave of digital services is part of TV’s evolution. The medium is about to turn 70, but there is clearly life in it yet.
363;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;AT&T outlines plan to take on Netflix in digital video;Time Warner shares fall as investors weigh risks of regulators blocking $85.4bn deal;AT&T said it would use its proposed $85.4bn acquisition of Time Warner to build a digital video platform to rival Netflix, as it outlined the rationale for a takeover that stands to transform the telecoms group into one of the world’s biggest media companies. The risk of regulators intervening in the deal weighed on Time Warner shares on Monday. At $87.61 in early afternoon trading, down 2 per cent on the day, they are well below the $107.50-per-share price of a transaction that has been criticised by both Democrats and Republicans. AT&T bonds also suffered a sell-off.One media industry rival to Time Warner, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, issued a statement calling for the deal to be reviewed. “A deal of this size and scope, and the impact it will have on consumers, should receive the highest level of regulatory scrutiny,“ it said.Randall Stephenson, AT&T chief executive, remained confident that it could get the deal approved, noting that there were few examples of Washington blocking the combination of two companies with different core businesses.He said that owning content from HBO, Time Warner’s critically-acclaimed premium network, and Warner Bros, Hollywood’s largest studio, would allow AT&T to move more quickly as it builds a new video product to offset the decline of its satellite television business, DirecTV. Broadcasters and pay-TV groups have been tripping over themselves to launch digital video services to respond to a growing threat from Netflix and Amazon, which have combined on-demand platforms with production houses responsible for shows such as House of Cards. AT&T will next month launch DirecTV Now, the latest in a string of “over-the-top” (OTT) video services that bypass traditional cable or satellite distributors by delivering content over the internet. However, Mr Stephenson admitted AT&T had not been able to include many of the features it wanted in DirecTV Now because it could not secure permission from content owners, which balked at plans to let customers share clips from their favourite shows online. “There are lot of things we really aspire to do with this platform — clipping content that you’re watching and sharing with your friends via messaging or via social media,” Mr Stephenson told analysts on Monday. “Our customers are really demanding that.”He added: “But trying to develop those capabilities with the current content providers is proving difficult. People are obviously very protective of their content. It's just really, really hard to get this type of innovation done.” Mr Stephenson said outright ownership of popular shows such as Game of Thrones and Veep would enable the company to “innovate our content much quicker”. Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, said video on demand offerings akin to Netflix and its own HBO Now service would soon become “a universal thing” for US customers.Mr Bewkes, who insisted he would stay at Time Warner if the takeover is successful, said customers were growing tired of having to pay more than $100 a month for a bundle of hundreds of channels they rarely watched. “Currently, you go to your set-top box, your television and there is that whole dial of networks — hundreds of channels,” he said. “But they should all be video on demand, just like HBO or Netflix.”Some analysts suggested that AT&T would try to mount a competitive threat to successful on demand services such as Netflix by keeping the most popular shows Time Warner shows for its own products.“We believe it is likely AT&T will accelerate streaming video content being shifted from Netflix to its own platforms, a potential minor negative for Netflix,” said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS. However, any such plan would surely count against the company during what is expected to be a very thorough regulatory review of the Time Warner takeover.AT&T completed its $49bn acquisition of DirecTV last year a deal that bought it billions of dollars a year in free cash flow, but also a ticking timer, because customers are ditching ageing satellite TV services in favour of more modern alternatives.
364;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-18T16:27:24Z;Netflix shares poised for best day since 2013;;Netflix shares were poised for their biggest one-day gain in more than three years after the online streaming site behind hit shows like Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black said it added more subscribers than expected last quarter. Shares in the California-based company jumped 19.2 per cent to $118.95 after the company said it added 370,000 US customers and 3.2m international users in the third quarter, topping analysts estimates for 304,000 and 2m respectively and its own estimates.Moreover, its guidance for 1.45m new domestic subscribers and 3.75m international subscribers in the current quarter also topped analysts’ expectations even as the company has lifted its subscription fees.Netflix also said it will be releasing 1,000 hours of original content next year, compared with 600 hours this year.That in turn prompted a handful of analysts on Wall Street to lift their price target on the stock and added to the rally in Netflix shares on Tuesday.Here’s a look back at the 10 best days for Netflix shares. The stock is currently poised for its ninth best day on record.
365;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-18T16:06:34Z;Netflix shares soar on subscriber growth;Video streaming company says original content like ‘Stranger Things’ has helped boost user base;Netflix raced past forecasts for subscriber growth in the third quarter, sending its shares up nearly 20 per cent at the open on Tuesday.The California-based video streaming company said it added 370,000 US customers and 3.2m international users in the quarter, beating its previous guidance of 300,000 and 2m respectively — and boosting its total subscriber base to nearly 87m.Netflix attributed the jump to “excitement around Netflix original content”, as hit shows such as Stranger Things attracted new audiences even after the company raised subscription prices.Revenues climbed by a third to $2.29bn while net income rose to 12 cents a share, more than double Wall Street forecasts.Netflix shares rose 19 per cent to $118.94 in morning trading in New York on Tuesday.It was welcome news for investors attuned to a narrative of a company unable to keep pace with its soaring share price and lofty valuation. Netflix stock more than doubled to lead the S&P 500 in 2015, but took a dive this summer on disappointing subscriber growth — with last quarter marking its weakest showing in three years.Netflix has dominated the race to capture audiences as they move away from so-called linear television — or tuning in at a preset time — in favour of digitally streamed, on-demand viewing.There are so many competitors out there for screentime now. Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook video, all of it is taking a lot of hoursHowever, competition has thickened as digital subscription services launch almost weekly, and established broadcasters and cable operators with large audiences start standalone services. Netflix is also fighting for customers with rivals such Amazon, Hulu and HBO.“There are so many competitors out there for screentime now,” Reed Hastings, chief executive, said on an investor call. “Snapchat, YouTube, Facebook video, all of it is taking a lot of hours.”Netflix says it will produce 1,000 hours of original programming next year, up from 600 hours this year, building on demand for hits such as House of Cards and Making a Murderer. At this pace Netflix appears to be heading towards spending half of its content budget on original programming rather than third-party content within a few years, analysts say.The race for original shows, while beneficial to Hollywood studios, has been expensive. Netflix is on course to spend about $5bn to produce and license original content this year and $6bn next year, while rival Amazon spent an estimated $3bn last year on shows such as Transparent.Netflix has raised prices in the US — by $1 per month for new customers and $2 for existing ones — to help fund an additional $1bn spending on content, but is burning cash at $1bn a year and needs to tap debt markets. Mr Hastings said on Monday that the company had no plans for further price increases.In January Netflix launched in more than 130 countries and said it would reach 100m subscribers “some time next year”. However, on Monday it scrapped ambitions to enter China in the near term, citing a “challenging” regulatory environment for foreign content.
366;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-17T23:33:27Z;Netflix: stranger things;It will be hard to increase profit margins to the level the video service’s valuation requires;Netflix highlighted The Crown, its upcoming biopic of Queen Elizabeth II, as being a good watch “for investors”. If there is a message there it is a bit obscure. Perhaps a line from the trailer: “You don’t think I would have preferred to grow up out of the spotlight, away from the scrutiny and visibility?”Coming of age in public markets is difficult when your ambition is to disrupt television worldwide. Netflix’s volatile results have sent the shares down by double digit percentages in the previous two earnings releases and they lag behind the market this year.On Monday evening, though, came the rebound — the shares rising 20 per cent after hours to a 2016 high — and a reminder that Netflix investors are indulgent as long as there is subscriber growth.Internationally, there was a net 3.2m additional subscribers in the third quarter, Netflix said, compared with its own forecast of 2m. The more mature US market also beat expectations for net additions, with 370,000. The ensuing surge sent Netflix back to a $50bn market capitalisation despite making just $163m in net income in the past 12 months. Growth is essential but it is still hard to see future earnings justifying that valuation.Of course, shareholders have kept faith with other companies for much longer with only crumbs of profits — Amazon, which competes with Netflix in streaming video, is an obvious example. Its operating margin is slightly thinner than Netflix’s 3.5 per cent. Yet the market dominance that Amazon has achieved in online retail along with its remarkable second act in cloud computing is ample evidence that profits will emerge. At Netflix, it is not as certain.The company has promised “material” profits next year, yet free cash flow is worsening to a negative $1.5bn this year. Those are not irreconcilable: by investing more cash upfront in original content such as The Crown and Stranger Things, Netflix cuts out studios and gains flexibility to distribute wherever it wants. Margin expansion should follow.But how much? Chief executive Reed Hastings noted there was plenty of room to grow, comparing the 1bn daily active users at Facebook and Google with Netflix’s 100m members. Both those companies also make real money, with a 26 per cent operating margin at Google and 40 per cent at Facebook. Those look out of reach for Netflix and its hold on the throne is far from secure.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
367;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Netflix shares jump 20% on strong subscriber growth;;Netflix added many more new customers to its streaming service than expected in the third quarter, sending shares up nearly 20 per cent in after-hours trade on Monday.The California-based company said it added 370,000 US subscribers and 3.2m international subscribers in the quarter, beating its previous guidance of 300,000 and 2m, respectively — and boosting its total customer base to about 87m. The company attributed the jump to “excitement around Netflix original content”, while forecasting another 5.2m total new customers next quarter.Revenues climbed more than a third to $2.2bn in the quarter while net income climbed to 13 cents a share — more than double that of street forecasts.Netflix has dominated the race to capture digital audiences, although it faces with increased competition from Amazon and Hulu, as well as big broadcasters and premium cable operators that have launched standalone subscription services. In January, Netflix expanded to more than 130 countries and declared it would reach 100m subscribers “some time next year”. However new additions in the first half of the year were slower than expected, which the company said may have resulted from “press coverage” of its plans to raise prices.The company is on course to spend about $5bn to produce and license original content this year, and an additional $6bn next year, building on demand for series such as Making a Murderer and Daredevil.Netflix stock has swung sharply, losing 14 per cent this year after more than doubling to lead the S&P 500 in 2015, as investors had been spooked by disappointingly slow subscriber growth. Last quarter, the company reported its weakest subscriber growth in 3 years, sending its shares plunging.
368;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-14T21:48:18Z;Week ahead: ECB, US earnings, presidential debate;;European monetary policy, corporate America, US politics and Chinese growth all demand investor attention next week.Here’s what to watch in the coming days.European Central BankA recent report that the ECB’s governing council had been discussing tapering its asset-buying programme spooked investors, and they will now tune into Mario Draghi’s press conference on Thursday for clues on how the central bank could move forward. Some economists expect the ECB could announce a six-month extension to the QE programme, which is currently set to expire in March 2017, at its December meeting.“Nevertheless, given the resilience in growth, the pick-up in inflation, and concerns about the negative side effects of low interest rates and bond yields, we believe a tapering decision on 8 December should not be dismissed easily,” Reinhard Cluse, economist at UBS, said.Economists expect the central bank will leave its interest rates unchanged next week.Clinton-Trump debateAcross the Atlantic US politics and corporate America grab the spotlight. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump will face off at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for the final debate ahead of the 2016 elections. The 90-minute debate will be moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace.Mr Trump heads to the match-up amid a fresh string of allegations that he groped or sexually assaulted women, following the release of a video earlier this month in which he bragged about groping women. For Mr Trump, who has in recent weeks lost the support of many top Republicans, this could be a final chance to bounce back in the polls.US earningsFor investors looking for a reprieve from US politics third quarter earnings season picks up pace with more than 80 companies listed on the S&P 500 scheduled to report results. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley round off results of major US banks. But tech giants like IBM, Netflix, Yahoo, Intel and Microsoft are also on the roster.China GDPFinally, China, which reported disappointing trade numbers last week briefly weighing on markets, is expected to report that the pace of economic growth remained unchanged at 6.7 per cent for a third straight quarter. Reports on retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment are also expected to be little changed.
369;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-13T06:28:48Z;Sky revenues grow despite surging cost of live football;;Sky grew its revenues by 5 per cent on a like for like basis in the three months to the end of September and says it is “on track” despite facing a surge in the cost of live football rights and a fall off in advertising revenues.Although the broadcaster’s share price has risen in the last few days on the back of speculation that Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, which already owns 39 per cent of the group, may launch another takeover, the shares have fallen sharply over the last 12 months.The slump has been driven by investor concerns over the rising cost of sports rights in the UK and Germany, the threat from streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix and the drop off in advertising.For the three months to the end of September, Sky suffered a 3 per cent fall in advertising revenues – part of a wider trend across the media industry following the economic uncertainty created by Britain’s vote to leave the EU.But Sky chief executive Jeremy Darroch said:I’m pleased with the start we have made to the year, with like-for-like revenue growth of over 5% and more than 100,000 new customers joining Sky. We finished the quarter strongly after a slower start against the backdrop of the Rio Olympics and UEFA Euro 2016.Sky said its new businesses in Italy and Germany were also performing well with like for like revenues up 9 per cent in Germany and 4 per cent in Italy – partly lifted by a rights deal to show some of the Rio Olympic Games there.Mr Darroch also said the company would be shortly launching its new mobile service – part of the broadcaster’s strategy to diversify and take on the threat from rival BT.
370;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-10-10T19:35:28Z;Netflix sale unlikely, Deutsche Bank says;;Netflix’s future is in focus again after Deutsche Bank sent a bearish note to clients on Sunday raising doubts about its prospects for a sale to Disney or Apple.Deutsche’s Bryan Kraft initiated a sell rating on the US streaming service with a price target of $90 for the stock. That is 14 per cent lower than its closing price on Friday.Rumours have been circulating that Disney or Apple may acquire the producer behind hit shows House of Cards and Narcos to ramp up their content portfolio. But Mr Kraft said the company’s business model “is too fully formed and well understood by the market to be acquired by Disney or Apple.”“Lack of a compelling strategic rationale and severe economic/earnings dilution are major obstacles to a potential combination,” he said, adding that Netflix’s sky-high valuation of 100 times estimated 2018 earnings is also a hurdle.But Mr Kraft praised the company for its domestic subscriber growth and average revenue per user, among other factors.“Netflix’s pivot to original programming, the development of its own in-house studio, the growth in aggregate studio output, and the size of Netflix’s programming budget all mitigate the apparent risk from Amazon, Hulu, and local international players increasing their SVOD programming spend.”Netflix’s shares were down less than 1 per cent on Monday.
371;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Amazon hits fresh high boosted by bullish JPMorgan;;Something for Jeff Bezos to smile about.Amazon shares rose as much as 2.1 per cent on Tuesday hitting a fresh all-time high of $815.72 following a bullish note from analysts at JPMorgan.Doug Anmuth established a December 2017 price target of $1,000 for the stock. That is up 8 per cent from the previous target of $925 and up nearly 23 per cent from current levels.“We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall eCommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party versus third party inventory is a major advantage compared with other retailers,” Mr Anmuth said. First party vendors sells wholesale to Amazon, while third-party vendors are those that act as retailers and just sell through Amazon.“Our price target is based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis as we believe this methodology appropriately attributes value to the company’s large, fast-growing and surprisingly profitable …Amazon Web Services segment, which Amazon continues to invest in,” he added.Still, JPMorgan has only the second highest price target on the stock on Wall Street. Ken Sena at Evercore ISI sports the highest at $1,015.Moreover, the Seattle-based company has 42 “buy” ratings, five “hold” ratings and zero “sell” ratings on Wall Street.Amazon — one of the so-called FANG companies that includes Facebook, Amazon,Netflix and Google — has also outperformed the S&P 500 in the current quarter and is up more than 20 per cent so far this year.
372;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-09-26T22:48:15Z;S&P 500 poised for best quarter this year;;Time for a little bubbly?The S&P 500 is poised for its best quarter in 2016 thanks in part to a rally in shares of technology companies.Despite muted trading for much of July and August, which saw the S&P 500 finish within 1 per cent of where it began the day for 43 straight trading days — the benchmark index is up 2.3 per cent this quarter and up for a fourth straight quarter.And that compares with a 1.9 per cent gain in the second quarter and a 0.8 per cent rise in the first three months of the year.“I think the reason the [S&P 500] performed best in Q3 is simply a matter of timing,” Randy Fredrick at Schwab Center for Financial Research, said. “Q1 was not a good quarter due to the historical price drop in crude oil prices, Q2 was spoiled by the Brexit surprise just 2 weeks before the end of the quarter, but Q3 started in the early days of the Brexit rebound.”The S&P 500 finished little changed in June — the month the UK voted to leave the European Union — but rose 3.6 per cent the following month as concerns around the vote abated and amid better-than-expected data on the US economy.And a breakdown showed that technology easily outperformed the broader index, climbing nearly 11 per cent so far this quarter, with Seagate Technology leading the gains in the sector, rising 52 per cent over the same period. The so-called FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon,Netflix and Google — have also outperformed the benchmark index in the current quarter.With the current quarter’s gains the S&P 500 is up 5 per cent so far this year.
373;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-09-11T20:11:35Z;Review: ‘Streaming, Sharing, Stealing’, by Michael D. Smith and Rahul Telang;TV and film networks need to move away from ‘gut instincts’ to use data;When the makers of the US version of House of Cards were pitching their series to television networks they were sure they had all the makings of a hit. The only problem was that none of the networks they approached wanted to take the risk of funding a pilot, let alone the series, because according to conventional wisdom in the industry, political dramas were not successful.But streaming service Netflix analysed data on its 33m subscribers to discover that many were fans of lead actor Kevin Spacey, director David Fincher and had rented the original BBC series. Those data were proof enough for Netflix to dispense with a pilot and instead offer $100m upfront for two series — a decision greeted with scepticism in the industry, but which turned out to be inspired. The programme has proved incredibly popular with audiences and critics alike and its fifth series is due for release next year.The story demonstrates the role that data now play in entertainment industry decision making — Netflix was even able to produce several trailers targeted at its various audience categories.It shows how the balance of power is shifting away from film, TV and music businesses, traditionally the biggest and most powerful, towards such entities as Netflix and Amazon — those that distribute content.Streaming, Sharing, Stealing charts the history of film, TV and music industries, going back a century to show how developments in technology and changing consumer habits have created a period of unprecedented change for them.The book, by two professors at Carnegie Mellon University, offers many lessons for executives in the creative industries, as well as serving as a case study of the challenges faced by any industry grappling with disruptive forces.It is packed with examples, from the nimble-footed who reacted quickly to adapt their businesses, to laggards who lost empires.Consider Apple, which was struggling when Steve Jobs rejoined in 1997 and became its chief executive. Jobs pinpointed the failure: Apple relied upon third parties to sell its computers and staff in those shops were often happier to recommend the cheaper products of competitors. He hunted out market and demographic data to show where Apple could build its own shops in the most convenient locations and sell directly to its customers — a strategy that went against the grain at the time.The book also offers insights for artists, film-makers and writers, pointing to how they can maximise what they earn and provide incentives that discourage piracy. The band Radiohead decided to bypass traditional music publishers when releasing their 2007 album In Rainbows. They made the tracks available to fans directly through their website, for any price they wished to pay, including nothing at all. It was the band’s most profitable album at the time.Those that failed to recognise the changing climate include NBCUniversal, which took a gamble in 2007 to remove its TV shows from Apple’s iTunes player. However, viewers largely opted for piracy rather than following NBC to other digital outlets.In one sense, Streaming, Sharing, Stealing highlights what the seasoned marketer has always known: the immense value of knowing your customer. Yet this study of the triumph of data is still much needed, as evidenced by the many executives who refuse to believe that the age of “gut instinct” and the “taste maker” has passed.The upshot for businesses is clear: change is happening and the way to ensure your business survives is to be ready to adapt and take bold decisions — just as Netflix did with its $100m bet on a series the industry said would never work.Streaming, Sharing, Stealing: Big Data and the Future of Entertainment, by Michael D. Smith and Rahul Telang, MIT, 232 pages
374;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-09-10T06:32:10Z;Silicon Valley’s adoration of the delinquent entrepreneur;A tale of a driven youth bucking the system, writes Philip Delves Broughton;"One of the documents most widely distributed among technology companies, and increasingly beyond, is one titled Netflix Culture: Freedom and Responsibility, produced by the video-streaming service in 2009. It addresses its employees as if they are adults, a remarkable and rare quality in a HR document. It argues for hiring the best people you can, giving them freedom and responsibility, and rewarding them for their output and performance rather than hard work: “Sustained A-level performance, despite minimal effort, is rewarded with more responsibility and great pay.” Great salaries, rather than the vagaries of the bonus, are seen as the best incentives.Netflix explained that as companies grow, so do complexity and bureaucracy, driving out the best people and leading to even more bureaucracy to manage the incompetents who remain. So the trick is to hire ever more self-managing, high-performing people and not cramp their style. You lay out a strategy, establish roles and objectives and get out of your employees’ way. You don’t force them to attend meetings they don’t need. You keep things ad hoc. And you certainly don’t count vacation days. If you expect performance, you let your employees decide when and how much they want to work to achieve it.Much of Silicon Valley’s behaviour has been shaped by the Californian counterculture. But few companies have been more influential than Patagonia, the outerwear company based five hours’ drive south of Netflix’s headquarters, in the California beach town of Ventura. Yvon Chouinard, the group’s founder, has for years been a Pied Piper for a different way of working. Ten years ago he published a book summing it all up, Let My People Go Surfing: The Education of a Reluctant Businessman; this month it is reissued, a testament to its rare durability among business books.The opening lines read: “I’ve been a businessman for almost sixty years. It’s as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or a lawyer. I’ve never respected the profession.” As a boy growing up in Maine, Mr Chouinard would watch his father, a French-Canadian handyman, extract his own teeth with a pair of pliers and whiskey for anaesthetic. Mr Chouinard Jr had few friends at school but, when his parents moved to California, he discovered climbing and falconry.In his late teens, he began making iron pitons — metal spikes — for fellow climbers. He spent a summer in the Rockies surviving on a case of cat food mixed with oatmeal, potatoes “ground squirrel, blue grouse, and porcupines assassinated à la Trotsky, with an ice axe”. As he became a more accomplished climber, he spent 200 nights a year sleeping outside. He didn’t own a tent until he was nearly 40. In 1962, he was arrested for riding a freight train in Arizona and spent 18 days in jail on a charge of “wandering around aimlessly with no apparent means of support”.His is the kind of entrepreneurial story America loves. The delinquent youth driven by an outsider’s passion, bucking the system.He began selling rugby shirts, which he found were ideal for climbing. And by the 1970s he found that, despite his best intentions, he had become a businessman. Yet, he “wanted to distance myself as far as possible from those pasty-faced corpses in suits I saw in airline magazine ads”. Business seemed to have come to him by accident: a means to pay for his climbing had become an organisation with bills to pay, products to launch and a payroll to meet.He vowed: “Work had to be enjoyable on a daily basis. We all had to come to work on the balls of our feet and go up the stairs two steps at a time. We needed to be surrounded by friends who could dress whatever way they wanted, even be barefoot. We all needed to have flex­time to surf the waves when they were good . . . [or] take care of a sick child.”It hasn’t all been like that, of course. By the early 1990s, Patagonia was in trouble and Mr Chouinard had to lay off 120 employees, 20 per cent of his staff. He had to refocus the company on its purpose. He took it upon himself to teach the Patagonia values to small groups of staff every week, driving them out on camping trips to talk. His concern about the degradation of the environment injected a new seriousness of purpose.Kris McDivitt, then chief executive, wondered if such purpose was compatible with the enjoyment the founder had once coveted. She wrote at the time: “I’ll bet you anything it’s a new kind of fun, one mixed with a bit of a squint in one eye with our heads cocked toward the ground.” Patagonia was no longer simply an enjoyable place to work. It became a company with a purpose.And so we have the Patagonia of today, highly conscious of its supply chain. A pioneer in on-site childcare and flexible working. Committed to its social and environmental causes. An office without cubicles, a cafeteria where everyone fetches their own lunch. It is a model that has influenced Google, Facebook, Apple and Netflix.Patagonia’s clothing is as popular today in urban coffee shops as it is on mountains or in whitewater, but its culture may be its most lasting impact.The writer is author of ‘What They Teach You at Harvard Business School’"
375;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-09-07T05:17:43Z;The algorithms using data to suggest your next purchase;The quality and quantity of data gleaned from online customers enable bespoke buying suggestions;Recommendation engines help Amazon to suggest books you might like, Linked­In to flag up jobs you could apply for and Facebook to suggest friends to contact. They also make proposals for the 125m hours of films and television that users of online streaming service Netflix watch every day.As Carlos Gomez Uribe, Netflix’s vice-president of product innovation, and Neil Hunt, chief product officer, wrote this year in an academic paper: “Humans are surprisingly bad at choosing between many options, quickly getting overwhelmed and choosing ‘none of the above’ or making poor choices.”They reckon that algorithmically generated recommendations account for about 80 per cent of hours streamed to Netflix subscribers, with the rest coming via search. By their estimates, recommendation engines that pique viewers’ interest and engage them with the service save the company about $1bn a year lost through customer churn. Netflix’s 2015 annual revenues were $6.8bn.Companies selling products or services online have been using such techniques for a while, whether off-the-peg programs or tailor-made versions. What has changed is the science behind the recommendations, the sheer volume and variety of data fed into the engines and the sophistication of the algorithms used to analyse them. This means users are receiving more helpful suggestions and therefore buying more, says Sean Owen, director of data science at US-based data software company Cloudera.“A sales uplift in the region of 20 per cent to 25 per cent is what a company like Amazon might be aiming for from its recommender systems,” he says. “That’s pretty consistent with what I hear from other ecommerce companies that do this well.”Recommendation algorithms broadly fall into two categories. One is content-based filtering, driven by the attributes of items. If you view a comedy starring Seth Rogen, a content-based recommender will propose other films in which the actor appears.The other kind, collaborative-based filtering, analyses user behaviour. It analyses data about users’ activities and engagement with items to cluster them into groups. If you buying a carrying crate for a puppy, you may soon receive a recommendation for a particular book on dog training or a certain harness because other people who bought the crate also bought that book or harness.“Collaborative filtering tends to do a better job of presenting new ideas to the customers,” says Mr Owen. However, collaborative filtering also requires a great deal more data.Ted Dunning, chief application architect at data software company MapR, advises any companies just starting to use recommendation techniques to avoid wasting time on implementing lots of complex algorithms before they understand what a few simple ones reveal. They should also be ready to maintain a quest for ever-better data to feed into the recommendation engine.The approach a company takes will depend on the kind of item being sold. UK-based start-up Artfinder, an online art marketplace, introduced a recommendation engine this year and, on the basis that any artwork is unique, chose a collaborative filtering approach. It felt that suggestions based on similar items would not be as effective as basing them on algorithmic observations of how different groups of buyers responded to works by the same artist or belonging to similar genres.Zalando, the Germany-based online fashion retailer, with annual sales of €3bn, uses both approaches, says Mikio Braun, who heads its recommendation and search operations. With collaborative filtering “we can derive similarities between items that might not be observed solely through product data,” he says. Such data used in content-based filtering will not reveal that customers think a certain top goes well with a certain skirt, but collaborative filtering, based on customer behaviour, can reveal they make a good outfit.Overall, while companies may seek greater insights into online customers’ preferences, they should remember this may not always be welcome. As Jason Gordon, a consumer analytics expert at professional services firm Deloitte, says: “There’s a fine balance to be struck between relevance and creepiness.”
376;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The Silicon Valley Tax Directors Group, which lists Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook among its members, also argued that the Dutch government should “question the legitimacy” of new UK tax rules aimed in part at making technology groups that book sales offshore pay more in tax.In a letter sent in May to the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, the group cautioned that changes to the country’s tax regime would “harm the Netherlands investment climate, resulting in reduced foreign investments and a loss of jobs”. The letter was published in the Dutch press on Monday.The Netherlands has become one of the main hubs for US tech groups in Europe, with companies including Netflix and Uber having their European headquarters in the country, thanks in part to its favourable tax regime. The country’s use of tax rulings — when a government guarantees how much tax a company will pay — has made it one of the most popular destinations in Europe for foreign investment. But tax policy in the Netherlands has come under scrutiny after the European Commission charged the Dutch government with striking a so-called sweetheart deal with US coffee chain Starbucks. The increased regulatory attention from Brussels has cast doubt over the widespread use of such tax rulings.Mr Rutte had asked for suggestions of ways to maintain the Netherlands’ competitiveness during a visit to Silicon Valley earlier this year. In its response, SVTDG also suggested cutting the Netherlands’ tax rate from 25 per cent “to a rate that’s comparable” to the UK and Ireland, which have rates of 20 per cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively. The tax body also argued that it would be appropriate to challenge the new UK tax, claiming that it was a “violation of the tax treaty between the UK and the Netherlands and, in addition, could constitute a breach of the EU fundamental freedoms”. The UK’s “ diverted profits tax” is a 25 per cent levy introduced by George Osborne, the former chancellor, in April last year to deter companies from shifting profits abroad. It has been cited as a potential risk to their business in the annual reports of technology groups including LinkedIn, Computer Sciences Corp and Qlogic.In March, Facebook referred to the new tax when it announced a change in its structure that resulted in it booking sales in the UK, instead of routing the revenues through Ireland, where it has a more advantageous corporate tax rate.US business groups have attacked the diverted profits tax from its inception. Soon after it was announced, the National Foreign Trade Council, a US lobby group representing more than 300 multinationals, said that the measure was “an election year proposal that could have long-term consequences for inward investment into the UK”.In general, the letter, first published by Dutch newspaper Financieele Dagblad, is complimentary of the Dutch tax regime, which contains a number of perks for international companies and employees.In particular, the tax lobbying group praised the “easy access” to Dutch tax officials as well as the availability of “advance tax rulings”. SVTDG could not be reached for comment.

Entertainment companies are waging a brutal war for consumer eyeballs and dollars. The companies that operate the pipes, meanwhile, can sit back. Whatever content is most popular, they will get paid to deliver it. A market once obsessed with the threat of cord-cutting by pay-TV subscribers now looks at the likes of Charter Communications and Comcast and sees big gains in high-speed internet users. This year those two and a smaller provider, Cable One, have seen their shares jump.On Monday, private equity gave its mark of approval. TPG Capital acquired two small, regional cable and broadband providers RCN Telecom and Grande Communications for $2.25bn, collectively.The regional monopolies that rule US TV and internet delivery are not quite as dominant as they seem. RCN and Grande are “overbuilders” that install their own service to compete against incumbents*. Customers can pick a fringe provider if they do not want 500 channels, preferring fast internet and streaming video from Netflix and its growing list of rivals.RCN and Grande together have less than 1m subscribers, making them a minnow (whales Charter and Comcast have 44m broadband subscribers all told). Altice, the French telecom upstart, has made an expensive splash in the US by buying up marginal providers Suddenlink and Cablevision for $27bn in recent years. The heavy debt it has absorbed in doing so will remain a burden for some years; it could, however, become a logical acquirer of the TPG assets in time.Until then, other overbuilders make for nice targets. Google’s venture capital arm is a minority investor in Monday’s deals and, with its existing effort in rolling out fibre networks, perhaps Google and TPG have grand plans. A utility business is not as glamorous as the next hit TV show. But it is a steadier business.*This article was amended from the original to clarify the definition of an “overbuilder”Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
379;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-08-02T01:24:32Z;Nasdaq Composite nears all-time high;String of beats from Microsoft, Amazon and others provides tech industry hope of recovered profitability;A resurgent US technology sector has driven the Nasdaq Composite to within a hair of its all-time high as investors position for a rebound in an industry that had ranked among the worst performing in the first half of the year.The index, which includes tech behemoths Apple and Google-owner Alphabet, has advanced more than 7 per cent since the third quarter began, double the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period.The brisk climb follows a turn in earnings expectations, with a string of beats from Microsoft, Qualcomm, Amazon and Facebook providing optimism that the industry’s broader profitability may soon recover. Roughly four-in-five technology companies within the S&P 500 eclipsed forecasts this quarter, better than all but the healthcare industry.Earnings in the second quarter are now projected to fall 2 per cent from a year earlier, far narrower than the 7.3 per cent drop projected at the end of June and the best improvement of the industries tracked by FactSet.“It is an earnings bump but often earnings bumps get the rally going,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist with TD Ameritrade. “You are seeing companies not only beating what are pretty low expectations . . . but there has been a tone change particularly from the tech sector. [It went] from ‘We can go along at this pace, we can meet sales expectations’ to ‘We are starting to see opportunity’.”The popular FANGs trade of 2015 — in which shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google each climbed more than 30 per cent — has also been reinvigorated. While Netflix stock has lagged behind after the streaming TV and movie company reported disappointing subscriber trends, the other three have outpaced the Nasdaq since the end of June.The index now sits less than 1 per cent below its record high of 5,231.94 set in July 2015.The shift marks a rotation from defensive sectors that led the market at the start of the year, when investors sought out the safety of companies with relatively staid business models and stable dividend yields.Valuations of utilities, telecommunication and consumer staple companies appreciated rapidly, with the latter trading at 20.7 times expected 2017 earnings — above its five- and 10-year historical averages.“They had gotten to valuations that made no sense for companies with slow earnings growth and even slower revenue growth,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of wealth manager Atlantic Trust. “Do I want to own a bunch of utilities that have 2 per cent revenue growth selling for a higher multiple than a basket of global technology companies?”Investors remain apprehensive about the rally, with many pointing to the drop in global bond yields for the elevated share prices. Central bank stimulus has driven a cavalcade of foreign investors to the US market, a point that portfolio managers say is a key support of the market’s broad gains, including in technology.“We may be seeing a slight shift in investment behaviour,” said David Lebovitz, a strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management. “I’m not sure the bid for defensive parts of the market is behind us, but with monetary policy seemingly pushing on a string and convention around more fiscal policy and what that can do for growth, you are seeing investor mindsets tilt back to [the question of] where is growth going to come from?”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
380;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Netflix slides after net new subscriber numbers fall short;Goldman Sachs shares drop despite better than expected quarterly profits;Netflix shares skidded on Tuesday to their lowest close since October 2014 after the video streaming service disclosed disappointing subscriber figures.The group said it added 160,000 US streaming subscribers in the second quarter, and 1.52m international subscribers. Both readings missed the California-based company’s forecasts of 500,000 and 2m, respectively. Netflix also said it expected total streaming net additions of 2.3m globally in the current quarter, far shy of Wall Street’s target of 3.2m.Netflix has led the “cord-cutting” revolution by enticing consumers to use its streaming services in lieu of traditional broadcast rivals. The company said the slower-than-expected subscriber growth may have resulted from “press coverage” early in the quarter that it planned to increase prices by $1 — $2 a month for those who were grandfathered into an old pricing scheme.“We are growing, but not as fast as we would like or have been. Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.However, the disappointing figures left some investors feeling queasy and the stock tumbled 13.1 per cent to $85.84, bringing the year-to-date decline to 25 per cent.The apparently high sensitivity among existing customers to slightly higher prices “suggests the loyalty of Netflix subscribers is thin”, said Barton Crockett, an analyst at FBR.Mr Crockett added “if a meaningful set of consumers will drop with a ‘whisper’ of price hikes”, future price increases and additional subscriber growth may be “difficult to come by”.Jason Helfstein, an analyst at Oppenheimer, noted that while 2016 would probably be a “transitional year” for Netflix, he still expected the shares to outperform due to a “bullish outlook” for international subscriber growth next year.Elsewhere, shares of Goldman Sachs declined 1.2 per cent to $161.41 even after the New York investment bank posted better than expected quarterly profits.The group said its earnings per share increased by 87.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter, helped by a rebound in its large fixed-income trading unit, and a sharp drop in expenses. However, investors homed in on Goldman’s annualised return on equity — a key metric for banks — that came in at 8.7 per cent, the fourth sub-10 per cent reading in a row.The decline initially weighed on the S&P 500 financials sector, but it later recovered, closing 0.1 per cent higher. Financials have been the weakest performer this year on concerns about the profit impact of both global financial market volatility and persistently low interest rates. However, the sector has crept within 1 per cent of breaking even for the year.That has come as several large US lenders, such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, have posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. It also represents a marked improvement from the year-to-date decline of 17.7 per cent the financial sector faced in mid-February.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,163.8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crept up 0.1 per cent to 18,559, and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.4 per cent to 5,036.4.
381;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Netflix: square eyes;When reminded they are paying for the streaming service, customers cancel — this is the good news ;Sit too close to the screen and your vision gets blurry. Netflix investors were so wowed by the company’s impressive growth in subscribers and parabolic stock chart that they imagined it continuing forever. Not even the chief executive suggesting that the stock was overvalued could tear them away.A dose of sanity arrived on Monday night. Netflix fell as much as 16 per cent after-hours after adding substantially fewer subscribers than forecast. The company blamed sinister-sounding “ungrandfathering” — where longer-standing customers are shifted from their cheaper legacy plans to the higher rates paid by new subscribers. Or rather, it blamed the media for highlighting the price rise. Suddenly, it seems, chatter caused churn: a batch of customers who had not bothered to look at their monthly outgoings for a while realised what they were paying and decided it was not worth it.The correction is welcome. Netflix always looked the shakiest of 2015’s surging internet stocks. The question now is whether it has gone far enough. In the US, which matters as it is where Netflix makes money, subscribers rose by a net 162,000 to 47m in the quarter compared with a forecast of 500,000. Non-US subscribers rose 1.5m, instead of an expected 2m, to 36m. The US growth rate is the worst in 18 quarters. It would be easy to assume that it means market saturation — it has already conquered about half the broadband households in the country. Netflix, though, points out that new customers are being added. But it is hardly encouraging that a little attention on the $10 or so a month that Netflix costs is enough for existing customers to cancel. Nor are the explanations mutually exclusive. Today it is price. Tomorrow, if Amazon or Hulu finally get their act together, it could be competition. Or it could be governments, frustrated that one service accounts for more than a third of internet traffic in North America. The mix of risks is enough to make Netflix’s reduced enterprise value of about $37bn seem high — it is more than five times last year’s sales. A target of 60m-90m US subscribers was reiterated on Monday, along with a pledge to produce the first “material” profits in 2017. That first goal looks shakier than ever. It is time to start worrying about the second.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
382;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix’s slowing subscriber growth: 2 charts;;Netflix shares fell as much as 15 per cent in extended trading on Monday and these two charts explain why.First, the California-based company, which has made a big bet on growth overseas, said international subscriber growth slowed sharply in the second quarter from the first as the company launched in 130 new markets in January. It also issued outlook for the current quarter that was shy of analysts’ estimates.Second, growth in the domestic market, which accounts for 60 per cent of Netflix’s overall revenues, slowed sharply in the second quarter.The company has slowly been rolling out higher prices for existing members and said that this plan to “un-grandfather longer tenured members” led to more cancellations than it had expected. Moreover, the company expects the Olympics to impact subscriber growth in the current quarter.
383;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-07-18T20:23:36Z;Netflix shares tumble on downbeat subscriber outlook;;Francis Underwood would not be pleased with Netflix’s latest results.The streaming site behind hit original shows like Narcos and House of Cards said it expects subscriber growth to slow in the current quarter reflecting, in part, an impact from the Olympics that was on par with what the company experienced four years ago. The news sent shares in the California-based company more than 14 per cent lower to $84.00 in extended trading.Netflix said that it expects to add 2m overseas subscribers in the third quarter, below Wall Street’s estimates for 2.54m. The domestic subscriber growth outlook of 300,000 was also shy of analysts’ estimates for 695,000, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.That came alongside news that Netflix added fewer customers than it had expected in the second quarter.The company said it added 1.52m international subscribers and just 160,000 US subscribers in the second quarter. That was below its previous projections for 2m overseas subscribers and 500,000 domestic subscribers and was sharply slower than first quarter figures that were boosted as Netflix said in January that it had launched in 130 new markets.The company reported profits of $41m or 9 cents a share, compared with $26m or 6 cents a share in the year ago period. That was shy of analysts expectations for 3 cents a share.Sales rose nearly 33 per cent to $1.97bn just shy of analysts’ expectations for $2.1bn.Netflix said its results were impacted modestly as the company moves longer tenured members to higher prices as it moves to its three-tier pricing model. The company said:Gross additions were on target, but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly, coincident with the press coverage in early April of our plan to un­grandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter.We think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually un­grandfathered is modest and conforms to our expectations.The online streaming site’s popularity has contributed to cord cutting, in which subscribers cut the cord on their cable subscriptions as they increasingly watch shows online.The company continues to invest overseas as it seeks to grow market share but said that the regulatory climate in China has become more challenging after Disney’s streaming service, which was launched in conjunction with ecommerce juggernaut Alibaba, and Apple’s movie streaming services were shut down.Netflix shares were down 13 per cent so far this year as of Monday’s close.
384;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-07-18T15:27:28Z;From rock stars to roadies, all change for Wall St champions;Fund managers head to the next big Fang — utilities and telecoms stocks;Times are changing for make-or-break investments. The big outperforming sectors of 2016 look very different from the stars of 2015.Then, owning a small group of stocks known as the Fangs — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — determined more or less whether a manager outperformed the market.This year’s variety is a wider, but less glamorous group: utilities and telecoms stocks.“The Fang names are all very well known consumer brands, but who can name the top three utilities in the S&P 500?” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. “We’ve gone from following rock stars to hanging out with the roadies.”While Amazon and Facebook are higher this year, investors have flocked to shares that offer the reliable attributes of dividends and stability versus explosive growth. Telecoms services and utilities, both up about 20 per cent this year, are the top performers in the index. With US government bond yields falling to record lows and a growing universe of other government bonds trading with negative yields — the chief reason is income.The utilities sector has a dividend yield of 3.24 per cent, while for telecoms it is 4.26 per cent. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury sits at 1.55 per cent.“You have a lot of portfolio managers saying, ‘I have outperformed for years not owning a utility’,” says Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors. “Now I am underperforming for not owning them.”Investors are also hiding out in areas perceived as safe against a backdrop of political and economic uncertainty in Europe in the wake of the Brexit vote. But owning this cog of the market is not without risk, especially after such a strong rally.“The biggest threat to telecom and utilities stocks is a stronger [US] economy,” says Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. “The reason is two fold. Number one — the stronger economy leads to higher interest rates. A stronger economy will then lead to a pick-up in risk appetite and people will want juicier stocks.”Indeed, as the S&P 500 rose to new heights last week, utilities underperformed. The sector lost more than 1 per cent. That is not significant enough to call it a full-scale rotation but it is a sign of how there is a tipping point when this leg of the longstanding bull run in equities, if it continues, becomes about growth rather than safety.On the flipside, if economic growth falters it could pressure dividend payments, though companies are typically reluctant to change policy unless the situation is dire.With the gains, utilities, for instance, look expensive on both an absolute and relative sense, says Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for the BlackRock Global Allocation fund.The S&P 500 utility sector currently trades for around 19.5 trailing earnings, roughly a 30 per cent premium to its long-term average, he says. What is more, since 1995 utility companies have typically traded at roughly a 20 per cent discount to the broader market, but now are trading in line with it.“The re-pricing of the sector is arguably being driven by two, interrelated trends: a preference for low-beta, less volatile stocks and a thirst for income,” Mr Koesterich says. “As long as we remain in an environment characterised by ultra-low interest rates, investors may be more willing to pay a premium for companies that can deliver a relatively secure income stream.”Earnings season for the second quarter is under way, providing insight into the growth picture. Expectations are for a 5.5 per cent decline in earnings year over year, which would be the fifth consecutive quarter of profit contraction and the worst run since the period around the financial crisis.While overall estimates for earnings are unchanged since the end of the quarter, according to FactSet, the 66 per cent of companies beating their forecasts so far is below the five-year average.But the high-profile financial sector has had some notable beats, helping that sector to curb its year-to-date losses.More crucial still is whether Wall Street expectations for a return to profits in the second half remain intact. An improving outlook for growth would prompt a rotation to more cyclically sensitive groups and out of the so-called bond proxies that have high yields, investors say.On the flipside, if that growth proves elusive and rates stay low, the boring, dividend-paying parts of the market could still draw investor interest.“Financial repression is driving this,” Mr Dwane adds. “We have low growth, low inflation and low interest rates — it makes sense to go into dividend stocks. In times of a dull economy and dull earnings growth the dividend becomes the dominant factor of returns.”
385;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Univision sues Charter over post-merger fees;;Univision, the dominant Spanish-language television network, is suing Charter Communications, alleging that the second-largest US cable operator has “refused to negotiate” new contract terms after its merger with Time Warner Cable.In a lawsuit filed in New York’s Supreme Court, Univision accused Charter of breaching its television carriage contract and using its acquisition of Time Warner Cable to impose license fees for Univision’s channels that are “dramatically below” market rates, reports Anna Nicolaou in New York.Univision’s licensing contract with Charter expired on June 30, and the cable company has tried to impose Time Warner Cable’s contracts rather than negotiate a fresh deal, Univision claimed, based on a “preposterous theory” that Time Warner was managing the cable systems after the merger.“But everyone knows that is not true,” Univision said in a statement. “Charter pitched this deal to regulators, its subscribers, and the public, as one where its management team would take control of the combined company, and that is exactly what happened. Quite simply, Charter promised one thing publicly in order to secure approval for its acquisition and is now privately claiming the exact opposite to Univision.”The filing comes as the newly formed Charter looks to leverage its scale in programming contracts. The carriage fees cable companies pay for television channels have risen in recent years, which operators have argued forces higher monthly cable prices for customers. Cable operators have embraced consolidation to better face off against programmers over rising content costs, and address the growing threat of so-called cord-cutters – consumers who turn to online video services such as Netflix.Charter said in a statement: “We have a long-term contract with Univision and we expect them to honor it.”
386;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-07-08T16:27:04Z;Netflix: laying cable;A deal with Comcast helps, a little;The mic drop came six months ago: Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings announced the video-on-demand service was going live, immediately, in 130 new countries.Empire builders can be undone by the war at home. In the US, Netflix has a goal of 60-90m subscribers, up from 47m today. At the current growth rate it would hit 60m in 2020. That looks optimistic. There are only about 100m broadband-equipped households to play for and growth has been slowing, from 20 per cent year on year in 2014 to 13 per cent last quarter. At that rate of deceleration, US subscribers would plateau at about 54m.Still, a few million people here, a few million there and soon you’re talking real money. Jefferies models an additional $1bn in profit in 2020 if Netflix managed to hit 70m subscribers. That is important: in the past 12 months Netflix made just $320m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. That little slice of profit must support an enterprise value of more than $40bn.US subscribers are profitable — Netflix’s new foreign customers are not — so it must push harder into the remaining US living rooms. Good news, then, that Netflix this week agreed a distribution deal with Comcast that will make Netflix available through its set-top boxes. Details are scant, but similar efforts including with Virgin Media in the UK have involved Netflix sacrificing some subscription revenue.In any case, the deal won’t get Netflix very far towards its target. Comcast has 23m video customers, but only a third have the required type of set-top box, and many of them are Netflix subscribers already. The deal may be defensive, though, making it easier for customers to watch Netflix rather than switch to rivals such as Amazon. Even with the deal it is hard to see Netflix achieving total US saturation — and thus pulling in the cash required for its overseas campaigns.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

All of the yardstick’s 10 industry sectors were higher on the week.On Friday consumer stocks led the pack. Netflix, the video streaming service, gained 5.7 per cent to $96.67, Amazon rose 1.4 per cent to $725.68 and Best Buy climbed 2.5 per cent to $31.36.The automotive sector also gained after carmakers reported a solid month of sales. Ford Motor added 1.2 per cent to $12.72 and General Motors rose 2.1 per cent to $28.89. BorgWarner, a car parts supplier, increased 2.6 per cent to $30.29, while AutoNation, a chain of dealerships, was up 1.8 per cent to $47.83.Harley-Davidson, the US motorcycle company, surged 19.8 per cent to $54.25 on an unconfirmed takeover rumour reported by The Fly, a financial website.Air transports also lifted off, with American Airlines up 3.6 per cent to $29.33, United Continental 0.8 per cent higher at $41.37 and Alaska Air Group up 0.8 per cent to $58.74. Cruise ship operator Carnival rose 1.5 per cent to $44.86.Industrial stocks found support in a robust reading from the Institute for Supply Management’s index of US manufacturing activity. Parker-Hannifin, an equipment supplier to mobile and aerospace industries, increased 1.2 per cent to $109.34.Materials stocks also climbed. Investors boosted Alcoa after the aluminium producer this week reiterated plans to break into a commodity business and a company producing specialised metal products, driving the shares up 3 per cent to $9.55. Albemarle, a chemicals company, rose 2.5 per cent to $81.32, while Mosaic, a potash fertiliser producer, gained 1.5 per cent to $26.57.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent for the day to 2,102.9, nearing its all-time high of 2,134.72 reached in May 2015. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to 17,949.4, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 4,862.6.The higher index levels reflected the sharp turnround in sentiment among US equity investors after markets were shaken by the UK’s Brexit vote the previous week.Oil and natural gas producers were supported as hot summer weather forecasts suggested stronger air-conditioning demand, which feeds back to power plants that burn gas. Among the gainers in the sector were Chesapeake Energy, up 7.2 per cent to $4.59, and Southwestern Energy, up 3.4 per cent to $13.01.Healthcare stocks added to the market’s strength, helped by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, up 0.4 per cent to $349.23, and Celgene, up 2.1 per cent to $100.70.On the losing side of the ledger, chipmaker Micron Technology dropped 9.2 per cent to $12.50 after reporting poor sales and cuts to its payroll.
388;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-06-30T17:26:26Z;TV networks hope for 10% ratings boost from new counting method;Nielsen metric that includes digital services expected to help advertising rates;Television networks may soon gain higher ratings for their TV shows, and a potential boost to their depressed advertising revenues, thanks to a new system of counting viewers that includes digital services.Under a long-awaited metric devised by Nielsen — the 93-year-old company whose ratings underpin most of the $78bn-a-year US TV ad market — audience levels could rise by about 10 per cent, or up to 50 per cent for the most popular shows, according to a study.After years of falling ratings, media owners and advertisers have been critical of Nielsen for not adapting quickly enough to changing viewer habits. With more people watching programmes on demand online, rather than tuning in to broadcasts at a set time, cable channels have seen their viewing figures drop — causing executives from groups such as Viacom and NBCUniversal to claim Nielsen’s ratings were “useless”. But Nielsen has now said its “total audience” measure will better capture viewing no matter the screen or source — from online video sites such as Netflix and YouTube, to broadcast and cable channels. In addition, it will count viewers over 35 days, rather than the current standard of three or seven days, to capture those who watch shows weeks after they air live.Nielsen has released this total audience data to TV networks — to allow them to review it internally — and will roll out the new measure to ad buyers by the start of the autumn TV season.Its stated aim is to evolve the key TV ratings metric, known as “C3” — which can often make or break a network’s new shows — in time for next year’s so-called “upfronts”: the meetings at which network owners try to sell their ad inventory ahead of the new season.Megan Clarken, president of product leadership at Nielsen, said the company is currently “deep in discussions” with the TV industry about agreeing a new ratings standard.There may be some players that will hesitate. If my audience goes up 5 per cent, but yours goes up one per cent, I’m happy and you’re not so sureUsing its total audience measure — which adds up all the people watching a show on streaming sites, mobile phones, tablets, computers, DVRs and conventional TV sets — one broadcast drama gained a 23 per cent uplift in viewers. On average, the increase in viewership across all shows has been 10 per cent.However, after past delays in the rollout of new ratings systems, some in the industry are sceptical that total audience will be adopted quickly. Two-thirds of investors and executives polled by Bernstein Research said they do not expect a new advertising “currency” to be used at next year’s upfronts. Executives even suggested the new metric may be pushed back by some of Nielsen’s own clients. “There may be some players that will hesitate,” said one television executive. “If my audience goes up 5 per cent, but yours goes up one per cent, I’m happy and you’re not so sure.”Nielsen has also shared viewership numbers for some shows on streaming sites for the first time. Companies such as Netflix and Hulu normally keep these numbers under wraps. But on Wednesday Nielsen revealed that Orange is the New Black, a Netflix original programme, drew 6.7m viewers for its season 4 premiere — putting it on a par with the second-highest rated cable drama. News of the streaming viewership numbers comes as traditional programmers worry that Netflix — and others — is chipping away at their audiences. Netflix accounted for about half of the 3 per cent drop in US television viewing last year, according to a study by Moffett Nathanson, a research company. Overall, Nielsen calculates that 26 of the top 35 cable channels attracted lower average primetime audiences in 2015 than in the year before. While ratings have recovered somewhat in the first quarter of this year, driven by bigger audiences for news networks such as CNN during the US election campaign — analysts have mostly dismissed this as a temporary boost.Over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 media index has lost 6.6 per cent, underperforming the broader market, as low ratings and concerns about “cord-cutting” hit US media shares.
389;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-06-29T23:06:40Z;The office is dead! Long live the office!;Technology is banishing old, static ways of working in favour of agile innovations;At Automattic, the company behind blog-creating tool WordPress, there are 470 employees distributed across 45 countries, and work practices have evolved to suit the business. Staff work where they want, communicating via blogs and Slack, the chat tool, rather than email. They travel to team or company meetings three to four weeks a year. Like Netflix and a growing list of other companies, Automattic has an open vacation policy with no set number of days.Such a set-up is not for those who crave structure, and a corporate document for employees at Automattic admits that recruits may feel they encounter “chaos” working remotely with colleagues around the globe. But employee benefits include sabbaticals and allowances for home offices, mixing desirable aspects of workplace and home-based practices.Agile, or smart, working policies are far from being the preserve of young tech companies though. “The ability for people to work in different ways through technology has encouraged some employers to think more creatively about the way we employ people . . . and that maybe work doesn’t naturally occur in 35-40 hour weeks,” says Clare Kelliher, professor of work and organisation at the UK’s Cranfield University School of Management.Telus, the Canadian telecoms provider, is a big company that moved early, with striking results. The idea for its “Work Styles” initiative came from younger employees a decade ago as a way to offer people flexibility, save on office space and reduce carbon emissions, says Sandy McIntosh, executive vice-president of people and culture.Seventy per cent of its 27,000 employees in Canada are now “mobile” — working from home, office and other locations — or fully home-based.“It’s a tremendous cultural change,” she says, pointing to the challenge of persuading older leaders to accept results-based management. “We started to accelerate when all the senior leaders truly embraced the concept of why this was good for employees, for the environment and for cost reduction.”Employee engagement scores have jumped from 54 to 87 per cent in the past six years, says Ms McIntosh. Telus saves more than $40m a year in real estate costs, and commuting has been cut by nearly 33m km, reducing carbon emissions by 8,000 tonnes a year.Some may scoff at the 35-hour week Prof Kelliher mentions as a distant dream, but employers and governments acknowledge that something has to be done. To tackle digital overload in today’s always-on work culture, the French government is introducing a “right to disconnect” from laptops and phones outside work hours. The measure calls on enterprises of more than 50 people to consult workers on technology use to ensure that holidays, rest and personal time are respected.Productivity rises when people can pick the time and place best suited to the task in handThe French move, which follows action by large German companies to curb out-of-hours emails, highlights the tricky question of how to balance the benefits and drawbacks of the technology-enabled work revolution.The pace of change presents employers, policymakers and individuals with opportunities but also challenges. Alongside concern about work intensification, there is fear that the rise of robots could soon leave many people idle. Ageing societies require new ways to sustain longer working lives. Yet the “gig economy”, with its temporary, piecemeal work, offers neither security nor career development.In a call to action, the World Economic Forum says many big businesses have been slow to act decisively to address the challenges ahead. Only 53 per cent of the human resources directors it surveyed at leading global employers were reasonably or highly confident about the adequacy of their future workforce strategy.The property savings derived from freeing people from offices are a big reason companies, even in traditional sectors such as the law, are taking tentative steps towards agile working. But early adopters report a range of wider benefits, most notably that productivity rises when people can pick the time and place best suited to the task in hand.A nine-month experiment by Stanford University with Chinese call-centre workers found that those who worked from home completed 13.5 per cent more calls than their office colleagues and quit at half the rate. The results “blew me away”, Professor Nicholas Bloom told the Harvard Business Review.Enthusiasm for the work revolution varies around the world. The UK is close to the point at which working away from the office becomes more common than working solely at a desk, 9am-5pm, says Lancaster University’s Work Foundation. Its research indicates that more than 70 per cent of organisations will have mobile working practices by 2020. But its authors say there is still much to do to ensure “employees are working smarter, rather than longer”.In the US, 20 to 30 per cent of the labour force works at home more than once a month, says consultancy Global Workplace Analytics. But demand for choice of time and location is much higher, at more than 80 per cent, says Kate Lister, president: “Two to three days a week seems to be the sweet spot that allows for a balance of concentrative work at home and collaborative work at the office.”As some governments and companies intervene to stem the digital deluge, individuals are finding novel ways to regain control. Tinna Nielsen, a social entrepreneur and WEF Young Global Leader, decided six months ago to focus on developing her business, answering emails only on Fridays.“The impact on my work is just magic,” she says. “I feel like I work less because I am much more efficient. I have more fun and do more development work and feel more creative. I have more time to meet with people, and I spend more time with my children and my husband. It feels right for me.”
390;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-06-20T11:32:21Z;Pay transparency is the last taboo in business;The fear of telling all on salaries infects both start-ups and multinationals;"When Netflix was drawing up the famous slide-deck that frames and explains its corporate culture, its call for “candour and directness” stopped at pay. Patty McCord, the video-streaming company’s chief talent officer from 1998 to 2012, says her senior colleagues opposed her suggestion to open up pay data to all because it would cause “too much disruption, too much emotion”.Ms McCord found a way to subvert that decision in the early days: she created a file marked “Top Secret” and waited for engineers to hack into it. She says that what had seemed a big deal turned out to be largely uncontroversial once people were able to look at the spreadsheet.Transparency has since become one benchmark for how progressive a company is. Thanks to social media and the sharing habits of younger workers, chief executives now write internal communications knowing they will be distributed beyond the company almost instantly. That rule applies especially to memos marked confidential, as Yahoo discovered in 2013 with its no-work-from-home missive to staff.Pay openness is one of the last taboos. At a private breakfast discussion on culture and transparency that I chaired last week for Founders Forum, the digital, media and technology community, I asked for a show of hands. How many of the entrepreneurs and executives present were completely transparent about pay within their organisations? Two or three out of more than 100. How many were partially open? Just eight or nine more. The rest stuck with the approach that has prevailed since the first company was formed: the boss, and perhaps the boss’s lieutenants, know who is paid what and so does the human resources team. Everyone else is in the dark. According to one breakfast guest, even those who claimed they were open about pay were probably exaggerating.This fear of telling all on earnings infects both start-ups and multinationals. At the youngest companies, pay is highly sensitive because — as one young entrepreneur running a team of 35 told me later — “we’re making it up as we go along”. Revealing pay levels too soon might cement an error that she would prefer to correct quietly later. Another chief executive of a fledgling company, employing just seven people, told me it was “important to be open” — virtually a mantra among start-ups — but she added that when it comes to pay, “it’s delicate”.She’s right. At the biggest companies, chief executives see pay as a Pandora’s box that, once open, will release chaotic forces. Among them, the extraordinary amounts some companies will offer to keep their stars (think of the brouhaha over requirements to make the BBC list its top-paid presenters); the gap in compensation between men and women, and the risk — obvious among listed company chief executives — that once pay is public, it will start a race to the top as staff demand salaries in line with the best-paid in the company.Bosses blinded by their bonus obsession
They might be amazed to discover how much could be achieved with a fair salaryCorporate culture: Lofty aspirations
It may not be possible to change the behaviour of scandal-hit sectorsIndefensible secrets on women’s payEmployers have been told to come cleanWell, too bad. There may be a case for keeping some details under wraps, and exploring halfway options (such as publishing median pay for particular roles). But the real fear of those with keys to the pay padlock is that unlocking it will expose hypocrisy, trigger explanations of context, lay bare inequities and force change.The salary strongbox is not so secure even now. Are we really saying that the HR team are trusted to know what many line managers and most staff cannot know?Research suggests pay secrecy may actually impede performance, while openness and explanation, according to one US survey, curbs the grass-is-greener impulse to quit.Transparency has the power to change the way companies work. Of course, openness has its downsides, too. As another Founders Forum participant — a CEO turned venture capitalist — said, the scrutiny to which public companies submit deters many fast-growing companies from listing.Pay remains the issue that most excites that scrutiny, whether it be restaurant tipping policy or executive bonus plans.“It’s data like any other and we should be able to justify it,” says Ms McCord. When the why, the how and often the who of compensation are clear or easily guessed, it is hard to claim that revealing the “how much” is a step too far.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghillA truth we humans are not equipped to handle / From Andrew J Oswald"
391;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-06-17T06:00:14Z;How do MBAs fit into this brave new media world?;;What is happening to the entertainment industry? It is a question people ask me again and again. It is one I recently reflected on during an interview with Chicago Booth’s alumni magazine. After four years working as a film producer, and now almost six months at a venture fund focusing on media and content companies, it is clear audiences are driving decisions in programming and content distribution like never before – and much of this results from the audience data that entertainment companies can now collect.This data influences everything: from the content a company like Netflix will purchase, to the type of platforms Apple and Amazon will use to distribute their content.MBAs need to look at new “tech entertainment” companies such as Spotify and SoundCloud, as well as the content divisions of places like Apple, Google and AmazonMy time at Booth, especially now as co-chair of the school’s Media, Entertainment and Sports Group, has prompted another question: how do MBAs fit into this brave new media world? For most MBAs, a sustainable and satisfying career in entertainment means thinking about how the media landscape is changing, and what trends and companies are likely to play out in the future. With this in mind, MBAs need to look at new “tech entertainment” companies such as Spotify and SoundCloud, as well as the content divisions of places like Apple, Google and Amazon. The number of startups operating and entering this space is endless.The reason I encourage this approach is the following: Booth has taught me that students here are uniquely prepared to tackle business challenges that rely on big data, analytics and an entrepreneurial mindset. Why? Because the decisions that many entertainment companies are making regarding their content programming, partnerships, new products and marketing strategies are driven by data on their users. Of course this is not absolute, and some of the best content decisions are not generated by historical data and forecasting, but many aspects of these businesses are. In this sense, it is easier for MBAs to break into careers at media companies that have embraced tech innovation than it will be for MBAs to enter companies that recruit based on industry experience and networks – the entertainment world is very much entrenched in relationship-based recruiting.Entertainment start-ups, especially, need the business acumen and analytical mindset that MBAs have. Some MBAs looking for entertainment jobs have told me that they would not consider working for start-ups because of the pay. I always remind them that entertainment jobs typically have significantly lower salaries than their consulting/finance counterparts anyway, and at least at a start-up there is the potential for high growth and equity that most people will not find at a larger, established company. The investments funneling into companies such as Vice, and the acquisitions of small digital companies by behemoths like Axel Springer, prove this.The entertainment industry is extremely hard to break into, but if you love that space, it is worth the time and effort pursuing itGrowing up, my dad told my sister and I that there is always a path to victory, and it is something I tell myself whenever I embark on a seemingly impossible task. The entertainment industry is extremely hard to break into, but if you love that space, it is worth the time and effort pursuing it. What will make the path to a successful entertainment career easier for MBAs? It is to think about what skills and abilities make an MBA unique and how those factor into where the industry is today and where it is going to be five years from now.

Vodafone will own 51 per cent of the combined group, which is expected to have total revenues of NZ$2.9bn excluding integration costs of the deal.“This merger brings together Sky’s leading sports and entertainment content with our extensive mobile and fixed networks,” said Russell Stanners, Vodafone NZ chief executive, on Thursday.Mr Stanners will become chief executive of the merged group, which expects to deliver synergies with a net present value of around NZ$850m, or NZ$1.07 per share, through cost savings, lower capital expenditure and new revenue opportunities by bundling products.However, UBS noted “significant” implementation risks and limited details on key elements of the synergies or their timing.“The fact that Sky is considering such a merger potentially highlights the challenges to growing earnings, before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation as a standalone business,” UBS said.Sky is the biggest provider of pay-TV services in New Zealand, with 830,000 subscribers — about half the country’s households. Vodafone is the biggest mobile phone operator with 2.35m customers and the second-largest fixed-line company, with 500,000 connections.Both companies face increasing competition from internet streaming services such as Netflix and Spark New Zealand’s Lightbox.In an investor presentation published on Thursday, the two companies forecast that revenue at Sky would fall to NZ$920m in 2017, down from NZ$927m a year earlier, with Vodafone revenues inching up to NZ$2.02bn from NZ$1.99bn over the same period.Under the terms of the merger, Sky will acquire all shares in Vodafone NZ and then issue new shares to UK-based Vodafone at NZ$5.40 each — a 21 per cent premium to Sky’s last closing price. Sky will also pay Vodafone NZ $1.25bn in cash, which it will fund via new debt.Shares in Sky rallied 17.5 per cent to NZ$5.25 on Thursday.Vodafone UK will hold 51 per cent of the combined company, which Sky said will have an enterprise value of NZ$3.4bn.Peter Macourt, Sky chairman, said the merger was transformational for the company and would enable shareholders to participate in the substantial synergy benefits it expects from the deal.

You should too.”T-Mobile has quickly gained market share from Verizon and AT&T, the two largest wireless networks in the US, since positioning itself in 2013 as the “uncarrier” by ditching monthly contracts and offering discounts and special offers to lure customers from its rivals. It now has more than 60m subscribers, compared to 140m for Verizon and 130m for AT&T.The primary account holders of postpaid accounts, which comprise about 10m of T-Mobile’s customers, will be eligible to redeem one share each through Loyal3, an online brokerage. Loyal3 will buy the shares on the open market on behalf of T-Mobile before distributing them to customers, said Mike Sievert, chief operating officer. T-Mobile registered 1m of these shares in a regulatory filing on Monday, but Mr Sievert said the number of shares claimed could be “a lot higher”.The third-largest US wireless network also said it would each week offer customers gifts, such as pizza and movie tickets, via its mobile app through partnerships with brands including Lyft, Domino’s and StubHub. “All the other carriers, they want to screw you. We just want to take you to a dinner and movie,” said Mr Legere.Shares in T-Mobile US closed 1.3 per cent lower at $43.07 on Monday, having climbed 10 per cent this year on strong earnings. In the first quarter, it signed up 877,000 postpaid customers, who are viewed as more lucrative than those with prepaid accounts, and boosted its full-year guidance for new postpaid customer additions to between 3.2m and 3.6m.The stock offer, branded #StockUp, is the company’s latest effort to distinguish itself from Verizon and Sprint, which charge higher prices for phone service but have better quality networks, through customer-friendly marketing campaigns.Last year T-Mobile US said it would allow customers to stream video from services such as Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go — by far the biggest use of a subscriber’s data allowance — without eating into their data plan. It also offers free texting and messaging on flights across applications such as WhatsApp and Viber.

395;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-06-06T12:52:08Z;Netflix to make first original series in India;Streaming company to adapt thriller ‘Sacred Games’ as it looks to deepen roots in market;Netflix is diving into Mumbai’s criminal underworld with its first Indian drama series, as it seeks original local-language content to bolster its push beyond the US.The online streaming company said on Monday that it would produce a screen version of Sacred Games, a detective thriller by Indian novelist Vikram Chandra. The adaptation will be made in partnership with Phantom Films, a local production company.Original content has been a big factor behind Netflix’s success in the US, notably the critically acclaimed political drama House of Cards. Over the past year it has begun rolling out self-produced non-English language series, including an adaptation of a Japanese novel, and French political drama Marseille starring Gérard Depardieu.The push beyond English is in line with Netflix’s rapid evolution from a US-focused entertainment provider to a global one. In the first quarter of this year, the company said non-US residents accounted for 4.5m of its 6.7m new subscribers, and 42 per cent of its 81.5m subscribers at the end of that period.However, this represented only a marginal increase from the 4m foreign subscribers that Netflix added in the previous quarter. This was despite the company announcing in January that it was extending services to more than 130 countries, leaving only China and nations such as North Korea and Syria outside its network.Netflix has faced criticism that its service in many of those new countries was available only in English, and there were complaints in India that much foreign content was unavailable because of copyright restrictions.It also faces fierce local competition in India from a streaming service run by Rupert Murdoch’s Star, as well as Hungama, a local company that claims 64m users, of whom 16m pay for video and audio content.Siddhartha Roy, Hungama’s chief executive, said in February that his platform had an edge over rivals such as Netflix because it used micropayments instead of monthly subscriptions — the US group charges about $7.50. Hungama also does not require cards for payment, an edge in a country with per capita income of $1,617, where only a fraction of the population makes payments by card.“In India . . . international consumption contributes just 5 per cent of consumption,” Mr Roy added. “So if you want to build real services for India, you’ve got to have content for India.”US technology companies have been making a concerted push into India, as the country has overtaken the US to become the world’s second-biggest home for internet users behind China, according to a report last week from Mary Meeker at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.Google has provided free WiFi access in 100 Indian train stations, and has developed apps adapted to India’s slow connections, enabling users to download data for later offline use.Facebook’s high profile Free Basics initiative was intended to make the social network and a few other websites available for free to low-income Indians. But it was struck down in February by the country’s telecoms regulator, which said it would breach principles of “net neutrality”.
396;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-05-31T21:30:36Z;ConAgra climbs on Jana nominees update;Mixed day for US stocks as volume weak after long weekend;ConAgra gained ground on Tuesday after the foodmaker amended an agreement with activist investor Jana Partners over two of its nominees for the board.Shares in the Nebraska-based company climbed as much as 2.2 per cent to $46.30 after the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its board would nominate Bradley Alford and Timothy McLevish for election at its annual meeting. The shares later gave back some of their gains, closing 0.9 per cent higher at $45.70.Notably, the amended agreement provides Jana, the fourth-largest shareholder, the ability to designate two individuals to the board of Lamb Weston — ConAgra’s potato business, which it agreed to spin off late last year — as long as 80 per cent of Lamb Weston shares are given to ConAgra’s shareholders.“Given the clear investor view that Lamb Weston could ultimately represent a strategic asset, we believe investors will take heart in knowing that Jana’s ongoing board representation at Lamb Weston could help catalyse value creation for that entity post-separation,” said Andrew Lazar, an analyst at Barclays.“In other words, we believe shareholders may now feel they will also have a safeguard of sorts on the Lamb Weston asset,” he added.ConAgra shares also gained a boost from an article in Barron’s that said the company’s shares could rise as much as 30 per cent as it sells its businesses and works to boost profitability. ConAgra shares have advanced 8.4 per cent so far this year.The rise in ConAgra shares came alongside a mixed day on Wall Street as volume remained weak following the long weekend.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent to 2,096.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined 0.5 per cent to 17,787.1, while the Nasdaq Composite made some headway, rising 0.3 per cent to 4,948.Elsewhere, shares in SodaStream rose 6.2 per cent to $20.73 after the fizzy drink maker launched its homemade beer system.Deere shares climbed on Tuesday after UBS issued a bullish note on the maker of farming equipment.UBS analyst Steven Fisher upgraded his rating on the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, saying that Deere’s shares could climb to $94 over the next year, given the potential rise in the price of corn, a key agricultural commodity.“Deere still trades with corn, in our view, and we see increasing likelihood of higher corn prices ahead,” Mr Fisher said, noting that the investment bank believes corn prices may climb to $5 a bushel this year from about $4.07 on Tuesday.Mr Fisher said the rise “puts a floor” in sales of agricultural equipment next year, and will drive sales growth in 2018 “if the prices are sustained throughout 2017”.That would come as good news for Deere, which said this month that it expected industry sales for agricultural equipment in the US and Canada to slide 15 per cent to 20 per cent in 2016 from the prior year, “reflecting the impact of low commodity prices and stagnant farm incomes”.Deere shares climbed 2.2 per cent on Tuesday to $82.29, bringing its year-to-date gain to 7.9 per cent.Allergan shares were also in the black after Carl Icahn, a billionaire activist investor, said he had “acquired a large position” in the Botox maker.Allergan’s shares rose as much as 2.7 per cent to $242.35, but fell later in the day, closing 0.1 per cent lower at $235.75. The shares are down 25 per cent for 2016.Meanwhile, shares of Amazon climbed to an all-time high on Tuesday, rising 1.5 per cent to $722.79.The gains buoyed the group’s market cap to $341bn, lifting it marginally above Facebook’s valuation. The so-called Fang stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — have rebounded after a disappointing start to the year, although both Google-owner Alphabet and Netflix remain negative for the year.

The EU wants Netflix to be more of a Euroflix. The Buffett investment protégés behind his new tech bets. All this and more in #techFT , a daily newsletter on technology, media and telecoms. You can sign up here.Google has laid out its most comprehensive vision yet (FT free-to-read) for a post-smartphone era, as it unveiled a range of new software and services partly aimed at catching up with rivals such as Facebook and Amazon. At its annual Google I/O developer conference, the world’s biggest internet company showed off a new voice-activated device for the home, while also outlining plans for its Daydream virtual reality headsets, as well as wearable devices that no longer rely on being constantly tethered to smartphones. Google also used the event to extend and revamp some of its main services for smartphones, including launching a new messaging app, in the latest bid to defend its core search business as mobile habits change.Many of the technologies on display at the event will not be available to users for months or even years, though Google promised that several companies would sell VR hardware based on its technology before the end of 2016.Here’s a summary, taken from our live blog, of what was announced at CEO Sundar Pichai’s opening keynote:Google Assistant: Trying to make voice-activated search more conversational and personal, based on context, data and advances in natural language processing.Google Home: The voice assistant will work in a vase-shaped device that you can ask questions, get to play music and entertainment and soon manage tasks like calling an Uber.Google messaging: A new app called Allo that includes Snapchat-like features such as drawing and emojis and an end-to-end encryption function like WhatsApp and iMessage. Google Assistant will work in Allo. It also suggests responses to your friends’ messages. Another new app called Duo with video-calling that apparently works on 2G.AndroidN: The latest Android operating system includes new graphics capabilities aimed at games developers and security updates. But it doesn’t have a name yet – Google would like the internet to help pick a dessert-related name beginning with N.Virtual reality: Cardboard’s successor will be called Daydream and several Daydream-ready phones will be on sale later this year. It will have a headset and a controller, that looks like a streamlined remote control, and you will be able to use Google products from Street View to YouTube on it.Androidwear 2.0: The update to Android watches breaks the tie with the smartphone, so you can go running with a watch and not bring your phone. Some extra messaging, fitness and music features.Instant apps: Google makes apps more like the web by enabling you to use them without downloading them. The apps are split into modules so only the relevant parts load.Artificial Intelligence in the cloud: Sundar finished by talking about Google’s TensorFlow and the new cloud platform it launched a couple of months ago. He used examples of DeepMind’s AlphaGo computer and a project to help recognise diabetes-related vision loss to show the power of machine learning.Euroflix Netflix and Amazon’s video streaming services could be forced to devote “at least” 20 per cent of their catalogues to European films and TV shows as part of an overhaul of the EU’s broadcasting rules.

The expanded firepower enabled one of the pair to make the distinctly un-Buffettlike investment in Apple, and has helped Berkshire widen its investment activities into industries, including technology, where Mr Buffett is uncomfortable.

It’s a small speaker you plug into the wall with always-listening, far-field microphones that can hear you from across the room. It’ll answer your questions, play your music, and control some of your home automation gadgets. It’s not portable, but the benefit of always being plugged in is that Google can make a more powerful speaker. Google Home is designed with multiple rooms and speakers in mind and uses the basic Cast standard. Sonos, which pioneered wireless sound around the home, should be concerned.

Traditional broadcasters invest more heavily than their online peers, according to an EU study. In general, broadcasters such as the BBC invest roughly 20 per cent of their turnover in new productions. For streaming services, this figure drops to barely 1 per cent, the EU found.Companies such as Netflix have started work on more original European content with mixed success: its recent blockbuster series Marseille, starring Gérard Depardieu as the mayor of the French port, has been panned by critics.Netflix has warned Brussels that rules requiring a minimum of European content would distort the market and create a “perverse incentive” for operators to buy cheap titles.“Rigid numerical quotas risk suffocating the market for on-demand audiovisual media services,” Netflix wrote in its response to the commission. “An obligation to carry content to meet a numerical quota may cause new players to struggle to achieve a sustainable business model.”1%Amount of turnover invested by streaming companies in new content, agains 20% for traditional broadcastersLikewise, rules on prominence of European content would interfere with the “personalised” approach to providing on-demand video services, according to the video streaming company. “The focus of European audiovisual media policy should be on incentivising the production of European content and not imposing quotas on broadcasters or other . . . providers who would struggle to meet the supply,” Netflix wrote in a submission.None of the new streaming requirements would apply to “small and micro enterprises”, according to the draft seen by the FT.The new proposal could also force websites such as YouTube to introduce stronger age barriers for young viewers. While TV channels across Europe tend to have “watersheds” to keep adult content from younger viewers, these rules do not apply to video-on-demand services.Rigid numerical quotas risk suffocating the market for on-demand servicesThe proposals will be announced as part of a wide range of measures aimed at creating a single, pan-EU market for digital services. As part of the plans, the commission will introduce rules banning so-called “geoblocking” — the tactic whereby companies treat consumers using the same service differently depending on their country of origin.Netflix declined to comment on Wednesday. Amazon could not be reached.This article has been amended to reflect the fact that the original directive mandated that national broadcasters had to devote a majority of their transmission time to European content, not 20 per cent.
399;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Amazon takes on YouTube in video streaming with new service;Technology group to allow users to upload and make money from videos distributed on the site;Amazon has moved into YouTube’s territory by expanding its streaming service to allow users to upload and distribute their own videos.The launch of Amazon Video Direct will give aspiring filmmakers and companies that produce video an opportunity to generate money from their content, either by making it available to rent or buy, or to watch for free supported by commercials.The move puts Amazon into direct competition with YouTube, the Google-owned site which is the world’s largest video service, and comes amid a big expansion of its video streaming efforts.The company has ramped up its production of original films and television series after scoring with critically acclaimed hits such as Transparent and launching a standalone video subscription service.It also differentiates Amazon from Netflix, the streaming service which is its main competitor.Amazon and Netflix are locked in a battle to capture television audiences that are moving away from so-called linear television, or tuning in at a preset time, in favour of digitally streamed, on-demand viewing.Both have invested vast sums to produce and license original content. Amazon spent an estimated $3bn last year on movies, while Netflix is on course to spend $6bn in 2016, building on demand for series such as Making a Murderer, Narcos and Daredevil.YouTube, meanwhile, said last week that more 18-49 year olds watched its videos in the US on mobile devices than any broadcast or cable television network. “We reach more 18-49 year olds during primetime than the top 10 TV shows,” said Susan Wojcicki, YouTube’s chief executive.The new Amazon service is aimed at independent video producers and companies that might want to monetise their work or ensure it reaches a broader audience. It has struck deals with a range of video producers, including publishers such as the The Guardian and Condé Nast Entertainment, as well as digital sites including StyleHaul and Mashable.Peter Goldwyn, president of Samuel Goldwyn Films, said that the service would help create “unique distribution strategies that reflect the changing ways in which our audiences discover our films”.Netflix has a considerable head-start on Amazon in video, having begun an international push four years ago.In January, Netflix turned on its service simultaneously in 130 countries, a move which helped add 6.74m new subscribers in the first quarter, of which 4.6m came from outside the US. The international push helped lift its total subscriber number above 81m.Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said recently that the company would hit 100m subscribers in 2017.

But Alibaba is stuck outside the blue-chip new economy club that includes Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. This despite a business model (e-commerce intermediary) that would fit in with, but not reproduce, that of the other members.Alibaba’s sales growth (39 per cent in the quarter reported on Thursday) is behind only Facebook’s. But its shares have trailed the big four badly since it floated. Its price/earnings ratio, at under 20, looks like Google’s. Yet it grows twice as fast.That Alibaba’s share structure cedes control to Jack Ma does not distinguish it from Facebook or Google. But it piles a scary, holding-company layer on top.

The deal, for an undisclosed sum, will allow video creators who use Vimeo to charge a regular fee for their channels, rather than just sell or rent out individual videos to its 280m viewers.Vimeo, the video division of New York-listed IAC, is known for focusing on more artistic and serious filmmakers than the creators who have built millions of followers of YouTube, a much larger video platform. VHX’s customers include larger media companies such as Comedy Central and Vice.Kerry Trainor, Vimeo chief executive, said it had acquired the start-up at the start of what he called the “second phase of online video”, where people realise it is worth paying for premium ad-free video.“Video has been really dominated in the first 10 years by the advertising world,” he said.Now as people watch less television and “cut the cord” on cable subscriptions in favour of online streaming services, many are willing to pay for entertainment accessed via internet platforms.“People will customise and spend their entertainment dollars on things they are really passionate about, rather things that will go unwatched,” he said.Fans of niche sports such as snowboarding or horseracing, for example, might pay extra for content they cannot watch on regular TV, or expatriates might pay for cricket channels alone.Late last year, YouTube launched YouTube Red, a subscription service, that allows viewers to pay $9.99 a month to watch videos on the Google-owned platform without the ads, plus some extra original content.Mr Trainor said: “It is interesting to see YouTube experiment with the Red product. At the end of the day, YouTube is a free experience and people want it to be free.”In the long run, he believes the deal to buy VHX sets Vimeo up to be a more specialist version of streaming services from Amazon or Netflix.He took aim at Netflix, saying it has shrunk its catalogue. “It is all major ‘Originals’ and series, all the niche product Netflix grew up on has been pushed out of the service.”Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.
402;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
403;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-29T16:20:18Z;Owning US tech shares no longer a quick route to big returns;While Facebook and Amazon have performed, too many other big tech names had disappointing results;Owning US tech shares has long been a quick route to big returns for investors. Not this year.The S&P 500 technology sector has fallen about 4 per cent this week alone. As energy and telecom services lead the way with double digit gains for 2016, tech loiters in the basement, down 3.8 per cent since the start of the year and in danger of losing further momentum.For the broad market, the woes facing the tech sector matter, given its status as the largest sector of the S&P 500, representing a fifth of the benchmark. Heading into the current earnings season, the market was sitting near last May’s record peak, looking for the sector to help shift momentum into a higher gear.“We are going to want tech to participate in any rally,” says Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments. “In order to say the market is back in a bullish phase we need to see tech participate.”While the likes of Facebook and Amazon have delivered, too many other big tech names have disappointed investors with their latest quarterly results. Earnings for the tech sector overall are expected to contract 7.7 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to FactSet.Accounting for 5 percentage points of that drop is Apple, which has the largest single weighting in the S&P 500 and disappointed investors with its first quarterly drop in revenue in more than a decade. The first quarter marks the first time Apple has been the worst drag on the technology sector’s profits since 2013, according to Factset.Shares of Apple have fallen around 12 per cent since Monday at a time when fellow tech companies Twitter, Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet have also missed Wall Street’s expectations for their earnings in the latest quarter.In turn, tech has lost momentum. Last year, for example, owning the so-called FANGs — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — turned out to be a swing factor in performance for portfolios.After being among the top five performing sectors in the index in the last four years, investors’ attention of late has been drawn to other areas that are outperforming. Energy is among the top performers in the S&P 500 year to date, up 11 per cent.“It feels like there is a lot of money rotating out of tech, primarily into energy and some financials,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. “There is always a slice of the market that moves into whatever is working today and there is no doubt that energy is working today.”Another factor is the size of some tech companies. That makes outsized growth harder to come by.“I wouldn’t say the tech rally is over,” says Skip Aylesworth, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds. “What you have are some companies that have gotten so big that the year-over-year numbers don’t compare well. They have also become more mature — there is not the innovation to drive the growth.”He puts Apple, Microsoft, IBM and, to a certain extent, Google, in that category.This week, Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on IBM to negative, a move that often precedes a downgrade, with the US tech group having struggled with 16 consecutive quarters of sales declines.Still, there are outliers. Facebook, for example, bucked the negative trend. It beat earnings and revenue expectations, after recording a 52 per cent surge in first-quarter sales. Facebook shares jumped 7 per cent after the news and are up more than 11 per cent this year.Amazon, too, surprised to the upside, reporting its most profitable quarter to date. The stock rallied sharply on the news.Still, Mr Aylesworth sees innovation resting on the smaller companies, with cyber security, for example, as an area where companies can hit on new products and produce rapidly growing sales.Investors face an uncertain macro environment, too. Concerns about China, geopolitical issues and negative interest rates all point to a less-than-stellar global economy and in turn less expendable income for consumers to buy the latest gadgets.“For growth investors who need exposure to tech, there is a search under way to find the names that can still grow through the rest of the year,” Mr Colas says. “We’re playing scrabble to see what new word will replace FANG.”

405;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-28T00:21:00Z;Facebook: Gentleman’s C;The most common form of shareholder franchise is still available at the social network;In a highly circulated opinion column earlier this week, a prominent pundit floated Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg as the head of a reform political movement to be known as the Innovation party. The piece was naturally mocked for a variety of reasons. Alas, the idea of President Zuckerberg could be problematic for no other reason than that man is not fond of democracy. As the social network reported another spectacular quarter (first-quarter revenue soared 52 per cent and even with a billion people on the site, Facebook user growth, somehow, accelerated) the company announced plans to cement its chief’s control.Since its initial public offering, Facebook has maintained a superclass of stock that allows Mr Zuckerberg to maintain control of the company even as more shares were issued to employees, or to pay for acquisitions. Through his Class B shares, which have 10 times the vote of Class A, he currently controls 60 per cent of the vote. However, as he sells or transfers shares over time because of his philanthropy, and new shares are issued, his iron grip would no longer be guaranteed.The solution: the creation of non-voting Class C shares that will be given to existing holders of Class A and B (2 C shares for each A or B share currently owned). Google also executed such a stunt so that its founders could keep control. Some shareholders sued the search company and an eventual settlement allowed them to be compensated if the new class of shares traded at a discount to the voting classes. Today, Google Class C shares trade at a 2 per cent discount.Facebook’s board emphasised that it went to great lengths to negotiate a fair deal with Mr Zuckerberg, noting it hired its own investment bank and law firm and that talks went on for months. The key concession it seemed to wring out is that his super-voting shares, upon his death or departure, would no longer have the current voting advantage (Mr Zuckerberg is able to maintain the super-shares should he temporarily leave to serve in public office).His vision has proved wildly lucrative to all Facebook shareholders and looks even more glorious as rivals Google, Apple and Netflix have recently slipped. The once curious acquisitions of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus are now poised to pay off even as the core Facebook social network is not slowing down. It is reasonable to believe that Facebook is the best-managed company in the world. But if that view ever changes, that grievance can still be expressed in the classic form: by dumping shares.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
406;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-24T15:11:43Z;Tech stocks: fangs for nothing;The outsized premium enjoyed by a handful of internet stocks is rightly narrowing;"Silicon Valley has had a few rain showers recently, but the California drought endures. The market for new equity offerings is in sympathy: since the financial crisis, there has never been a drier spell of activity — not surprising when the few companies to risk an initial public offering have generally seen their shares trade poorly. Yet during 2016 a handful of big technology stocks have hit their highest multiples in years. The rationale is a “winner-takes-all” thesis that last year propelled shares in Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google/Alphabet (the “Fangs”). Add in Microsoft, whose claim to join younger peers comes from its fast-growing cloud business: last week it reached an enterprise value of 13 times earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation — the highest since 2008. The valuation gap has finally started to close, though not because the stragglers are catching up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 2 per cent this year compared with a 2 per cent gain in the broader S&P 500. SecureWorks, a rare tech IPO, priced below its indicative range on Thursday night; on Friday it fell further.Instead, it is a capitulation from the high-flying handful. Facebook, whose shares are up 5.6 per cent this year, is the last Fang standing. All the others have fallen in 2016, with sharp post-earnings declines on Friday for Microsoft, down 7.2 per cent, and Alphabet, down 5.4 per cent. Netflix, last year’s best-performing stock in the S&P 500, has dropped 16 per cent in 2016. In February, Alphabet overtook Apple to become the most valuable public company; now it is valued at $75bn less.The current earnings season has brought harsh punishment for those that miss racy expectations. Netflix fell sharply when its overseas subscriber growth disappointed. Revenues at Microsoft and Alphabet were also light. There is still a deserved premium for high growth tech stocks; but investors cannot rely on market dominance from a few rainmakers.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
407;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-22T11:13:02Z;Europe should forget Google and investigate its own shortcomings;It should ask why its biggest names are worth a fraction of those in the US, writes Michael Moritz;Imagine if, over the next 60 days, the European Commission staged a series of press conferences and bombarded journalists with a battery of announcements of pocket-sized investigations into the condition of the continent’s technology industry.One investigation might delve into the rate at which PhDs are granted to students of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects at Europe’s 20 leading universities. This might contain an appendix showing the percentage of Nobel Prizes given to people born and resident in Europe over the past 100 years.Another inquiry might examine the state of science education in high schools across the EU and how this compares to countries such as China, Singapore, Israel, India and the US. An appendix of this report might summarise the number of European high school students and college graduates that have elected to study in, or emigrate to, the US.Other lawyers and social scientists on the vast EU payroll might be dispatched to the patent filing libraries to see how the rate of European invention in critical fields has kept track with what has occurred in China and the US since 1990. Then, assuming there are still lawyers available — not an insurmountable challenge in Brussels — another taxpayer-financed squadron could be sent to examine why the rate of formation of technology companies in Europe trails that in other countries.Instead, the commission has chosen to launch a new investigation into one of its bête-noires — Google. This new witch-hunt, seeking to uncover skulduggery and anti-competitive practices in the way that Google has licensed its Android operating system, is in addition to a separate Commission probe into the company’s search business. Add to this the EU probes into the privacy policies and tax payments of US technology companies, and the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix and Qualcomm — six of the greatest businesses built over the past 30 years — must be thinking that, within Europe, no success goes unpunished.This same sentiment seems to be spreading to European boardrooms. Recently, the founders of Spotify, the Stockholm-based music-streaming service that has been engaged in a tooth-and-nail fight with some of the largest US technology companies, did the unthinkable. They voiced a distinctly American viewpoint by castigating Swedish politicians for the conditions they have to battle in their homeland. These included the acute housing shortage in Stockholm, the manner in which gains from stock options are taxed and the shortcomings of technical education — particularly for girls and young women. Little wonder that they threatened to move much of their company — lock, stock and smoked herring — to more hospitable climes.The commission might find some solace in an odd place — its own investigation of Microsoft which started in 2000 and extended for more than a decade. The accusations against Microsoft were every bit as pointed as the charges now levelled at Google. Yet consider what’s happened since. The EU filed its charges against the leader of the personal computer industry before Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat or Skype were even formed and at a time that Google was barely a year old. However, the inventiveness of these companies that had a much greater effect on Microsoft’s apparent ironclad lock on the technology industry than any set of mandarins infusing legal charges with a political marinade.The commission should examine one other fact. Over the past five years the eight most valuable technology companies developed in Europe have assembled a combined market value of around $32bn. That’s not a figure to be sneezed at any more than the admirable young European technology entrepreneurs who, despite all odds, are more inclined to take a risk than members of their parents’ generation. But EU legislators should be wondering why Europe’s eight most valuable companies are only worth about 10 per cent of Facebook or 6 per cent of Google.There’s nothing new about this strain of anti-Americanism running rampant in Brussels. Some of its intellectual roots stretch back 50 years to Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, the French publisher and journalist, who tried to galvanise Europeans into countering the threat from across the Atlantic with the publication, in 1967, of The American Challenge. Its echoes can be heard in this week’s press conferences in Brussels. Forget the fact that American ingenuity and daring has brought to hundreds of millions of Europeans phones cheaper and more powerful than the supercomputers of the 1970s, thousands of films and TV shows that can be streamed at the touch of a button, free text-messaging services, books that are delivered overnight and thousands of comfortable cars that can be summoned at a moment’s notice.Rather than pointing across the Atlantic and seeking scapegoats, the Commissioners who have just launched another fusillade against one of their favourite American bogeymen may want to start a series of investigations into Europe’s own shortcomings. This may be a more fruitful exercise than reigniting the spent flames of the 1960s.The writer is chairman of Sequoia Capital. Views expressed are his own.

408;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-19T17:51:09Z;Amazon and Netflix lock horns in streaming battle;Ecommerce group fires shot across the bow of rival with standalone video offer in the US;The battle for the living room is hotting up. This week Amazon fired a shot across the bow of Netflix when it launched its Prime digital video package as a standalone subscription in the US, untethering it from its express delivery service in a bid to attract more customers.A day later, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said his company was on course to hit 100m subscribers “sometime” next year.The two companies are duking it out to capture television audiences that are moving away from so-called linear television — or tuning in at a preset time — in favour of digitally streamed, on-demand viewing. Both have invested vast sums to produce and license original content. Amazon spent an estimated $3bn last year on movies and shows such as Transparent while Netflix is on course to spend $6bn in 2016, building on demand for series such as Making a Murderer, Narcos and Daredevil.The question is whether they can each prosper in an increasingly competitive environment in which new digital subscription services are launching on a near weekly basis — and where established broadcasters have large, built-in audiences. In Europe, for example, “cord-cutting” is not as prevalent as in the US and players such as Sky, which has 21.5m customers across the UK, Ireland, Austria, Italy and Germany, has a customer base already well-served with on-demand content.Mr Hastings hinted that digital players can thrive in a more competitive environment. When asked about Amazon’s standalone subscription on the company’s first-quarter earnings call, he said it was evidence that “growth in the internet TV market” was “displacing linear TV”. The increased competition was “all part of the natural evolution from linear TV to internet TV”, he added.Netflix has a considerable head-start on its rival having begun its international video push four years ago. But its path to hoped-for global success is littered with potential stumbling blocks.In January it turned its service on simultaneously in 130 countries, a move which helped add 6.74m new subscribers in the first quarter, of which 4.6m came from outside the US. The international push helped lift its total subscriber number above 81m.However, Netflix expects to add fewer subscribers in the second quarter than it did in the same period a year ago, when it launched its service in Australia and New Zealand. It is forecasting 2m new international subscribers for the second quarter, compared with 2.37m a year ago.This admission spooked investors and sparked a 10 per cent fall in Netflix shares on Monday in after-market trading. “International subscriber guidance was considerably lower than the most bearish forecasts,” wrote Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson, in a research note.Yet despite occasional periods of potentially slower growth, Netflix is still expected to grow: Enders Analysis said it would double its subscriber base to 150m by 2020.Netflix has sacrificed earnings growth for investments in original content, generating a paltry $27.7m in net income in the first quarter on revenues of close to $2bn.Investors have been willing to accept such a low margin as Netflix has pursued international growth. At some point, however, it will have to make its investments pay.“Netflix has to move quickly along its tightrope to stay ahead of the growing chasing pack of other online subscription video on demand services,” Enders analysts Toby Syfret and Alex Fenton wrote in a recent note. “The question is whether it can get to the end and reach the promised land without falling on the way.”In the US, NBC, Showtime, Starz and HBO are among the channels to have launched standalone video subscription services that are available without a cable or satellite television subscription. They are all in the market for original content, which has increased the pressure on Netflix but has been a boon for Hollywood studios and other producers.HBO has signed deals with the likes of former talk-show host Jon Stewart and Vice Media to produce programming for its HBO Now digital service. On Tuesday it revealed that it had invested in Otoy, a digital graphics company, to develop “holographic content” for Mr Stewart.Matthew Garrahan and Shannon Bond discuss Amazon’s ambitions in the film and television industryAmazon, meanwhile, outbid Netflix and other broadcasters to pay an eye-watering $250m to sign the three presenters of Top Gear to a new series and has a enlisted Woody Allen to write a comedy series.Netflix will this year premiere The Crown, a series about the life of Queen Elizabeth II, outbidding UK broadcasters for the rights. This year also marks the start of its deal to air first-run Walt Disney movies in the US, making it the home of new release films after they have been screened in cinemas and released on DVD, such as the new adaptation of The Jungle Book and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War, as well as older titles.These investments should ensure Netflix keeps adding subscribers. But Amazon and the rest of the chasing pack are snapping at its heels.In Amazon’s most mature markets, Prime has become its secret weapon, writes Leslie Hook in San Francisco. Prime members in the US, who pay $99 annually for the service, spend nearly twice as much on Amazon a year as non-Prime members.The services included in Prime include unlimited video and music, as well as expedited shipping and online photo storage. Estimates from different analysts put Prime membership at between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of US households.By introducing a new monthly pricing option, Amazon is trying to expand the appeal of Prime to a new group: lower-income customers who might otherwise balk at the annual fee. For the first time, customers can buy a month of Prime membership for $10.99. (This follows a test launched last month, in which customers of the telecoms network Sprint could elect to have a monthly Prime subscription added to their phone bill.)“Amazon Prime is likely somewhat saturated for above-income households in the US,” said Ben Schachter, analyst at Macquarie, in a recent client note. He expects that the company “will continue to experiment with ways to attract more lower-than-average-income households over the next few years”.This demographic is a key customer base for Amazon’s rival Walmart, whose bricks-and-mortar stores have been struggling to grow in the US. Walmart started testing its own Prime-like shipping subscription last year, but the service has not been rolled out nationally.
409;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;China’s ‘Bants’ set to rival America’s ‘Fang’ tech stocks;Fund managers quadruple holdings of Chinese internet quartet;Incisive Chinese companies have long been sinking their teeth into their western rivals. Now the country has developed its answer to the “Fangs” phenomenon, one of the remaining crown jewels of the west.The internet-focused quartet of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now renamed Alphabet, awkwardly) saw their share prices surge more than 70 per cent, on average, last year, even as the wider US stock market fell.Now China is responding with its very own quartet of Bants — Baidu, Alibaba, Netease and Tencent.Since 2013, emerging market equity funds have quadrupled their exposure to China’s new Gang of Four to more than 4 per cent, equivalent to $11bn, according to data from Copley Fund Research, which tracks 121 EM equity funds with combined assets of $235bn.Tencent has led the way, with its weighting in the average EM fund rising fourfold to more than 2 per cent since 2011, but Alibaba has shown explosive growth of late, as the first chart shows.“You can draw parallels to the Fang stocks in the US being, as they are, a mixture of internet search, social networks and ecommerce companies. These four stocks are starting to dominate things in the internet space in emerging markets,” says Steven Holden, founder of Copley.Gary Greenberg, head of emerging markets at Hermes Investment Management, who has a weighting of 10.8 per cent to the Bants in his Global EM fund, adds: “We think there is growth here that can continue, cash flow generation that is remarkable relative to Chinese old economy industries, along with some real innovation and disruption.“Their underlying economy is growing, especially the consumer service sector, disclosure is steadily improving and scepticism among the international community is high [preventing valuations from rising too far],” Mr Greenberg says.The rise of the Bants has helped drive a dramatic reshaping of EM equity portfolios since 2012. Allocations to technology stocks in general have risen sharply, hitting a record 20.6 per cent in March, according to Copley, while holdings of energy and materials stocks have slumped in line with plunging commodity prices, as the second chart shows.Within the internet subsector, which constitutes 6 per cent of the typical EM fund, however, the Chinese heavyweights appear to be elbowing aside their competition.Chinese companies now account for 83 per cent of EM equity funds’ internet holdings, with Russia and South Korea accounting for a further 10 per cent between them.However, the latter are on the slide, with the rise of Bants largely supplanting ownership of more established internet names such as Naver, South Korea’s biggest internet portal operator, and Mail.ru, the internet group controlled by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, Mr Holden says. (For those who get hot under the collar about South Korea being classed as an emerging market, equity investors are largely guided by the MSCI EM index, which includes the likes of South Korea and Taiwan.)“What is becoming clear is the emergence of a ‘big four’ [which] are starting to dominate the sector,” says Mr Holden, with 79 per cent of EM funds holding at least one of the Bants.Funds managed by Oppenheimer, William Blair, Calamos, Columbia and Delaware as well as Hermes, each have an exposure of at least 8 per cent to the Bants, while Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford leads the way with weightings of 13.3 per cent and 12.8 per cent respectively in its EM Leading Companies and EM Growth funds respectively.Richard Sneller, head of emerging market equities at Baillie Gifford, told EM Squared this year that “in many emerging markets the speed with which young consumers are adapting to technological change, in areas such as ecommerce and online shopping, is much faster than in the US.“Trends that we hoped would emerge 15-20 years ago have come to generate significant cash flows.”The surge in demand for the Bants was in part a response to MSCI’s decision to include some companies listed outside the emerging markets in its flagship EM index.The move, the first stage of which came into effect in November 2015, brought New York-listed Baidu, Netease and Alibaba into the index for the first time, a move that appears to have particularly boosted the latter.“Alibaba has captured the largest number of new investors over the last six months. A net 15 per cent of funds opened new positions including TT International, Schroders and Lazard among others,” says Mr Holden, who calculates that the funds in his database have invested a net $840m in Alibaba in the past half year.Mutual funds’ holdings of the Bants could rise to higher levels still, with the index weighting of Alibaba, Baidu and Netease due to rise further in May, when MSCI implements the second and final stage of its plan to fully incorporate such stocks in its EM index.Mr Greenberg argues that valuations “are not unreasonable” with Tencent trading on 25 times one-year forward earnings, Alibaba at 23 times and Baidu 21 times [he does not hold Netease] “given that their earnings are expected to grow by 25-30 per cent per annum”.“These are good businesses at reasonable prices, especially since smartphone usage is increasing and penetration for commerce, advertising and services online is also growing rapidly, providing opportunities for monetisation of the user base,” he adds.Mr Holden sees other reasons to expect their weighting to rise still further. More than 20 per cent of funds still do not have any exposure to any of these four stocks, with some high-profile managers, such as Aberdeen and First State, eschewing Chinese internet stocks entirely, Mr Holden says.Moreover, the funds in his database are still, in aggregate, underweight both Tencent and Alibaba compared with their index weighting.“In the face of impressive price action in Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba from the lows of early February, EM funds may find it more difficult to avoid these stocks going forwards,” he says.Follow us on Twitter @em_sqrd
410;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-19T15:04:10Z;Netflix plunges as subscribers tune out;;Netflix shares are falling like a house of cards on Tuesday.Shares in the video-streaming provider, best known for its original shows such as Orange is the New Black, plunged nearly 12 per cent to a one month low of $96.87 a share in early trading after it issued surprisingly weak subscriber growth guidance.The company said on Monday night that it expects to add 2m international subscribers in the current quarter. That figure was below analysts’ estimates for 3.45m and sharply slower than the 4.5m added in the first three months of the year.The disappointing guidance overshadowed what was otherwise a solid set of first quarter results.As analysts at FBR & Co. quipped:1Q16 is close to peak subscriber growth, and from here sub growth looks likely to decelerate, a situation that we see capping the near-term upside argument for the equity.Analysts at Mizuho reckon the slowdown in subscriber growth could continue well into the third and fourth quarter and have slashed their price targets and earnings estimates for the company in response.For 2016, we are lowering our revenue by 3% to $8.65b and our EPS goes from $0.32 to $0.29. For 2017, we are lowering our revenue by 2% to $10.86b, and our EPS goes from $1.16 to $1.12. Our target price is based on our sum-of-parts valuation, which we lower from $120 to $109.They added:Netflix continues to face challenges in new, non-English speaking markets like Japan, India, Russia, and others. In addition, we believe that competition is increasing, especially from Amazon, which will now offer its Prime Video as a standalone service. With the company burning close to $1bn in cash this year and next, we remain on the sidelines.
411;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix: Red peril;Growth in international subscriber numbers is slowing alarmingly;Netflix is “breaking through the cultural zeitgeist”, proclaimed the video-on-demand company in quarterly results on Monday. Its stock then broke below the more tangible $100 level, falling sharply after hours.Grand ambitions helped Netflix become the best-performing S&P 500 stock of 2015. In January, it produced a map of the world coloured almost entirely in its corporate red to publicise its expansion to 130 new countries. Investors could be forgiven for thinking this flag planting would mean an acceleration in international subscribers. No such luck. Although first-quarter results contained a 4.5m bump in non-US streaming customers to 34.5m, Netflix forecast just 2m more in the current quarter — more than 50 per cent below analysts’ forecasts. The excuse that a rollout to Australia a year earlier gave a tough comparison does not really cut it. In percentage terms, the increase would be the smallest ever.What investors cannot be forgiven for is propelling Netflix to this frothy valuation in the first place. Even chief executive Reed Hastings has expressed bemusement. After Monday night’s 8 per cent decline, the company still trades at an enterprise value of more than four times 2016 revenues. Other high-priced internet stocks can at least boast significant barriers to entry — think of Amazon’s physical infrastructure. Netflix, like the TV networks it seeks to displace, is on a hamster wheel of buying or producing more appealing content. Perhaps the next Adam Sandler film or new Gérard Depardieu series — both launching on Netflix in the coming weeks — will lure more subscribers but even their talents cannot bring lasting success.Amazon announced a new video-on-demand offer on Monday, disaggregating it from its Prime shopping membership programme. It offers some advantages over Netflix, including the ability to download content to watch offline. At home and on its travels, Netflix will encounter similarly stubborn competitors, unwilling to roll over.The battle is expensive. Netflix has raised prices in the US to help fund an additional $1bn spending on content, but is burning cash at $1bn a year and needs to tap debt markets. The company notes that its bonds trade better than their single B rating implies and suggests that “over time” the rating agencies “may catch up”. Then again, shareholders might catch up with the risk of the proposition. Those zeitgeists are fickle things.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
412;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Netflix sets sights on 100m subscribers;Shares fall after warning that aggressive expansion will slow;Netflix will hit 100m subscribers “some time next year”, according to chief executive Reed Hastings, after the digital home of Daredevil and Orange is the New Black reported its best ever quarter, aided by expansion into 130 new markets.However, the company’s shares fell almost 10 per cent in after-market trading after Mr Hastings warned in an investor letter that international growth would slow in the second quarter because of a “tough comparison” with the same period in 2015, when Netflix launched in Australia and New Zealand.By the end of the earnings call, Mr Hastings predicted that Netflix’s customer base would exceed 100m some time in 2017. “It’s going to be a big celebration,” he said.Netflix added 6.74m customers in the first quarter, with more than 4m coming from outside the US after its simultaneous January launch in 130 countries. New customers lifted its total subscriber number above 81m.David Wells, chief financial officer, suggested growth patterns had been erratic because of the company’s aggressive international push. “You haven’t seen a normalised pattern of growth from us because we’ve been layering on new markets as we go,” he said.Netflix still intends to launch in China, the only big global market where it is not available. It said it was “continuing discussions” with partners but had no “material update” on its approach or timing.It is facing increased competition from Amazon, which has launched its Prime video service as a monthly subscription— it was previously available only to customers who bought express shipping for delivery of their online shopping annually.When asked on the earnings call if he was concerned by Amazon’s move, Mr Hastings was non-committal, saying Netflix and its competitors were “working hard to build the best content”.“We’re seeing growth in the internet TV market and that’s displacing linear TV,” he added. The increased competition was “all part of the natural evolution from linear TV to internet TV”.Most big broadcasters and premium cable operators have launched standalone subscription services. Amazon and Hulu are Netflix’s biggest rivals but it also faces competition from HBO, which is part of Time Warner.Mr Hastings said he was surprised that HBO had not attracted more than 800,000 subscribers to HBO Now, its streaming service.Revenues rose from $1.57bn to $1.96bn, while net income rose from $23.4m to $27.7m, its low margins reflecting its investments in content production. Earnings per share were flat at $0.06.

But in the current quarter the company expects subscriber growth to slow.Tougher comparisons are part of the problem, but estimates for international subscriber growth also missed analysts’ estimates by a wide mark. And investors were not pleased.And expectations for domestic subscriber growth were not much rosier
414;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-18T20:36:39Z;Netflix slides amid weak subscriber growth outlook;;Overseas subscriber growth at Netflix is slowing.Netflix shares fell as much as 13 per cent in extended trading, after the company said on Monday that it expects to add 2m international subscribers in the current quarter. That figure was below analysts’ estimates for 3.45m and sharply slower than the 4.5m added in the first three months of the year.The online streaming company behind hit shows like The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Daredevil attributed expectations for fewer overseas additions “to a tough comparison against the Australia/New Zealand launch”.The company added:International net adds are down sequentially both due to standard seasonality and our launch in 130 countries at very beginning of Q1 (so Q1 captured the initial surge of sign­ups).The California-based company reported net income of $28m or 6 cents a share in the first quarter, compared with $24m or 5 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales rose nearly 30 per cent to $1.8bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 4 cents a share, on sales of $1.97bn, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.The company added 2.23m subscribers in the US last quarter which was up sequentially but slower than the 2.28m added in the prior year quarter.Netflix has invested heavily in original programming in a bid to woo subscribers to its streaming service. The online streaming site’s popularity has contributed to cord cutting, in which subscribers cut the cord on their cable subscriptions as they increasingly watch shows online.Netflix shares have advanced more than 122 per cent since the start of 2015.
415;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-18T13:13:42Z;Amazon standalone video streaming launch ramps up Netflix fight;Monthly subscription for Prime service highlights effort to become bigger video player;Amazon has launched its video streaming service as a standalone offering in the US, as it ramps up its battle with rivals including Netflix and Hulu.Previously, customers could only access the service by signing up to a $99 annual subscription to Amazon Prime, a bundle that included free shipping, music streaming and other perks. Now, US customers will be able to pay for Prime on a monthly basis for $10.99 a month or choose to subscribe to the video service on its own for $8.99 a month.The move highlights Amazon’s ambitions to become a bigger player in video and follows its investments and success in exclusive shows such as Transparent, Mozart in the Jungle and The Man in the High Castle. Last year, Amazon spent $1.7bn on original content compared to $3.3bn at Netflix, according to RBC Capital Markets.“Amazon is placing another stake in the sand, signalling that they’re going to build the next-generation TV provider,” said Richard Broughton, research director at Ampere Analysis, a data collection and forecasting specialist.In December, Amazon launched its “streaming partners programme”, which allowed customers to sign up for additional, third-party video platforms — including Showtime, Starz and Curiosity Stream — directly through their Prime membership.Mr Broughton said Amazon appeared to be building a broad distribution platform for pay-television, seeking to become “the next Comcast or Sky” for the internet age.The company’s closest competitor in video is Netflix, which will report its first-quarter earnings on Monday.Paolo Pescatore of CCS Insight, a research group, said that Amazon has some catching up to do in video. “Netflix has done a phenomenal job of launching in many new markets within a short period of time and, as a result, has a far greater reach and can benefit more from scale and of course early mover advantage,” he said.Amazon’s decision to offer video separately from Prime marks a shift in its strategy. In recent years, the company has focused on enhancing the appeal of the Prime bundle, in order to lock in customers to the company’s ecommerce site. Recent additions to the bundle include free two-hour grocery delivery from Wm Morrison, the UK’s fourth-largest supermarket chain, for Prime members based in London.But the decision to offer video on a standalone basis suggests that Amazon sees digital media services as a growth opportunity in their own right.The move also raises the possibility that the company will offer its music streaming service as a standalone product, which would increase competition for Spotify and Apple Music.Amazon does not disclose how many Prime members it has. But it has said that membership increased by 51 per cent last year, growing more quickly overseas than in the US. Analysts estimate that between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of US households have a Prime subscription.

But the meeting instead ended in disarray, with Saudi Arabia unexpectedly toughening its stance on Iran, which has sought to increase production after sanctions have been lifted on the Middle Eastern economy.“This meeting and its outcome should have built confidence that the oil market rebalancing was close at hand, as well as building a circle of trust among producers for possible future cooperation and coordinated action,” analysts at Barclays wrote in a note to clients. “In this regard, the meeting was a complete failure”.The collapse in the talks ricocheted across global financial markets. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, recently skidded almost 4 per cent to $38.76 a barrel. It has dropped by 8.1 per cent since April 12, Bloomberg data show. Russia’s rouble fell 1.8 per cent in choppy trading, while European equity markets started the week with modest losses.Traders were also paying close attention to corporate earnings. Shares of Morgan Stanley, a large US investment bank, climbed 2.3 per cent in morning trading after it posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits. Results from IBM and Netflix are due after the closing bell in New York.
417;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Disney-Netflix: a costly cure-all ;Acquisition would not be the potion that fixes all that ails the Magic Kingdom;"The ructions in Disney’s management ranks have drawn attention to its strategic challenges. It is tempting to prescribe one potion to fix all that ails the Magic Kingdom. After spurning the heir apparent to chief executive Bob Iger, the board must now look for an outside candidate. Whoever takes over will be confronted with the upheaval in Disney’s biggest division brought about by “cord cutters” abandoning the traditional cable TV bundle for a narrower selection of content delivered over the internet. As BTIG points out, there is a unified solution: Netflix. Acquiring the video-on-demand company would bring 75m subscribers, the perfect hedge against cord cutting and, in founder and chief executive Reed Hastings, an accomplished leader who has proven better at navigating the new media landscape than anyone else. So far, so attractive.In practice, it would further muddy a market for content that is already crowded with frenemies. And the price is a killer. With net debt of about $15bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $16bn, Disney has plenty of headroom for more leverage. Raising an additional $50bn looks plausible; Netflix’s enterprise value is $44bn. But the internet company (which barely makes a profit) was valued at $56bn as recently in December and the stellar rise of the stock over the past couple of years would presumably require a steep premium. Any realistic price looks heavily dilutive to Disney’s earnings.If Disney were in dire straits (as BTIG contends) then it might be worth blowing its entire debt capacity on Netflix and throwing substantial equity into the mix. But for all its quandaries — managerial and strategic — the company has plenty of breathing space. On the first front, Mr Iger is a respected CEO and, at 65, could stay beyond his scheduled 2018 retirement date. On the second, the doom-mongering is overdone. RBC analysts estimated on Friday that even with an acceleration of cord cutting, ESPN — Disney’s sports business, which is the focus of concern — would only lose 5 per cent of its subscribers annually, hitting overall earnings by the same magnitude. The new boss has mitigating actions available — selling ESPN directly to consumers, for example. Meanwhile, she will be able to benefit from previous daredevil acquisitions such as Marvel, which was bought for $4bn in 2009 and has shown it is a conveyor belt of profitable movies and merchandise. Hard to believe Netflix would prove the same bargain."
418;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-04-05T11:26:49Z;Twitter nabs deal to stream NFL games;;Something to tweet about.The National Football League has said that Twitter has won the rights to stream Thursday night games. Shares in the social media site climbed nearly 4 per cent to $17.73 in pre-market trading.The agreement follows several months of discussion with a number of potential digital platforms to show games online as the NFL looks to expand its reach beyond its traditional television stronghold.Earlier this year the league signed new deals with CBS and NBC to broadcast Thursday night games on TV, with each network paying $225m for five games. The games are also carried on the NFL Network, the league’s cable channel, writes Shannon Bond in New York.Live events and especially American football games are a bright spot in the US television industry, drawing huge audiences watching in real time even as overall ratings for TV programmes are in decline.But the NFL is taking steps to broaden its distribution as people spend more time watching online video, often on their mobile devices, and as more young consumers are bypassing pay-television packages entirely in favour of “over the top” streaming services from companies such as Netflix and Amazon.At the time the CBS and NBC agreements were announced, the NFL said it was discussing over-the-top streaming rights with several “prospective digital partners”. Facebook had said it was interested in the streaming rights but reportedly dropped out of the bidding last week.Last year, the NFL partnered with Yahoo for its first ever free livestream of a game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars, played in London.Meanwhile, Twitter has been looking to boost its live video content. It signed a deal last year with the football league to distribute short video clips of highlights and replays on the social network.Twitter shares have declined more than 52 per cent since the beginning of last year as user growth has stalled.The deal was first reported by Bloomberg.

It becomes a staple among people whose commitments to work and family make evenings out a fortnightly adventure. Members of my trade parse the show for allegorical meaning. Political columns liken serving ministers to this or that character. Playfully threatening to garrotte anyone who blurts out a spoiler becomes central to hilarious dinner-party badinage. When the final episode is broadcast, heartbreak is softened by anticipation of a new, yet more vaunted drama. Everyone toasts the golden age of television.I am not an old man but I have lived through 30 or 40 iterations of this cycle, starting with The West Wing and The Sopranos at the turn of the millennium. When you remember Six Feet Under’s time as the “best TV show ever”, the breathless acclaim presently engulfing the BBC’s The Night Manager is easy enough to see through. The HBO imperium, the British fightback, the rise of Netflix, the improbable boom in Scandinavian noir: television has been the cultural story of my adult years. Other people had The Beatles and Motown.It is not some bohemian distaste for television itself that has inoculated me against all this — kept me, even, from watching a full season of any drama. I own a TV the size of Canada, for which the rest of my flat is just a shell. This glowering matt-black thing blitzes my retinas with nothing more refined than live sport and old films. I do not pretend to be annotating Finnegans Wake in the time others devote to Borgen.The middle-brownness of television drama is not a crime but its pretension to something loftier should be. These shows are as technically deft as their lavish budgets demand. They are not this century’s Shakespeare plays or Russian novels. They go deep and narrow into a particular profession or slice of life; any themes of wider import are either in the eye of the over-interpreting beholder or conveyed too obviously to constitute a creative feat.When The Night Manager provokes ruminations on Britain’s place in the world, when Girls and Mad Men are studied for their gender politics, you can hear the sound of material being stretched beyond its tensile capacity. Modern television allows fatigued, educated professionals to feel they are improving themselves without having to work too hard.All that is asked of them is time. Aeons of it. The languorous pace of these dramas — “It gets going halfway through the third season” — does not testify to their seriousness, only their vanity and the power of new means of distribution, such as on-demand subscription channels, to emancipate producers from broadcast schedules. The result is what you would expect if the publishing industry did away with editors: dashes of genius and many Everests of waffle.Every drama merits the creepy spectacle of competitive binge-watching, in which adults boast of festering on their humid sofas through 15 episodes of whatever is modish that monthConcision must be a — though never the — criterion for good art. Revolver would not top best album surveys if the same quantity of good music were smeared across a patchy triple LP. Cinema and theatre are exercises in compression: internally coherent two-hour narratives that must find space for beauty and insight without skimping on the rudiments of exposition. Some great art sprawls, most notably War and Peace. Breaking Bad is not War and Peace.That is not a deadpan line, it is a plea for perspective amid the hysterical boosterism. In the golden age, every drama is the best drama ever. Every drama merits the creepy spectacle of competitive binge-watching, in which adults — people with jury service under their belts and clean credit histories to their name — boast of festering on their humid sofas through 15 episodes of whatever is modish that month.Concision is not everything. As long as aesthetic value remains unmeasurable, longevity is the proxy test. Who mourns Six Feet Under now? When did you last think about 24? What will Homeland mean to anyone in 10 years? For such vaunted works, they do not endure in our lives as novels, films and albums do. Even the comedy series of yesteryear, such as Seinfeld and Only Fools and Horses, remain reference points for millions. Only The Sopranos has avoided the trap of transience, which suggests the golden age of television — like that of pop in the 1960s, and of Hollywood in the 1970s — boils down to one or two exemplary works, with many more ciphers illuminated by the reflected glory.Not everything put out by these well-staffed studios is wonderful. Much of it is baggy and overwritten. Some — Doctor Who, Game of Thrones — will be remembered as children’s television when everybody calms down. And all of it is puffed up by people convinced they are living in the television equivalent of 15th century Florence, with geniuses beavering away behind every door.janan.ganesh@ft.comPublishing has done away with editors, and it shows / From Barbara Newman"

Next door Argentine footballer Sergio Aguero is doing tricks for a commercial. “The industry needed a big soundproof space, power and access to crew,” said Sue Woodward, the founder of the Space Project.The site has only been open a year but is already doubling in size as Ms Woodward plots an accompanying film studio next door that will be both taller and larger.Manchester city council is providing £15.5m for the expansion since Space has already supported 250 jobs and pumped an estimated £9m into the local economy. It is breaking even and will repay council loans, Ms Woodward pledged.TV and film makers are flocking to Britain partly because of government tax breaks.A report from Amion Consulting for Creative England and Manchester city council found that the industry was growing faster outside London than in the capital, which is still the largest base.Over the period 2010 to 2014, out-of-London production rose from 39 per cent to 48 per cent of the UK total by value and above 50 per cent by volume. Around half of that was in the north. There were around 26 studios offering 120,000 sq m of floor space, it said.The north has benefited from the strength of TV advertising, while new services such as Netflix are commissioning more drama. Houdini & Doyle is airing on ITV Encore, its subscription channel, and Fox in the US.New focus on ‘Northern Powerhouse’ potential: can redoubled efforts overcome entrenched weaknesses?Read moreThe BBC’s move to Salford in 2011 has increased its spending with local producers. Only 5 per cent of BBC productions by volume were made in the north in 2010: by 2014 it was 30.6 per cent.Some 82 TV dramas were made in the UK in 2015, spending £759m, a 20 per cent increase on the year before. Film producers spent £1.4bn.Ms Woodward’s first venture was the Sharp Project, a former consumer electricals warehouse. “The old solution was a leaking warehouse near the M25. But they are all being developed into office and flats,” she said. “We saw a gap in the market.”Fresh Meat, Mount Pleasant and other shows were filmed there but its four studios were overwhelmed. So Space was born, with 5,110 sq m of studio. Space also has props storage and a large car park — surprisingly rare in TV studios.Several suppliers, such as an equipment hire business, recruitment agency and a prop maker, are also on site.Based on the forecast levels of growth, Amion estimated that in 2032 the UK would require an additional 74,300 sq m of floor space. Pinewood Studios, where Bond films are made, is expanding in London and Wales because it is short of space.“Manchester offers significant financial, logistical and lifestyle benefits over London,” it said. It had “critical mass” with almost 600 companies but its industry is a third the size of the capital’s.Challenges remain. Staff in Manchester are ageing and journalism is too reliant on the BBC. If incentives are cut, foreign companies — they make up almost half the TV spending — could stay away, Amion said.For the moment the north is proving popular. The combination of cheap studio space and locations has seen ITV’S Beowulf filmed in Northumberland and County Durham and the BBC’s Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax in West Yorkshire.In March the British Film Commission gave six senior executives from US producers including HBO a tour of the north.Andrew Critchley, managing director of Red, the independent drama producer that makes Happy Valley, met them. He said: “The region is blessed to have some of the best writers, talent and crew, which allows Red to keep producing innovative programming year on year in the north. The . . . inward mission for US TV and film executives is a clear signal that the north is building its international appeal.”Three years after being set up to promote studio investments for making films and TV drama, Scotland’s Film Studio Delivery Group has yet to deliver, writes Mure Dickie.Scottish National party ministers agree that Scotland needs more studio and “buildspace” to promote domestic production and attract international projects.Scotland already has some dedicated facilities, but creating a national film studio has proved difficult.Local planners initially rejected a private sector proposal for a £140m complex just south of Edinburgh, with a final decision by the central government delayed until after Scottish parliamentary elections in May.The SNP government has been focusing instead on a public-private proposal to expand Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld, which was used for production of the first two series of the kilted Sony television drama Outlander.This month Fiona Hyslop, Scottish culture secretary, said Wardpark’s application for planning permission for the expansion marked an “important milestone” in Scottish screen sector promotion.The plans involve building two new 50ft-high sound stages with a total area of 30,000 square feet alongside the Wardpark’s existing 48,000 sq ft space across four sound stages.Willy Wands, chairman of the Association of Film and Television Practitioners Scotland and producer of films and TV series such as Whisky Galore and Rebus, has said the lack of a national studio is a “disgrace”.Between them, Wales and Northern Ireland had four big studios with 12 stages, the AFTPS complained in a submission to the Scottish parliament. “Scotland, a country that has a greater population and over double the land mass of Wales and Northern Ireland combined, has none,” it said.
421;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Politics: stranger than fiction;How can television shows compete with the sensationalism of real-life political drama?;"Last weekend, I did precisely what you’d expect of a millennial political junkie: I parked myself on the sofa and binge-watched the latest season of House of Cards. From 11am on Saturday until mid-afternoon the next day, I waded through 13 episodes of Netflix’s addictive political drama, which charts the fortunes of Machiavellian fictional president Francis J Underwood (played by Kevin Spacey) and his equally calculating and ambitious wife, Claire (Robin Wright).The previous three series of the show have seen Frank, introduced as a backroom operator in the US House of Representatives, gradually climb the greasy pole to the Oval Office. En route, he has sabotaged the lives and careers of his opponents, and even resorted to murder — twice. The plots may be outlandish but Frank still strikes a chord: he’s everyone’s idea of the ultimate politician, in the worst possible way.This fourth instalment of House of Cards has a special appeal: it is the programme’s first series to be released during a presidential campaign year, and one of its major plot points is Frank’s bid to be re-elected.While I was watching it, I had half an eye on the latest primary results filtering through from the ongoing presidential race, which has at times seemed more far-fetched than the wildest episodes of House of Cards.Just over a week ago we found Marco Rubio and Donald Trump engaged in a back-and-forth about the alleged smallness of Trump’s hands, and how that might relate to the size of his genitalia. Standards of taste and respect have been abandoned, and that’s even before you get to the absurd policies that have been proposed: from Ted Cruz’s suggestion of carpet-bombing Isis to Trump’s giant wall across the Mexican border — paid for, naturally, by the Mexican government. The traditional model of politics, in which the establishment would eventually close ranks against a populist outsider (think of Pat Buchanan or Ralph Nader in the 1990s), is broken.All this has presented a challenge for the programme’s makers: how do you write a political drama when real-life events are already cartoonishly outsized? This isn’t a new problem. The novelist Philip Roth identified it in a 1960 essay in which he argued that “the American writer in the middle of the 20th century has his hands full in trying to understand, describe and then make credible much of American reality”. The same challenge faces both political journalists and fiction writers today. As Roth put it, “the actuality is continually outdoing our talents, and the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist”.This season, the writers of House of Cards haven’t pursued a narrative that apes the actual 2016 race, and they’ve avoided the temptation to bring in a Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders-style insurgent. The show is actually at its weakest when it deals too literally with current affairs: the last series got bogged down in the details of Frank’s America Works employment policy and Claire’s attempts to negotiate with the comical Putin-esque Russian president (a storyline that gave rise to a jarring cameo from the protest band Pussy Riot).Where it works best is as a study of power, and what it takes to attain it. And in that respect, the show already has this year’s election race covered. The character of Frank Underwood is both Hillary and Trump: superficially, he’s a politician in the traditional mould, the careful cultivator of a statesmanlike image; but inside, as he reveals to us in fourth-wall-breaking soliloquies, he’s the ultimate pragmatist, an anti-idealist of the most ruthless sort. When Trump made his claim that “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters”, it’s hard not to think of Frank turning to address us in House of Cards.Meanwhile, many Republicans will have watched the show’s Governor Will Conway in wistful admiration, praying that the electoral gods might deliver them a candidate of his calibre before their party falls apart. He is a Republican JFK, complete with a picture-perfect family and moderate values that pose a serious challenge to Frank’s candidacy. He plays on a nostalgic idea we still have of what politicians could be; he may have no real-life equivalent in the current American scene, but he has the texture of reality.What the drama does, too, is enable us to see real life with a new perspective, and to put its absurdities into relief. When a photograph of Frank’s father alongside a KKK Klansman makes it into the public domain, we watch him do exactly what you might expect of a seasoned politician: he admits the undeniable truth and makes a very public apology. Contrast this with Trump’s response to his support from former KKK “grand wizard” David Duke— a belated and mealy mouthed disavowal — or his outright rejection of the allegation that his father was arrested at a 1927 Klan brawl.Played right, even the most obscure mechanisms of politics can take on a new life; we saw this in Borgen, which pulled off the surprising trick of engaging viewers in Danish coalition politics. And this season House of Cards has introduced many people to the concept of the brokered, or open, convention — something that occurs when no single candidate has the majority of delegates required to secure their party’s nomination, last seen in 1952.In the fictional Democratic race, Frank pushes for an open convention to add some drama to the election, while handily helping his preferred choice of running mate to nab the nomination. In the real-life Republican race, a brokered convention appears to be a real possibility. The GOP establishment is doing everything possible to ensure that Trump does not have the 1,237 delegates required to become their nominee, and a challenge at an open convention could be their last chance to stop him. John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, is predicting this situation, while Marco Rubio is preparing for it. More so than anything else in this season, these prescient scenes add to the notion that the series is interpreting the race, with the knowledge that what is seen in fiction may soon arrive on news channels.Of course, there is precedent for this in the original British series of House of Cards. The very first episode began with devious Tory whip Francis Urquhart holding up a picture of Margaret Thatcher and uttering the lines: “Nothing lasts forever. Even the longest and most glittering reign must come to an end some day.” The show aired on November 18 1990, just two days before the real-life Tory leadership contest that toppled Mrs Thatcher. The writers had tapped into the national mood of disillusionment and reimagined it in fiction with startling clarity.A series packed full of loathsome characters might not seem a natural way of helping people to engage with the real world of politics, but when it strikes the right balance between the realistic, the dramatic and the implausible, it does just that. House of Cards is not The West Wing, in which Aaron Sorkin imagined a world of hopeful idealists snappily solving America’s problems as they marched through the corridors of the White House. That programme is still name-checked by a generation of Democrats seduced by its heroic conception of politics. But House of Cards offers something different: a man with an unshakeable hold on the levers of power, able to extricate himself from the tightest of corners. Like Wall Street’s Gordon Gekko, or The Wolf of Wall Street’s Jordan Belfort, both of whom unexpectedly inspired scores of would-be traders, Frank’s sleazy glamour may in some perverse way make politics seem more accessible.The 2016 presidential race will surely continue to provide as much entertainment as any fictional series, while the EU referendum in Britain will offer its own variety of plot twists and bizarre characters. They also happen to be the most consequential and thought-provoking debates for decades.There has never been a better time to engage with actual politics. Once you’ve finished binge-watching House of Cards, of course.Sebastian Payne is the FT’s digital comment editorIn the mid-1970s compulsive television-watchers were described as “couch potatoes”, who would sit in front of the small screen for hours, barely capable of hauling themselves up to switch channels, writes Horatia Harrod. They got fat, developed diabetes, became zombified by low culture: what they did was considered unequivocally bad.In the past couple of decades, such behaviour has come to be viewed quite differently. Today, we “binge-watch”: Collins English Dictionary chose the verb as its word of the year in 2015. As television has become more respectable — at least the high-end shows produced by American cable networks — the phrase has been cleansed of its negative connotations. To spend a weekend watching back-to-back episodes of House of Cards, Breaking Bad (with Bryan Cranston as Walter White, pictured) or The Wire is considered an almost heroic act of cultural commitment.How did we get here? It’s partly thanks to changing technology: TiVo, the digital video recorder that allows viewers to queue up endless episodes of their favourite programmes, arrived in 1999, a precursor to online streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. Before then, we had the TV box set, the first of which made an appearance in 2000; although those bulky volumes of Sex and the City are now gathering dust, they ushered in the era of binge-viewing.All this coincided with the so-called “golden age” of American television, exemplified by The Sopranos and The West Wing, as well as later shows such as Mad Men. These complex, immersive productions seemed perfectly suited to being watched one after the other, just as we now read Dickens in novel, rather than serial, form. (The comparison is one that TV showrunners have unabashedly embraced: “As television becomes more and more like literature, I’d love to be able to set the book by the nightstand when I want to,” said David Fincher, House of Cards executive producer, back in 2013.)Freed from the whims of TV schedulers, shows found new followings. In 2002, the makers of 24 found they were able to convert people who’d missed the first series by releasing it on DVD six weeks before the second series aired, allowing them to catch up; they sold 1.7m units and gained 3m new viewers when the show restarted.By bulk-releasing whole series, first done for the crime drama Lilyhammer in 2012, streaming services have had similar victories: Netflix data suggested that viewers were prepared to sit through an average of 3.44 episodes before deciding whether or not to commit. Not that they’re leaving anything to chance: their “post-play” feature, which prompts viewers to segue straight from one episode to the next, is based on an algorithm that works out when previous viewers turned off.These developments haven’t made everyone happy. Some have bemoaned the end of TV as a communal pastime: discussing a programme around the water cooler has become a fraught activity, with conversations swiftly shut down for fear of revealing spoilers. Others claim that binge-watching has made us less shrewd viewers, in a variation on the sunk-cost fallacy: once you’ve invested an amount of time in a show, you feel duty-bound to finish it. It’s what one critic described as “TV drama Stockholm syndrome” — and it seems we’re all prisoners now.Photographs: Netflix; New York Times/Redux/Eyevine; Reuters; AP"
422;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;ComScore plunges after accounting review announced;Shares in US media measurement company down more than 33%;Shares in ComScore dropped more than 33 per cent on Monday after the US media measurement company, in which advertising group WPP holds a 16 per cent stake, revealed it was reviewing “certain potential accounting matters”.ComScore delayed filing its annual report, postponed its investor day and suspended its $125m share repurchase programme “out of an abundance of caution” while the review is under way.The announcement comes amid a push by ComScore to take on Nielsen, the long-time standard in measuring US television audiences whose ratings underpin billions of dollars in advertising sales.ComScore recently bought TV measurement company Rentrak and last month said it would roll out a new metric of media consumption across TV and the internet to compete with Nielsen by as soon as April.Media owners and advertisers have been calling for better measurement of audiences, with the increasing use of mobile phones, tablets and internet-connected TVs to watch programmes and movies. Viacom has been among the most vocal critics of Nielsen, arguing that its methods of measuring do not capture the full digital reach of its networks including MTV and Comedy Central.Nielsen is rolling out its “total audience” measure that it says will provide a fuller picture of viewing from broadcast and cable channels to online video sites to subscription video services including Netflix.ComScore said in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that the accounting review by its audit committee, an independent counsel and advisers would not be completed before March 15, the last day of an extension to file its 2015 report.It said its board had “received a message regarding certain potential accounting matters” on February 19, two days after it reported its fourth-quarter and 2015 results.ComScore said it would not comment further on the review until it was finished.
423;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-02-23T19:51:01Z;UPS, FedEx should breath easy over Amazon;;Breath easier, UPS and FedEx. Speculation has been rife that Amazon may be trying to disrupt a new industry: the business of delivering parcels. But analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon the ambitions of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos are probably far narrower.The Seattle-based company has upended the retail sector by selling a vast array of products online and getting them to customers quickly. It’s also made waves with its lucrative Amazon Web Services division, which allows companies to rent computing power. AWS now powers many big-name brands, such as Netflix.So it’s little surprise that reports indicating Amazon has been in discussions to lease cargo aircraft and buy its own trucks have left investors wondering if the company plans to take on package delivery companies, like UPS and FedEx.But Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, argues Amazon’s ambitions are far less dramatic. Creating a fully-fledged delivery company would require a “large” investment and returns on that investment would be “uncertain,” he says.[Amazon's] management’s recent comments on delivery, that they are looking to “supplement our existing partners…not…replace them”, aforementioned subscale unit delivery economics, and questions about whether traditional retailers would trust [Amazon] with their package delivery make us skeptical [Amazon] is building a full fledged competitor against the parcel companies.It’s also far-fetched, Mr Nowak argues, that Amazon plans on delivering its own packages on a large scale, despite having spent about $11.5bn last year to ship an estimated 2.2bn packages. The company would not be able to reach critical mass of around 100 packages per driver per day to make such a move economically viable, he says.For perspective, UPS, the biggest US package delivery company, delivers about 220-300 residential packages per driver per day in urban areas. So what, then, does Amazon have up its sleeve?Mr Nowak says it makes sense for Amazon to make its own deliveries in certain densely-populated urban areas (think New York). He estimates there are around 10m members of Amazon’s Prime service, which charges an annual fee for unlimited free two-day delivery, across the 10 biggest US metro areas.Assuming the members order one package a month, that translates into about 380,000 packages delivered per day across the areas.“This would likely be enough density to support in-house delivery and drive long-term cost savings,” Mr Nowak wrote, adding that if Amazon could deliver 150 packages per driver per day in these areas, it would drive $220m in total annual savings.Still, Mr Nowak notes that an sort of Amazon delivery service may still be far off:While the mathematics work, we note that there is still investment required (trucks, loading docks, logistics technologies, hiring/training thousands of drivers,etc.) before [Amazon] could start to meaningfully perform its own delivery.
424;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Where America has Fangs, Britain has stubby molars;Europe has talked about the need to build tech champions, others just do it, writes Robert Colvile;"Hubris, meet nemesis. Dan Wagner, the founder of Powa Technologies, claimed to be building “the biggest tech company in living memory” — a British giant that would leave Google and Alibaba in its dust. But as the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, the mobile commerce company has had to delay some payments to staff and suppliers. In a video message to staff late last year, Wagner admitted that Powa was “basically pre-revenue”. This “unicorn” (the term used to refer to private companies valued at more than $1bn) may still have a bright future — but for the moment its mane is looking rather ragged.What is most interesting about Powa, however, is not the imbalance between rhetoric and revenue. It is that its global ambitions (including a joint venture in China) make it a novelty — and a rarity — on the London scene.Britain is increasingly skilled at turning its brainpower into thriving tech firms. But these tend to end up in the arms of the American giants. Take SwiftKey: two of its co-founders turned their frustration with typing on mobile phones into a predictive keyboard app downloaded by more than 300m people, a deal to provide Stephen Hawking’s language software, and finally a buyout from Microsoft earlier this month for $250m. The only one not celebrating was the third co-founder, who traded his initial stake for a bicycle.Before that there was DeepMind, the British artificial intelligence company acquired by Google for a reported £400m. And VocalIQ, one of three British tech firms acquired by Apple in 2015.“I think there’s definitely an issue in Britain, and with technology companies in particular, of thinking that the route to success is being bought by a larger — usually American — company,” says Matt Warman, Conservative MP for Boston and Skegness, and a former technology journalist. The digital economy has a built-in tendency towards monopoly, due to the network effects that entrench market advantage. Yet the firms doing the monopolising seem always to be American. They have the so-called Fangs— Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. We get a selection of stubby molars.What is the explanation? Partly, it is about culture. London is now Europe’s largest tech hub, with more than half of the continent’s unicorns. But a recent report noted that in comparison to other hubs, London “lacks a fully authentic entrepreneurial spirit”. An earlier survey found that twice as many company founders were after a quick buck as in New York or Silicon Valley. The Brits wanted a slice of the action; the Americans wanted the whole pie.Yet ascribing this phenomenon to a national inferiority complex is, Mr Warman insists, “horribly unfair”. Rohan Silva, who as an adviser to David Cameron helped build up Tech City in east London, argues that “it takes a village to raise a unicorn”. Building multibillion-dollar companies does not just require entrepreneurs and investors, he says, but an array of specialised executive talent with experience of growing companies.Mr Silva claims London is building up its talent pool — not least because the founders who “exit” to US giants often then invest in new start-ups. But obstacles remain. For example, tax relief for entrepreneurs is capped at £10m. “It means there is a massive incentive to sell before your stake is worth that,” he says. “I meet loads of entrepreneurs who are grappling with that quandary.”But there are also structural problems that British, and European, firms may never overcome. For a company such as Uber or Facebook, with operations in 50 American states, overseas expansion rarely represents an existential risk. For companies from smaller countries, it might mean doubling in size. That makes it a much riskier bet — and one that many of Powa’s British rivals have, entirely rationally, shied away from.It is obviously good news that Britain is building tech firms, of any size. But their failure to join the ranks of the megafauna is a problem for politicians as well as entrepreneurs.As the recent wrangling over Google’s tax bills shows, relations between tech giants and national governments are tense and getting tenser. The Fangs are, increasingly, actors with real global muscle; the same may soon be said of their Chinese equivalents.Europe has talked endlessly about the need to build tech champions of its own. But instead the US giants have grown larger — trampling or swallowing firms both at home and abroad.In the old days, countries used to measure their virility by the size of their fleets. If tech giants are the new dreadnoughts, Britain and Europe were long ago blown out of the water.The writer is author of ‘The Great Acceleration: How the World is Getting Faster, Faster’"
425;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-02-16T18:28:36Z;Networking lessons: an MBA does the Sundance Film Festival;;"Last week I sat in a packed theatre at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, and felt exhilarated and humbled to watch the premiere of the film I produced before attending Chicago Booth. The film was a huge part of my pre-MBA career; I spent four years working on it and learnt a lot from my talented colleagues. While my pre-MBA experiences brought me to Sundance, Booth helped me make the most of my time there.Since I was part of a film team during the festival, I had access to various industry events where I could meet business leaders I would normally only encounter in the press. I left for the festival with a suitcase full of snow-friendly networking clothes and my head full of advice from my entrepreneurial selling professor.On the first day of entrepreneurial selling, our class was shown how an attention-grabbing introduction is key to a strong first impression. “It gives the person you’re talking to something to connect with,” our professor, Craig Wortmann, explained, “and shows that you’re enthusiastic about the conversation.”When people asked me, “what do you do?” I never said “I’m in grad school.” Depending on my audience I said “I’m working on a new venture at UChicago’s business school,” or “I’m part of the film team that made Unlocking the Cage,” or “I’m interning with a VC fund while getting my MBA at UChicago.” These very different introductions resonated with very different people. When I introduced myself to Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, I mentioned the case I did in my accounting class on his company. Thankfully he laughed when I made a joke about its numbers.While using detailed introductions seems like a no brainer, using them strategically helped me stay on top of the points I wanted to cover while networking. This is something I learnt from Prof Wortmann: have a goal for each conversation. With specific goals in mind, I spent less time on awkward small talk and more time on the substantive stuff that I had a brief amount of time to get to. Before making an introduction, I reminded myself of what I wanted to get out of the meeting – whether learning about a particular role in a company, or getting feedback on my entrepreneurial project.Prof Wortmann was right when he told us that having a clear goal for a conversation increased the likelihood of it being a success. I made the most of the moments I had with folks from HBO, Amazon, Netflix and others, and having a game plan kept my confidence up. I have never had a problem introducing myself to strangers, and yet I was really nervous about approaching the media industry leaders I admire.Selling anything is hard, but selling yourself can be the most difficult thing of all. Too often MBAs overlook the difficulty of mastering a skill like selling, and at Booth, in particular, our obsession with data and analytics can often distract from lessons in people-to-people skills.My advice to any MBA: take every opportunity to engage with communications skills as you would with any of the others in the MBA toolkit. No amount of data could have prepared me for Sundance, and I would have looked back on the trip as a waste had I not taken my networking up a notch and had my selling strategy on hand."
426;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-02-10T17:12:24Z;US media: proof of life;Viacom’s problems are both commercial and governance related;Having taken the nastiest plunge of the big US media groups, leave it to Viacom to seek a rapid youthful makeover. Last week its 92-year-old patron, Sumner Redstone, announced he would step aside as board chairman. He has not been seen for months on account of his deteriorating health. On Tuesday, Viacom (parent of Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV and Paramount Pictures) said it had signed a partnership with Snapchat, the photo sharing app favoured by frisky millennials. Still its shares fell a fifth and are down 61 per cent in two years — far worse than its peers.All cable networks face sagging ratings and advertising revenue as Americans increasingly watch TV through streaming services, such as Netflix, or recorded shows that skip the commercial interruptions. But Viacom lacks the safety nets of its peers. Its most crucial network, Nickelodeon, is a children’s station whose programming happens to be the sweet spot of Netflix. And unlike Time Warner, 21st Century Fox and, particularly, Disney (owner of ESPN) it lacks live sports.For all the gloom pervading the sector, some green shoots are sprouting. Disney said on Tuesday that the number of ESPN subscribers was growing as young consumers buy slimmer TV bundles. Time Warner on Wednesday boosted its forecast for 2016.Viacom said its cable network revenue growth would be only in the mid-single digits, below previous forecasts. However, it believes that turnrounds at Comedy Central and MTV are impending and that Snapchat — where Viacom would sell ads for the upstart app — can lend the older company some of its cool, as well as build a foundation in the area to which ad spend is migrating.Yet for all the angst about its commercial problems, complex governance may be what most holds back Viacom. Its chief, the richly paid Philippe Dauman, is not supported by Mr Redstone’s daughter, Shari. However, she does not control the board of which Mr Dauman is the new chair.

427;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-02-05T15:05:57Z;Telecoms groups face new battle over bundled services;BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media compete to offer combined telecoms and media deals;"A decade ago, telecoms customers in the UK knew where they stood. BT did not sell television, Sky did not sell broadband and the country’s largest cable group, NTL Telewest, did not sell mobile phone contracts.By the end of this year all of the big four telecoms groups — BT, Sky, TalkTalk and NTL’s successor Virgin Media — will be engaged in a form of cross-dressing. Each will offer so-called quadplay packages — broadband, landline, mobile phone and TV contracts — in an effort to increase customer loyalty and spending. They will be joined by Vodafone, which is tiptoeing into the market, offering new customers six months’ free broadband and Netflix.“Effectively you’ve got five operators that are offering triple-play bundles, plus at least a bit of TV,” says Guy Peddy, an analyst at Macquarie. The question now is which providers are best positioned.BT
Strength: Mobile
Weakness: Threat of more regulationIn the UK, no company has invested more to prepare for the new world of “convergence” than BT. It has spent more than £2bn on sports rights and £12.5bn on mobile operator EE— the latter adding 25m customers. Analysts now expect BT to push cheap bundles of services. “BT will not want to allow TalkTalk or Sky any headroom for their nascent mobile offerings,” says Will Draper at Mirabaud Securities.However, with greater size comes greater oversight. BT could be badly scarred in the next few months by Ofcom if the telecoms regulator recommends a formal split of the Openreach network. Access to BT’s network for rivals will almost certainly be more tightly regulated, which could lead to cheaper broadband lines for consumers.The jury is out as to whether BT will be able to broaden its TV offering — adding high-quality drama as well as sports rights. BT’s brand has proved difficult to stretch in the past, says James Barford of Enders Analysis. The company will continue to use the brands of EE and cheap broadband provider Plusnet to appeal to different customers.Sky
Strength: Content
Weakness: MobileFor Sky, telecoms is a means to an end: television. It owns the most content, and so far customer numbers have kept growing — up 3 per cent over the past year — despite the rise of BT Sport and Netflix. Sky only plans to launch a mobile offering later this year, after its rivals have done so.Bears argue that the economics are moving against it. Since 2006, Sky has been to able to sign up millions of broadband customers, because the cost of accessing BT’s copper network is strictly regulated. The same is not true of fibre broadband and superfast mobile — meaning Sky’s costs will be much higher, says John Karidis, an analyst at Haitong.Yet Sky, which spends more on advertising than any other company in the UK, has seen off the doubters before. It is betting that content, customer service and branding will allow it to beat the competition.Virgin Media
Strength: Speed
Weakness: ContentVirgin Media only covers about half of UK households, but among them it is the most popular broadband provider. Its bet is that viewers will prioritise high-quality internet over price. Fibre-optic speeds — up to 200Mb per second — go down well among fans of Netflix and Amazon Prime.But content is Virgin’s weakness. It is reported to make minimal profits from selling Netflix, and pays more to BT and Sky than it charges its customers for their channels. As the costs of Premier League football increases, customers may have less money to spend on broadband.Virgin, which is owned by US group Liberty Global, is extending its network to an additional 4m homes by 2020, which could challenge BT. But without nationwide coverage, the group is reluctant to invest in a mobile operator — because it would be unable to sell internet to many of the mobile customers. If network ownership matters, that will hinder its appeal.TalkTalk
Strength: Price
Weakness: Lack of assetsTalkTalk appeals to the “value customer”. It makes a virtue of the fact that it does not own expensive rights to TV content or extensive infrastructure. Like Sky, it rents access to BT’s broadband network and space on O2’s mobile network. It is therefore similarly vulnerable to increased wholesale costs of fibre broadband and superfast mobile.Other short-term headaches include a cyber-hack that led to almost 100,000 customers leaving in the last quarter. “TalkTalk endured a torrid time, but operationally at least there are signs the worst is now over,” says Mirabaud Securities’ Mr Draper.One opportunity for TalkTalk is buying mobile capacity or infrastructure — if regulators demand that operators O2 and Three sell off assets as a condition for approving their merger.Vodafone
Strength: Mobile
Weakness: Fixed lineVodafone is still primarily a mobile group in the UK; it has launched a broadband service but has pushed back its TV platform until later in 2016. The company continues to complain to regulators about difficulties accessing BT’s fibre network and the content rights, mostly owned by Sky in the UK.Analysts expect it to make slow headway in the UK’s competitive market. Many argue that a takeover of Liberty Global is what Vodafone needs to become a serious quadplay provider. The companies are in talks to combine their operations in the Netherlands."

It will aim to produce at least 300 hours of original content in 2016 and to double that by 2018.Having first launched in 2011 as a free-to-watch streaming website for Nigeria’s “Nollywood” movies— the world’s second-largest film industry by output — the Lagos-based group has since shifted to a “mobile only” subscription app strategy. Subscribers download an app and pay a monthly fee to watch unlimited movies.“For us, there is no version of reality where the marriage between Africa’s most powerful communication tool [mobile] and the most prolific and loved entertainment provider [Nollywood] won’t be a joyous union,” argued Jason Njoku, chief executive and co-founder of iROKOtv. “With millions more Africans poised to come online via mobile in the coming years, our mission is to lead viewers to content they’ll love.”Although smartphone data usage is still expensive in many African countries, costs are coming down rapidly, in line with the price of smartphones. In Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy, some Chinese-brand devices retail for the equivalent of less than $40.Even so, iROKOtv has developed its app to stream films on low bandwidth so as not to deter customers who cannot afford large monthly data packages. While many of its 65,000 subscribers are in the African diaspora, not on the continent, iROKOtv faces competition from Netflix, which this month announced plans to enter 130 countries, including many African nations.For iROKOtv the challenge will be to fight for new customers against Netflix. The California-based streaming video provider has 74m subscribers.iROKOtv, which previously raised $25m from international investors including US-based hedge fund Tiger Global Management, declined to comment on the valuation implied by its fundraising. But a spokeswoman said the new deal means that iROKOtv will be “cash flow positive within the next couple of years”.

But it gives Sky, which is 39 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, the rights to Showtime series in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria. Showtime is owned by CBS, the US broadcast network.The deal goes beyond 2020 when a similar arrangement will expire between Sky and HBO, the Time Warner-owned channel behind hits such as Game of Thrones and Veep, according to a person familiar with the matter.Unlike the US, European pay-TV has not been hit by a wave of cord-cutting— whereby consumers cancel their cable or satellite subscriptions in favour of cheaper online alternatives.“The dynamics of our business are fundamentally different from the US model,” said Gary Davey, Sky’s managing director of content.However, Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services are increasing their investment in original programming, which is putting pressure on European pay-TV operators. Netflix will spend $6bn on content this year and recently switched on its service in 130 new countries, giving it coverage in every major market apart from China.“HBO already has its deal with Sky and has deals in other parts of the world,” said Armando Nuñez, president and chief executive of CBS’ global distribution group. Showtime, he added, “is kind of the last piece of pristine beachfront property that is available from a US content perspective”.Mr Davey said Sky had to make sure it kept freshening its content to keep customers. “The churn rate can kill you,” he said. “Making sure you keep your customers is part of that but so is building a reputation as the exclusive home of the world’s best content.”The Showtime-Sky deal is the latest in a string of transatlantic tie-ups between US studios and European pay-TV groups.Liberty Global, the John Malone-controlled group that has investments in European cable television assets including Virgin Media and Discovery Communications, recently acquired a stake in Lions Gate Entertainment, the studio behind the Mad Men series. Liberty described the deal as a “strategic content investment”.Meanwhile, AMC Networks, the US cable channel behind The Walking Dead series, recently mounted a push into new markets — including the UK — where it launched a new channel on BT’s television service. BT and Sky are fierce competitors in the UK.In the US, Showtime has launched a standalone “over the top” streaming service which is available without a cable or satellite subscription.The company is also producing more of its own series, rather than licensing them from other studios. Homeland, its biggest hit, was produced by Fox, for example, but the company envisages most of its shows eventually being produced in-house.

These companies do not require licences to operate in Kenya, where there is no internet censorship and the media is largely free.A Communication Authority spokesman said: “The KFCB view is important but its decision is not final and the position of Netflix is under review by the whole government, including the KFCB and the CA.”Kenya’s objections to Netflix’s programming are indicative of the possible pitfalls facing digital-streaming platforms that rely heavily on western content.Netflix said it in a statement that it was “an internet television network, not a traditional broadcaster”.“Services delivered over the internet present all sorts of novel questions for policymakers,” the company said, adding that its content was only available via subscription. “We empower consumers to make smart viewing choices by providing details on the titles on Netflix, including ratings and episode synopses. We also provide parental controls.”Netflix is engaged in a “living room” battle in the US, its main market, with Amazon and Hulu, which is owned by 21st Century Fox, Walt Disney and Comcast.However, it has pursued aggressive international expansion this month, switching on its service in 130 new countries, including India, Russia, Indonesia and Turkey.Kenya is one of the first countries to express concerns over Netflix’s content — although such criticisms have not slowed its subscriber growth. Shares in the company rose on Tuesday morning when it reported another 4.04m international sign-ups — more than the 3.5m it had forecast in October. Netflix shares initially fell more than 7 per cent but by afternoon trading had recovered to be down less than 1 per cent.

Kenya was one of 130 new markets Netflix pushed into earlier in January in a move that tripled the number of countries it operates in.Without referencing anything specific, the KFCB said that “if such content is allowed without scrutiny by our regulatory standards, the country is bound to open a floodgate for extremist and radicalising content, particularly within view-on-demand and pay platforms.”There is disagreement among Kenya’s regulators over how Netflix should be categorised. While the KFCB is keen to regulate it closely, others have adopted a more relaxed attitude.Francis Wangusi, the director-general of the Communication Authority, told local media last week that Netflix was not a traditional broadcaster but an online platform.

432;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-01-19T23:12:03Z;Netflix brings back the Frank Underwood bond;;The Frank Underwood bond is coming back.Netflix is likely to tap bond markets later this year or in early 2017 as the high costs to produce original programming sap its cash on hand, the US streaming television and movie group said on Tuesday.The producer of House of Cards, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Orange is the New Black holds roughly $2.4bn in debt — rated B plus by Standard & Poor’s and B1 by Moody’s — including $1.5bn issued in the last year, US capital markets correspondent Eric Platt reports.The group’s cash and cash equivalent slipped to $1.8bn at the end of 2015, more than a quarter below its holdings at the end of its fiscal first quarter.Netflix has invested heavily in original programming a bid to woo subscribers to its streaming service. The company counted more than 57m streaming subscribers in its latest quarter, along with 5.8m consumers who continue to pay for its DVD-by-mail service.While only two companies have tapped the US junk bond market this year, Netflix is not likely to face many of the stresses that have weighed on the asset class, which has been buffeted by a sell-off in commodity-linked paper.The yield on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch index of single-B rated companies has climbed to 9.7 per cent from just above 6 per cent last April. Yields move inversely to the price of a bond.In contrast, ten-year paper issued in 2015 by Netflix yields 5.9 per cent, having slipped 7 cents on the dollar from a high of 107 last year.In the company’s quarterly letter to shareholders, chief executive Reed Hastings and chief financial officer David Wells, wrote:Our bonds trade like a BB credit (vs. their single B rating) due, in part, to the long‐term growth of Internet TV globally and our low debt to market cap ratio, which provides bond investors with a very thick cushion of protection.Revenues in the last year climbed 23 per cent to $6.8bn, while profits slid 54 per cent to $122.6m.
433;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-01-19T21:29:35Z;Netflix shares pop as overseas subscribers jump;;Netflix investors have given the online streaming site a five-star review after it reported better-than-expected earnings and overseas subscribers growth in the fourth quarter, even as US subscriptions missed forecasts.Shares in Netflix jumped as much as 10 per cent in extended trading after the company —known for its original programming, including House of Cards, Making a Murderer and Beasts of No Nation, its first original feature film — said it added 4.04m international subscribers in the fourth-quarter, ahead of the 3.5m it had forecast in October, writes Mamta Badkar in New York.However, the company added 1.56m domestic subscribers, below the 1.65m it had previously forecast. This was slower than the 1.9m additions in the year ago quarter. “Our high penetration in the US seems to be making net additions harder than in the past,” the company said in a letter to shareholders.US subscriber growth slowed to 881,000 in the third quarter and the company had blamed the ongoing transition to chip-based credit and debit cards for weaker net additions at the time, stating that the switch had impacted its ability to collect online payments.The company said it crossed 75m members on January 1, right after the quarter ended, with 17m net additions last year.For the current quarter, Netflix expects US additions of 1.75m and international net additions of 4.35m. Netflix, which is now available “virtually everywhere”, said it has “work and uncertainty ahead” in China, the last remaining major market.The Los Gatos, California-based company said profits fell to $43.2m or 10 cents a share in the three months ended in December, compared with $83.4m or 19 cents a share in the year ago period. This compared to forecasts for 2 cents a share.Overseas operations ate into profits once again as the company pushes ahead with its global expansion. Netflix reported a loss of $109m in its international division.Meanwhile, sales rose 23 per cent to $1.8bn, in line with estimates.Lagging US subscriber growth proved a thorn in the side for the company in the third quarter. Netflix said last year that it is increasing the price of its most popular streaming service by $1 to $9.99 a month as it seeks to boost revenues.The site said earlier this month that it has launched in 130 more countries including India and Russia in a global push that would expand the challenge to traditional broadcasters from online streaming sites. The company’s popularity in the US has seen viewers increasingly choose to “cut the cord” on their cable television subscriptions.Netflix shares have advanced more than 120 per cent since the start of last year.
434;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-01-15T22:07:49Z;Wynn bucks the sell-off on Las Vegas win;US stocks sink following a sharp sell-off in China and more oil price falls;On a day when 96 per cent of companies on the S&P 500 were in the red, shares in Wynn Resorts were rallying after the gaming company reported preliminary fourth-quarter results that showed growth in Las Vegas and earnings in Macau that were modestly above consensus estimates.Shares in Las Vegas-based Wynn jumped more than 13 per cent to $58.36 by the close after the company said it expected revenues in a range of $387m to $395m, compared with $376.8m in the year-ago period. At the close they were flat at $51.50.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) were expected to rise to between $123m and $131m, compared with $111.2m a year ago and ahead of forecasts.The company said revenues and earnings in Macau, the Chinese casino gambling centre, are estimated to decline from last year.A slowdown in the Chinese economy coupled with the nation’s crackdown on corruption has seen Macau’s gaming revenue decline for 19 consecutive months.Wynn said adjusted ebitda in Macau is expected to be in the range of $156m to $164m, down from $241.2m in the year-ago period. However, the high end of that range was above consensus estimates for $157m.“Given the high short interest in Wynn Resorts, this pre-release should lead to a sharp short covering rally, which recently has led to swings of 10 per cent or more,” said Harry Curtis, an analyst at Nomura.However, he said that investors should wait to “understand the sustainability of the strength in December in Macau” before jumping in.Shares in Wynn Resorts slumped more than 50 per cent last year.Walt Disney shares fell 5.26 per cent to $93.90 after analysts at Barclays downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “equal weight” and reduced their price target to $89 from $98.Analysts noted that despite boosts to the stock from the latest instalment in the Star Wars film franchise, there is a risk to earnings next year as its sports channel ESPN continues to lose subscribers even as sports programming costs climb.Disney shares have been hurt as viewers increasingly choose to “cut the cord” on their cable and network television subscriptions as competition from online streaming sites such as Netflix and Amazon rises.With Brent crude, the global oil marker, and West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, both falling below the $30-a-barrel mark, energy stocks took a hit.Marathon Oil was the biggest loser, falling 10.25 per cent to $8.14, shares in Chesapeake Energy declined 4.04 per cent to $3.56 while shares in Transocean dropped 6.45 per cent to $9.86.The S&P 500 energy sector was one of the worst performing sectors alongside information technology.The decline in technology shares was led by Intel, which slid 9.10 per cent to $29.76, after the company issued disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter and amid a broader sell-off in US equities.US markets were lower on Friday following a sharp sell-off in Chinese equities and oil prices that sapped confidence.By the close, the S&P 500 had declined about 2.1 per cent to 1,880.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen around 2.3 per cent to 15,985.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was off 2.74 per cent to 4,488.02.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

Huanxi will announce on Thursday that it has agreed an alliance with Mubi, a streaming service headquartered in the UK.China’s cinema box office revenues surged 40 per cent last year to $6.8bn and the country will overtake the US as the world’s largest movie market by 2018, according to research group IHS. But its market for film subscription services is still relatively small.Netflix, the world’s largest film streaming service, which expanded into 130 more countries this month, has yet to enter China — having failed to obtain permission from the government to do so.Huanxi and Mubi said they expected to launch their service in China this year, though they declined to detail how they would obtain the necessary licences from Beijing.“We know how to navigate through all the regulations,” said Steven Xiang, chief executive of Huanxi Media.Mubi’s rivals in the Chinese market include Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, whose video offering iQiyi has more than 10m paying subscribers.Efe Cakarel, chief executive of Mubi, said the service had the potential to attract “millions of subscribers” thanks to its exclusive access to films produced by Huanxi.“We’ll have exclusive access to potentially the biggest films coming out of China,” he said.Ning Hao and Xu Zheng, two of Chinese’s most successful film directors, are co-founders of Huanxi and will be making original content for the group. Lost in Hong Kong, their latest production, has grossed more than $250m at the Chinese box office, making it one of the country’s most commercially successful films.Huanxi has agreed to invest $40m in the joint venture and will own 70 per cent of the new company.Mubi is licensing its streaming technology in perpetuity to the venture and providing operational expertise in exchange for a 30 per cent stake.Huanxi has also agreed to invest $10m for an 8 per cent stake in Mubi itself, valuing the company at $125m. In its last funding round in 2014, Mubi was valued at $25m.One of the main ways that Mubi differs from other streaming services is that it offers a small catalogue of just 30 films at any one time. Each day a new title is added and another is removed — a product feature that Mubi has patented in the US.
436;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-01-11T11:17:08Z;Pacesetting companies and the masochists who run them;No one company can dictate fashion but bellwethers like M&S are still needed;Being a bellwether is no fun. Shepherds used to castrate a ram — or wether — put a bell round its neck and set it to lead their sheep. For chief executives who head a company whose performance is supposed to be a guide to the state of the market, it is more like wearing a millstone than a bell.Take Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks and Spencer, Britain’s best-known retailer.In 2009, he was fleetingly hailed as the “billion-dollar man”, based on the combined rise in M&S’s value and the fall in that of his previous employer on his appointment. He was paid a controversial fortune to join, but was doomed never to dazzle investors again. He did a decent job, often in areas out of the spotlight, but it was a wearying task. “If you are going to be chief executive of one of these entities you have to be bloody resilient,” says one person who knows the M&S chief. “You wouldn’t believe the amount of attention you get.”If it is so hard for a single company, let alone a single executive, to make the pace, why not drop the bellwether tag altogether? After all, you could argue we are all bellwethers now: the ease with which the crowd can voice its collective opinions, tastes and desires — via social media, for instance — means no single company can or should dictate fashion.But strangely, individual benchmarks are still valuable, however hard it is for some to stay standing.Bellwethers increasingly face the threat that they will one day be led off to the slaughter. Ecommerce rivals and “fast fashion” proponents have torn into M&S’s clothing business.Meanwhile, many investors seeking signals about the state of the UK retail economy have instead chosen to follow Next, headed by the sharp-eyed seer of the sector, Lord Wolfson. Yet even he has recently admitted that Next’s lead over faster-moving rivals in areas such as catalogue and online retailing is breaking down.In the US, DuPont and Dow Chemical, either of which might in the past have led the flock, are merging in order to split, ultimately, into three separate manufacturers. None will provide the same barometer for the whole chemical industry.The ability of technology’s corporate champions to stay at the top is even more tenuous. BlackBerry — then Research In Motion — was once a bellwether stock until Apple snatched its bell away. Even then, people have questioned the sustainability of the iPhone producer’s stream of innovations virtually since the day Tim Cook took over from Steve Jobs.For much of the 20th century, the bellwether company of the bellwether sector of the US economy was US Steel. The Financial Times first described the integrated producer that way in 1909 and it was another 70 years before mini-mills such as Nucor challenged the incumbent’s supremacy (as described in Clayton Christensen’s recently contested account of how disruptive innovation happens).The groups that now lead the US market — the “Fangs” quartet of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet) — have a combined lifespan of 70 years. Challengers for the title of trendsetter such as Uber and Airbnb are younger still.In short, the bellwether label has a far earlier sell-by date than it used to.Yet investors will continue to seek out stocks that are useful gauges of the economic forces affecting, say, outsourcing (such as Walmart, the retailer) or international trade (like AP Møller-Maersk, the container shipping group). A few large groups such as ExxonMobil will always have the power to lead their sector based on sheer scale and long history, despite the threats to their existence. Some companies still have a role to play as emblems of a national psyche, however diminished. A nation of shopkeepers without a flag-carrying shopkeeper would be unthinkable: hence the need for a line of resilient successors to run M&S.But there is also another important reason bellwethers are still needed — now more than ever. “We need to know that it’s not an impossible task to be a success,” says David Bowers of Absolute Strategy Research.In other words, in uncertain times, the symbolic value of high-profile survivors increases, if only as a target others can aspire to hit or beat.Bellwether companies may be less long-lasting than they once were. Their sense of direction may occasionally be unreliable. Running one is hell. But if we could no longer hear them, we really would be lost.andrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill

More news and analysis from FT reportersNetflix’s move triples the number of markets in which it operates, and is the latest new media challenge to traditional broadcasters.Reed Hastings, chief executive, told the CES it was “witnessing the birth of a new global internet TV network”. The only big market the company had yet to tap, he added, was China, “where we hope to be in the future”.Advances in automobile technology also drew attention at the CES, with Volkswagen unveiling a new all-electric van, dubbed the Budd-e. The concept car has software that allows users to control the car with voice recognition and hand gestures, and can travel 233 miles on a single charge.Ford chief executive Mark Fields also delivered an address at the world’s largest consumer technology convention, saying his group was determined to be a leader in autonomous vehicles, hinting that Ford would look into joint ventures with leading tech companies.In a further sign of the convergence between the automotive and tech sectors, Toyota announced that it had hired Google’s former head of robotics, predicting that robots could one day become the Japanese company’s main business.James Kuffner, a Google employee since 2009, joins Toyota as part of a team of researchers to lead its new artificial intelligence research lab in Silicon Valley.New product launches in wearable technology, ranging from fitness trackers to Fitbit and Casio smartwatches, also drew attention at the show of 3,600 exhibitors.● Related Lex note: Netflix — chill

lucrative enough to bother with.Michael Platt, BlueCrest’s founder, said late last year that the fabled two-and-20 hedge fund fee model — based on charging a fixed 2 per cent management fee on assets as well as a fifth of trading profits — was “no longer a particularly profitable business”.Retail billionaire is latest Chinese executive to vanishThe billionaire founder of one of China’s leading fashion brands went missing this week, amid reports he had been caught up in the country’s anti-corruption campaign, writes Nicholas Megaw in London.Metersbonwe, which operates more than 4,000 clothing stores across China, suspended trading in its shares on the Shenzhen stock exchange last Thursday after local media reported that its chairman, Zhou Chengjian, had been taken away by police.Mr Zhou started his career managing a shop in Shikengling, the mountain village where he grew up, but the success of Metersbonwe has made him China’s 62nd richest man with a fortune of Rmb26.5bn ($4bn), states the Hurun Rich List.He is the latest high-profile businessman believed to be involved in the government’s long-running anti-corruption drive. His disappearance follows the detention last month of Guo Guangchang, chairman of China’s largest private conglomerate Fosun.Dozens of financial industry executives and state-owned company officials have been investigated since the summer meltdown on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, but the country’s business community has been shocked that private businesspeople have also being targeted.Mr Guo reappeared after five days, and Fosun claimed he had still been able manage company matters while assisting authorities with an unspecified investigation.Metersbonwe said in a statement it was unable to reach Mr Zhou or the secretary of the board, Tu Ke.Valeant’s interim chief avoids talk of permanenceValeant, the embattled Canadian drugmaker, appointed an interim chief executive this week to stand in for Michael Pearson, who was hospitalised over Christmas with severe pneumonia, writes David Crow in New York.Previously, the company had said a team of managers would cover for Mr Pearson. But it changed tack when it became clear that he was unlikely to make a speedy return to work.On Wednesday, Valeant named Howard Schiller, its former chief financial officer, as an interim replacement.Mr Schiller served as CFO from 2011 until his departure in June of last year. Before that, he had spent two decades at Goldman Sachs, latterly as chief operating officer of its investment banking division.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Schiller said he would implement the business plan crafted by Mr Pearson before he became unwell, but insisted he had the authority to take big decisions himself. “We need to run the business and we can’t put things on hold while Mike is absent,” he said.Valeant has spent recent months lurching from one crisis to another, denying allegations from short-sellers that its business is a fraud while dealing with outrage from politicians over price increase for its drugs.Mr Schiller said he would adopt a “boring” approach, reducing leverage after years of debt-fuelled acquisitions while eschewing the price rises that have damaged the company’s reputation. But he demurred when asked if he would take on the job permanently. “I’m reluctant to speculate right now,” he said.Yahoo’s Mayer feels heat as activist calls for shake-upActivist investor Starboard Value ramped up the pressure on Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer this week by threatening to push for a management shake-up unless the company altered its approach, writes Ravi Mattu in London.Jeffrey Smith, Starboard’s managing member, which has a stake of just under 1 per cent in the technology group, accused the company of not considering offers for its core business and neglecting shareholder interests.“The board must accept that significant changes are desperately needed. This would include changes in management, changes in board composition, and changes in strategy and execution,” Mr Smith wrote in an open letter.Starboard has agitated for changes at Yahoo for more than a year. It first pushed for the group to spin off its $29bn stake in Alibaba, the ecommerce group. Then it reversed course, saying that it should focus on selling its core internet business.Yahoo agreed to look into a spin-off but Mr Smith alleged that it was ignoring legitimate buyers.The tech group responded to Mr Smith’s letter by saying it intended to share its plans for a “more focused” company in the coming weeks, either on or before it reports fourth-quarter earnings.Ms Mayer become chief executive in 2012 with a promise to revive Yahoo’s fortunes, but the company has struggled to realise her ambition. Shares in Yahoo have fallen almost 40 per cent in the past year and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation declined in the third quarter."

The sobriety that briefly seized Netflix shareholders has already passed. After falling sharply in the first couple of trading days, last year’s best-performing S&P 500 stock jumped 9 per cent on Wednesday after the announcing its immediate launch in 130 additional countries.“Netflix is now global,” the company said. It is not quite true. The video streaming service may be live in Guinea-Bissau but it is still conspicuously absent in the world’s most populous country. And even if Netflix does manage to launch in China, as it has pledged to do this year, there is still a disconnect between the land-grab and the puffy valuation.True, Netflix is taking in more revenues, not just acquiring new stamps in its passport. It is second only to Facebook on a list (compiled by Goldman Sachs) of expected 2016 revenue growth among the 100 largest US stocks. It is also ranked third in terms of analysts’ expectations for growth in earnings per share.Yet while the estimated sales growth of 28 per cent could end up conservative, forecast profit growth of 41 per cent looks optimistic. More countries mean thin margins, for the foreseeable future. Last quarter international losses more than doubled year on year to $67.6m. Last year Netflix was cutting rather than increasing its earnings guidance. The company trades on more than 400 times 2016 earnings and more than five times forward sales.Chief executive Reed Hastings used to be cautious on expanding outside the US, noting five years ago that Netflix was not like other internet companies which could just “translate the website”. He has changed his tune. The company is firmly entrenched as the (almost) global video streamer and has profited from the woes of traditional US cable companies. But it has not built the same moats as that other high-growth, regular earnings disappointer Amazon — which happens to be a major competitor.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Matthew Garrahan, media editor, has the full story on Netflix’s expansion plans.
440;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;CES 2016: Netflix launches in 130 new markets;Streaming service’s expansion is further challenge to traditional broadcasters;"Netflix has launched its streaming services in 130 more countries, raising the stakes in its global battle with Amazon for supremacy in online video.The on-demand content provider, whose popularity in the US has hit audience ratings and advertising revenues at cable and satellite channels, will now offer its services in markets including India, Russia, South Korea and Turkey.Netflix’s move triples the number of markets in which it operates, and is the latest new media challenge to traditional broadcasters. Its task will be to deliver enough high-quality programming that resonates in countries where tastes vary wildly.Reed Hastings, chief executive, told the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas it was “witnessing the birth of a new global internet TV network”. The only big market the company had yet to tap, he added, was China, “where we hope to be in the future”.The expansion could have big implications for international broadcasters and media groups. Netflix’s on-demand streaming video service, which includes original films and television shows, such as Orange Is the New Black and Narcos, has had a profound effect on how people consume and watch media, particularly in its home market.Netflix already has about 74m subscribers and more than half of them are in the US. Its popularity there has been a contributing factor to “ cord-cutting”, where consumers shun the expense of television channels bundled with a cable or satellite subscription in favour of cheaper, on-demand alternatives offered by Netflix and rivals such as Amazon.The number of people watching Netflix and similar internet services has hurt the financial performance of the big media companies that own cable television channels. In 2015, the S&P 500 Media index fell 5.7 per cent, far more than the broader market, which was flat for the year.Unlike the shares of its mainstream media peers, Netflix stock rose more than 140 per cent in 2015.On Wednesday shares in Netflix rose 9.3 per cent to $117.68, erasing losses since the start of the year on concerns about US subscriber growth. With a market capitalisation of $46bn, it is worth more than CBS and Viacom combined.Mr Hastings said the moment had arrived for Netflix to deliver its streaming video service to every country. “Globally, 3.2bn people are using the internet, and 2bn are from developing countries,” he said. “That’s up from 400m in 2000. This growth has been nothing short of astonishing.”Toyota poaches Google exec

More news and analysis from FT reportersHe acknowledged that running the service in so many international markets was a “big and challenging task” and pointed to the difficulties involved in securing global rights to hit shows normally sold country by country.“Content rights are [usually] sliced and diced by territory in deals between studios and local TV networks that often last up to a decade,” he said. “Countries have differing attitudes to what content is appropriate [and] e-commerce payment systems are still developing around the world.”Netflix was the first company to launch a mass-market video subscription service but competition has increased recently. Amazon spent $1.3bn in 2014 on original series production for its Prime instant video service and last year said it would “double down” on its investment.Hulu, the streaming service owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast, has also ramped up its investment in original programming. Hulu is only available in the US but James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, suggested recently that international expansion was likely."

442;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;CD sales in the UK more resilient than downloads;Fastest-growing part of music business remains streaming songs;"The death of the CD has been greatly exaggerated.CD sales in the UK fell at the slowest rate in a decade last year, according to figures from the Entertainment Retailers Association, a trade body that represents high street retailers such as HMV and Tesco as well as digital services such as Spotify.Total sales of CDs fell just 3.7 per cent to 53.6m in 2015 compared with the previous year whereas in 2014 they dropped 8 per cent, in 2013 they fell 12 per cent and in 2012 they plunged 20 per cent.The format, which generated revenues of £468m last year, is proving much more resilient to competition from downloads and streaming than many industry executives had predicted.CDs are also proving more robust than downloads — a format once tipped to replace them. Download sales dropped 13 per cent last year to less than £300m.“It is clearly way too soon to write off the CD or other disc-based formats,” said Kim Bayley, ERA chief executive.“The fact is that different formats provide different benefits to different groups of entertainment fans. That diversity is proving to be the entertainment market’s greatest strength.”Vinyl is also showing strength. Sales of vinyl records surged 65 per cent to £42m, with 2.1m LPs sold over the past year. After facing near extinction in 2007, when just over 200,000 LPs were bought, the format’s sales have increased in each of the past eight years.However, vinyl still accounts only about 2 per cent of UK music consumption.The fastest-growing part of the music business is streaming songs through services such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music, which tend to charge £10 a month for unlimited access to millions songs through the internet.Revenues from streaming services increased 50 per cent last year to £251m, the ERA said.Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, which represents the UK record industry, said that digital music subscription services such as Spotify and Apple Music “are going mainstream as more people discover how wonderful it is to have all the music in the world to listen to, whenever and wherever you want”.But he added that physical music formats also had a viable future, as “millions of fans also continue to build treasured collections of favourite albums on vinyl, CD or downloads”.The ERA said total revenues from music, video and games increased 5.6 per cent to £6.1bn last year.All three entertainment sectors grew last year, with video up 1.5 per cent to £2.2bn; music up 3.5 per cent to £1.1bn; and games up 10 per cent to £2.8bn.In each sector, growth in digital revenues outweighed declines in physical sales.Overall, digital services account for nearly 60 per cent of entertainment revenues in the UK."
443;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Internet stocks: Fangs a lot;If value comes into fashion, big internet groups will be bitten;"It is unsettling that, in 2015, the US stock market was propped up by four internet companies nicknamed Fang. The worry is that the strength of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (now called Alphabet, but let’s not spoil the acronym) obscures widespread weakness elsewhere. The degree of lopsidedness is slightly overstated: 240 constituents of the S&P 500 ended the year in positive territory. But the foursome’s hefty market valuation and big increases did exert outsized influence. The S&P 500 fell just 0.7 per cent, whereas on an equal-weighted basis — where Chesapeake Energy has as much impact as Amazon despite being worth 100 times less — the index was down 4.1 per cent. A market reliant on such experimental engines is, as Amazon’s part-time rocket man Jeff Bezos knows full well, prone to disaster.What of the four stocks themselves, though? The party might continue. Facebook might have a virtual reality hit with Oculus; Amazon could take even more share of the cloud; Netflix may successfully expand in China; Alphabet’s life sciences division could end death. More likely, something will come unstuck. Collectively, the Fang conglomerate is valued at $1.2tn, with just $18bn in annual earnings. Alphabet made $14bn of that profit and trades at a relatively paltry price/earnings ratio of 35, compared with 100 at Facebook, almost 300 at Netflix and more than 900 at Amazon.Last year, investors were willing to pay up for growth stories. Fangs all share an ability to spin a good yarn. Netflix enjoyed the strongest rise in the S&P 500, in spite of cutting earnings estimates, because it told a seductive tale about its plan to stream video to ever more countries, even at the expense of short-term profits. Investments in growth have been the Amazon buy case, too, time and time again.On the first trading day of 2016, the market looked with more sober eyes. Amazon and Netflix were among the worst performers. Facebook and Alphabet also fared badly. This year, even the Fangs are going to have to show more profits to make their valuations seem a little less scary.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.comFalse teeth? / From Anthony Smouha"
444;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-01-04T22:19:54Z;Netflix falls amid US subscriber worries;Downbeat sentiment on China prompts broad sell-off in equities;Netflix was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on the first trading day of the year following an analyst downgrade and amid a broader sell-off in US equities.Shares in the online streaming site fell more than 6 per cent to $107.19 after the stock was lowered to “neutral” from “outperform” and the price target cut to $115 from $128 by analysts at Baird. They closed down 3.86 per cent at $109.96.The analysts said their quarterly US subscriber survey suggested “potentially weaker US subscriber results for the second consecutive quarter” compared with a normal quarterly increase into the holiday period.The survey showed 46 per cent of its 3,000 US respondents were Netflix streaming subscribers compared with 47 per cent the previous quarter.“This appears to point to more flattish Q4’15 US subscriber progress and, if accurate, potentially raises some questions around the US subscriber growth trajectory,” said William Power, an analyst with the firm.A $1 price increase, which took effect in October, could have had a greater impact on subscription growth than previously thought, he said.Moreover, Mr Power noted that Netflix’s international subscriber growth could beat forecasts but that the expectation was largely priced in. Netflix shares advanced more than 130 per cent last year.Shares in Tesla were also on the back foot after the electric carmaker reported fourth-quarter total vehicle deliveries at the low end of its guidance range.Its shares fell 6.92 per cent to $223.41 after the Palo Alto-based company said it delivered 17,400 cars in the last quarter, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sunday. This compared with its previous outlook for 17,000 to 19,000 deliveries.The company also said it delivered just 208 of its Model X sport utility vehicle, which launched with a two-year delay in September. Tesla noted that it was prioritising “quality above all else”.The fourth-quarter figures brought its 2015 deliveries to 50,580, the low end of its guidance. However, analysts noted that the automaker had lowered its outlook through the year.Chinese equities plunged on Monday amid concerns about the health of its economy, prompting Beijing to use its circuit breaker rule. That set the tone for global markets. .US-listed shares in Chinese companies were punished, with shares in ecommerce site Alibaba down 5.64 per cent to $76.69.Shares in Baidu, a search engine group, fell 2.65 per cent to $184.03 while shares in Cheetah Mobile fell 2.87 per cent to $15.56.The sell-off in Chinese stocks also weighed on shares of Macau casino operators, though their shares had recovered most of their losses by the close. Wynn Resorts was down 0.61 per cent at $68.77, Las Vegas Sands was down 1 per cent to $43.40, and Melco Crown Entertainment was off 0.77 per cent to $16.67.All 10 big sectors on the benchmark S&P 500 were in the red. The S&P 500 was down 1.53 per cent to 2,012.66, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.58 per cent lower at 17,148.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was off by 2.08 per cent to 4,903.09.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
445;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2016-01-04T18:07:06Z;Netflix shares tumble on tough day for US stocks;;On a testing day for US equities, Netflix is having a particularly difficult time thanks to an analyst downgrade and concerns about US subscriber growth.The online streaming site is among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500, falling as much as 8 per cent to $105.21, after the stock was lowered to “neutral” from “outperform” and the price target was cut to $115 from $128 by analysts at Baird.The company now has 23 ‘buy’ ratings, 18 ‘hold’ ratings and 4 ‘sell’ ratings, according to data from Bloomberg.Analysts at Baird said their quarterly US subscriber survey suggested “potentially weaker US subscriber results for the second consecutive quarter”. The survey showed 46 per cent of its 3,000 US respondents were Netflix streaming subscribers in the fourth quarter, compared with 47 per cent the previous quarter. Typically subscriber growth increases in the holiday period.“This appears to point to more flattish Q4’15 US subscriber progress, and, if accurate, potentially raises some questions around the US subscriber growth trajectory,” William Power, an analyst with the firm, said. A $1 price increase, which took effect in October, could have had a greater impact on subscription growth than previously thought, he said.This isn’t the first time that US subscriber growth has been an issue for the site behind hit shows like “Jessica Jones” and “Orange is the New Black” and movies like “Beasts of no Nation”. The company added just 881,000 domestic subscribers in the third quarter against forecasts for 1.19m and the news sent Netflix shares down 11 per cent.For the bulls that point to strength in the overseas market, Mr Power noted that Netflix’s international subscriber growth could beat forecasts but that the expectation was largely priced in.However, it is worth noting that Netflix shares have enjoyed a strong rally — a 130 per cent jump last year — as viewers increasingly choose to “cut the cord” on their cable television subscriptions.
446;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Equities: And then there were nine;Apart from a few stocks, the US markets are in a slump with fears post-crisis rally has run its course;"Had it not been for a small group of nifty companies, 2015 would have entered the history books as a terrible year for the US stock market. As it was, stocks were almost exactly flat, as were bonds and cash, meaning that US bonds and equities had their second-worst collective 12 months since 1995 — outstripped only by the disaster year of 2008.“It’s the world of low numbers,” says Andrew Milligan, chief investment strategist at Standard Life in Edinburgh.Yet there were some very high numbers for a group of four companies that have come to be known as the “Fangs” — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — and for a slightly wider group that added Microsoft, Salesforce, eBay, Starbucks and Priceline to create the “Nifty Nine”. Both groups gained more than 60 per cent for the year.Away from the excitement generated by these hot companies, things were dire. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, where each of the 500 companies receives 0.2 per cent of the index, was down, and underperformed the S&P weighted by market capitalisation.Such a “narrowing” of the market is a classic symptom of a lengthy rally — this one has lasted almost uninterrupted since 2009 — that is coming to an end. Investors run out of ideas and instead pour money into a few companies with a positive story to tell. The underperformance of smaller companies is a sign that investors are growing more cautious.The dominance of the Nifty Nine recalls the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a long bull market petered out into a period dominated by a “Nifty Fifty” of companies such as Xerox.“Technically this feels very bearish,” says Jim Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. “The closest feel is the Nifty Fifty era when much of the market peaked in the late ’60s but the Nifties carried on until 1972.”He said the performance of Amazon, which is revolutionising consumer industries, is particularly distorting, and that of the wider consumer discretionary sector — which was the best performing sector of 2015 — had a “night and day difference” without it.Part of the reason is that profits are in decline, mainly due to the problems falling oil prices have created for energy companies. “We shouldn’t be surprised, because there’s a profits recession, and in profits recessions markets become very Darwinist,” says Richard Bernstein, an investment consultant. That Darwinism means that money flocks to the companies that can show strong revenue growth, such as Netflix — whose profits halved in the third quarter but continues to show subscriber growth — or Amazon. Both saw their share prices more than double, as funds flooded out of companies perceived to be losing out to them and registering disappointing profits, such as Viacom and other mainstream television media groups or Walmart and other retailers.According to Peter Atwater of Financial Insyghts, who analyses market psychology, narrow participation is a symptom of extreme nerves, as last seen during the 1990s internet bubble. Writing before the US Federal Reserve decided to raise rates last month, he pointed out that for 2015, “the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 are up 13.9 per cent while the other 490 are down 5.8 per cent — the largest spread since the late 1990s!”It has also grown more important to pick winners, while there are plenty of losers to choose from. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat says that he had seen Fang-like concentrations in the past, but usually the top and bottom 10 cancel each other out. In 2015, the winners far outperformed the losers.Mr Lee warned that “Fang likely ends with a Dang!” as top movers in one year have a strong tendency to underperform in the next.Valuation trends suggest that the next move is more likely to be downwards. US stocks endured a correction during 2015, dropping more than 10 per cent in August as the Chinese currency revaluation sent tremors through the financial world. But, to quote Mr Paulsen, it was “not a pause that refreshes”.“We did not reset valuations or refresh the profit cycle,” he says. Instead, the S&P 500 had almost regained its highs by the end of October, and US share prices, judged by a multiple of earnings, ended the year as expensive as they began it.Telling indicatorsThe two critical measures that should set the market’s direction are earnings and interest rates. In the third quarter, S&P 500 earnings dropped by 0.8 per cent year on year, and the consensus expectation is that they will be down 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, mostly thanks to energy. Meanwhile, Europe may have hit the bottom of its own profits recession, with earnings for the Stoxx 600 companies falling 5.1 per cent year on year in the third quarter.The renewed fall in the oil price has raised concerns that energy companies will be forced to write down the value of the assets more sharply. Once this damage is done, hopes on Wall Street are high for a rebound from a low base; brokers’ analysts now forecast 7.9 per cent earnings growth for the S&P 500 as a whole in 2016. However, equity strategists and asset allocators, who take a more top-down view, expect these numbers to be marked down considerably as the year continues. Further, earnings tend to move in cycles, and in the US the cycle appears to have turned.As for rates, the Fed has told markets to brace for four more rate rises this year, while the Fed funds futures market is implicitly only pricing in two. All else equal, lower rates would aid share prices. But all else is not equal. Lower rates would imply a sickly US economy, which would hit hopes for earnings.So the great hope that a narrow US market will not tip over into a bear market this year is the US economy. There are few signs of a recession — and without a recession, equity bear markets are usually not severe. Indeed, outside of manufacturing, which is in a global downturn, the economy looks robust. The hope is that services will start to benefit as US consumers at last begin to spend the money they have saved on oil.“Profit margins are not going any higher, and rates aren’t going any lower, and there’s a lot of things used up,” says Mr Paulsen, whose best guess is that another flat year is in the offing. “But it’s hard to see a recession.”Excitement around a few big new-economy stocks was intense during 2015. Netflix and Amazon both more than doubled, while Facebook and the Google companies also enjoyed a great year. Put these stocks (known as the Fangs for their initials) together with Ebay, Priceline, Salesforce, Microsoft and Starbucks, to create a “Nifty Nine” and they beat the rest of the US market by more than 60 per cent.That is worrying. Dominance by a few big companies – or a “narrowing” market – is a symptom of the end of a bull run, as it was in the early 1970s (dominated by the “Nifty Fifty”) or the late 1990s (dominated by the dot-coms). The biggest 50 companies rose last year, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell, showing concerns about the economy, while an equal-weighted version of the S&P also fell. Most stocks were down, and interest is restricted to a few.S&P 500 companies saw earnings decline slightly in 2015. This was in large part due to falling revenues at energy companies, driven by falling oil prices. But the strong dollar, which hit overseas earnings, was a factor. So was declining margins, as wages started a slight recovery. Both earnings and margins tend to by cyclical, implying both could have further to fall. Meanwhile, earnings in Europe fell by even more, raising hopes that European companies have reached the bottom of the profits cycle.Valuing stocks is and will always remain an imprecise science. Many Wall Street analysts now make technical criticisms of Prof Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings multiple, which compares to prices to average earnings over the previous decade. But a simple multiple of the previous twelve months’ earnings, which is much noisier and leapt to extremes during the earnings recession of 2009 when investors universally assumed that earnings would recover, gives a similar conclusion. Prices are not extreme, but clearly look expensive by historical standards.The US stock market has vastly outperformed the rest of the world (including both developed and emerging markets) since the 2008 crisis. Lenient monetary policy helped this, as did the strength of the US economy, while the strong dollar amplified the outperformance. But the strong dollar should hit US companies’ overseas earnings, while strengthening the rest of the world, and other central banks are now aggressively easing monetary policy while the US Federal Reserve has just started to raise rates.2015 was dominated by speculation over when the Fed would raise rates. There is every reason to expect this to continue. This chart shows the “dots” issued by the Fed, in which each dot represents the prediction of a different Fed governor for where target rates will be at the end of 2016. The median forecast is for four rises of 0.25 percentage points. The market expectation, derived from the Fed Funds futures market, is for two rises. This gap will have to be reconciled during 2016.This article was updated on January 4 to correct yearly references in the information on the first chart, and on the X axis of the fourth chart"
447;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Week ahead: Corporate review US;Amazon revenues set to be a fifth higher than last year’s record, with focus on cloud unit;By almost any measure 2015 was a bumper year for Amazon, the online retailer.The share price has more than doubled and analysts expect this year’s revenues to be a fifth higher than 2015’s record, even in the face of a strong dollar.Soaring retail sales are not the only reason for the Seattle-based group’s success. A subtle but equally important shift has been the decision to break out its cloud computing business as a separate unit in financial results.When the tight-lipped company lifted the veil on Amazon Web Services in April, analysts were surprised by its margins. It has been the group’s most profitable segment this year by operating income.Many in the finance community are salivating over the idea that AWS could become a separate listed entity, given its profits and its fast growth.But a closer look shows that its apparent profitability stems largely from its decision to lease, rather than buy, much of its equipment. Depreciation expenses are set to soar, and the paper profits will be hard to maintain.Brian Pitz of Jefferies expects Amazon’s growth to continue this year, as its retail operations benefit from sizeable investments in warehouses and logistics.“They are taking share of new categories because of their ability to service customers faster than everyone else,” he said.“They’ve created such a moat, no one will be able to catch up.” Leslie HookThere is not a whole lot of loving going on at Whole Foods. Shares of the US supermarket, much of whose goods are labelled organic, dropped by a third in the year just ended, while the S&P 500 has risen 0.7 per cent.Several factors have served to upend Whole Foods. Amid growing concerns over its prices, there has been stiffer competition, particularly given that many mainstream supermarkets such as Kroger have built a strong offering of organic produce, while Walmart has also expanded in this area.According to Neil Saunders, an analyst at the Conlumino research group, other problems include the experience of shopping at a Whole Foods, which critics say in New York is not inviting.And with its focus on the high end — the store has been dubbed “Whole Paycheck” because of its high prices — Whole Foods may be paying too much attention to impressing with new stores instead of keeping existing ones up to scratch.“A combination of falling margins and slowing sales growth presents a long-term danger to profitability,” said Mr Saunders.“The whole purpose of reducing prices should be to attract and keep more customers, with a consequent uplift to the sales line. However, at present this dynamic is not working as effectively as it should.”For 2016 investors will be closely watching to see the extent to which Whole Foods can balance margins and customer traffic.Last month’s $1bn repurchase programme has not revived demand for the shares. Lindsay WhippEvery winning streak comes to an end. This year, after betting heavily on its business in Macau, Wynn Resorts’ luck ran out abruptly.In the nine months to September 2014, the gaming company earned more than $3bn in revenues from its casinos in Macau, compared with just $1.2bn from its business in Las Vegas.But last year, after the Chinese government made it clear that it was no longer acceptable for officials and executives to gamble in Macau, takings at casinos dropped 35 per cent.Revenues at Wynn’s Macau arm declined to $1.9bn in the year to September. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were 46 per cent lower at $548m.Wynn has postponed the opening of a $4.1bn resort by three months and Steve Wynn, the casino mogul, has criticised Macau for what he calls its “preposterous” policy of limiting how many gambling tables he can have in the new joint.After the shares more than halved from $139 to $65, Mr Wynn bought a million shares. The move was meant to reassure investors after the dramatic price fall but had little effect.November was the 18th consecutive month of shrinking casino revenues in Macau, and casino operators are still doubling down: between them they have committed to almost $27bn in new developments.The plan is to make the switch, as Las Vegas has done, to a family-friendly entertainment hub. But it may be a long time before the transformation kicks in and lady luck shines on Wynn Resorts again. Malcolm MoorePerhaps more than any other company, Netflix has changed the way people watch television.The streaming service has produced its own programming and bought the rights to other producers’ shows and movies, making them available on demand for a set monthly price that is much lower than a standard subscription for cable or satellite services.Its impact, in the US in particular, has been profound. With Netflix and other companies offering on-demand viewing, many viewers are “cutting the cord”, shunning the pricey bundle of channels offered with a cable or satellite subscription in favour of cheaper online alternatives.Fear gripped the media sector this year as evidence grew that cord-cutting was hurting audience ratings and advertising revenues.Netflix was not affected: its shares rose more than 140 per cent over the year. With a market capitalisation of close to $50bn it is worth more than CBS and Viacom combined.Whether the group can sustain subscriber growth and deliver profits that justify its lofty valuation is another matter. Still, on-demand, digital-based viewing is the future of television and Netflix is well placed to benefit. Matthew GarrahanFor Chesapeake Energy last year provided a textbook case of the consequences for a highly leveraged company of steep falls in the price of its principal product.Chesapeake is the second-largest natural gas producer in the US, surpassed only by ExxonMobil, and the slump in US gas prices sent its shares down about 80 per cent.After the departure in 2013 of Aubrey McClendon, the risk-taking entrepreneur who built the company, Chesapeake seemed to be heading in the right direction.It stabilised its finances in October 2014 with a $5.4bn sale of some gasfields to Southwestern Energy at what was described as a “blowout” price.But borrowings built up during its period of rapid growth under Mr McClendon remained high, and net debt was about $10bn at the end of September.As the price of US benchmark Henry Hub gas dropped from more than $3 per million British thermal units at the end of 2014 to below $2 at the end of 2015, earnings were squeezed. Weaker prices for oil and natural gas liquid compounded the problem. Chesapeake reported an underlying net loss of $83m for the third quarter.The energy group has been cutting costs and capital spending to shore up its cash position, but Chesapeake’s future will be shaped by the prices of gas and oil.

Beyond the modest headline change, investors experienced significant swings in major areas that comprise the world’s largest equity market.“The underlying sectors have moved a heck of a lot — the index to some degree hides it,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.The year’s performance largely reflected big losses among energy, materials and utilities stocks versus the robust performance of a select number of technology companies. Leading the market in 2015 were the “Fangs”— Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — and the “nifty nine” which adds Priceline, eBay, Starbucks, Microsoft and Salesforce.Energy stocks suffered as the price of crude oil dropped more than a third in 2015 and ended the year near the lows at under $40 a barrel. The energy subset of the S&P 500 fell 24 per cent as earnings slumped.“The market ended basically flat even though the energy sector had a dramatically low price performance,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex.Mr Colas said performance this year came down to whether investors opted to own three or four individual stocks — namely the Fangs. “If you made a decision early in the year not to buy them, you underperformed and if you did buy them, you outperformed,” he said.A narrow leadership group reflected investor anxiety over a lack of earnings and falling revenues. Analysts estimate that S&P 500 earnings will decline 4.7 per cent for the final quarter of 2015 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to FactSet. That leaves the index on course for three consecutive quarters of year-over-year earnings declines, a performance not seen since 2009.Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said the strongest performers in 2015 were companies that managed to boost sales, such as the Fangs. He said investors had grown tired of the financial engineering, particularly share buybacks, that have buoyed earnings but done far less to bolster actual income or revenues.“I want to see revenue because it is really one of the only accounting items that can’t be manufactured. If a company has organic revenue growth, everything else will fall into place,” said Mr Ablin.Consumer discretionary stocks were the top performer, up 8.4 per cent, boosted by Amazon and Netflix, which rose 118 and 134 per cent respectively. With a 4.3 per cent rise, the information technology group was third, with components such as Google, Facebook and salesforce.com driving gains.At 5.2 per cent, healthcare was the second best performing sector amid a wave of M&A megadeals. Looking ahead, though, some market participants were wary of the rally given the upcoming year for presidential elections.“Of all the sectors, healthcare may have the biggest question mark around it,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “More than any other, it is influenced by the political climate.”Financials closed 2015 down 3.5 per cent in spite of the long-awaited start of a tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve. Banks are a beneficiary of rising rates since they can charge more on the money they lend versus what they pay on the deposits they hold.The first rate hike in December arrived after the central bank delayed tightening policy in September and investors may have experienced some fatigue in the interim.“For us to really go higher — to threaten 2,200, we will need financials to be one of the leaders,” said Mr Kinahan.

Japan’s Nikkei is up 9.1 per cent and, thanks to a stable yen, is also 8.5 per cent higher in dollar terms on the year.Europe’s benchmarks did well this year in local currency terms, with Italy’s FTSE MIB up 12.7 per cent, but only higher by 1.1 per cent in US dollar terms given the euro’s weakness. The commodity rout hammered London’s FTSE 100, down 4.9 per cent on the year. Anglo American fell 75 per cent and Glencore dropped 70 per cent. In contrast, the domestically focused FTSE 250 is up 8.4 per cent.In the US, the S&P 500 declined 0.7 per cent for the year, its worst showing since the financial crisis in 2008 when it dropped by nearly 40 per cent. The broad benchmark’s total return was 1.4 per cent.The S&P was weighed down by significant falls in the oil and materials sectors, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 6 per cent, bolstered by the ‘Fangs’— Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google; and the ‘nifty nine’, which adds Priceline, eBay, Starbucks, Microsoft and Salesforce. This group of fast-growing technology and consumer companies have largely kept the long-running US equity bull market from reversing during 2015.Video streaming website Netflix has surged 134 per cent to lead the Fangs as its subscriber base has continued growing at a swift clip. Facebook is up 34 per cent, while Amazon has gained 118 per cent and closed at a record high of $693.97 on Tuesday. Google has risen by 45 per cent.CurrenciesBrazil’s real stands out as a big decliner, down 33.1 per cent against the dollar, hurt by a weakening economy and political risk as the Petrobras corruption scandal snowballed.In a year of US dollar strength, buoyed by the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy for the first time in nearly a decade, the dollar index has risen 9 per cent. Mirroring that performance, the euro has eased some 10 per cent, falling from $1.21 to about $1.09.Sovereign DebtUkrainian, Russian and Greek government bonds offered some of the best returns this year. Ukraine and Greece came within a whisker of defaulting, and the prices of their bonds plummeted amid fraught negotiations with their creditors. But when they finally struck deals, their bonds rocketed and racked up hefty returns for those brave enough to be holding them.Among major countries, the Barclays US Treasury index had registered a total return for the year of 0.84 per cent. The bank’s long-dated Treasury index was down 1.2 per cent. For the eurozone, Barclay’s Euro Aggregate index of Italian issuers has a total return of 4.5 per cent for the year, while the Euro Agg Treasury index is up 1.7 per cent.Barclays Sterling Aggregate index has gained 0.5 per cent.Corporate BondsUS corporate high-yield bonds lost 4.5 per cent, according to the Barclays index, while European junk registered a total return of 2.9 per cent in 2015. For investment grade, US long-dated corporate credit slid 4.6 per cent. One notable standout in fixed income for the year was US municipal debt, which climbed 3.3 per cent, according to Barclays.CommoditiesSlowing demand from China and supply gluts hit the sector hard in 2015 with oil sliding more than a third. Brent crude tumbled 35 per cent over the year from $57.33 to below $37.28 a barrel on Thursday. Spot gold dropped 10 per cent, with copper falling by a quarter.The Bloomberg Commodity Index, based on the value of 22 different futures contracts, has fallen 25 per cent in 2015, and is headed for the worst of five straight years of declines."
450;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-12-23T18:37:18Z;US media companies hit by viewer switch to online services;Majority of cable channels lost viewers hitting media shares in 2015;A great switch-off is under way on US primetime television with a majority of cable channels losing viewers in 2015, a trend that is reshaping the media landscape and rattling investors.Audience data compiled by Nielsen, the research firm, show that 26 of the top 35 cable channels attracted lower average primetime audiences in 2015 compared with 2014. ESPN, Bravo, Comedy Central and MTV were among those hit.“This is a multiyear issue and is leading to lower industry advertising growth,” said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson. “A business that had been growing in advertising is now struggling.”Lower audience ratings and fears about “ cord-cutting” — the cancellation of cable and satellite television subscriptions — hit US media shares in 2015 with the S&P 500 Media Index falling 5.5 per cent, far more than the broader market, which was flat for the year.Walt Disney, which recently released Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and AMC Networks, home of The Walking Dead series, are the only media companies to end the year with their shares up on 2014. Disney sparked a sell-off in media stocks this summer when it warned that subscriber growth at its ESPN network had slowed. The channel lost an estimated 3m subscribers in the year to August, said Nielsen.Lower average audience ratings for cable networks are indicative of a big shift in viewing habits. Audiences are increasingly using on-demand streaming services, such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, rather than tuning in to watch live television. “The world is moving to on-demand viewing,” Mr Nathanson said.The Nielsen data include viewings of programmes on digital video recorders up to seven days after their air date. But the ratings do not include views of shows on online services, which has been a point of contention with media chief executives, such as Viacom’s Philippe Dauman.Nielsen will launch a new measurement system in 2016 that aims to include viewing on alternative services and devices.Among the few networks to attract larger average primetime audiences were cable news channels Fox News and CNN. Both benefited this year from the Donald Trump effect, with Republican primary debates setting ratings records for non-sport cable programmes.Mr Trump’s appearance at the first Republican primary debate propelled Fox to attract four times the viewers that tuned in to watch GOP primary debates in the 2012 election.Ratings for the Republican debates have held up since then, with CNN, CNBC and Fox Business Channel achieving record ratings for the debates they have aired.Mr Trump recently asked for a $5m payment from CNN in return for participating in its December debate. The network refused to pay and Mr Trump appeared as scheduled.
451;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-12-18T17:42:38Z;Walt Disney: Force is still strong;All empires have weaknesses, but the entertainment group is far from finished;Weakened empires sometimes retain dangerous weapons. This is one point to take from the Star Wars films. It applies to Walt Disney, which in 2012 bought LucasFilms, the franchise’s creator, for $4bn.In an entertainment galaxy not so far away, Disney is the empire: powerful, ruthless but vulnerable to attack from a group of determined rebels, led by Netflix and Amazon.Disney’s once impregnable Death Star is ESPN. The cable sports network has commanded the highest fees from subscribers and advertisers. But the first signs of weakness have appeared: subscriber numbers have dropped 7 per cent in the past two years. Last summer ESPN warned that profit growth was slowing.The empire is under assault from streaming services but also confronts a fresh assault from pay-TV providers: the “skinny bundle”, which includes just a handful of channels. Often excluding ESPN, they can cost a fraction of the traditional package.Disney still has lines of defence. The seventh Star Wars film debuts this weekend and could gross $2bn in worldwide box-office receipts. Such “tent pole” franchises (so called because they can support an entire entertainment constellation) come with revenue opportunities for toys, video games and theme park rides. Morgan Stanley estimates that, all told, this picture alone could be worth $1.3bn in operating profit.A stellar sum, yet less than a tenth of Disney’s total operating profit of about $15bn. Star Wars Episode VII, set to be a blockbuster, still only replaces or just surpasses Frozen and other hits.Disney’s stature allow its shares to trade at significant premiums to those of 21st Century Fox and Time Warner. Despite a peppering from rebel forces, they are up a fifth this year. And its Death Star remains formidable, still growing and generating half the empire’s profits.

452;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-12-10T17:38:56Z;Atlassian shares surge on Nasdaq debut;Australian software company scores rare success in US listings market;"Australian software company Atlassian soared on its debut on Thursday, emerging as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy IPO market this year.The company’s stock jumped as much as a third to $28, giving it a market capitalisation of nearly $6bn. The first-day rally came even after Atlassian priced its shares above expectations.The offering follows what has been a tough year for US-listed IPOs, including technology share issues, as market volatility has stymied investors and hot tech start-ups have been drawn to lofty valuations on offer in private funding transactions.Atlassian was the first US tech IPO to price above the range since July, according to Renaissance Capital, before global stock markets fell amid concerns about the health of China’s economy and the potential ripple effects of a slowdown across the globe.Most companies have instead had to offer discounts to lure investors wary of declines in the after-market. On average, investors have lost 3.6 per cent buying US IPOs in 2015 and 1.4 per cent buying into tech companies.Atlassian, which has Facebook, Nasa and Netflix among its customers, priced 22m shares at $21 a piece late on Wednesday, raising $462m.That was above the indicated range of $19 to $20, which the company already had lifted earlier this week from a range of $16.50 to $18.50. It also increased the number of shares on sale by 10 per cent.Matthew Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, attributed Atlassian’s success to the particular strengths of the company, which sells enterprise software including a messaging service, project management tools and a document-sharing service.“It is the type of tech company that can go public in any market,” Mr Kennedy said. “The combination of growth and profitability make it a standout IPO.”Atlassian contrasts with other tech companies such as Square, the payments start-up headed by Jack Dorsey that went public earlier this year.Square had earned a high valuation in its last fundraising round as a private company, and attracted a negative reaction when it was forced to price its stock at a substantial discount and issue more shares to compensate its private investors.Atlassian, by comparison, has never raised money from outside equity investors; its venture-capital backers bought shares from employees. The company also has an extended history of profits from its business of selling collaboration tools, with software developers as a core market.Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were lead underwriters."
453;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

It also boosted the number of shares on sale by 10 per cent.The well-received deal caps what has been a tough year for US-listed IPOs including tech offerings, as financial volatility pressured the market and hot tech startups were drawn to lofty valuations on offer in private funding transactions.Atlassian is the first US tech IPO to price above the range since July, according to Rennaissance Capital, before global stock markets fell amid concerns about the health of China’s economy and the potential ripple effects of a slowdown there across the globe.Most companies have instead had to offer discounts to lure investors wary of declines in the aftermarket. On average, investors have lost 3.6 per cent buying US IPOs in 2015 and 1.4 per cent buying tech deals.“The six tech IPOs of 2015 that priced above the range averaged a first-day pop of 36 per cent,” said Matthew Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, which specialises in IPO research and investment. “Unless something goes awry, (it) looks like 2015 will end with a bright spot for tech IPOs.”
455;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-12-06T20:03:23Z;Networks battle to control best TV shows;Established broadcasters are having to adapt quickly to the world of online competitors;People in the media industry are bored with hearing about the “death of television” — a prediction of a doom-laden event that has so far failed to take place. Despite this, broadcasters and pay-TV platforms are having to adapt rapidly to tackle digital upstarts.Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video — which between them have more than 4m subscribers in the UK, according to estimates — do not compete for advertising spending. However, there is not much evidence to date that British consumers are choosing them over more expensive pay-TV packages from Sky, to which 12m households subscribe to directly or via Now TV, Sky’s low-cost streaming serviceInstead, the newcomers’ challenge to broadcasters is less direct. It is forcing broadcasters to think about how to keep hold of the best content and to distribute it effectively. “If you’re a content creator and a broadcaster, it’s both an opportunity and a threat,” says Richard Broughton, research director at Ampere Analysis, a data collection and forecasting specialist.The opportunity is that Netflix and Amazon are willing to pay for older shows, providing welcome commercial revenue to those, such as the BBC, with an extensive back catalogue.But that leads straight to a threat: Netflix and Amazon are also willing to pay for new shows, outbidding the traditional broadcasters. The BBC says that it was beaten by Netflix for the rights to The Crown, a six-series drama about the life of Queen Elizabeth II.“We just couldn’t compete with the money,” said Danny Cohen, the BBC’s director of television at the time.This has contributed to programming inflation as the cost of the rights to the best show have risen by between 30 and 50 per cent in the past few years, says Darren Childs, chief executive of UKTV, owner of channels such as Dave.Partly as a result, broadcasters are investing more in their own programmes. UKTV, previously best known for airing BBC reruns, now produces shows such as Storage Hunters UK and Monty Python Live (Mostly).ITV, the UK’s biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, has acquired 12 production companies since 2012, including the makers of Real Housewives of New Jersey, The Voice and Poldark, at an expected cost of about £750m. About 60 per cent of programmes on its main channels are now made in-house, up from less than half in 2009.Anke Schäferkordt, co-chief executive of European broadcaster RTL, said in a recent interview that on the company’s two main German channels the proportion of original commissions was “shifting from over 80 per towards 90 per cent”. “I have no doubts that this will give us a huge competitive advantage over the next few years,” she added.In order to rival Netflix and Amazon’s global scale, broadcasters are also looking for co-production deals, which allow costs to spread across more than one company. The BBC’s The Honourable Woman was made with the US network AMC’s Sundance TV. Sky’s The Last Panthers is made with French pay-TV broadcaster Canal Plus.When should a broadcaster make shows available to Netflix and Amazon?Last year Sky also bought its German and Italian pay TV sister companies from 21st Century Fox, partly to give it greater strength in the content market. In the long term, many analysts expect streaming platforms to try to buy sports and entertainment rights on a global or regional basis.Media businesses with an international reach will have a powerful advantage. For the moment, however, there are some programmes that only traditional broadcasters can make.The BBC and ITV have produced more “live” programmes — such as episodes of soap operas EastEnders and Coronation Street, broadcast in real-time like theatrical performances — to keep viewers tuning in. The dilemma for broadcasters is if and when to make shows available to Netflix and Amazon. Some are holding back works for longer, says Mr Broughton of Ampere Analysis.UKTV has not sold programmes to Netflix, which does not prominently display the branding of the individual producers on shows it broadcasts. However, it has launched a UKTV app for Amazon’s Kindle Fire TV.“If you’re going to invest heavily in content, it has to be [aired] with your own brand,” says Mr Childs. “That’s where a lot of the battles are.”Broadcasters are rethinking how their content is delivered to audiences. ITV offers a premium player for £3.99 a month — where shows are available without ads, as they would be on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Sky has taken on Netflix directly by launching its own Now TV service in 2013, which allows viewers to access its best programmes and channels for £6.99 a month.Sky has not, however, reached a deal to offer Netflix as part of a subscription package it offers. Nor will the Netflix app be available on Sky’s set-top box, Sky Q, which goes on sale in early 2016.“From a long-term strategic perspective, they’re very keen not to encourage the success of a company that could become a competitor,” says Ampere Analysis’s Mr Broughton.Intriguingly, however, Sky Q does allow viewers to access YouTube, including Whistle Sports, a youth-focused YouTube channel in which Sky invested $7m last year. This careful positioning of content emphasises the nuanced approach that the new environment requires.“Sky would view YouTube as the evolution of free-to-air broadcasting,” says Mr Broughton. “[YouTube] isn’t premium content.”
456;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-11-29T14:38:30Z;Hulu in spotlight as expansion beckons;With viewership up 85%, a sleeping giant in streaming may be preparing to make its move;This has been the year of streaming television. Broadcast channels, cable networks and technology companies are all making the leap into a future where TV refers not to a box in the living room, but to any kind of video delivered over the internet to the screen of the consumer’s choosing.Netflix and Amazon dominate the race to capture consumers’ attention and entertainment budgets, first building big audiences at home in the US and more recently pushing into Europe and Asia.But a sleeping giant may be getting ready to wake up and make its move. Hulu, the digital video service jointly owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast, has been splashing cash on top-quality content including the hit Fox drama Empire and Seinfeld, the classic US sitcom.Viewership is up 85 per cent and subscriptions have risen 60 per cent from a year ago, Fox told shareholders on its third-quarter earnings call. Hulu announced in April it had reached 9m subscribers. The lossmaking company, however, is still being outspent by Netflix, which has 43m US members, and Amazon, which gives its estimated 40m Prime members access to its instant video offering for no additional charge.Now one of Hulu’s owners is talking openly about international expansion — an area from which the service has previously shied away.“Today it’s a very relevant part of the landscape for customers in the US,” said James Murdoch, Fox chief executive, at the Paley Center for Media’s International Council Summit earlier this month. “I think in a number of years we have decisions to make around, do we take it to other countries? Probably more likely than not if it continues to be successful here.”Mike Hopkins, Hulu chief executive, says the company is looking at international opportunities but has no specific plans. “If you look at adoption and broadband penetrations around the world, it’s compelling and something we will take a look at,” he told an industry conference in October.Since taking over executive duties from his father Rupert Murdoch in July, the younger Mr Murdoch has been outspoken about the continuing strength of the TV industry while also calling for better advertising and a re-evaluation of Netflix’s dominance in streaming. He said Fox is licensing more content to Hulu as “the business rules are changing and our thinking is evolving”.Whether Hulu will be able to accelerate its growth and swing from loss to profit depends on whether its trio of owners have the stomach for an investment plan that risks cannibalising their lucrative relationships with cable and satellite companies.Fees to carry their channels in pay-TV packages make up a significant proportion of media owners’ revenues. They also derive millions of dollars in advertising sales from traditional television.Both of those revenue streams will come under pressure if more consumers opt to “cut the cord”, trading pricey cable bundles for streaming options such as Netflix, Time Warner’s HBO Now— and Hulu.Netflix has so far borne the brunt of the industry’s anxieties over cord cutting, with media owners asking if they are getting fair value in return for licensing their content to streaming platforms. In addition to Mr Murdoch suggesting his company might reconsider its deals with Netflix, Jeff Bewkes of Time Warner and David Zaslav of Discovery Communications have also questioned whether the streaming company is friend or foe.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, has responded that Hulu presents a bigger risk, because it allows viewers to watch episodes of network shows without commercials the day after they air on traditional TV.“Hulu is even more of a cord-cutter’s dream than Netflix is,” he said on the company’s most recent earnings call.Analysts agree, especially in light of reports that Hulu has approached Time Warner to become an investor and bring more of its programmes on to the service.“If Hulu does become a stronger service, we think it only increases pressure on cord-cutting and advertising,” says Todd Juenger of Bernstein Research. “It’s one thing if potential cord-cutters are considering giving up the pay-TV bundle and having Netflix as their primary alternative. It’s different if they have Netflix and a stronger Hulu.”The question of Hulu’s owners’ willingness to unleash the streaming company’s potential is not a new one. The service was launched in 2008 as a joint project of NBCUniversal, now owned by Comcast, and News Corp, then owner of Fox, with Disney taking a stake in 2009. The parent companies have long been seen as unwilling to invest robustly and have put Hulu up for sale more than once.In 2013, it drew interest from bidders including AT&T and the Chernin Group, whose chairman, Peter Chernin, was involved in Hulu’s early development when he was News Corp’s chief operating officer. But Hulu’s parents abandoned the sale and promised a $750m infusion instead.Since then, Hulu has hired more than 300 employees, ramped up marketing, signed advertising partnerships to improve targeting and boosted its content budget.It outbid Netflix for exclusive rights to Empire, beat Amazon and Yahoo to secure Seinfeld and inked a multiyear deal with Epix, an entertainment network, for movies including the Hunger Games franchise and Transformers: Age of Extinction.It has picked up original shows, including the cancelled Fox sitcom The Mindy Project.It has also signed agreements to make Hulu available through cable operators’ set-top boxes and partnered with Showtime to offer the premium network’s online service at a discounted rate to Hulu subscribers.But rising costs have led to Hulu’s owners anticipating that losses will accelerate. Disney said the equity loss from its stake dragged down operating income at its broadcast division in the third quarter.The question is, when are the partners going to put in a substantial amount of capital to fund long-term US expansion as well as international expansion?“The question is, when are the partners going to put in a substantial amount of capital to fund long-term US expansion as well as international expansion?” says Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research. “Hulu needs to make money — $750m was fine but now they need $1.5bn.”Hulu has tried for international growth in the past. The company launched a service in Japan in 2011 but sold the business three years later to Nippon TV as it focused on the US.Barriers to international expansion are plentiful. Hulu would have to navigate a complicated array of rights agreements and territorial sales and some of the shows it offers in the US — including those owned by its parent companies — might have been sold to other providers overseas. Disney recently announced plans for its own streaming service in Europe.In the US, Hulu may also find itself increasingly in competition with its owners. Variety has reported that Disney-owned ABC is developing original shows for its own streaming platform — not Hulu. NBC has announced a subscription video service focused on comedy that will show both original and licensed content.“There is room for more than one successful global streaming player,” Mr Greenfield says. “They want somebody to foot the bill.”If Hulu does make an international move, it faces an increasingly active landscape of competitors. US rival Netflix is in the midst of a push to reach 200 markets, including China and India, by the end of next year. But local operators are also getting in on the streaming game.Sky, the pay-television broadcaster, has launched digital service in the UK with plans to expand to other markets.Other rivals include Wuaki.tv, the service owned by Japanese technology group Rakuten, which is active in markets including Germany, Spain, Italy and the UK, and Vivendi’s Canal Plus, which has Canalplay in France.Southeast Asian telecoms groups and entrepreneurs are partnering with Hollywood investors including Warner Brothers and Sony to offer mobile video subscriptions in countries including Malaysia and the Philippines.In India, Rupert Murdoch’s Star TV and Bollywood studio Eros International are racing to head off Netflix— although Eros has seen its share price collapse on worries over financial irregularities and growth rates.Emerging markets may be particularly tough to crack due to high levels of piracy, unreliable internet connections and inconsistent payment systems. China and India both restrict foreign media ownership and investment.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareilTwitter: @FTMedia
457;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-11-27T17:47:25Z;ESPN cord-cutting punishes Disney shares;Financials led the way during November as investors anticipated US policy tightening;On a quiet Friday in US markets, Walt Disney shares were on the move after the company disclosed it lost 3m ESPN subscribers in a year.Disney said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Wednesday that ESPN — which charges premium fees for its live sports coverage and supports cable’s traditional business model — had 92m subscribers at the end of its fiscal year in October, compared with 95m in the year ago period.Shares in Disney fell 3 per cent to $115.13 on the news.US stock markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.The loss of subscribers appeared to renew fears that viewers were choosing to “cut the cord” as competition from online streaming sites such as Netflix and Hulu grew and pushed the S&P 500 media industry index 1 per cent lower.Viacom shares fell 2.3 per cent to $51.16, News Corp shares declined 1.6 per cent to $14.37 and 21st Century Fox shares slid 1.2 per cent to $29.54.US stocks, which fluctuated between modest gains and losses following a sell-off in China, were mixed at the end of an abbreviated trading day.The S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,090.11, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.1 per cent to 17,798.49 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2 per cent to 5,127.52.Meanwhile, interest rate sensitivity proved to be a key theme in the US stock market this month as expectations that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy in December held sway over the financial and utilities sectors.Federal funds futures imply that there is a 74 per cent chance that the US central bank will raise interest rates for the first time in nine years at its December meeting, according to Bloomberg data.The Fed first made overt reference to the possibility of a rate rise at its October meeting. The minutes of that meeting, released last week, showed that most members on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee think conditions for a rise in interest rates “could well be met” by December.Those expectations delivered a shot in the arm to shares in lenders because higher rates allow banks to charge borrowers more for loans than they pay for deposits, which in turn helps drive their margins. Moreover, rising interest rates are a sign that the US economy is gaining momentum, bolstering demand for credit.The financials index has led the main S&P 500 sectors during November and, with one trading day remaining, stands 2 per cent higher for the month.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 utilities index has lagged behind the S&P 500 and other main sectors, declining 2.9 per cent in November. Dividend-paying utilities have benefited in a low interest rate environment as investors piled into the sector in search of higher fixed income than bonds.But focus is shifting from the timing of the first rate rise to the pace of monetary tightening, with the Fed seen taking a wait-and-see approach. Such a path could limit the upside to financial stocks. mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
458;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Cost cuts bolster Deere’s earnings;Broad market nearly unchanged ahead of Thanksgiving Day;Deere shares were lifted on Wednesday as cost cuts helped the world’s largest maker of agricultural equipment post better than expected fourth-quarter earnings.The Moline, Illinois-based company reported profits of $351m, or $1.08 a share, in the three months ended in October. This topped Wall Street expectations for earnings of 73 cents a share, but was down 46 per cent from a year ago.However, weakness in the construction equipment market and the global agricultural sector pushed equipment sales 26 per cent lower to $5.9bn, shy of analysts’ estimates for $6.1bn. Total revenue declined 25 per cent to $6.7bn.Bumper harvests have weighed on grain prices and the Department of Agricultural said this week that US net farm income was forecast to decline 38 per cent in 2015. That in turn has hurt demand for agricultural equipment.Deere warned that global sales of agriculture and turf equipment, its largest division, were forecast to decrease by about 8 per cent in fiscal 2016.Construction and forestry equipment sales, its second-largest division, are expected to declined 5 per cent in 2016.The outlook also reflects the sting from currency translation as many of Deere’s key international markets have seen their currencies weakened, while the US dollar has strengthened.For the year, the company projects earnings of $1.4bn, modestly ahead of forecasts.“[The] stock could trade up on short covering due to solid cost control, but guidance for 2016 suggests end market and earnings declines are continuing,” said Stephen Volkmann, an analyst at Jefferies.Deere shares, which have declined nearly 10 per cent this year, climbed 4.8 per cent to $80.Shares in Hormel Foods gained 3.1 per cent to $73.55, after the maker of Spam, Muscle Milk and Jennie-O turkeys said its board had authorised a two-for-one stock split. The news arrived a day after the Minnesota-based company forecast stronger than expected 2016 earnings.Hormel is the latest company electing to split its shares, a decision that often bolsters investor interest in buying shares due to the reduction in price. Earlier this year Nike, Kroger and Netflix, announced their own stock splits.HP Inc was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500 falling 13.6 per cent to $12.65, after the maker of PCs and printers issued disappointing first-quarter guidance.Hewlett-Packard separated into two companies in October. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, the IT operations company, also issued disappointing earnings outlook, but shares climbed 3.1 per cent to $14.12.Guess shares jumped more than 6.8 per cent to $20.86, after the retailer reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ expectations.The Los Angeles-based company said profits slid 40 per cent to $12.4m, or 15 cents a share, however this was better than the 11 cents that analysts had forecast. Sales slid nearly 12 per cent to $521m.Guess lifted the lower end of its earnings outlook and now sees full-year earnings in the range of 93 cents to $1.02 a share, compared with estimates for 96 cents.US stocks inched higher and healthcare stocks led the benchmark S&P 500, rising 0.5 per cent.At close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were nearly unchanged at 2,088.87 and 17,813.39 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent higher at 5,116.14. US markets will be closed on Thursday in observance of Thanksgiving Day.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
459;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-11-25T18:11:58Z;Amazon’s Nazi-style advertising gimmick backfires in New York;Adverts on subway highlight streaming services’ riskier efforts to promote content;"It must have seemed like a good idea to somebody.Amazon has come under fire after plastering Nazi-type imagery over a subway train in New York.It was the second mis-step in the marketing for The Man in the High Castle, Amazon’s big budget drama, which imagines the world if the Axis powers had won the second world war.A fortnight ago, The Guardian newspaper in the UK had to pulp 300,000 of copies of its listings magazine, The Guide, after senior editors realised too late that a cover image about the show, headlined “The Reich Stuff”, could be offensive.The badly received publicity moves are a lesson to marketers and magazine designers. But they also illustrate the intense battle for audience eyeballs in the television industry: with streaming companies and traditional broadcasters looking for riskier programming ideas and marketing them more aggressively.“You have to do more, and be more distinctive, to stand out,” says Dan Brooke, marketing director at Channel 4. In the US, streaming service Hulu has pledged to boost spending by 70 per cent this year to promote its own original shows, such as The Mindy Project.Amazon and Netflix, which are seeking to define their creative ambition, start at a disadvantage because they do not have traditional TV channels. By contrast, the BBC does little promotion for its programming in the UK, relying instead on cross-promotion from its various outlets, which include the country’s most popular TV channel, radio station and news website.“A good old, linear schedule” allows broadcasters to rely on a certain inbuilt audience, says Tim Westcott, an analyst at IHS. Unlike Netflix, Amazon at least has a retail website, where A Man in the High Castle has been extensively featured, he adds.Even those companies with existing TV channels are having to work harder to establish their reputation for drama. UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky promoted Fortitude, a £25m Arctic thriller that was its most expensive drama to date, by placing an 8ft model of a polar bear at various London landmarks.Channel 4’s Humans, a drama about artificial intelligence, was preceded by an extended hoax, including an eBay page and a store in Regent Street, London, that both purported to sell robots.“Fifteen years ago people would just turn up [to watch shows],” says Mr Brooke. “Now you have to go out and reach them more.”But the shift to more innovative marketing, which cannot be turned off like a TV or YouTube advert, requires a particular duty of care, says Tim Duffy, UK chair of M & C Saatchi, the advertising agency. “There was a duty on [Amazon] to make clear the premise” of the Nazi imagery.You have to do more, and be more distinctive, to stand outPoor marketing decisions are not unique to the streaming era. In 2007, a would-be guerrilla advertising campaign for a movie based on Cartoon Network’s animated series Aqua Teen Hunger Force sparked a terror scare in Boston. LED panels bearing the likeness of two characters were mistakenly identified as bombs, leading to a citywide security response.The head of Cartoon Network resigned over the incident, and Turner, the channel’s parent company, agreed to pay the Boston police and the US Department of Homeland Security $2m to pay for the costs of the incident.Amazon is removing its campaign from the New York subway, but the publicity is unlikely to have been entirely unwelcome. Next year it launches Jeremy Clarkson’s new motoring show; the boundaries of taste may soon be pushed again."
460;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-11-18T14:06:07Z;Rescheduling television’s future;With digital choice paralysing many, Molotov wants viewers to stumble upon great shows again;"A few years ago Jean-David Blanc stopped watching live television. Then he realised what he was missing. “I was looking at the TV guide, and I thought, ‘There’s so much good stuff, why am I not watching TV any more?’” says the Frenchman.That sensation is familiar to many digitally savvy viewers who rely on streaming services such as Netflix and the BBC iPlayer. Those platforms are great at delivering the shows audiences know they want to watch — House of Cards and Doctor Who — but they have so far struggled to replicate the spontaneity and serendipity of live television.For Mr Blanc, this is the opportunity. In 1993 he founded AlloCiné, a telephone service for cinema listings, which was acquired by French broadcaster Canal Plus and now covers films across Europe.His new company, Molotov,is an at­tempt to reinvigorate TV — combining the best elements of schedules, streaming and social media. What people want is still “the experience of [watching a] television channel”, says Mr Blanc: they just want that experience to be a bit more interactive, more personalised, more “Netflix-like”.Molotov, which launches early next year, has signed up about 80 channels in France. It is seeking to raise €100m in venture capital, after an initial pot of €10m. Even if it does not take off, it neatly identifies the challenge facing broadcasters and technology companies: how can TV be better? And is there still life in the television schedule?Television has, in some ways, taken a back seat in the digital revolution.“TV is one of those things that, if we’re really honest, it’s stuck back in the seventies,” said Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, in late 2014. A year later, Apple launched the fourth iteration of its TV plug-in, and proclaimed that “the future of television is apps”.Others, including Amazon’s Kindle Fire, have taken a similar approach by drawing viewers away from linear TV schedules, towards apps and on-demand viewing.“There’s a general sense that the world is going in this direction,” says Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, which recently launched a standalone subscription app, DisneyLife. Apps are richer than channels “where one programme follows another programme”, he adds. Some platforms are seeking to tear up the electronic programme guide, which for years has been the road map to TV.Amid the accelerating debate over the future of television, one fact is often overlooked: most programmes are still watched live.British adults spent an average of 4.5 hours a day watching their TV set last year, according to Enders Analysis, the media analyst. Three-quarters of that — nearly 3.5 hours — was live television; the remainder included catch-up, DVDs and video games.“The live schedule is a very easy way of making choices. Catch-up is not going to overtake live for many years,” says Toby Syfret, an analyst at Enders. (Change would accelerate if the British government decided to switch off broadcasters’ access to spectrum, a move that remains speculative.)“People just get human nature wrong,” says Lindsey Clay, chief executive of British television trade body Thinkbox. “[Viewers] can’t be bothered to spend hours curating their own content.”Catch-up and time-shifted viewing is nonetheless on the rise, particularly among under-35s but also among older age groups. Reported TV viewing time has fallen nearly 30 per cent among those aged between four and 24, according to rating agency Barb, which does not include mobiles and tablets.The rise of catch-up poses challenges for the biggest broadcasters. Currently, those at the top of the electronic programme guide — BBC and ITV in the UK — have an incumbency advantage. But as viewers move to apps or other online players, that advantage dissipates.But the world of standalone apps has its own problems. Search functions are makeshift and moving between different apps is often clumsy. Although they should allow personalised recommendations about which shows to watch, that relies on broadcasters being willing to share the data.Hence some, including Molotov, still think the place to start is with TV channels. They are easy to navigate, have clear brands, and guide viewers to programmes they might otherwise have missed.“It’s two different philosophies for how you look at TV,” says Nigel Walley, managing director at consultancy Decipher Media Research. “There are a lot of people for whom the rhythm of TV channels maps on to the way they live their lives.”That means family soaps before children go to bed, then more adult dramas. Schedules are as deliberately stocked as supermarket aisles. New programmes piggyback on established favourites (Downton Abbey aired directly after The X Factor), and educational output sneaks in after popular shows.Some platforms have already souped up the schedule. Set-top boxes from Sky, EE and others record hours of the most recent live TV, so that viewers can scroll back seamlessly. Sky-Q, a premium service announced this week, aims to make it easier for viewers to find live, recorded and on-demand shows in one place.But Molotov, with a fraction of the budget of such companies, wants to be a contender. With its initial €10m in venture funding, it has produced a TV platform with the look and feel of the music streaming service Spotify. It lists the available channels, and viewers can then personalise their programming guide with only the channels they want to watch.Molotov also allows viewers to bookmark shows and to search by actors or even politicians to find new programmes. To help discover new shows, the interface details which programmes have performed unexpectedly well on social media, as well as which are popular among their own friends on Facebook and elsewhere. “These functions already exist. What we change is the experience,” says Mr Blanc.Molotov’s functionality will also allow users to take digital clips of program­mes and share them online. “The idea is to drive the audience right away back to the channel,” says Mr Blanc. Currently, a popular way to share a clip from a programme is to hold up a smartphone to the screen to record footage.The idea is to be a one-stop shop for audiences by replacing dozens of apps on Apple TV, or indeed an entire cable box. “The cable operators are saying, ‘you will have access to 399 channels, catch them if you can’. It’s so complicated,” says Pierre Lescure, who set up Canal Plus in 1984, and co-founded Molotov.The big obstacle to Molotov’s model will be the broadcasters, who own the rights to the shows. If a broadcaster does not want to appear on Molotov, the start-up cannot force them to do so.Many broadcasters are likely to feel particularly uneasy about allowing viewers to take short clips of programmes, especially for sports, where online rights are often sold separately. (Another TV start-up, Grabyo, takes a different approach by giving broadcasters and sports federations the tools to post clips on social media.)Molotov claims it is not a threat to the broadcasters, merely a distributor that helps them to maximise their audiences. It rebroadcasts free channels, and plans to take a cut of subscriptions on pay-TV. (Its service also excludes Net­flix, the bane of some broadcasters.)Even so, “it took us about two years to get the networks onboard”, says Mr Blanc, of the company’s French launch. Some French broadcasters, including Canal Plus, are still not signed up, although Molotov thinks it has enough to make a viable service.The next step is to roll out internationally. “If we can make it in France, we can make it anywhere,” says Mr Blanc."
461;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;T-Mobile to offer free video streaming in wireless battle;Shares fall as phone company tries to lure customers with ‘binge’ watching campaign;T-Mobile US is planning to allow customers to stream video from services such as Netflix, HBO Go and Hulu without eating into their data allowances, as the fast-growing wireless carrier continues to try to differentiate itself from its larger rivals.Wireless carriers such as T-Mobile sell their customers a monthly “bucket” of high-speed data measured in gigabytes, which is then consumed by listening to music, watching videos and browsing the internet.However, T-Mobile said on Tuesday that its subscribers would no longer use up data allowances by watching videos on two dozen of the most popular streaming services, although the quality of shows would be slightly impaired.Google’s YouTube, one of the most popular destinations for video, is not included, because its service does not meet T-Mobile’s technical requirements, although the carrier said it was in talks about adding the platform.Although T-Mobile is known for its eye-catching, customer-friendly deals, the move surprised investors because video is by far the biggest use of a subscriber’s data allowance, and is often the reason they choose to upgrade to larger buckets that are more expensive.Shares in the company closed down 3.97 per cent in New York.The offer, branded “BingeOn” by T-Mobile, is the latest in a series of initiatives designed to differentiate the company from its largest rivals, AT&T and Verizon, which charge higher prices but also have better quality networks.John Legere, chief executive, announced the offer at an event in Los Angeles and said that while AT&T and Verizon were “squeezing customers” with fees, T-Mobile was “unleashing entertainment”. The company already lets its subscribers stream music without eating into their data allowances.The generous offers have helped T-Mobile steal customers from its larger rivals. So far this year, the company has added 2.6m of the most lucrative mobile phone subscribers, compared with 613,000 for Verizon, while AT&T and Sprint have lost 1.2m and 175,000 respectively.Verizon is also trying to boost its video credentials, recently launching a new advertising-funded streaming service for millennials, known as go90, while AT&T recently purchased DirecTV for roughly $50bn and made the company’s content available on its smartphones and tablets.Growing consumption of video from content groups such as Netflix and YouTube on smartphones and tablets is set to explode over the next few years, pushing the amount of data delivered to mobile devices from 4.2bn gigabytes this year to 24.3bn by 2019, according to Cisco.However, until T-Mobile’s move, video was seen by telecoms executives and investors as a way of persuading customers to spend more on their phone bills.At a media conference in New York in September, Lowell McAdam, chief executive of Verizon, said: “The more people watch, the bigger the bundles they buy, and that’s what we are in business for.”Mr McAdam added that as customers bought larger data packages to consume more video, the revenue companies like his earned per customer should also rise.
462;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Hollywood meets Bollywood as diversity hits US prime time TV;‘Quantico’ and ‘Empire’ highlight growing influence of ethnic minority audiences;Bollywood meets Hollywood in Quantico, a drama on Walt Disney’s ABC network, with Priyanka Chopra playing an FBI agent on the run after being implicated in a terrorist plot.The casting of one of India’s biggest movie stars seems to have paid off: Quantico has performed strongly enough for ABC to commission a second series. But the show is part of a broader effort by the network to cast more racially diverse actors in starring roles at a time when the composition of audiences is changing and the distribution of television programming is in flux.Technological changes have reshaped the broadcast landscape, says Paul Lee, president of ABC’s entertainment group. Serialised dramas, such as the network’s Scandal, which was licensed to streaming service Netflix after its broadcast run, have “recruited a whole new audience for us”. Digital platforms have created a new revenue stream, he adds.But changes in front of the camera have been no less striking. The biggest broadcast hit of the year was Empire, the Fox network drama about a hip-hop dynasty featuring a predominantly African-American cast.A recent study by Variety, the entertainment trade magazine, found that a 30-second advertising spot during the show cost more than $500,000 — second only to NBC’s regular Sunday night American football broadcast.ABC’s Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder — which has also been licensed to Netflix — also feature African-American stars and are produced by Shonda Rhimes, television’s most bankable hit creator.It was not long ago that black and other minority actors were relegated to secondary roles in prime time television series. But times are changing: Viola Davis, the star of How to Get Away with Murder, recently won the Emmy for best actress in a dramatic series — becoming the first black woman to scoop the award. Mr Lee says ABC has deliberately shaken up its line-up, commissioning series from more racially diverse talents. “We’ve tried to be inclusive of the audience,” he says. “Let’s reflect the country as it truly is.”The network has led a charge into programming starring more racially diverse actors.Recent shows launched by the channel include Fresh off the Boat, a sitcom about a Taiwanese family, Blackish, which centres on an African-American family, and Dr Ken, which stars the Korean-American comedian Ken Jeong.These programmes have become fixtures of the network’s primetime schedule and come as the proportion of viewers from non-white backgrounds in the 18-49-year-old demographic most coveted by advertisers is growing, according to Nielsen, the research firm. Six years ago Hispanics, African-Americans and Asians represented 36.6 per cent of viewers aged 18-49. This year, that figure had increased to 41.2 per cent.“We know the multicultural audience is growing in size,” says Esther Franklin, head of Americas strategy at Starcom MediaVest Group, the media buying agency. Advertisers have noticed, she says, partly because this new generation of shows is attracting audiences that may have once felt marginalised or excluded by the programmes available to them.Marketers are also aware that different cultures can exert an outsize influence on consumer tastes and behaviours, she adds, pointing to music, fashion and food preferences. Salsa and tortilla chips, a staple of Hispanic communities, now outsell potato crisps in the US, for example.Ms Franklin mentions Empire, which increased its audience each week in its first series, defying broadcasting convention. “The audience is more engaged because this content is more reflective of the audience,” she says. “They are participating with it on social media and the advertisers want to reach them.”Producers and networks used to make programming designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience but shows that focus on characters from a specific ethnic or racial group are among those succeeding in the ratings, says Mr Lee.“If you are going to reflect America and unleash creativity then let’s get some people who have a story to tell. What we’re seeing is that the more specific the voices and stories are, the larger the audience,” he says.The new generation of shows on ABC and Fox appear to mark a sharp break with the history of broadcast television, but the change has actually been a decade in the making. Ms Franklin says the turning point was the launch on ABC of Grey’s Anatomy in 2005. Created and produced by Ms Rhimes, it featured a racially diverse cast and was a big success.Since then Ms Rhimes has churned out hit after hit for the network to the extent that ABC has devoted its Thursday night primetime line-up to shows made by Shondaland, her production company. She has four series on the network this year.The new generation of programming is resonating with traditional white audiences but also with other minority groups. “These shows are reaching beyond the traditional multicultural segment,” says Ms Franklin. She points to the Indian-American community as an example, which she says is “rising in influence”, and which has been accompanied by a new generation of stars, such as the comedians Aziz Ansari and Mindy Kaling — and now, Ms Chopra from Quantico.Demographic change that affects consumer and viewing behaviour is not going away, says Lia Silkworth, managing director of Starcom MediaVest’s multicultural division. “These demographic groups have never been more diverse and they see the world very differently from the generation that preceded them. If media companies and advertisers want to be relevant they have to engage with them.”Priyanka Chopra is one of Bollywood’s biggest stars and first came to the attention of Walt Disney’s movie studio several years ago, which cast her in Barfi!, a film produced by its Indian division.This led to the star signing a deal with ABC, the company’s broadcast network, to front Quantico.The network has made efforts to sign acting, writing and directing talent from a more diverse range of backgrounds. The ABC Discovers programme, launched in 2001, gave 12 Years a Slave Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o her first break — she also stars in Disney’s new Star Wars film. Chadwick Boseman, who starred in the James Brown biopic Get on Up, was also given his big break by ABC Discovers.“We created the programme to give opportunities to diverse actors, writers and directors,” says Keli Lee, the network’s head of casting. “It’s about finding the best talent and creating opportunities for them.”
463;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-11-03T20:08:58Z;Jon Stewart to spearhead HBO digital drive;Four-year production deal will see political satirist focus on short-form online content;"Jon Stewart, who shaped a generation of political satirists during his 16 years hosting Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, is taking his act to HBO, the Time Warner-owned premium cable channel behind Game of Thrones.But Mr Stewart’s new project will not see him anchoring a traditional television series like Last Week Tonight, the half-hour HBO comedy show hosted by his protégé John Oliver. Instead, Mr Stewart will kick off his four-year production deal by making short-form content for HBO’s digital platforms.The move comes as the network is beefing up its online offerings in a bid to expand its audience beyond people who pay for its top-tier channel as part of pricey cable or satellite television packages.Mr Stewart’s satirical take on news at the flagship programme of Viacom’s Comedy Central was a consistent source of viral video content, shared across social media sites by an age group that TV networks find increasingly hard to reach.Younger viewers are leading the shift in trading traditional viewing habits, like sitting down in front of their televisions at a set day and time to watch a show, for on-demand services like Netflix and quick video hits on sites like YouTube and BuzzFeed.“Going digital-only is just another sign of the times: digital content can be every bit as mainstream and appealing to large groups of people as content that is distributed to large groups of people through broadcast or cable,” said Paul Verna, media analyst at eMarketer, the research group.To keep up with changing consumer preferences, last year HBO launched HBO Now, a paid streaming service that allows people to watch its programmes both live and on-demand without a pay-TV subscription.Since then, the network has signed up an eclectic roster of big-name media brands, from Sesame Street to Vice Media and Bill Simmons, the popular US sportswriter, all of which will appear on HBO Now.The latest deal, announced on Tuesday, will see Mr Stewart, who stepped down as host of The Daily Show earlier this year, “produce timely short-form digital content, which will be refreshed on HBO NOW multiple times throughout the day”.He will also be involved in “additional projects” yet to be announced, HBO said, and will work with Otoy, a digital graphics company whose advisers include Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt and Ari Emanuel of WME-IMG.It’s really all about content exclusivity, having something that your competitors don’t have“Appearing on television 22 minutes a night clearly broke me. I’m pretty sure I can produce a few minutes of content every now and again,” Mr Stewart said.Mr Verna of eMarketer said: “For HBO to have someone like [Mr Stewart] exclusively on their streaming platform instantly puts them in a position to gain or at least retain a lot of their subscribers. It’s really all about content exclusivity, having something that your competitors don’t have.”As more media and technology companies are entering the online streaming market, original content is becoming an important point of differentiation between services competing for users’ wallets.The biggest streaming providers — Netflix, Amazon and Hulu — are all investing heavily in original shows. This week, CBS said that its new Star Trek series would be available exclusively on its own subscription digital service.But even as content owners search out new ways to reach viewers across a proliferation of internet-connected devices, some digital natives are eyeing the still-substantial reach of traditional television.HBO’s announcement came on the same day that Vice Media, the youth-focused digital brand, said that it would launch its own cable network next year devoted to lifestyle and entertainment programming. Vice also has a deal with HBO to produce a daily news series.“Vice is in the eyeballs business and there are still lots of eyeballs on TV,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research.shannon.bond@ft.com

It has gone live in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand with Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam to follow.Peter Bithos, Hooq chief executive, points out that excluding China, where there are severe restrictions on foreign content and investment in the media industry, only about 150m households among emerging Asia’s 2bn people have traditional pay TV.“The question is how do you entertain a couple of billion people in a premium way without them having a satellite on their roof?” he says. “There’s a very large opportunity but it’s a long-term journey with the three main challenges being the bandwidth infrastructure, the variety of different devices and payments.”The streaming services provided by Netflix and Amazon in developed nations have grown rapidly thanks to ever-faster internet speeds, high levels of fixed-line broadband connectivity and smooth credit card payment.Their model cannot work in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, where Mark Britt, iflix chief executive and co-founder, estimates that out of more than 600m people there are just 50m broadband subscriptions and 100m mobile data subscriptions, but 250m smartphones.Due to a lack of available content and weak law enforcement outside Singapore, many Southeast Asians have turned to content piracy, buying counterfeit DVDs that are sold openly across the region and using illegal downloads.150mHouseholds among emerging Asia’s 2bn people with traditional pay TVMr Britt says “download and play” rights are a “game-changer” because they will allow companies finally to offer a product that is better than piracy.The $3 average monthly subscription price is meant to compare favourably with pirated DVDs, which can cost as little as $0.50 each, and is well below the $10-$15 price in the US and Europe.While smartphone ownership has soared in Southeast Asia, Mr Bithos says the average user only connects to expensive and unreliable mobile internet eight times a month and that many rely on WiFi networks at work or in cafés to access content.The experience of iflix bears that out, with 85 per cent of its content downloaded over a fixed internet connection but 55 per cent of it watched on a mobile device.Mr Britt says he and his rivals are trying to “optimise our technology for the low end”, with file sizes as small as possible.Both companies, each launched earlier this year, remain reluctant to reveal subscriber numbers; iflix says 650,000 have signed up for accounts, although not all have paid for the service.China and India have led the way for mobile streaming in Asia but Mr Bithos expects the battle for young users in Southeast Asia to intensify as more local rivals launch.“We will see tremendous competition in the next six to 12 months,” he says."
465;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-10-21T16:59:18Z;Content creators join streaming race to keep pace with consumers;Disney joins HBO, CBS, Amazon, Netflix and others in looking for new ways to reach consumers online;For years, cable and satellite subscribers have had to choose from a large and often expensive set menu of channels, with little ability to control which ones were included.But with the advent of digital streaming technology, à la carte viewing is suddenly taking off. Consumers are increasingly able to pick and choose the channels and services they want to use thanks to their availability as apps.Walt Disney is the latest and largest media company to start a service that offers a range of content without requiring a cable or satellite subscription. DisneyLife, to be launched in the UK next month, will join services from HBO, CBS, NBC, Showtime, Nickelodeon and WWE that let viewers pay to watch shows on demand, and in some cases live broadcasts, over the internet.The network owners are following the path blazed by Netflix, the largest subscription streaming service. Audiences for broadcast and cable channels are shrinking and viewers — particularly younger ones — are spending more time watching television via smartphones, tablets or internet-connected televisions and devices such as Roku, Apple TV and Google’s Chromecast.Some viewers are cutting the pay-television cord in favour of online alternatives or opting for cheaper “skinny” bundles of channels. Others, dubbed “cord nevers”, are not signing up for traditional television subscriptions in the first place. A recent survey by Magid Associates, a consultancy, found three-quarters of respondents who said they were “extremely likely” to cancel their pay-TV subscriptions this year cited the availability of digital content on services such as Netflix.In August, fears that a generation of viewers is abandoning pay-TV sent media stocks into freefall, wiping $37bn off the market value of the largest businesses, including Disney, Viacom and Time Warner, in a single day.“The summer was a watershed moment for the entire industry,” says Evan Shapiro, executive vice-president of NBCUniversal, which last week launched Seeso, a new streaming service focused on comedy.“Rather than bury our heads in the sand and pretend it’s not happening, we decided not to just protect our ecosystem but to grow it by creating a brand new channel for the lifestyle that is clearly part of the mainstream now.”This is not to say media companies have abandoned the traditional set menu. The bundle of channels remains highly profitable: CBS, for example, expects to generate $2bn by 2020 in annual “retransmission” fees from the cable and satellite companies that carry its network.The company will make better margins from its standalone CBS All Access app, which it sells directly to consumers for $5.99 a month. By contrast, it generates about $2 a month per pay-TV subscriber — although the audience watching via traditional means is much larger.However, the broadcaster is keen to hedge its bets. “The key is to distribute your content in the ways viewers want to receive it, whether that’s direct, part of a cable package or in a skinny bundle,” it says.Distributors such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube — which will launch its own subscription service on Wednesday — have reshaped the competitive landscape.To keep pace with this new crop of digital services, media companies are looking to win viewers however and wherever they want to watch.“If it was 15 years ago, we probably would have launched [Seeso] as a cable channel,” says Mr Shapiro. “It’s not 15 years ago. The idea here is to create new products for the next generation of viewers.”The wave of new standalone apps from broadcasters and cable networks also signals a reassessment of their relationships with Netflix.Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner chief executive, and James Murdoch, head of 21st Century Fox, have both expressed concerns about whether they are being paid enough by third-party digital services.“You don’t want the money that they offer you to replace more money that somebody else used to be able to offer you,” Mr Bewkes said last month.Licensing programming to new digital services or launching standalone apps could have big repercussions, warned Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura Securities. “If you drive people to find enough of what they want outside the traditional cable or satellite bundle it will hurt that legacy business,” he says.Pointing to the $120bn generated annually in the US in advertising and carriage fees, he says the traditional bundle of channels was “a golden goose that is well worth looking out for”.“TV Everywhere” was supposed to protect that golden goose. The term, originally coined by Time Warner’s Mr Bewkes, refers to efforts to make channels available online but only for viewers that logged in with their cable or satellite subscription details.But analysts say TV Everywhere has failed to deliver, with Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research calling it “TV nowhere”. This may explain why so many channel owners are bypassing traditional distributors and going direct to consumers.Other media industries, namely music and print publishing, have made painful transitions to online business models. Television, though, is not waiting to be disrupted.“One of the things that I think is an issue today with some of the legacy [cable and satellite] distributors is they haven’t cracked mobility and they haven’t cracked the easy to use, easy to find, easy to navigate challenges at all,” says Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive.“They haven’t stepped up to that. Some of them are trying but they either have legacy technology that disallows that or they don’t have the culture to provide it. We can’t wait for them to figure that out.”The new Apple TV box, which goes on sale next week, will fix the “broken” model of traditional viewing, the company’s chief executive Tim Cook promised this week, writes Tim Bradshaw.“The content owners have done a great job producing incredible content,” Mr Cook told the WSJD conference. “There’s 700 channels of it, but you can’t find anything to watch . . . The user experience is in another decade than the way you live on your iPhone.”But for Apple’s rivals in the set-top box business, Mr Cook’s pitch seemed familiar.“Apple is charging $150 for features we have on a $50 streaming player,” Anthony Wood, chief executive of Roku, said last month. “They are quite expensive for what they are offering.”The market for boxes and dongles that can stream video from the internet is growing by 30 per cent a year but is “brutally competitive”, Mr Wood said. Roku’s devices go up against not just Apple TV but Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s two offerings, Chromecast and Android TV.Now it has the concerted attention of all the big tech companies, analysts say this sector holds greater growth potential than Apple’s main earner, smartphones.“The major area of any [tech] growth at all in markets like the UK and the US is going to be devices that plug in to the TV set,” says Dan Cryan, digital media analyst at market researcher IHS. “The new Apple TV is a very important part of that.”But how consumers will use these devices is unclear. Apple’s launch in September showcased not just streaming video but games such as Guitar Hero and even online shopping apps.“Is the killer app of TV still TV? That’s the question,” says Mr Cryan. “Apple is bringing a compute platform to the TV. It is not competing directly with what Roku has in market at the moment.”
466;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Pressure builds on Netflix to cash in on its streaming land grab;Video streaming group’s low prices are a headache for content owners as well as cable networks;"It is possible to build a consumer business quickly if you charge a low enough price for a valuable product. Indeed that is the essence of any self-respecting land grab. Roll it out first; worry about making the real money later.Few have understood the first part of this equation better than Netflix. Barely a month has passed in recent years without the US video streaming company either plotting or executing a launch in another market. No sooner has it built up share in one territory than it races on to the next.It is a strategy that has allowed the company to sign up an extraordinary number of customers. It has 66m subscribers in 81 countries. That puts Netflix up there with some of the biggest television companies in the world.What is less certain is how profitable this way of operating will be for the company’s investors. Netflix may be great at winning customers. But it has not demonstrated that it knows how to turn these relationships into pots of hard cash.Take a look at the important US market. Selling pay-TV to Americans is hardly a groundbreaking business model. Yet while Netflix has almost as many subscribers as all the cable networks put together, its US revenues last year amounted to just $3.4bn. That is a small fraction of the $56bn the traditional networks brought in collectively.Land grabs ultimately make money when the companies acquire pricing power as a result of their ubiquity. Netflix has started cautiously raising its charges. It recently pushed up the monthly cost from $8.99 to $9.99 — but only for new customers. The existing 42m keep the old price until next October.Even after the increase, the service remains an extraordinarily good deal for users. Not only is the price peanuts compared with the $90 on average that cable networks charge, but Netflix is also pretty generous in the content it provides.True, its subscribers do not get the same range of viewing that one gets from a cable “bundle”. But mixed in with the TV series and venerable movies is content of considerable value. Netflix has itself made expensively produced exclusive shows such as the political thriller House of Cards and Narcos, a drama about the Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar.Nor is this the only way Netflix shows its generosity. The service is laidback about account sharing. It allows users to watch content on an unlimited number of devices, and to stream more than one programme simultaneously. The scale of abuse of this offering is difficult to quantify. But if a recent report from Parks Associates is anything to go by, some 11 per cent of broadband-enabled households receive streaming services through shared accounts.The company’s low prices are clearly a headache for cable TV networks. They raise the prospect of what is called “cord cutting”, as subscribers churn off their expensive bundles to buy cheaper streaming services.More significantly for Netflix’s fortunes, its low prices are also bothering content owners. These companies might find Netflix a useful vehicle for monetising content that would otherwise decay in the back catalogue, and as a way to get their stuff in front of the younger, more difficult to reach audiences where the streaming group has a strong foothold.They are not, however, keen to see valuable cable subscriptions steadily eroded by cut-price streaming. Their take from each deal is linked to the amount charged by the distributor. See prices come down too much, and the rents they take from productions will shrink.Content owners have a strong incentive to force Netflix to push up prices. In spite of its land grab, the company is not so big yet that they have to distribute through it. The competition is growing— including from Hulu, a venture owned by three big content houses. Netflix’s US subscription growth slowed in the latest quarter.Nor can Netflix easily ramp up its own limited TV production effort to reduce its dependence on content acquired externally. That costs a great deal of money, and it is unclear where Netflix could find that apart from customers’ pockets. The company is already burning through cash as it continues to build out overseas.The risk for any media business in dishing up freebies is that customers come to take them for granted. Since launching its online service in 2007, Netflix has tossed goody after goody at viewers. Its future may hinge on how they react when asked to pay a realistic price for stuff that is already streamed to their screens.jonathan.ford@ft.com"

The order is valued at higher than $8bn at current list prices, although airlines frequently receive discounts.Boeing’s shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $137.49 by markets close on Thursday. Its shares are up about 5.8 per cent for the year.It said recently it saw rising passenger traffic and jet demand this year from 2014, despite global economic headwinds.Elsewhere, Netflix shares tumbled 8.3 per cent to $101.09. The streaming video company posted weaker-than-expected domestic subscriber figures for the third quarter.Netflix attributed some of the decline to issues collecting payments related to the implementation of chip-and-pin credit cards in the US. International subscriber growth actually beat Wall Street expectations.Shares of California-based Netflix were still up by 107 per cent for 2015.In the US financial sector, Goldman Sachs shares increased 3.1 per cent to $185.11 even though it logged disappointing third-quarter results.The New York-based bank’s profits fell in the third quarter from the same month in 2014 as trading revenues dipped. However, a rise in investment banking revenue provided a reason for optimism.KeyCorp shares jumped 4.7 per cent to $13.31. The Cleveland-based bank revealed a sharp year-on-year increase in third-quarter profits and revenues.Meanwhile, Marriott Vacations tumbled 15.2 per cent to $62.93. The timeshare company recorded weaker third-quarter sales and profits than expected, and cut its outlook for full-year contract sales growth.An increase in its full-year per-share profit forecast appeared to do little to improve sentiment on the day.Valeant Pharmaceuticals said late on Wednesday it had received a subpoena from US federal prosecutors over drug-price increases. Its shares dropped 4.7 per cent to $168.87.The biotechnology sector has faced increased scrutiny since Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential hopeful, said on September 21 she planned to take on “price gouging”.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index jumped 4.4 per cent despite the news from Valeant. Some analysts reckoned the criticism might coalesce around a few players, as opposed to the entire industry.Garmin plummeted 12.7 per cent to $32.28.

Banks have been rolling out chip-and-pin cards to customers in an effort to fight fraud, but new account numbers on some cards meant Netflix was unable to process payments for some customers, leading to what the company called “involuntary churn”.The weak US growth was offset by the addition of 2.74m international subscribers, ahead of 2.46m estimated by analysts and Netflix’s forecast of 2.4m. Total subscriber growth of 3.62m was ahead of the 3.55m that Netflix projected.The company said it expects to finish the year with more than 74m subscribers as its global rollout continues before an expected completion date at the end of 2016.But the cost of expanding into new markets weighed on profit, which halved to $29.4m, or 7 cents a share, from $59.3m, or 14 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 23 per cent to $1.74bn.Netflix expects to break even through next year and deliver “material profits” afterwards. Its shares have risen 125 per cent this year on investor enthusiasm for its growth plans amid a shift in television-watching habits.The company has been ploughing money into original programming such as the Narcos series, about Colombia drug lord Pablo Escobar, and its first feature film, Beasts of No Nation, which will be released on Friday. It has also moved into children’s programming and documentaries. Next year it plans to launch a talk show featuring Chelsea Handler.Other companies including HBO and Vice Media are moving into the news business, with a daily news show planned to debut on HBO’s cable channel and streaming service early next year.On the earnings call, Mr Hastings asked Mr Sarandos, “What is the likelihood we compete directly with [the new media group] Vice in the next two years?” Mr Sarandos replied: “Probably high.”But Mr Hastings told the Financial Times that Netflix had no plans to get into the general news reporting business.“We’re really focused on the Chelsea Handler show, documentaries, that aspect of programming. Some of which Vice does very well,” he said.shannon.bond@ft.com

469;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-09-24T11:26:44Z;Death to the bland as TV viewers seek an escape from reality;The commissioning of scripted series is on the rise, but is there just too much to watch?;Jeff Bezos did not hide his enthusiasm at the Emmy awards on Sunday night, leaping to his feet and cheering when Transparent, the Amazon show about a transgender father, scooped five awards — the first ever won by the online group’s streaming video service.The success of the show, part of a new generation of serialised television programmes that has wowed critics and audiences, has led to talk of a golden age of television. From The Sopranos through to Mad Men, Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones — another big winner at the Emmys — television is enjoying a critical and artistic renaissance. Such is its ascent that many in Hollywood say it has supplanted films as the medium of choice for the best writers, actors and directors.But is there too much of it? Across the media industry, concern is growing that there are simply too many quality scripted shows to watch. John Landgraf, chief executive of FX, the cable channel that is part of 21st Century Fox, sounded the warning bell last month when he warned that audiences were “overwhelmed” by the number of available shows. The industry was “choking” on its own abundance, he said.Mr Landgraf has a point. The network estimates that there were about 280 scripted series on air five years ago, a number that had climbed to more than 370 by 2014. On a series such as Game of Thrones, which just finished its fifth season, each episode is an hour long, so a 50-hour time commitment would be needed by someone starting from scratch. Add in other must-see series, and watching television or video streaming services requires a substantial time investment. For working adults there are not enough hours in the day to watch everything.This point was illustrated at the Emmys. In a sketch that opened the show, comedian Andy Samberg retreated to a bunker to catch up on all the programming he had missed. He emerged with a long beard a year later.Some TV executives agree with Mr Landgraf’s assessment. After all, investments in original production are fraught with risks. For those broadcast and cable networks that depend on advertising, there are clear implications if shows do not immediately find an audience and generate ratings. At FX, The Comedians, which starred Billy Crystal, was cancelled when it failed to bring in enough viewers — despite favourable reviews from critics.The warning from Mr Landgraf carries weight but do not expect a slowdown in the number of scripted series being commissioned anytime soon. One reason is a slowdown in reality television. From the mid-1990s onwards into the next decade, this was a reliable cash cow for media companies. Cheap to produce and produced in formats that were eminently exportable — the American Idol format was remade for almost 50 countries — reality TV became the industry’s golden goose.But the format has lost its shine and viewers are seeking something else from their viewing. In the US this summer, companies that relied on reality TV — and did not have a pedigree in scripted drama — were hit by a big share sell-off, when concerns about disappearing audiences and declining advertising revenues spooked investors.Channel owners are betting that original, quality dramas are the best way to retain audiences. USA, the cable network owned by Comcast’s NBCUniversal, used to be best known as the home of reruns and bland, middle-of-the road dramas. However, its edgy new series Mr Robot, about a vigilante cyberhacker, was the most talked about show of the summer. Even Lifetime, which is more commonly associated with pulpy style and reality shows, has changed direction, winning plaudits for Unreal, a dark comedy about a fictional dating programme.In both cases the channels have bet on original writing, taking a punt that audiences will respond well when challenged by something they may not have expected. The best scripted programming can help networks stand out in a crowded marketplace — consider what House of Cards and Orange is the New Black did for Netflix, for example.Bland television designed to appeal to everyone has had its day, one senior TV executive told me this week. Instead, programmes that may have once been earmarked for niche audiences are most in demand. There may be too much scripted programming around, but broadcast networks and cable channels have few other choices. With the ratings for the Emmys, TV’s starriest night of the year, down 20 per cent on 2014, it is clear that audiences are evaporating. Drastic measures are needed — and brilliant, challenging drama may hold the key.matthew.garrahan@ft.com

But David Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, said such streaming devices would only “come alive” if the programmes were owned by traditional broadcasters. Unlike Netflix and Amazon, Apple has not announced plans to invest in original content.Mr Zaslav also sought to dampen investors’ fears about disruption to traditional television sector business models after tens of billions were wiped off media stocks in recent weeks.“There was a question of does the industry have a cold, or is it sick?” he told a Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge. “I don’t think it has a cold, I don’t think it’s sick. I think it’s evolving.”Discovery, which recently bought Eurosport in a €1bn deal, could make further acquisitions in Europe and Latin America as it looks for growth.“Our number one priority is international expansion,” said Mr Zaslav when asked about a possible takeover of British broadcaster ITV. “We have a lot of synergies — and a lot of content.”New platforms such as Netflix are becoming key buyers of television content, but they also are threatening to move beyond the cable bundle that has proved hugely profitable for the likes of Walt Disney, Time Warner and 21st Century Fox.“If there were no antitrust laws, we’d get together and say, ‘No, no, no, no, here’s how you’re going to offer [our content]’,” Mr Zaslav said.Discovery, whose channels include Animal Planet and TLC, will seek to “invest more and make less” programming, he added.It recently acquired the European broadcasting rights for the Olympics for €1.3bn, although in some countries it may sublicence them to other broadcasters such as the BBC.“We’re asking ourselves two questions: how well does our content work on linear [television] . . . and how good is our content if people could watch anything?” said Mr Zaslav. “Sport is at the top of that pyramid.”Mr Zaslav was the best paid chief executive of a US-listed company last year, taking home $156m. Asked about his toughest competitor, he said “James and Rupert and Lachlan”, referring to the three Murdochs at the top of 21st Century Fox.

But investors fear that the success of digital video services could be accelerating a decline in ratings, advertising sales and pay-TV subscriptions.Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, said that networks such as Turner needed to be sure that licensing fees from Netflix were not cannibalising more lucrative sources of revenues. Time Warner owns the Turner network, which operates the rolling news channel CNN and the Cartoon Network.“We don’t want that money to replace the more money that someone else was paying us,” said Mr Bewkes at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference in New York.Asked whether he thought the rise of Netflix was accelerating cord-cutting, he said: “I do.”Mr Bewkes suggested that when buying content in the future, networks like Turner should offer programming through their own video-on-demand services or those operated by the established pay-TV groups.Time Warner’s HBO division recently launched HBO Now, its own digital video service, and has said it could expand it to include television from Turner and films from the Warner Bros studio.James Murdoch, chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said Netflix was a “valuable partner”, but that the company could choose to license more of its content exclusively to Hulu, a rival service that is jointly owned by the Fox network, Comcast’s NBC and Walt Disney.“The business rules are changing and our thinking is evolving,” Mr Murdoch said, adding that Hulu reimbursed Fox in a way that was “attractive to us”.Netflix said: “We do a ton of business with Time Warner and Fox, and we appreciate them as important partners.”The comments came as new study found that the rise of digital video services was the main driver of cord cutting. Roughly three-quarters of respondents who said they were “extremely likely” to cancel their pay TV subscription this year cited the availability of digital content on services like Netflix, according to a survey conducted by Magid Associates, a consultancy.The same survey found that the number of US consumers who are “extremely likely” to cancel their pay-TV subscription had nearly doubled to 3.7 per cent in 2015 — small in percentage terms but the equivalent of roughly 3.7m customers.August 14: When 24m US viewers tuned in to watch Donald Trump slug it out with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Fox News hit record ratings for a non-sports cable broadcast. However, those who followed on social networks had a common complaint: Fox had made it virtually impossible to watch the event online.Read moreFor several years, the television industry has played down the danger of cord-cutting. But that position has become increasingly untenable following a second quarter that was the worst on record in terms of pay-TV customer losses for the sector.Executives now admit cord-cutting is happening, but are trying to convince investors they are able to capitalise on the growing popularity of online video too.“There’s going to be a lot more choice in the marketplace,” Mr Murdoch said. “Customers want more choice, with them spending $10 to $15 on streaming services and getting a little less from their” pay-TV provider.“The streaming environment is better for us because it gives us control and we have the ability to innovate in advertising,” he added, pointing to the use of customer data to send viewers more targeted advertising.He admitted advertisers wanted more proof that Fox content was reaching customers through digital channels, and said it was incumbent on the large networks to find a way of measuring this audience. “The biggest networks need to push ahead on this rather than being passive and waiting for traditional rating agencies to catch up,” he said.Executives from the pay-TV providers also insisted they were well-placed to deal with any acceleration in cord-cutting.“While there is a transformation in how people are watching, hourly video consumption is continuing to increase,” Mr Stevens said. “The key for us is to deliver services over multiple platforms — satellite, broadband and wireless.”John Stevens, chief financial officer of AT&T, said the 133,000 subscriber losses at its DirecTV satellite TV division in the second quarter had been in line with the company’s expectations, and that it would focus on “long-term profitable growth” rather than winning customers back with promotions.Upon completing its $49bn acquisition of DirecTV this year, AT&T became the largest pay-TV group in the US by subscribers.Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, said his company would benefit from the shift to digital video because it would drive uptake of its broadband products. “We think video over the internet is more friend than foe — the more you rely on online video, you need broadband,” he said.Mike Cavanagh, the company’s chief financial officer, touted a series of products designed to appeal to cord-cutters and “cord nevers”, including an online streaming product and a discount package for students.“Not every one of these is going to be a home run, but more important is a willingness to experiment to try out and stay tuned in with [how] our current and future customers are behaving,” he said.
472;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-09-14T14:21:19Z;Lines blur between advertising and children’s entertainment;Toymakers such as Mattel are generating their own content to reach kids on tablets and smartphones;"The newest addition to American Girl’s line-up of historic dolls is Maryellen Larkin, supposedly a nine-year-old living in Florida in 1954. But the toy company is using decidedly modern tools to promote her, creating a short live action film about the character developed through a “crowdsourcing” platform.The finished movie will be showcased on American Girl’s website and social media channels, including YouTube. There, it will run alongside videos promoting other American Girl toys, tutorials on braiding dolls’ hair and craft sessions demonstrating how to make garlands of stars and doll-sized suitcases.American Girl, an arm of the US toymaker Mattel, is not alone in its approach to content marketing, the increasingly common practice of companies creating their own videos, news-style articles, graphics and other snippets to attract and engage customers.US businesses will spend $50bn this year on such “ content marketing”, according to Contently, a venture capital-backed start-up that connects companies with freelance writers. In some cases they partner with news organisations to create “ native advertising”, sponsored spots that look like and run alongside editorial content.Other companies are hiring writers and editors to create content that the brands promote on their own social media channels and websites.The ultimate goal is to reach audiences in a fragmented media world, where consumers — and particularly young people — have more choices in what, where and how they partake in entertainment.“You have to fill the pipeline of social and traditional media with enough content that brings people back to you,” says Chuck McBride, founder and chief creative officer of Cutwater, an advertising agency. “And it has to be more than just your TV spot. Kids are on mobile devices, sharing stuff — that’s how an ad gets seen these days.”Companies are moving beyond the traditional world of television adverts to reach a generation of kids who have access to smartphones, tablets and on-demand media from the start.Lego’s YouTube channel is stocked with episodes of cartoons tied to its various lines, including Bionicle and the girl-targeted Lego Friends as well as promotions for the Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales mini-series, which airs on pay-TV.The Danish toymaker was behind one of the most successful examples of a consumer brand being integrated into kids’ entertainment: The Lego Movie, one of 2014’s biggest box office hits.In many ways the intersection of entertainment and marketing to kids is not new; companies like Walt Disney have long excelled in merchandising their most successful brands. Disney and Viacom’s Nickelodeon this year both launched divisions that work with advertisers to create content and promote it to their wide audiences on social media.But the blurring of lines between content and advertising online raises new challenges for parents, says Caroline Knorr, parenting editor at Common Sense Media, a non-profit organisation that advises families on media and technology. “Ads should really be separate from the content,” she says. “We think it’s really important to protect kids from deceptive advertising.”In the US, concerns that children are less able to differentiate between ads and content have led to Federal Communications Commission restrictions on TV advertising during children’s programming. There are limits on the number of commercials that can be aired and prohibitions on advertising products within shows or using characters to sell items.Consumer groups have appealed to the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates deceptive advertising practices, to examine online ads aimed at kids.In the meantime, the marketing industry is preparing itself for a future where traditional 30-second television commercials are no longer the cornerstone of their advertising strategies.“We’re starting to see clients move percentages of media budgets — in some cases large ones — out of broadcast and into online and social video,” said Tom Pettus, executive vice-president at advertising agency Deutsch*.As competition heats up in the streaming video market, children’s programming is emerging as a key area of investment for new players like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, as well as established brands like Disney, Nickelodeon and the Cartoon Network.Indeed, many of the new companies pushing into children’s programming tout that they offer advertising-free environments.HBO, the premium cable network best known for dark and often violent dramas such as Game of Thrones and True Detective, announced in August it would be the new home of Sesame Street, the classic children’s TV programme.Netflix licenses movies and shows from Disney and DreamWorks Animation but is also making large investments in creating its own kids’ programmes as part of its broader emphasis on original content. Amazon, which carries Nickelodeon’s pre-school shows, this year launched six original pilots, all aimed at kids.A notable exception to the trend towards ad-free online destinations for kids’ programming is Google’s YouTube. Its YouTube Kids app carries programmes aimed at young kids with advertising from family-friendly brands, under extensive rules that prohibit advertising food or beverages and including material not suitable for children under the age of 13.But advocacy groups including the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, the Consumer Federation of America and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry have raised concerns with the FTC that it is the videos, not just the ads, that highlight the eroding boundaries between marketing and content online.On the channel for Pocoyo, a popular Spanish TV programme aimed at preschoolers, interspersed with short episodes showing the adventures of the title character and his friends are live-action videos showing Pocoyo toys being unwrapped and played with. They are the toddler version of the “unboxing” videos popular among adult tech fans keen to visualise a new gadget.YouTube declined to comment on the advocacy groups’ letter to the FTC. But such clashes are only likely to become more common as the trend evolves.“It’s this rabid consumption of the content,” says Deutsch’s Mr Pettus. “That’s where if you got kids hooked on a show or character, the ability to weave into that content companion experiences, whether standalone mobile apps or products like colouring books, becomes incredibly effective.”Two-thirds of US children under five use tablets and one-third own one, according to a 2014 survey by Communicus, an advertising research group.“With the younger generation, what sets them apart in this changing of the media landscape is their very, very early adoption of mobile devices compared to adults,” said Fiona Su, a director at Eleven Inc, a marketing agency.“Television is changing in format from a very traditional scheduled programme to on-demand delivery right on tablets and mobile devices,” she says.The marketing industry needs to be aware that this new distribution system is no longer entirely supported by ads, she adds. A recent study from PwC, the consultancy, found more than half of eight- to 18-year-olds said streaming television was their favourite media content, ahead of cable and network TV shows, games and short videos.Kids still watch more TV than any other media, however. Those surveyed spend an average 7.8 hours a week watching traditional network TV, compared with 7.2 hours watching YouTube videos, 6.2 hours watching cable TV and 6.1 hours streaming shows and movies on a laptop, smartphone or tablet.*This story has been updated from a previous version to amend the company name."
473;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;ITV looks to Rugby World Cup to repair worst-ever ratings;Tournament offers 140 hours of live sport with an upmarket audience;The fans are ready, the players are ready. But perhaps no one is looking forward to the Rugby World Cup more than executives at ITV — which is trying to repair its worst-ever audience ratings.The commercial broadcaster, which has the exclusive UK rights to the tournament, has experienced a 5 per cent drop in viewing share so far this year. Several key programmes have flopped, while others have lost audiences to BBC and Channel 4.“There’s a huge amount of pressure on this autumn,” said Stephen Price, a former ITV commissioner. “ITV had a great year in 2013. Since then, they’ve slowly declined.”Forthcoming shows include the final series of Downton Abbey, which climaxes at Christmas, and the 12th series of The X Factor, already under way.But the Rugby World Cup, which starts on Friday, promises a particularly upmarket demographic that the broadcaster has struggled to attract. ITV’s audiences of ABC1s have fallen 7 per cent this year.The last tournament, held in New Zealand in 2011, attracted up to 6m viewers per game, even though the kick-off times were inconvenient for British audiences. When England reached the final in 2003 and 2007, about 12m people tuned in.This year’s competition lasts for six weeks — providing ITV with nearly 140 hours of live sport, or an average of three hours a day. The company is charging up to £2.5m for brands to advertise for 30 seconds in every game.“A good world cup would be fantastic [for ITV]. A good England performance would obviously help that,” said Michael Underhill, an analyst at Enders Analysis.Live sport has become increasingly important to broadcasters worldwide, as viewers otherwise switch to streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube. As well as the Rugby World Cup, ITV will air Six Nations matches from 2016 to 2021 — including all of England’s home games. That will partially compensate for the loss of the rights to Champions League football to BT.Under chief executive Adam Crozier, audience numbers are seen as less important for ITV. The company’s strategy is centred on growing its production business, which now includes the makers of shows such as Poldark, The Great British Bake Off and Come Dine With Me. Its share price has soared thanks to a cyclical rise in ad budgets and speculation about a US takeover.But in recent months Mr Crozier has admitted his unhappiness with ratings. ITV has also criticised the BBC for scheduling big-budget programmes on Saturday night, a key time for ad revenues. “It’s a game to them, and it’s a business to us,” said Peter Fincham, ITV’s director of television last month.Executives have not signalled that they are prepared to spend more money competing with the BBC, Netflix and Amazon Prime, which recently won the rights to Jeremy Clarkson’s latest motoring show.Rigorous financial management means that ITV will spend £1.04bn on programmes across all its channels this year, slightly less than it did in 2005. In particular, the channel has cut the hours of drama it airs by two-thirds since 2008, replacing it with documentaries that are cheaper to make.Whatever happens with the Rugby World Cup, “the golden age of TV is a little exaggerated”, said former commissioner Mr Price.
474;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-09-11T21:03:19Z;Decline in UK TV viewership ‘plateauing’;Data provide some relief for broadcasters worried about services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime;Television viewing is still falling in the UK — but the rate of decline appears to be slowing.New figures offer some respite to broadcasters, which for years have faced predictions that online platforms including Netflix and YouTube will disrupt their business models.In the first six months this year, the average number of minutes per person watched in the UK fell by about 2 per cent, compared to a 6 per cent decline in the previous year.The figures were derived by Enders Analysis from official data from Barb, the UK’s official audience measurement body. They do not include viewing of Netflix or Amazon Prime, the video streaming services, or programmes that are watched on mobile devices.Paul Lee, a media analyst at Deloitte, said the decline of viewing was “plateauing”.The average person in the UK still spends more than three and a half hours a day watching television. So far in 2015, audience behaviour has varied by age group: among those aged over 55, television viewing is roughly unchanged, while among those aged 25 to 34, it has fallen by about 7 per cent year-on-year.Overall, the time spent watching television has fallen by nearly half an hour a day since 2012, according to Barb, which surveys 5,100 homes nationwide. The agency is trialling a new survey methodology that would include viewing on computers, but would still exclude Netflix and Amazon Prime.Fewer viewing minutes do not automatically translate into lower ad revenues for broadcasters. By reducing the opportunity to reach mass audiences, it has actually led to an increase in the price of advertising slots, said Enders Analysis.ITV, the UK’s biggest private broadcaster, has blamed part of the decline in viewing on the economic recovery, with fewer unemployed people watching large quantities of programmes.@henrymance
475;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-09-01T10:00:12Z;Japan offers Netflix its Asian debut;US streaming video service provider makes its first foray into region;Netflix will take a step towards completing the final leg of its international expansion as the US streaming video service provider makes its first foray into Asia with its Japan launch this week.Described by local media as the “black ships” of Commodore Matthew Perry — referring to the arrival of US mission to Japan in the mid-19th century — the arrival of the US challenger has raised hopes for a shake-up of the Japanese television industry following Netflix’s successes in North America and Europe.“There is no vision of being a global internet television network that doesn’t include operating in Japan,” Greg Peters, who heads Netflix’s Japanese unit, said on Tuesday ahead of its Japan debut on Wednesday.Digital services such as Netflix and Amazon have lured viewers from traditional broadcast and cable networks with affordable pricing and strong original content such as House of Cards, triggering fundamental changes in TV viewing habits.Netflix operates in more than 50 countries with a subscriber base of 65m, of which 23m are outside of the US. It aims to expand into every significant global market — including China and India — by the end of 2016, making hefty investments that will in the short term expand its operating losses for non-US businesses.As a stepping stone into Asia, Mr Peters says conditions in Japan are ripe for acceptance of Netflix’s on-demand services. The infrastructure is already in place with households having access to broadband internet and mobile devices.Compared with launches in other markets where the percentage of local content is between 10 and 20 per cent, Netflix will have domestic offerings of closer to 50 per cent in Japan, according to Mr Peters.The company has already announced tie-ups with TV broadcaster Fuji Television Network and Osaka-based talent agency Yoshimoto Kogyo to produce original local content.Earlier this week, it also announced a partnership with SoftBank, which would allow its users to pay Netflix subscription fees through the Japanese telecom and internet group’s payment system. Netflix’s monthly pricing plan for Japan ranges from Y650 ($5.40) to Y1,450 while it costs $8.99 a month in the US.Netflix said the penetration of its services in Japan would probably be gradual. Another US rival, Hulu, which entered the Japanese market before Netflix, struggled after its Japan launch in 2011 and its Japanese service was later sold to local broadcaster Nippon Television Network.“There is still no growing awareness of paying money for content in Japan,” said Goro Oba, a media expert at Bukkyo University who previously worked at a TV broadcaster.Japan has a strong public broadcaster called NHK, the equivalent of the BBC in the UK, and six other free-to-air broadcasters. Many Japanese still visit rental DVD shops rather than obtaining content online. Less than 30 per cent of Japanese households subscribe to pay-TV compared with 85 per cent in the US and 60 per cent in the UK, according to estimates by Media Partners Asia.Still, some media experts said Netflix’s arrival would be a good catalyst for Japan’s TV industry, which has suffered from declining viewing ratings. A tie-up with Netflix could also potentially allow Japan’s media content to reach a global audience.“Until now, it made sense not to change the business model since it was so profitable,” said Natsuki Tohsaka, a media expert who also works at a TV broadcaster. “Once the digital age starts, the TV broadcasters will not be able to survive in the next five years unless they keep up with the pace of the changes.”
476;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-31T16:29:32Z;Twitter lifted as bank’s analysts warm to prospects with upgrade;US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from Chicago and Texas;Twitter shares were buoyed on Monday by an upgrade from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, as analysts with the bank warm to the company’s prospects and depressed stock price.Shares in the San Francisco-based group advanced 3.5 per cent to $27.78 after Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust, lifted his rating.Mr Peck said that the recent all-time low in Twitter shares, which saw its stock drop below its initial public offering pricing in November 2013, “provide a buying opportunity with: sentiment at a low, potential leadership and board stabilisation, user and monetisation catalysts coming shortly, and an attractive valuation.”Twitter shares have moved erratically since the year began, as investors fret that it will fail to add new users at the same pace it did when it floated.In its latest quarter, the company reported a 61 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier, while its loss narrowed. However, user growth slowed to less than 1 per cent from the first quarter.Planet Fitness climbed 6 per cent to $17.81 after all nine investment banks that underwrote the initial public offering of the chain of budget gyms initiated coverage with ‘buy’ or buy-equivalent ratings, including Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Jefferies.Price targets from the nine banks ranged from $19 to $25 a share, compared to the $16 price the company sold shares for this August.Analysts with Baird said that Planet Fitness had created a “disruptive model” poised to take market share, while those with Jefferies said it was the “logical beneficiary of favourable industry trends given its extensive store base, compelling value proposition and brand strength.”“Planet Fitness disrupted the $23bn US health club industry when the company launched its high-value, low-price business model, helping to create a fundamental shift in how consumers are spending their exercise dollars,” said Jerry Gray, an analyst with Cowen & Company.JC Penney shares rose 2 per cent to $9.11 after analysts with Deutsche Bank upgraded the department store chain to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ on the view same-store sales and margins will improve.“New chief executive Marvin Ellison is now driving the next step of applying the science of retail to bring JC Penney up the curve in pricing and markdown optimisation,” said Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche.Rival chains fell on Monday, with Dillard’s down 0.3 per cent to $92.51 and Sears Holdings dropping 2.2 per cent to $26.71.Netflix shares slid 2 per cent to $115.35 after the company said it would not renew its licensing deal with Epix over the weekend, removing blockbuster titles such as Hunger Games: Catching Fire, World War Z and Transformers: Age of Extinction from its US service at the end of September.Utilities were the worst performing industry on Monday, with the S&P 500 utility index sliding 1.6 per cent to 214.28 following comments from policymakers on Saturday that the US central bank could raise rates in September.Duke Energy slid 2 per cent to $70.91, Exelon declined 2 per cent to $30.76 and FirstEnergy weakened 1.6 per cent to $31.96.Overall, US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from the Greater Chicago and Texas regions.The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,972.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 16,528.03.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
478;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-31T13:21:14Z;Netflix: Burden of empire;US digital TV provider can succeed in its bold international expansion, and still be overvalued;Netflix is coming to Spain. “Bienvenidos!” was the tweet from a rival digital television provider, Wuaki TV, although it spiked the greeting with an image of a belligerent looking man and the words: “We’re waiting for you.”If Netflix’s history of foreign invasions is a guide, it is Wuaki, owned by Japanese internet group Rakuten, that has more to fear when its US challenger arrives in October. Even where there is an established incumbent, such as Lovefilm in the UK, Netflix has eventually triumphed with keen prices and keenly-awaited content such as House of Cards. Arriving later means a tougher battle but also permits lessons from the missteps of predecessors. In Japan, where Netflix is launching this week, it is promising cheaper prices and more Japanese content than the entry offering from Hulu, which struggled at launch. The Netflix empire now spans more than 50 countries and 65m subscribers, of which 23m are outside the US.But that comes at a cost. Netflix makes big operating losses in its non-US business — last quarter $92m on revenues of $455m — and has warned they should worsen before peaking next year when launches are scheduled to include China and India. With a never-ending and expensive battle for content, Netflix’s free cash flow has been negative for the past four quarters, $229.3m for the three months to June.Founder and chief executive Reed Hastings has been proven right in fending off shareholder calls to sell the company and aggressively pursuing growth in digital streaming. His overseas expansion has captured the imagination of subscribers and investors alike. Last quarter it predicted 2.5m new subscribers, but ended up with 3.3m. The company predicts it will break even next year before recording “material global profits” in 2017.Yet after surging this year, Netflix’s market capitalisation is now $50bn, about 265 times 2016 earnings. It is hard to see where the moats are around the business that would allow Netflix to ever charge subscribers enough money to justify that valuation. Nor is there any sign that content, whose suppliers are increasingly also competitors, is going to cost less. With unusual frankness, Mr Hastings seems to agree. He has previously described a 2013 stock market valuation as a “hype fest”. Today, with the stock 148 per cent higher, he sees a “mystery”. His words deserve more attention.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Analysts on Wall Street had expected JM Smucker to report earnings of $1.10 per share on sales of $1.9bn.Shares of Tiffany fell more than 2 per cent to $83.29 after the high-end jeweller cut its full-year profit forecast, attributing the move to the effect of the strong dollar and “ongoing external uncertainties”.The New York-based company now expects full-year earnings to be 2 to 5 per cent lower than last year’s earnings of $4.20 a share. Tiffany had previously forecast minimal growth in full-year earnings.The news accompanied profits of $104.9m, or 81 cents a share, and sales of $990.5m in the three months ended in July, both short of analyst forecasts.Shares of Signet Jewelers, the company behind the Kay and Zale jewellery brands, jumped nearly 12 per cent to $135.60, after the group reported second-quarter adjusted profits that topped forecasts, driven by its acquisition of Zales last May.Overall, US equities climbed for a second consecutive day as a closely scrutinised measure of volatility slid and a reading of second-quarter economic activity surpassed expectations.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 1,987.66 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 16,654.77.

480;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;TV networks face shaky future in changing media landscape;Wall Street no longer sees traditional entertainment groups as a sure bet;Sharply falling stock markets have brought company valuations under renewed scrutiny but, for media groups, the China-induced panic is merely a sequel to an already painful re-evaluation by investors.Media shares first went into freefall at the beginning of August, when companies on both sides of the Atlantic suffered steep declines. Viacom, Discovery Communications, ITV and Time Warner were among those hit: in one day of trading, $37bn was wiped from the market value of the biggest media businesses.Television continues to be a highly profitable, cash-generative industry, but viewing habits are changing. New, digital services such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are luring talent — and viewers — from traditional broadcast and cable TV networks. Now, the hottest new programmes are as likely to be shown first on digital streaming services as they are on TV.Price is another problem. In the US, the high cost of cable and satellite packages — and a perception that the bundles of channels on offer do not represent value for money — has led to cancellations, known as “ cord-cutting”. Meanwhile, there are plenty of other forms of entertainment, such as social media, to suck up time that was once spent watching TV.But these trends are not new. So what triggered the sell-off in media shares?It began when Walt Disney, the world’s largest media company, revealed that growth had slowed at its hitherto unstoppable ESPN sports cable network. ESPN holds the largest collection of live sports rights with long deals in place to broadcast the most sought-after competitions. In the TV industry, the prevailing argument has always been that live sport is immune to changes in viewing patterns. After all, nothing keeps a US household away from their favourite match on TV. With all the drama and tension inherent in a big NFL or NBA game, it has to be watched live rather than later via a digital recorder. This means ESPN has been able to command hefty premiums from advertisers and the highest fees from cable and satellite companies that carry its channels.But sport is an expensive business. Competitors such as NBC Sports and Fox Sports are vying for the same rights as ESPN. This has driven up the prices the network pays for rights — a cost that is passed on to the cable and satellite companies that pay to carry ESPN and, ultimately, to the consumers that subscribe to pay-TV.Local broadcasters’ gravy train may be about to slow downContinue readingDisney’s revision of its growth projections for ESPN sent alarm bells ringing across the media landscape. “It showed that everyone was exposed,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research.It also coincided with dreadful audience ratings figures for some of the most popular cable channels in the US.In the past 12 months, leading networks such as MTV and Time Warner’s TNT Network have suffered ratings declines of about 20 per cent on the previous year, according to Nielsen. Some companies, notably Viacom — which owns MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central — have been grappling with falling ratings for more than a year.But it is clear that lower ratings are the new normal across the media landscape — a realisation that is, belatedly, being reflected in the valuations of the companies that produce and distribute TV programming.Record numbers of Americans are unplugging their subscriptions.Read moreAmong media executives, the hot new book this year is Michael Wolff’s Television is the New Television. He argues that TV is holding its own in the face of competition from digital players. Despite the demise of TV being long predicted, he says it continues to thrive.He makes a good point. Cutting-edge companies such as Vice Media have already jumped into TV production, quietly realising that there are more advertising dollars to be earned there than on the internet. BuzzFeed and Vox Media plan to follow suit, with both companies having secured investment from Comcast, owner of the NBC broadcast network.Investors are nervous, judging by the performance of media stocks. Discovery shares are down close to 40 per cent over the past year, Viacom’s have fallen 50 per cent in the same period, while CBS is down more than 25 per cent.Mr Wolff’s thesis may be right. But someone forgot to tell Wall Street.matthew.garrahan@ft.com
481;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-21T17:17:36Z;US TV: over the top, under the gun;Investors who ignored the rumour are selling the news;There were good reasons to sell shares in US television companies (those that make programming and those that distribute it) before this month. Ratings have been lousy for a while. HBO, which makes some of the most popular programming, has made it possible to buy its content outside a larger TV package. Streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu are growing. And distributors such as Dish and Verizon, responding to creeping declines in subscribers, have started selling basic, low-cost video packages.All of this threatens the wonderfully lucrative TV model whereby anyone wanting to watch good programming has to buy it along with a huge amount of rubbish in a bundle costing perhaps $70 month. Even so, shares in Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable churned upwards this year (the likes of CBS and Viacom, with greater sensitivity to advertising, have struggled more).So the rumour was ignored. August brought the fact. Second-quarter subscriber numbers at the cable companies declined — but no faster than usual. Then telecoms and satellite distributors released awful figures. Total pay TV subscriptions fell by around 600,000 (off a base of 100m), the worst quarter on record, according to SNL Kagan. Disney cut its targets for its TV business. The sector saw a harrowing sell off: Time Warner and Disney both fell more than 15 per cent for the month. They now trade at 15 and 18 times earnings, respectively, down three notches from July.What now? For the distributors, the days of the big expensive TV package are numbered. They must offset this by making sure customers pay up for the bandwidth they are using to watch video — whether they are watching old-style channels or streaming video. For content producers, the trick is to make shows that customers will pay for individually. TV companies used to have market power. Now they need pricing power.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
482;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-14T22:15:49Z;TV flickers as viewers find new screens;Record numbers of Americans are unplugging their subscriptions;When 24m US viewers tuned in to watch Donald Trump slug it out with his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Fox News made television history, recording record ratings for a non-sports cable broadcast.However, those who followed the political jousting on social networks had a common complaint: despite partnering with Facebook to host the debate, Fox News had made it virtually impossible to watch the event online.Twitter users traded links with illicit livestreams and lambasted the network’s failure to cater for “cord-cutters” or “cord-nevers” — people who have either ditched their pay-TV subscription or have never signed up for one.The disconnect between the knockout ratings and the incredulity of young, media-savvy viewers appeared to support the central thesis of broadcasters and pay-TV providers: cord-cutting might be fashionable for trendy elites, but it has yet to make a dent in “real” America’s love affair with television.That theory is coming under attack like never before. The second quarter is always tough for the pay-TV industry, as families move home and college students disconnect, but this time it was the worst on record for net customer losses: an estimated 566,000 people cut the cord. With the exception of Verizon, which is still rolling out its video service, all pay-TV companies lost subscribers during the quarter.Worse still, the poor performance comes against the backdrop of improving macro trends that are usually positive for the industry, including a rise in new household formation following several years of stagnation.With roughly 100m US pay-TV subscribers, the loss of half a million customers does not equal Armageddon. The subscriber base shrunk 0.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, its sharpest contraction on record, but nowhere near as precipitous as the declines seen in other media businesses such as newspapers and recorded music.But after a decade of fretting about cord-cutting, investors think it has finally arrived.Concerns over younger customers’ changing viewing habits led to a sharp sell-off in media stocks earlier this month. More than $50bn was wiped from the market value of the S&P 500 Media Index, after Walt Disney cut growth estimates for its cable networks and companies including Viacom, Fox and CBS reported declining advertising revenue.Among the companies who pipe pay-TV into customers’ homes, satellite groups have emerged as the biggest casualties of cord-cutting. These groups amassed a huge subscriber base when they entered the market in the 1990s, with deep discounts to cable products and technology that could reach rural homes — but now the disrupters are being disrupted.Unlike cable operators, satellite companies cannot offer a high-speed broadband connection — an essential for anyone wanting to watch streaming services like Netflix or Hulu.“We are witnessing the rapid erosion of satellite’s competitiveness,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “The industry is no longer growing in the US and the dynamics have shifted in favour of cable, and in favour of broadband.”Analysts estimate Dish, one of the two big US satellite groups, lost 151,000 subscribers in the second quarter, versus a loss of 44,000 a year ago. It reported narrower net customer losses of 85,000, but that figure lumped in sales of Sling TV— a new slimmed-down streaming TV service for cord-cutters that is delivered via an internet connection or “over-the-top”.Charlie Ergen, Dish chief executive, has said he expects its pay-TV business to come under pressure, and has tried to diversify by launching Sling TV and by acquiring tens of billions of dollars of spectrum— the airwaves needed to deliver wireless telecoms services.Never one to shy away from rubbing salt into the wounds of struggling broadcasters, Mr Ergen had a sharp message for content owners earlier this month: “The biggest problem in the linear [TV] business today is that viewership is going down. Advertising rates are going down. And everybody wants to go to the street and say they’re still making the same amount of money.”DirecTV, the satellite group recently acquired by AT&T for $49bn, also had its worst quarter ever, posting net customer losses of 133,000, versus 34,000 in the same period of 2014. Investors in AT&T appear to be nervous about the prospects for the new company, sending its shares down as much as 3 per cent on Wednesday after an analyst day where executives outlined their long-term strategy.For cable operators, the picture is much better. As owner of NBC, the broadcaster, Comcast got burnt in the recent media sell-off, but its cable subscription business performed quite well, shedding 69,000 subscribers versus a loss of 144,000 a year ago. Time Warner Cable lost 43,000, compared with a loss of 147,000 in the second quarter of 2014.Sesame Street deal shows how HBO’s chief has steered into the digital ageContinue readingAnalysts say cable companies are faring better because those customers who still want pay-TV services also want high-speed broadband, which can be delivered by a cable but not by a satellite dish.And even if the cable industry experiences some immediate pain from cord-cutting, some predict a win-win situation in the long term. When customers ditch their pay-TV subscriptions and flock to Netflix, HBO Now and other online services, they will still need a high-speed internet connection.“As subscribers cut the cord they are more reliant on faster broadband, which favours cable,” says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, who points out that many smaller cable companies make no profit from video services, while larger groups, like Comcast, make very little.Cable One, a small Arizona-based operator, has lost 20 per cent of its video subscriber base in a year, while increasing earnings and cash flow. “Smaller operators have already crossed the Rubicon,” says Mr Moffett. “Eventually it will come to that for all.”In the second quarter, Comcast crossed a Rubicon of its own: it now has more broadband subscribers than video ones.Still, Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research, thinks the likes of Comcast and Time Warner Cable will be less sanguine about losing video customers. “They still make money in video, which makes it harder to abandon. They charge more than it costs them [to pay affiliate fees to broadcasters]. If they are only in broadband, they have to accept lower revenues or raise their prices.”Perhaps the biggest risk for cable companies is that regulators block them from hiking broadband prices to account for lost pay-TV profits. Currently, the economics of pay-TV are quite simple: a customer pays, for argument’s sake, $80 a month. Roughly half goes to the broadcasters for content, while the other $40 goes to the pay-TV company transporting the content.In the Netflix world, Comcast et al still deliver the content, but they need to find a new way of getting paid. The Federal Communication Commission’s recent net neutrality ruling closed down at least one avenue, banning cable operators and telecoms groups from charging Netflix and others for a “fast lane” to access their viewers.That means sharp price increases for consumers, though that too could face opposition. In vast swaths of the US, customers have only one choice of cable provider. If companies were to start using their monopolies to extract more cash from customers, regulators could step in with utility-style price caps.“The real question is whether they can charge for delivery when the same video is delivered over the same network, but is being sent by Netflix,” says Mr Moffett.As investors and executives grapple with accelerating changes in media consumption habits, they are nervously eyeing one group in particular: today’s kids, who they worry may not grow up into tomorrow’s pay-TV customers.The worst-hit stock in the sector’s recent sell-off was Viacom. The home of Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central dropped 20 per cent over two days as it missed revenue estimates and reported a 9 per cent decline in US advertising sales.Once powerhouses of programming aimed at children, teenagers and young adults, Viacom’s channels have suffered sharp ratings declines as young audiences shift to watching programmes on demand on their digital devices, often without advertising. Viewership across its networks was down 18 per cent in the second quarter, according to Bernstein Research.“Viacom still boasts some attractive programming, but it appeals mainly to a younger demographic that is more likely to abandon traditional TV viewing,” said Dave Novosel, analyst at Gimme Credit.Viacom has countered that the Nielsen ratings that underpin the $70bn US TV advertising market do not capture its digital reach. It is taking steps to lessen its reliance on the research firm’s measurements, including launching a subscription online streaming service aimed at preschoolers.But traditional TV networks also face competition from online-only programmers including Netflix and Amazon, which are investing in original children’s content and licensing popular programming from Walt Disney, DreamWorks Animation and Viacom’s own Nickelodeon, which runs commercial-free, an appealing fact for many parents. This week, HBO struck a five-year deal to carry Sesame Street on its premium channel and digital platforms.A study this week from PwC, the consultancy, found more than half of eight to 18-year-olds said streaming TV was their favourite media content, ahead of cable and network TV shows, games and short videos.Their reported viewing habits told a different story, however. Those surveyed spend an average 7.8 hours a week watching traditional network TV, compared with 6.2 hours watching cable TV, 6.1 hours streaming shows and movies on a laptop, smartphone or tablet and 7.2 hours watching YouTube videos.Still, the risk remains for the TV industry that this generation of children growing up with iPhones and the ad-free offerings of Netflix is developing a very different notion of what exactly constitutes “television”.
483;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-14T16:44:30Z;Time Warner: there goes the neighbourhood;Producing its own content has been lucrative for HBO;Sesame Street has become a toll road. The producer of the beloved children’s television programme, Sesame Workshop, has signed a five-year deal with Time Warner’s Home Box Office (HBO) network where new episodes of the show will air first. Sesame Street is known for both its wholesomeness and its egalitarian access model via free, over-the-air television. So its move to a pay-TV operator known for intense and racy fare is curious. Yet although some may lament Big Bird’s migration, Sesame Workshop has made a decision that secures its financial future. For Time Warner, the licensing deal is a bold departure from its typical reliance on internally developed content.In 2014, Sesame Workshop had revenue of $104m, down over a tenth from 2013. It recorded operating losses in both years. It relies on philanthropy, fees from the not-for-profit Public Broadcasting Service network, and DVD and merchandise sales. But all that together is no match for what a deal with a commercial network and streaming service could provide.The financial terms were not disclosed but the number of Sesame Street episodes produced will double and there will be a new spin-off. HBO already offers a family channel but now has a prize property to attract children (and their parents’ money). That market has been highly sought after by the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.HBO’s revenue in the first six months of 2015 was up just 3 per cent. Between 2012 and 2014, HBO and its sister network, Cinemax, added 6.5m US subscribers, for a total of 45m. Netflix, in comparison, added 6m subscribers in 2014 alone to get to 38m in the US.In part because of its focus on self-made content, HBO’s operating margin of 35 per cent is four times that of Netflix. After accounting for the cash costs of acquiring external content, Netflix is merely cash flow break even. Time Warner has been an excellent builder. But sometimes the only way to get on to a nice street is to buy.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
484;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-10T10:39:16Z;Netflix needs to devote time to nurturing its new baby;Companies must nudge women — and men — to take up rights to ‘unlimited’ family leave;"Netflix’s new family leave policy — unlimited paid time off for parents in the first year after a child’s birth or adoption — is great. But it would be even better if the video streaming company could now ensure its founder and chief executive Reed Hastings has a child and spends 12 months out of the office caring for his newborn.If nobody takes advantage of a new progressive policy, it is worse than useless. In the case of maternity and paternity leave, whatever the brand and recruitment value of its announcement, Netflix will not advance gender equity, or reap the full business benefits, unless men also take part. The question is how to encourage staff to use their new rights.All-you-can-eat holiday policies, such as those already operated by Netflix, offer a partial lesson in unintended consequences.The need to have enough people available for vital work puts a natural limit on the ability of everyone to bunk off at once. But, without guidance, it may also lash them more firmly to their desks.Sir Richard Branson was rightly lampooned for making unlimited leave at Virgin conditional on staff being “a hundred per cent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project”. Some companies with unlimited-leave policies have had to offer monetary bait to prompt hard-pressed employees to take any holiday at all.For instance, Triggertrap, a UK photographic start-up, had to start paying a £300 bonus to staff members who take at least 10 days in a six-month period; unsurprisingly, everyone now books at least the minimum time off.Family leave differs, of course, in one rather important way: at least one person cannot stay at her desk throughout (though stories of hard-charging female executives BlackBerrying or conference-calling through labour abound). But some malign incentives are in play to persuade mothers, particularly, to return to work as soon as possible.For a study about how maternity leave affects women’s careers, due to be presented to the Academy of Management’s annual meeting this week, researchers asked students to examine imaginary job applications for management positions. They tested the perception of women who take leave of just one month, against those who take leave of a year (the norm in Canada, where this paper originated).“Women with a one-month leave were perceived as more masculine and, in turn, as more committed to their jobs and were recommended a higher salary,” the academics concluded.Parents should be able to choose how much or little time they take off to bear and care for their newborn children. That is one reason why it was wrong to attack Marissa Mayer for saying, when appointed as Yahoo’s chief executive in 2012, that she would take only a few weeks’ maternity leave and work throughout. But she should also have had support if, for instance, she had decided to change her mind and stay away for longer, whatever the reason.A good family leave programme will allow all parents on leave to stay in touch with work (if they want to), and reassure them that they can reintegrate successfully afterwards, without fear of career penalty. A bring-baby-to-work plan could also smooth the return.Men’s participation is crucial, as it is for many gender-friendly corporate policies. If Netflix’s male employees decide they prefer not to compromise their “masculinity” by taking leave, they could undermine the whole plan. In fact, if the Canadian study is right, men should probably spend longer on paternity leave to allow their partners to return to work sooner.Norway has a “father’s quota”, which gives men ten weeks of family leave. Norwegian researchers say the quota has been particularly useful in setting boundaries to what they call “limitless jobs”, as at Netflix, where it is left up to staff to organise their working hours.Forcing its staff to take a minimum amount of time off to care for their babies would “not be culturally relevant”, Netflix says. But it and other progressive companies should still nudge their employees, particularly the men and the senior staff, to exercise their new rights — and to brag about doing so.As norms change, new role models will emerge and the hidden stigma of asking for leave will diminish. But new practices need nurturing. As every parent knows, if you fail to encourage and support your children, they are more likely to grow up wrong.This article has been amended since original publication to reflect Norway’s current family leave policyandrew.hill@ft.comTwitter: @andrewtghill"
485;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-07T10:03:42Z;‘Media implosion’ spreads to European groups hit by streaming;Plunging share prices in Viacom and ITV and others reflect fears about sector’s long-term prospects;It is a golden age to watch US television — and a nightmare week to invest in it. On Wednesday alone $37bn was wiped from the market value of Sumner Redstone’s Viacom, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, Bob Iger’s Walt Disney and five other big cable and broadcast groups — in what Bernstein analysts labelled “the great media implosion of 2015”.Viacom, whose biggest star Jon Stewart left The Daily Show this week, was the worst hit stock — shares fell 8 per cent on Wednesday and 14 per cent on Thursday.By Friday the malaise had spread to Europe. ITV and ProSiebenSat.1, the biggest commercial broadcasters in the UK and Germany respectively, experienced share price declines of up to 6 per cent.The trigger for the declines was lower quarterly revenues than expected at some US cable and broadcasting groups. That sparked a deeper fear that Netflix, YouTube and others may fundamentally disrupt the sector, where operating profit margins have exceeded 40 per cent.“It comes down to one simple question,” said Todd Juenger, an analyst at Bernstein. “Do you believe pay-TV [subscribers] will slowly erode, or do you believe they will crumble into chaos?”In the US, television groups depend on two main sources of revenue: advertising and so-called affiliate fees from cable and satellite companies that carry their channels.Advertising revenues are in a cyclical recovery but face a structural threat because of the shift away from live TV and the rise of online players such as YouTube and Facebook.Lower audiences translate directly into lost ad revenue, in Viacom’s case a fall of 9 per cent year on year in the three months to June. That contrasts with the UK, where advertising is sold differently: as ITV’s audiences have fallen in recent years, ensuring consumers see an ad has become harder and brands have ended up paying more for the privilege.Viacom is particularly affected by the shift away from live TV, because its viewers tend to be young. It is far from clear that new audience metrics, which measure viewing on mobiles, “will save the day”, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.Affiliate fees are a steadier source of income, so long as viewers keep paying for their cable or satellite subscription. But if viewers switch from a pay-TV bundle, costing perhaps $80 a month, to a Netflix subscription, costing $8.99 a month, those revenues automatically fall.Disney, often seen as a case study of how to invest in content over the past decade, told investors on Tuesday that ESPN, its flagship sports channel, had seen a “modest” decline in subscribers.Netflix, meanwhile, has grown to 41m subscribers in the US and 63m worldwide. Charlie Ergen, chairman of satellite provider Dish Network, has called it “the most powerful content aggregator in the world today”.John Malone, the biggest shareholder in Discovery Communications, has admitted his companies were caught cold by Netflix — and challenged them to respond to the threat.Even so, evidence of cord-cutting — whereby households cancel their pay-TV subscriptions — is limited. A survey by research group TDG found that 84 per cent of Netflix subscribers used pay-TV, compared with 87 per cent three years ago. In Europe, where most households do not pay for a cable or satellite subscription, cord-cutting is an even more distant prospect.A moderate scenario for the US is a shift to so-called “skinny bundles”, where consumers can select only certain premium channels. That would put affiliate fees for some channels under pressure, while other less desirable channels might miss out entirely.Disney has sought to emphasise that ESPN, the dominant outlet for US sports, is a “must have” part of any skinny bundle. Analysts at Bernstein, JPMorgan and Pivotal Research have also questioned the size of the recent market sell-off — with the latter calling concerns about the long-term prospects of the US TV industry “overstated”.Bernstein said: “We may be huge pessimists on TV advertising, but we remain optimists on the bundle.”Yet others see a comeuppance for US media companies, which have for years benefited from being part of a system that offered high prices and low choice.“Most US consumers we talk to have hated their cable company for as long as we can remember,” wrote Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, last month.Even as companies begin to respond to Netflix’s threat, “you would still be hard pressed to find consumers that love their current multichannel video provider”.
486;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-08-06T20:14:29Z;Weak Viacom revenues deepen media slump;Shares across sector tumble as investors fear viewers’ changing digital habits;Viacom shares fell by more than 14 per cent on another dark day for US media companies as the owner of Comedy Central, MTV and Paramount Pictures hit earnings forecasts but missed estimates on revenues.The media sector has been in freefall since Walt Disney revised its growth outlook for its ESPN sports channel this week. The declines continued on Thursday, with 21st Century Fox closing down more than 6 per cent after steeper intraday falls. The S&P 500 Media Index fell more than 2 per cent and is down 9 per cent from its July high.Big changes in distribution and viewing habits are fuelling investor concerns as a generation of younger viewers spends less time in front of a television in favour of digital alternatives.Netflix, the on-demand streaming service, has driven much of the change in consumption patterns. Its shares hit a new high on Thursday for a market capitalisation of $54bn — more than the combined value of CBS and Discovery Communications and close to the market value of 21st Century Fox.On the day Comedy Central was due to air the last episode of its hit news satire, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Viacom missed revenue estimates because of lower revenues at Paramount, which scheduled some of its big-budget film releases for the fourth quarter.Group revenues fell from $3.4bn to $3.1bn while net income declined from $618m to $591m. Earnings per share rose from $1.42 to $1.47.Shares in Viacom, which also owns the UK’s Channel 5, are down more than 46 per cent over the past 12 months.The company, which has struggled to gain recognition for views of its shows on alternative, digital platforms, has also been hit by sharp advertising declines as its ratings have fallen. Viacom’s revenues from US advertising fell 9 per cent in the quarter.“There’s no question that our industry is in the midst of significant change,” said Philippe Dauman, the company’s chief executive, on an investor call. “Change can create uncertainty and concern but with change also comes opportunity.”Like its competitors, such as Time Warner, Viacom has increased its spending on original programming with the aim of generating additional revenue from sales to other platforms and offsetting advertising declines.“We are doubling down on quality original programming across our brands as acquired and syndicated shows are underperforming in today’s environment,” Mr Dauman added.Viacom has been embroiled in tense negotiations with cable and satellite companies over carriage of its channels and analysts warned that potential future disputes could further dent earnings. “Viacom will, from time to time, go through additional cable affiliate renewals and could be negatively impacted by any disputes with distributors,” wrote Michael Nathanson, an analyst with MoffettNathanson.The company’s channels were dropped by two operators last year — Suddenlink and Cable One — after failing to agree terms on a new distribution deal. It struck deals with other operators in the quarter, Charter Communications and MediaCom. Mr Dauman said the company had carriage deals representing more than 70 per cent of total US cable and satellite subscribers.
487;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix blazes a trail in paid parental leave;Silicon Valley may inspire, but parents need statutory help as well;Netflix is clearly an exceptional place to work, with a culture based on giving staff the freedom to work as they see fit. As the Harvard Business Review puts it, only “fully formed adults” need apply. Once employed at the video streaming company they are left to work as they see fit, including a right to take unlimited vacation. Netflix’s culture is so exceptional that a slidepack about it was described by Facebook’s CEO as “one of the most important documents to emerge from Silicon Valley”.In light of this progressive approach, people should be impressed but not surprised at Netflix’s announcement of fully paid leave to new parents for the first year after birth or adoption.Great news for the staff, and probably sound tactics from the company itself. Headquartered within hoverboard distance of Silicon Valley, Netflix has long grasped the need to attract and retain great workers. Fully formed adults often become parents, and US laws grant them minimal support. Apart from Oman and Papua New Guinea, the US is alone in providing no statutory paid leave to parents. Even the 12 weeks of unpaid leave guaranteed by federal law applies only to businesses with more than 50 staff. Two-fifths have no such rights at all.What sets Netflix apart from many of its peers is not so much the generosity of its offer as the trust it puts in its staff. This reflects a corporate culture designed to elicit better performance through a less controlling approach. Customer service agents are free to interact with clients as they please — one famously helped a customer, while adopting a Star Trek persona throughout their online conversation.Star Trek impressions aside, it would be good to see this approach emulated elsewhere in Silicon Valley, so often a trailblazer for corporate America. The scant help provided to those juggling the duties of parenthood and work is wasteful and unjust. Women in particular are faced with an invidious choice: between a satisfying career and the fulfilment of motherhood. This may lie behind declining female participation in the US workforce, a trend running counter to other developed economies.But workplace innovations cannot be transplanted piecemeal without facing possible rejection by the corporate host. Experiments with unlimited holiday time have often misfired, with staff experiencing not so much freedom as pressure. They fret about the impression imparted by a long break from work, and can react by slaving even harder. Tech firm Evernote even withholds a bonus from workers refusing a break. Faced with theoretically unlimited vacation, staff at Tribune Publishing threatened to sue, forcing the management to abandon the idea.Moreover, most workers lack the bargaining power of those at Netflix. Median wages in the US have stagnated for decades. Software developers may be in demand in San Francisco, but in most of the country “truck driver” is the leading occupation. Not everyone enjoys such job satisfaction that it keeps them turning up no matter what. Nor can most companies easily absorb the volatility caused by staff choosing their hours. For them, a perk is a cost, and if not matched by their competitors puts them at a steep disadvantage.The Netflix corporate culture is fit for a company in a race to the top, one which a soaring market valuation suggests it is on course to win. In contrast, the logic of the “ gig economy” is one that forces most companies into a race to the bottom. Most countries understand this, and therefore the need to codify rules about holidays and parental time off. Its tech trailblazers aside, this is an area where the US needs to catch up.Somebody has to do the new parent’s work / From Judith Gunn Bronson
488;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Disney: smoke and fire;ESPN may not render the group as digital-proof as hoped;The problem with firewalls is that when they are breached, those left on the inside have no defence against the inferno. Traditional cable networks in the US have been under attack for the past year as ratings have fallen sharply, a phenomenon blamed on “cord-cutting” and digital options such as Netflix. The one holdout was thought to be ESPN, the sports network majority-owned by Disney. ESPN’s portfolio of live sports gave it greater immunity to changing viewing habits. ESPN charges its distributors $6 per subscriber per month to carry its content. Other channels only charge $1. That made it Disney’s profit engine.However, when Disney reported results late on Tuesday, it lowered its earnings outlook for its networks business, primarily ESPN, from high single-digit growth in 2016 to mid single-digits. It may not seem much but is an acknowledgment that even ESPN has tough choices to make about how it adapts to a digital-first world.The standard Disney defence is that ESPN is far too compelling for subscribers to leave en masse or for pay TV distributors to drop. Yet it was recently reported that Nielsen data showed that ESPN had lost more than 3 per cent of its subscribers in the past year. Disney has denied such a level of attrition. Nevertheless, it still must make a tough decision about whether to offer its own direct-to-consumer ESPN digital product in the way Time Warner has with its HBO network.Such an offering from ESPN could lead to further erosion of lucrative cable subscribers who also pay for other properties, such as Disney Channel, via bundled subscriptions. Time Warner said on its earnings call on Wednesday that the HBO direct product had so far only led to a 1 per cent decline in HBO cable subscribers.The hint of difficulty at ESPN sent Disney shares down a tenth on Wednesday. Yet they are still up 70 per cent in the past two years. And while it sorts out ESPN, the film studios and theme parks serve as buffers.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Some viewers are “cutting the cord” in favour of online alternatives, such as Netflix, or choosing cheaper “skinny bundles” — slimmed-down, cheaper packages of channels.Disney fell 9.2 per cent, equivalent to $19bn being wiped off the company’s value. Time Warner shares fell 8.5 per cent and 21st Century Fox fell 6.7 per cent ahead of its results announcement. Discovery fell about 12 per cent.The S&P 500 media index dipped 6.3 per cent to 486.62 by close of trading in New York, its largest one-day decline since August 2011.A minor change to Disney’s guidance for ESPN seems to have triggered the sell-off. Disney reported record profits on Tuesday but warned that ESPN had experienced “modest subscriber losses”, saying that revenues from its cable and satellite partners would fall “a bit short” of expectations.ESPN is the dominant cable network owning a portfolio of live-sports rights that allow it to charge premium fees from advertisers and distributors.Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, offered a robust defence of ESPN in an interview with CNBC. ESPN, he said, “ports well to any new platform whether that’s smaller bundle, whether that’s an over the top package of programming or whether it’s a direct to consumer business”.Disney had invested in the ESPN brand, he added. “That gives ESPN the ability to essentially manage through whatever disruption is going on.”ESPN has been a cash juggernaut for Disney, and some analysts warned against writing it off. Tuna Amobi, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said “growing concerns with ESPN’s exposure to a shifting US pay-TV landscape seem to us largely overdone”.Still, the modest change in outlook reverberated around the sector, hitting companies such as Time Warner: its shares slumped despite the company not changing its guidance. It reported increased profits on the performance of its Warner Brothers movie studio and Turner cable channels. “Things are going very well for us,” said Jeff Bewkes, chief executive.The media sector is absorbing the impact of the shift away from traditional television, which is hitting ratings and advertising revenues.“While online video continues to evolve, Netflix and YouTube’s growth highlight pressure on TV advertising as consumers shift time spent to streaming video,” said Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.Kenneth Lowe, chairman of Scripps, which owns several cable channels, said the traditional bundle of cable channels was set to change. “It’s going to look different . . .[and] be priced in different forms and ways,” he said.
490;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-07-30T19:12:03Z;Amazon pays $250m to sign departing Top Gear trio for new show;Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May to compete against old show;Amazon has signed the departing presenters of BBC’s Top Gear show in a blockbuster $250m deal, as internet groups continue to encroach on the terrain of traditional broadcasters.The world’s largest online retailer said it had signed Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May to present a television series that will premiere in 2016.Amazon declined to comment on the price but people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times the deal was worth $250m for 36 episodes over three years.The deal was negotiated by Ari Emanuel’s William Morris Endeavor group. It is one of the largest ever agreed by a digital streaming group — Netflix paid $100m for two seasons of House of Cards, for example — and is evidence of the intense competition among rival operators to sign proven talent that can deliver large audiences for new services.The show will be produced by Andy Wilman, Top Gear’s long-time executive producer who left the BBC with the presenters.The move will pit the trio against the BBC’s relaunched Top Gear show, led by Chris Evans, while boosting Amazon’s video-streaming service in its battle with Netflix, which is estimated to have four times as many subscribers in the UK.In March, the BBC sacked Mr Clarkson for physically and verbally abusing Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon. The corporation then faced the task of trying to reinvent its flagship automobiles show, which generates an estimated £150m in commercial revenues each year from global sales but had depended heavily on the presenters’ personalities for its appeal.Amazon is likely to look to tap the hosts’ popularity in countries such as the US and Australia. However, some in the television industry have questioned whether the trio will be able to replicate their success — pointing out that one Top Gear imitator, Fifth Gear, largely flopped, and another former BBC presenter Jonathan Ross had become less prominent since switching to ITV.The presenters’ deal is for three series of an as yet untitled car show that will be available only to subscribers of Amazon Prime, the company’s service that offers perks such as next-day deliveries, online photo-storage and video and music streaming.Car show on streaming service will seek to capture the spirit of his BBC offering, says Henry Mance.Continue readingAmazon’s video streaming service is included with the £79-a-year Prime service. That compares with Netflix’s UK prices of between £72 and £108 a year.Enders Analysis estimates that 4 per cent of British homes have Amazon Prime, compared with 16 per cent that have Netflix.In an attempt to reflect the group’s blokish charm, the men released co-ordinated statements.Mr Clarkson said: “I feel like I’ve climbed out of a biplane and into a spaceship.”Mr Hammond added: “Amazon? Oh yes. I have already been there. I got bitten by a bullet ant.”Mr May said: “We have become part of the new age of smart TV. Ironic, isn’t it?”The BBC had offered multimillion-pound contracts to Mr May and Mr Hammond to continue to work on Top Gear. But the two presenters refused, citing their longstanding connection with Mr Clarkson.Amazon did not reveal the commercial terms for the deal.It is the second time in recent months that the BBC has lost high-profile talent to a streaming service, highlighting the challenge to traditional broadcasters from digital platforms. In March, DJ Zane Lowe quit Radio 1 to join Apple Music’s new radio station.In contrast to traditional broadcasters, which are focused on attracting large audiences for programmes, streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix have looked to invest in a handful of big-budget winners that will boost subscriptions globally.This “tent-pole” strategy has led to House of Cards, Transparent and other shows with famous casts, whose cost is a large multiple of what the BBC and ITV could pay.But it has also led Amazon to make shows with a niche fan club such as crime drama Ripper Street, which originally appeared on the BBC where it ceased because overall ratings were too small.
491;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-07-30T13:13:15Z;Netflix’s global ambitions provide a lesson for HBO;Streaming services offer growth potential for rival companies;"For a technology company, Netflix certainly makes a lot of television. At a presentation this week to the Television Critics Association in Los Angeles, the streaming video business pledged to produce 475 hours of original programming in the next 12 months.Television is moving rapidly towards a streaming model (consider Amazon signing up former Top Gear co-host Jeremy Clarkson to present a new motoring show) but Netflix has led the way. Its strategy of adding its own films and TV shows — such as series from the director Baz Luhrmann and comedian Aziz Ansari, to the content it licenses from other providers — has served it very well.The company has 65m subscribers worldwide and a gravity-defying share price, which has risen close to 600 per cent over the past five years. Its $45.4bn market capitalisation is greater than the combined value of commercial broadcasters CBS and ITV.Netflix has said it will expand into every significant global market — including China — by the end of 2016. Its service clearly resonates with viewers, who have embraced its on-demand, digital ethos.But can its sky-high valuation be fully justified, particularly when compared with HBO, the Time Warner-owned premium network behind hit shows such as Game of Thrones and The Sopranos?The two companies share some attributes. They both want high-quality programming, they both also license films from Hollywood studios and they each operate in multiple markets. HBO is accessed primarily through pay-television services — it has 46m subscribers in the US and 120m globally, whereas Netflix can be accessed digitally (although it still operates a subscription DVD business).Netflix trades at 130 times the $347m it generated in operating income over the past 12 months. HBO, meanwhile, generated $1.8bn of operating income over the same period: applying Netflix’s multiple would value HBO at an eye-popping $234bn. This is almost four times the market value of Time Warner and would not include its other assets, such as the Warner Brothers studio or Turner cable networks.This disparity is even more dramatic when considering analyst estimates for 2015 earnings. They expect Netflix to generate $0.23 per share for the year, giving the company a price-to-earnings ratio of 465. Time Warner, by contrast, is trading on a multiple of about 19 times forecast 2015 earnings.What explains the valuation gulf? There are several factors. Netflix is a direct-to-consumer business, selling subscriptions in each market in which it operates. Two-thirds of its customers are in the US so there is significant potential in other markets. It is a relatively cheap service and costs only $7.99 in its home market so there is also potential to increase prices. Its top-line revenues from streaming increased 30 per cent year on year; HBO revenues, by contrast, have been relatively flat.At Netflix, short-term profits have been sacrificed as the company invests to build a truly global streaming network. The prospect of vast future earnings, say analysts, is what appeals to growth investors.HBO is already extremely profitable which, perversely, may explain its lower multiple. It derives most of its earnings from the cable and satellite operators that carry its channels: its programming is also licensed internationally by companies such as Sky that pay it hefty fees.But, like Netflix, HBO is also in the streaming game. This spring it launched HBO Now, a standalone service that aggregates all of its content without the need for an expensive pay-TV subscription.Richard Plepler, chief executive, has talked about pursuing the 10m US broadband users who do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV. Yet there may be an even bigger prize on offer for HBO. Its streaming service could, one day, be just as globally distributed as Netflix. Its licensing deals with international partners would have to expire before this could happen. That would take time, depending on the country and the terms of its agreements.It is unclear why this potential upside has not been priced into Time Warner shares. Yes, HBO has differences with Netflix but its core business, content, is the same. From Six Feet Under and True Detective to Girls and Last Week Tonight with John OIiver, there is arguably no company better at producing it than the Time Warner-owned group.Netflix trades on a tech-style multiple; Time Warner does not. If Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, wants to unleash a similar valuation, the creativity of HBO holds the key.matthew.garrahan@ft.com"
492;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Sky shrugs off competition after adding 1m European customers;Questions remain about impact of price rises and BT’s exclusive Champions League coverage;Sky has shrugged off fierce competition, including from BT and Netflix, to add nearly 1m customers across Europe in the past year.The pay-TV broadcaster, which last November completed the £7bn acquisitions of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, has faced questions over whether it can sustain revenue growth in the face of rivals’ cheaper sports and entertainment packages.Adjusted pre-tax profit after gains on disposals and restructuring costs rose 6 per cent to £1.2bn in the year to June 30, broadly in line with analysts’ forecasts. Pre-tax profits were £1.52bn.Turnover was up 34 per cent at £10bn, but adjusted as if Sky had owned the Italian and German operations for the full year from July 1, it was up 5 per cent to £11.3bn.Jeremy Darroch, chief executive, said the tough competitive environment in the UK, highlighted by smaller British broadband operator TalkTalk, was “nothing new”.Sky’s customer numbers increased 4 per cent year-on-year in the UK, 12 per cent in Germany, but remained flat in Italy, with a decline in the last three months.Shares in the company opened 2 per cent higher on Wednesday, having already risen by a quarter this year. They later fell back 0.62 per cent to £11.17.Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, said the results were “very strong”, but there was likely to “some moderation in the rate [of] improvement” in the coming months because of BT’s Champions League launch and Sky’s own price increases.BT, Sky’s biggest rival in the UK, is expected to market its own TV packages heavily to coincide with the launch of its exclusive coverage of the Champions League this autumn.Mr Darroch said Sky Sports remained “the first choice” for audiences. “We’ll get through the next three months,” he said.He added that both high-cost subscription bundles and the low-cost streaming service NowTV were “doing well” in the UK — although he did not say whether sales were growing. NowTV is, like Netflix, a no-commitment service.Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said that average revenue per user — Arpu — was “flatlining despite price rises and increasing number of products taken”.An average Sky customer in UK paid £47 a month in the last quarter, up £1 from a year earlier. In Italy average revenue was flat, and in Germany, where Sky has been emphasising growth, it fell.Mr Darroch said that, as Sky segmented the market by offering low-cost streaming options, “a single Arpu measure is getting a lot less relevant.” Sky customers’ bills will increase by about £1 a month after recent price rises, he added.The proportion of subscribers cancelling their Sky subscription fell below 10 per cent in the UK, Germany and Italy, offsetting fears of “cord-cutting”.Mr Darroch said this was a “direct result of the investments we’ve made in [internet] connected services and quality content.”
493;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Efe Cakarel: Delivering indie films to the masses;Turkish movie entrepreneur is vying with Netflix to offer niche service;"In 2007, two entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to transform the way people watch films.One of them was Reed Hastings, the Californian co-founder of DVD-by-mail business Netflix. His decision to shift into the nascent market for streaming movies over the internet was well-timed: Netflix now boasts more than 60m subscribers and is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange with a market value of almost $50bn.The other was Efe Cakarel, a Turkish film-lover and former Goldman Sachs banker who had recently completed an MBA at Stanford. Like Mr Hastings, he decided to launch a film streaming service, except rather than offering Hollywood blockbusters he would focus on cult, classic and independent movies.But while Netflix quickly attracted a big audience, Mr Cakarel’s more modest start-up got off to a slow start. First called The Auteurs, in 2010 it was renamed Mubi, a made-up name that Mr Cakarel hoped was less elitist.“The first five years of our evolution were very challenging,” says Mr Cakarel, speaking against a backdrop of classic film posters at Mubi’s headquarters in an 18th century town house near Carnaby Street in central London. “But now we’re growing like crazy,” he says, breaking into a smile.Mubi’s subscriber base has been increasing two per cent week-on-week this year, he says. The total subscriber number — which the company has not previously disclosed — is about 100,000. The UK is its biggest market, though it is available in more than 100 countries.Mubi is minuscule next to Netflix and Amazon, which dominate the film streaming market. But the fact that it has carved out a niche for itself without burning through hundreds of millions of dollars on licensing rights and advertising has attracted influential investors.This year it raised $15m from investors including Eric Fellner, co-chairman of Working Title Films, the British production company; Pascal Cagni, former head of Apple’s operations in Europe; and Jorg Mohaupt, head of media for Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries.What sets Mubi apart from other streaming services is its decision three years ago to reduce its large catalogue of films. Today it just offers 30 at any one time. Each day a new title is added and another is removed. The service also costs less than rivals: £4.99 a month in the UK, compared with £7.49 for Netflix. Among the films available on Mubi this month are La Jetée, a 1962 French short film, and The Wave, a 2008 German sociopolitical thriller.By offering a small, carefully-curated selection of films, Mubi “eliminates the paradox of choice”, says Mr Cakarel. This is the dissatisfaction that people can feel when they are offered a large number of options. Faced with thousands of alternatives on Netflix and Amazon, people can waste time scrolling instead of watching, he says.But the core reason Mubi offers just 30 films at once, as opposed to the Net-flix model of making thousands of films available for an indefinite period, is that it is much cheaper to do so. Netflix is spending about $4bn a year on film and television content. That includes licensing from third parties and funding original productions such as House of Cards, the political drama starring Kevin Spacey. Mubi, by contrast, spends just a few million dollars a year. While Netflix makes a profit in the US, its international operations are lossmaking.Just as film streaming services are evolving, so is cinema.Hollywood blockbusters remain the mainstay. But cinemas are screening a range of entertainment including live sport, concerts and opera, known as “event cinema”. Last year, the National Theatre broadcast War Horse live from London’s West End to cinemas around the world. The play earned $5.8m at the cinema box office and brought British theatre to global audiences.Revenues from event cinema increased 32 per cent to $277m in 2014, according to analysts at IHS Technology. Of course, that is a tiny fraction of the global box office of almost $36bn.Another innovation is 4D cinemas, where seats respond to the onscreen action. As well as moving, the seats can emit bursts of air, allowing them to simulate effects such as a bullet whistling past your neck.“We’re very disciplined to not overpay for content,” he says. Mubi spends half of its gross revenues on content and 20 per cent on platform costs, leaving it with a gross margin of 30 per cent. The company does not disclose its sales and has yet to reach profitability.The downside of Mubi’s focus on licensing relatively inexpensive films from independent studios and “mini majors” such as Lionsgate, eOne, and Pathé is that the company has so far only been able to attract a niche audience of cinephiles.Although films like La Jetée and The Wave are highly acclaimed by critics, they are hardly mainstream crowd pleasers. Mr Cakarel, who studied computer science at MIT, acknowledges that Mubi needs to offer higher-budget films from Hollywood studios to attract a larger audience. “If you go to Mubi right now, it feels niche,” he says. “We’re going to start changing that perception.”This month, after three years of negotiations, Mubi struck a deal to license hundreds of library titles from Sony Pictures, marking its first agreement with one of the “big six” Hollywood studios. But Mr Cakarel’s ambitions go further than showing library films. He wants to acquire new releases, vying with Curzon Home Cinema and Netflix who are also experimenting with this model.Mubi has just completed its first such deal. It purchased the UK rights to Arabian Nights, a film about the eurozone crisis directed by Miguel Gomes, one of Portugal’s most prominent film directors, and received plaudits at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. “It’s an art house film, it’s not a Quentin Tarantino or a Woody Allen, but it’s an extremely high quality film,” Mr Cakarel says.Arabian Nights will be released exclusively on Mubi on the same day that it is first shown in cinemas. In doing so, Mubi will shatter the so-called “theatrical window” that has traditionally existed in film distribution, whereby there is a gap of several months between cinema release and availability on other platforms. “The opening weekend is when people want to see a film, that’s when they get really excited,” says Mr Cakarel. “I want to . . . release films on all channels at the same time.”Reflecting its confidence, Mubi this year splashed out on advertising for the first time with a poster campaign across the London Underground. It is also already planning to raise more money from investors next year in order to obtain even better films.Irina Kornilova, analyst at IHS Technology, forecasts that total revenues of subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD, services will increase 26 per cent this year to $9.7bn. While Mubi is a “niche proposition”, she says, it is “cheaper than anything else on the market and has a distinctive business model”, so can “squeeze itself” into film-lovers’ services.Mr Cakarel argues that Mubi has a particularly big opportunity to expand in territories outside the US, which tend to be neglected by rivals from Silicon Valley. That is the reason why he relocated Mubi’s headquarters from Palo Alto to London in 2010. He also points out that Netflix has shifted its resources away from films and towards TV shows, “leaving movies wide open for someone else to offer an amazing service”.Whatever Mubi is lacking, it is certainly not ambition. Mr Cakarel says: “What I want in 10 years is when anyone from Buenos Aires to Tokyo wants to watch a film, they ask ‘what’s on Mubi tonight?’”"

This was below expectations for earnings of $3.06 a share. Garmin maintained its revenue forecast for $2.9bn.The news came alongside preliminary earnings in the range of 70-72 cents a share in the three months to June 27, below analysts’ consensus forecasts for 90 cents a share. Sales in the range of $770m-$775m compared with forecasts for $770.7m.Results were pressured in a “difficult currency environment”, said Cliff Pemble, chief executive. “Additionally, the current competitive environment in the fitness market necessitates more aggressive pricing with higher advertising expenses,” he said.Garmin has come under pressure in recent years with competition from fitness trackers and smartphones that use Google Maps and other navigation applications, prompting it to focus on high-end devices.The company maintained its guidance for 25 per cent growth in its fitness segment for the year.“However, we expect a high degree of scepticism around any type of significant re-acceleration given the level of market competition, in particular from Fitbit and the Apple Watch,” said Simona Jankowski, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Garmin shares, which are down more than 25 per cent in the past year, fell 7.1 per cent on Thursday to $43.08.Netflix was the best performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company added 3.28m new subscribers worldwide in the second quarter, to bring its total subscription base to more than 65m.The streaming company behind hit shows such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Orange is the New Black added 900,000 US subscribers above forecasts for 600,000. Meanwhile, its overseas members increased by 2.37m, topping estimates for 1.9m new members.The company said profits slid to $26m, or 6 cents a share, but topped Wall Street estimates for 4 cents a share. Meanwhile, sales of $1.64bn were largely in line with forecasts.Netflix shares gained 18 per cent to $115.80.Shares of US paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams fell 7.4 per cent to $261.23 after the company lowered its full-year guidance and attributed its disappointing second-quarter results to a strong dollar.The Ohio-based company reported second-quarter profits of $350m or $3.70 a share on sales of $3.1bn. This missed expectations for earnings of $3.82 a share on sales of $3.3bn.Full-year earnings were lowered to a range of $10.60-$11 per share and missed forecasts for $11.26.Citigroup shares rose 3.7 per cent to $58.59, after the US’s fourth-largest bank by market value reported second-quarter profits that topped Wall Street estimates.US stocks were buoyed after the Greek parliament passed austerity measures agreed with its international creditors that cleared the way for bailout talks.The S&P 500 climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,124.29, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 18,120.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3 per cent to 5,163.18.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
495;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix: face off;Can the streaming company become HBO — before it turns into ESPN?;"The US online video industry has the circular logic of an identity theft movie: Netflix is determined to become HBO — before HBO can become Netflix. With any luck, John Travolta and Nick Cage star in the movie version.One company is the most consistent creator of high-quality video content; the other has the most popular video streaming site. As HBO is building its own streaming service, distinct from its usual pay-TV distribution channel, Netflix is pouring money into its quest to compete with HBO’s shows, producing original series and licensing more content from studios. Netflix’s current content obligations rose nearly 40 per cent from a year ago to $2.6bn in the latest quarter, outpacing the 30 per cent growth in paid subscribers.Netflix says that making original content is cheaper, in dollars per viewer hour, than buying it. Fair enough. Some licensing deals can be punishing. But the original content strategy increases fixed costs — Netflix’s payments for others’ shows vary with viewership. Fixed costs will sting if user growth should slow.The risk is that Netflix is less like HBO, and more like ESPN, the sports cable TV channel controlled by Disney. ESPN has been struggling not only with falling subscriber numbers, but also with increasing costs for the rights to the sports it airs. Other channels have bid up the cost of the most prominent games and leagues. Netflix can relate. Even though (for example) Amazon has just a fraction of Netflix’s video streaming traffic during peak viewing hours, its presence and free spending could change bidding dynamics when, say, Netflix’s deal with Disney comes up for renewal.Over the past two years, Netflix’s content costs have been roughly $40 per subscriber. Not too bad, considering that the monthly Netflix subscription generates revenue of almost $100 per year per customer. The challenge is that Netflix may have little room to raise prices; instead it must develop its customer base to cover its expanding costs.Free cash flow is already negative (and got worse in the most recent quarter). And its ambitious international expansion programme — Japan, Spain, Italy and Portugal are next — could eat further into cash flows in the second half of this year. This pattern can hold up as long as subscriber growth continues — otherwise, well, ESPN’s fate awaits.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
496;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-07-15T22:10:18Z;Netflix dashes past 65m subscriptions;Shares surge through $100 mark on higher than expected user growth;Lawyer-turned-superhero Daredevil helped Netflix dash past its subscription growth estimates in the second quarter, as it added 3.28m members around the world to pass the 65m mark.The streaming video company gained 900,000 US subscribers, more than its forecast of 600,000, and 2.37m international members, compared with a projected 1.9m.Its shares jumped more than 9 per cent to $107.67 in after-hours trading in New York. The stock price has doubled this year, leading the S&P 500.“Around the world, everyone wants internet TV. It’s just a better experience than linear TV,” said Reed Hastings, chief executive, on a conference call with analysts.Netflix credited the subscriber surge to a particularly strong slate of original programming, including the superhero crime drama Daredevil and the latest season of Orange is the New Black, a dark comedy set in a women’s prison.Original content is one area where the company has been making hefty investments on its quest to lead what it calls “a wave of global internet TV adoption”. Later this year Netflix will premiere its first original films online and in theatres.It is also undertaking an aggressive international expansion with the aim of reaching 200 markets by 2016. Netflix will launch in Japan, Spain, Portugal and Italy this year and is exploring expansion into China next year.Netflix expects content costs, for both originals and licensed shows and films, to approach $5bn next year, with an growing share of investment devoted to its own programmes “both in absolute dollars and percentage terms”.It will also boost its marketing spending as it faces increased competition from new online video providers including Comcast, Showtime and HBO.The cost of its content binge and international growth are weighing on profits, however.Net income fell to $26m, or 6 cents a share, from $71m, or 16 cents a share, a year ago, compared with Wall Street’s expectations of 4 cents. Revenue rose to $1.64bn from $1.34bn, compared with a forecast $1.65bn.In the international division, a loss of $92m was less steep than the $101m the company had projected, due to stronger than expected subscriber growth. Mr Hastings said he expects international losses to peak next year and for the company to achieve “material” global profits from 2017.In the third quarter, Netflix forecast it would add another 1.15m US subscribers and 2.4m international members. It expects net income of $31m, or 7 cents a share, on $1.6bn in revenue.Netflix executed a seven-for-one stock split on Tuesday night, in a move that will allow it to increase its shareholder base by making it easier for both retail and institutional investors to buy blocks of stock.On Wednesday, in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, Netflix said it would support Charter Communications’ $90bn-plus plan to become the second-largest US cable operator by rolling up Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.The company had been a strong opponent of Comcast’s attempt to buy Time Warner Cable, which the largest US cable group called off this year.The key to winning Netflix’s backing was a new pledge from Charter not to charge online services for the traffic they incur on broadband networks. Netflix pays fees to other broadband providers, including Comcast and AT&T, to ensure its video can stream without interruption.“It frees us up from getting taxed by an internet service provider,” Mr Hastings said. Netflix is urging US regulators to impose a similar policy as a condition of approving AT&T’s $48.5bn proposed acquisition of DirecTV.

Shares of Delta Air Lines rose 2.1 per cent to $43.36 while shares of American Airlines gained 2.9 per cent to $42.42.Shares of Marathon Petroleum rallied 7.9 per cent to $58.78 after the company said its master limited partnership, MPLX LP, an owner of oil pipelines, would buy natural gas processor MarkWest Energy Partners.The combined company would have a $21bn market valuation and would be the country’s fourth-largest master-limited partnership. Shares of MarkWest Energy gained 13.8 per cent to $68.01 while shares of MPLX LP fell 14.5 per cent to $59.03.US stocks bounced on Monday as eurozone leaders reached an €86bn deal on a Greek bailout.The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 2,099.60, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 17,977.68 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.5 per cent to 5,071.51.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
498;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-07-02T08:17:19Z;Audience satisfaction with main terrestrial TV stations rising;Rise in approval rating comes despite 15% cut in budgets for UK programmes;Audiences are more satisfied with Britain’s main television channels than they were in 2008, even though the broadcasters’ budgets for UK programmes have fallen by 15 per cent in real terms.A review by regulator Ofcom concluded that public-service broadcasting — including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 — “continues to bring significant benefits to society”.Its intervention comes as the government prepares to determine the BBC’s funding and remit for the next 10 years, and considers whether to privatise Channel 4.Public-service broadcasters are seeking to compete with streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, as well as with the growing number of channels available on Freeview and pay-TV.Ofcom said that public-service broadcasters “need to adapt their models to maximise commercial revenues and efficiencies”. Other immediate challenges included making television news attractive to young people— who watch nearly one-third fewer hours of television news than they did in 2008.“Research suggests that for 16-34s the internet is already replacing the TV as their main source for news, sport and other information,” the regulator concluded in what is a statutorily required periodic review.Public service broadcasters are facing funding challenges in the UK: the BBC’s licence fee is currently frozen, while advertising revenues have bounced back since the financial crisis, but remain similar to 2008 levels.£440mCut in spending on UK programmes 2008-14In response, ITV and Channel 4 have lobbied for US-style retransmission fees, where pay-TV operators would pay to include their channels on their platforms.That system could generate hundred of millions of pounds a year for the broadcasters, but Ofcom said it would require “a new and potentially complicated regulatory system”. There is also “currently no guarantee that all the money would be spent on public service content,” it said.The broadcasters cut spending on UK content by £440m in real terms between 2008 and 2014. That was partly because inflation in the TV industry had relatively low, Ofcom said.Children’s programming was particularly badly hit — with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 cutting their spending by 74 per cent. But there was also a fall in spending on dramas, despite the high profile of shows such as Downton Abbey and Doctor Who.Spending on new UK drama has fallen 44 per cent since 2008 to £278m. The number of hours of new drama on TV has also fallen 41 per cent — with broadcasters shifting to “cheaper genres”, Ofcom said.British public service broadcasters enjoy certain benefits, such as free spectrum and the prime positions on the programme list, but have obligations to air certain amounts of British programming.
499;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-07-01T11:54:02Z;How a subscription model could benefit your business;Technological change is helping drive the return of a method of commerce that slipped out of vogue;"Launching a subscription business is not easy. Just ask Apple, which last week decided to pay artists during the three-month free trial period of its $9.99-a-month Apple Music service, after singer Taylor Swift complained.Shifting to a subscription model requires mindset, management and marketing changes — and an ability to anticipate, and sometimes absorb, the impact on suppliers, customers and financial results. Adobe Systems, the software group that in 2011 switched to selling cloud-based subscriptions rather than licences paid for in advance, had to endure three years of flat sales before this month reporting record quarterly revenues.But the business model that in the pre-digital age was the preserve of periodicals, book-of-the-month direct sales companies and golf clubs is spreading fast. Companies in search of the magic combination of customer loyalty, predictable income and user information are selling pet foods, cosmetics, socks and cheese for monthly payments and challenging incumbents with more traditional models.Dollar Shave Club, set up three years ago to ship fresh razor blades to customers every month, is reported to be worth $615m following a recent funding round, obliging Gillette, among others, to sharpen its approach. The BBC’s funding model, based on an annual licence fee, paid by anyone in the UK who receives its programmes, is under pressure as subscription-based services such as Netflix expand.Peter Fader, co-director of Wharton business school’s Customer Analytics Initiative, expects subscription commerce to become “a mainstream part of our lives” over the coming years. The marketing professor says most companies are over-anxious about how customers will respond to change.Why are subscriptions catching on now, centuries after newspapers pioneered the concept? One reason is the combination of technological and demographic change. John Warrillow, author of The Automatic Customer, subtitled “Creating a subscription business in any industry”, says everyone is now happier to use credit cards online and “young people are more comfortable with this notion of access rather than assets — [they] have no need to own things any more”.Another reason, according to Prof Fader, is that earlier association of subscription models with aggressive direct marketing tactics is fading.Technology has also helped the biggest collectors of customer data, such as Amazon, to retrofit subscriptions to existing customer choices. Amazon’s Subscribe and Save model invites users to select items they regularly reorder and put them on a monthly delivery schedule, with the added enticement of a 15 per cent discount on the usual price.Loyalty is one prize for companies that get subscription services right, even in industries usually associated with big one-off purchases. In 1996, General Motors launched OnStar, its in-car “service assistant”, which links live advisers and in-car computer systems, in the US.The idea was to create a separate stream of revenue from subscriptions that currently range from $19.99 to $34.99 a month (2015 buyers can connect their vehicles to a basic service for free for five years). Now OnStar is more about ensuring customers keep returning to GM vehicles. The group is about to introduce OnStar for its European passenger car. According to Dan Ammann, GM’s president, increasingly the important question is not how much metal can carmakers sell, but “who owns the customer relationship”.Author John Warrillow outlines nine subscription models. Here are four:The all-you-can-eat library: Apple Music or Spotify’s premium service, for example, offering unlimited access to a warehouse of tracks
The surprise box: “Curated goodies” shipped to your home monthly, such as cheese from the Artisanal Premium Cheese Club or five samples of deluxe beauty products from Birchbox
The peace-of-mind model: A form of insurance against something you care for — for instance, your car or your laptop, which LoJack will track for you
The simplifier: List managers, decluttering apps and services such as Hassle Free Home, to manage your mansionYet for many companies, shifting to a subscription model can be painful. A simple move from taking lump-sum payments upfront alters cash flow. To sustain a subscription model involves assessing what the lifetime value of customers, or groups of customers, is likely to be, and reviving some of the “direct marketers’ tricks”, Prof Fader says. One is “RFM analysis” — recency, frequency and monetary value: how recently and how often does the customer buy, and how much do they spend?Phil Libin, chief executive of Evernote, the online workplace productivity tool, recognises some of these pressures. Last month, Evernote introduced a tiered “good-better-best” approach to pricing, adding more features for higher subscriptions, after realising only 5 per cent of customers were using the premium version.Evernote’s most important insight was that customers were not choosing to use the basic service — they were defaul­ted automatically towards it. “Unless you took action, we never told you about the other version,” says Mr Libin. “When you go to a restaurant, there’s an expectation you are going to order something. You can sit there eating breadsticks, but at some point, you’re going to order. We were just letting people hang out.”So far, the Evernote transition to a three-tier subscription system seems to be paying off. But Mr Libin is under no illusions about how hard it will be to keep satisfying customers, preventing their defection to rival services or halting a slide back towards the free version (renamed Evernote Basic, to underline its bare-bones features).Greg Alvo, founder of OrderGroove, a subscription technology platform used by 80 brands (and advised by Prof Fad­er), says one pitfall of shifting to a subscription model is to focus only on the number of new subscribers rather than how to value and retain them, a mistake he equates to “pouring money into a leaky bucket”.Mr Warrillow says subscription businesses should aim to “change the consumer’s behaviour in that first 30 to 60 days”. Ron Adner, of Tuck School of Business, whose book The Wide Lens looks at how companies sustain the wider structure of relationships that make innovative business models successful, says the consumer has to think “I’m getting so much more than I used to”.Relying on customer inertia for re­newing the subscription is another weak strategy. As renewal dates approach, clever companies not only remind you to pay, they also push out an escalating series of messages reminding you to use the service. At the moment of renewal, the customer is more likely to remember why the subscription was useful.At the same time, as Ms Swift’s initial rejection of the new Apple Music contract shows, neglecting any part of the chain of interests involved in sustaining a subscription model can be dangerous.Prof Adner also warns that the proliferation of subscription offers could it­self create a problem. “I think there’s a household limit to how much you can possibly sign up for,” he says.But others believe that customers and businesses are only just appreciating the real value of the subscription model. OrderGroove’s Mr Alvo says the most successful subscription-based companies will simplify customers’ existing behaviour.He adds a word of warning, though, straight from the bad old days of direct marketing scams: “They have to be different from subscription services that lock you in and rip you off.”"

The activist investor has just sold his remaining stake in the online video company, making a $2bn profit. But when he first invested in 2012, he wanted Netflix to sell itself. In interviews, he even threatened to “go to war” with Netflix if necessary. Today Netflix’s share price is 12 times what it was then. Mr Icahn’s returns would have been very much lower had Netflix directors heeded his advice back then.The question of when to sell a company, and when to hold on and keep building it, is one that comes up frequently in Silicon Valley. Not every company that withstands pressure from Mr Icahn has done as well as Netflix. Look at Yahoo, which passed up a $47bn offer from Microsoft in 2008 (contrary to the wishes of Mr Icahn). Today Yahoo’s enterprise value is just $34bn — and most of that is down to its stake in Alibaba, which was hardly a consideration in 2008. By some analysts’ calculations, today’s market values Yahoo’s core business at close to zero.Sometimes investor pressure can be helpful when a founder or chief executive does not want to sell. This is particularly true when the company is struggling to grow. Take Motorola, which split itself up under pressure from Mr Icahn. Its phone business went to Google for a huge premium (60 per cent over the undisturbed price), and the share price of its equipment unit, still publicly traded, has risen 55 per cent since the split. Software company BEA also benefited from the Icahn nudge, and sold itself to Oracle for $8.5bn in 2008.However, for fast-growing companies the opposite risk exists: selling too soon. Facebook wisely held out against a $1bn offer from Yahoo in 2006; today it is worth $240bn.The lesson here is not that Mr Icahn’s advice is worth following, or that it should be ignored. It is that Mr Icahn — like other activists — has no more insight than anyone else into the perfect moment to sell a company.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
501;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-06-24T17:51:21Z;Carl Icahn sells out of Netflix, touts Apple instead;Activist investor made $2bn total profit on video streaming group;For Carl Icahn to make the same percentage return on his Apple stake in the next three years as he made on his Netflix holdings in the last three, Apple would have to be worth $9tn in 2018.That might be a stretch, even if everyone on the planet buys an Apple Watch.Nonetheless, Mr Icahn cemented his position as one of Apple’s most enthusiastic public boosters on Wednesday, as he also revealed that he has sold the remainder of his Netflix stock for a $2bn total profit.“Sold last of our $NFLX today,” the veteran investor announced on Twitter, using the stock exchange ticker symbol for the video streaming group. “Believe $AAPL currently represents same opportunity we stated NFLX offered several years ago.”Mr Icahn grabbed nearly 10 per cent of Netflix shares in 2012 when the stock price was languishing at $58 and investors were losing confidence in the company’s growth prospects. He cashed in half the stake a year later at around $341 per share and has been selling intermittently since then. He has now unloaded the remaining 2.3 per cent stake after a share price surge this year.On Tuesday the stock traded at $684, almost 12 times the price at which Mr Icahn seized his original opportunity.Meanwhile, Mr Icahn’s hedge funds have $6.8bn tied up in Apple shares, just under 1 per cent of the $745bn company. Apple’s price has already doubled since he took his initial stake in August 2013, and he has been one of the company’s biggest cheerleaders on Twitter and in television interviews.Apple is the sort of company that only comes along twice in a century, he said last month, and it has an “absurd” low valuation.Mr Icahn’s technology stakes are overseen by his son, Brett, and also include eBay and Nuance Communications.Netflix’s rocketing share price has been fuelled by the television industry’s shift from pure broadcasting to on-demand viewing. Audiences are increasingly choosing to watch Netflix programming rather than traditional cable channels, which have been hit by ratings and advertising declines.Most Netflix subscribers are in the US but the company has been on an aggressive expansion push, launching its video streaming service in Latin American and European markets. It added a record 4.9m subscribers in the first quarter, lifting its global base to more 60m.“Netflix is winning the daily war for consumer time and attention,” Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, wrote in a recent note. He has set a price target of $950 a share. “We believe Netflix could reach 140m global subscribers by 2020,” he said.The recent rise in Netflix shares has propelled its value past some of the biggest names in US media. The company now has a market capitalisation of $41.69bn — significantly more than Viacom ($26.7bn), which owns a movie studio and portfolio of cable channels, and CBS ($28.2bn), the leading US broadcast network.

That is a place-holding figure that typically changes.Freeport paid $9bn for two oil and gas producers, McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration and Production, in 2013, when crude was trading at far loftier levels.The company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FMOG. Barclays will advise on the listing.Ford shares gained 1 per cent to $15.50 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy” and raised the price target from $18 to $19.“The key driver is a superior growth outlook at Ford as it starts to see the volume, mix, and pricing benefits from the F-150 launch in the second half of 2015, as well as still improving positioning in China,” Patrick Archambault, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said.Meanwhile, shares of General Motors fell 3 per cent to $35.16, after Mr Archambault and his team downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral” and cut their price target from $47 to $40.Netflix shares jumped as much as 3 per cent after the streaming site’s board approved a seven-for-one stock split plan. Shares, however, pared back gains after activist investor Carl Icahn said on Wednesday that he had sold the last of his stake in the company after Netflix’s shares almost doubled this year.US stocks fell after two straight days of gains as hopes for a Greek debt deal began to fade.The S&P 500 declined 0.7 per cent to 2,108.58, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 17,966.07.

503;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
504;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-06-23T17:10:32Z;Hulu deal with Showtime to offer internet video service;Deal marks first foray into premium cable programming and live television feeds;"Hulu, the online streaming company, has struck a deal with Showtime to offer the premium cable channel’s new internet video service at a discounted rate to Hulu subscribers.The partnership marks the first time Hulu will bundle another company’s standalone streaming offering with its own and its first forays into premium cable tv programming and live television feeds. It comes as Hulu attempts to compete more aggressively with streaming rivals including Netflix.Hulu subscribers can get Showtime’s new service, which launches in July and does not require a traditional pay-TV package, for an additional $8.99 a month — or $2 less than what Showtime will charge on other platforms including Roku and Apple TV boxes and Sony’s PlayStation Vue internet TV bundle. Subscribers to Sony's PlayStation Plus premium service will also be offered the discounted $8.99 rate through Vue.Subscribers can watch Showtime’s original shows, documentaries, sports and films without commercials — another first for Hulu, which began life as a free, ad-supported service and shows advertising even in its $7.99 a month paid tier. The Showtime subscription includes access to the network’s east and west coast live TV feeds.“We’re excited to be the first premium service available to Hulu’s growing subscriber base,” said Matthew Blank, Showtime chief executive. “Hulu is an important launch partner for Showtime as we continue to expand our service across new platforms and distributors, reaching new consumers wherever a broadband connection is available.”The move comes as media companies, technology groups and TV distributors are rushing into the streaming market.Showtime rival HBO launched its own $14.99 a month offering in April, while free-to-air broadcast channel CBS and children’s network Nickelodeon launched their own services last year.Sony and DirecTV sell subscription bundles of channels and are expected to be joined soon by Apple. Verizon is putting together an online video package for mobile devices.In the relatively new world of internet TV, eight-year-old Hulu, a joint venture of Comcast’s NBCUniversal, Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox, is a veteran but has not captured the buzz of Netflix and Amazon, nor spent the amount its rivals have on big content deals, despite the deep pockets of its owners.Hulu counts more than 9m US subscribers, up 50 per cent from a year ago, but trails behind Netflix’s 42m US members.Hulu is an important launch partner for Showtime as we continue to expand our service across new platforms and distributorsAmazon does not disclose the number of subscribers to its Prime service, which includes on-demand video, but Macquarie analysts estimate about 40m worldwide.Hulu is stepping up its efforts to compete this year. It has won the rights to some high-profile programmes, including Fox’s hit drama Empire and the entire nine-season run of Seinfeld. It is also investing more in original programming, an area where Netflix and Amazon have won acclaim and awards.Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura, estimates Hulu will spend up to $900m on content this year, compared with Netflix's estimated $4bn. He pegs Hulu's enterprise valuation in the range of $6.7bn to $9.7bn.Publicly traded Netflix's market capitalisation of $40.9bn this year passed that of CBS, presently at $28.7bn, and is closing in on Fox's $68bn.""If the recent acquisition of the streaming rights for Seinfeld tells us anything, it is that Hulu now possesses the resources and latitude to sustainably step up its investment in streaming content rights,"" Mr DiClemente wrote in a recent note.""We believe that Hulu’s owners view Hulu as a strategic (though smaller) counterbalance to Netflix in the internet video space; as such, Hulu is likely to continue to aggressively reinvest revenue into both original and acquired content to drive further growth, growth which appears to be accelerating in 2015.""Hulu executives say the company will also boost its marketing efforts to promote both its library of shows from networks including ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS and the BBC as well as its own original series, to make sure consumers are aware of the broad reach of its programming."
505;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-06-11T22:23:28Z;US to start shake-up of internet rules;Telecoms groups barred from throttling internet traffic while selling ‘fast lanes’ to providers;The US will start implementing a sweeping overhaul of internet regulation on Friday after an attempt by the telecoms industry to delay the introduction of tough new rules was dismissed by an appeals court.Broadband service companies will be forbidden from blocking or throttling some internet traffic while selling “fast lanes” to other content providers, after the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said a challenge by the telecoms sector had not satisfied the requirements for a stay of the new rules.The decision marks a partial victory for President Barack Obama, who shocked the industry last autumn by calling for broadband to be reclassified as a public utility, warning that “gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the internet’s growth”.It is also a vindication of the campaign waged by Silicon Valley groups such as Netflix and grassroots digital activists, which had warned the White House that telecoms companies like AT&T, Verizon and Comcast had the power and incentive to distort the internet.The Federal Communications Commission heeded the president’s wishes and in February unveiled a new “open internet” or net neutrality regime. It was instantly challenged by telecoms companies, which said the US telecoms watchdog did not have the authority to reclassify broadband services.While the decision paves the way for the new regime to be implemented immediately, it could still eventually be struck down. The court agreed to an expedited review of the case, which both the FCC and its opponents have called for.Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, took to Twitter to welcome the development. “Today’s court decision means Open Internet rules will take effect Friday. It’s a good day for consumers and innovators,” he said.He added: “Blocking, throttling, fast lanes and other efforts to come between consumers and the internet should now be things of the past.”The National Cable & Telecoms Association, a lobby group, said “being granted a stay is always a long shot” but it was as “confident as ever that we will prevail”.It added: “We are pleased that the court has agreed to expedite the review of our appeal of the FCC’s misguided decision to impose utility-style regulation on internet networks. We are now ready to get to the merits of the case.”Telecoms companies deny they are blocking or throttling traffic and say the rules will have little immediate effect, but have warned that the rules will have a chilling effect on investment in broadband infrastructure.

There are two price plans: Y500 ($4) a month for 20 hours of music, or Y1,000 for unlimited use, with a Y300 discount price for students.“With the Y500 basic plan and student discount especially, we want to bring a range of content to younger users and those who aren’t familiar with streaming services,” said Jun Masuda, the president of Line Music.Japan’s total music market has been in gentle decline, falling from Y370bn in 2010 to Y298bn last year. Unlike other countries, however, the digital market has struggled to become established.Digital music sales grew steadily to a peak of Y91bn in 2009 but then entered a five-year slump, only stabilising last year, with 5 per cent growth to Y43.7bn.The arrival of Apple Music, which is expected to reach Japan relatively early, is set to shake things up. Apple’s marketing muscle and ability to reach millions of iPhone users could make it a force in the Japanese music market.Line, which is owned by South Korea’s biggest internet portal operator Naver, is seeking to expand its range of services beyond smartphone messaging as it gears up for an initial public offering, probably later this year.The company has done well in Japan and other parts of Asia, with 205m monthly active users and annual revenue of $702m. Analysts estimate Line could attract a market value of more than Y1tn.Sixty per cent of its monthly active users are based in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. Line has struggled to make headway against rivals such as WhatsApp in the US and Europe.
507;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Time Warner Cable battle highlights industry upheaval;Aftershocks expected with Altice the potential loser as Malone’s Charter closes in;The battle over Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable television operator, reflects the profound change sweeping through the industry and is expected to set off a series of aftershocks.After days of haggling, it emerged on Monday that Charter Communications, the third-largest cable TV company, which is backed by media tycoon John Malone, was closing in on buying TWC in a $78bn deal including debt. The potential loser is Altice, the European cable group chaired by billionaire Patrick Drahi, which has also been interested in acquiring New York-based TWC, according to people familiar with the matter.Luxembourg-based Altice made its first foray into the US only last week by striking a $9.1bn deal to acquire a controlling stake in Suddenlink, the fifth-largest pay-TV operator, and is expected to look for another deal to muscle up against a combined Charter-TWC and industry leader Comcast.This all comes at a time when subscription TV providers are slowly but steadily shedding customers. The US pay-TV industry has shrunk by 0.5 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. “That may not sound dramatic, perhaps, but it’s the fastest rate of decline on record,” he says.Smaller cable groups, many of which have been in family control for years, are seen as likely takeover targets. Shares of Cablevision, the fourth-largest pay-TV operator controlled by New York’s billionaire Dolan family, surged 22 per cent last week on speculation about further consolidation. Privately owned Cox Communications is also seen as a target.In recent years, industry executives have argued that consolidation would help cable operators better compete against their rivals in the satellite and telecoms sectors, face off against programmers over rising content costs, and address the growing threat of so-called cord-cutters— consumers who turn to online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon and HBO Now.Cable companies have countered antitrust concerns by arguing that their geographical spread means that no single group has a national presence: the industry evolved in a fragmented way that gave large operators control of regional monopolies.But recently, growth in their broadband businesses has surpassed TV services. Comcast counted more internet subscribers than video customers for the first time in the second quarter of this year.The emerging primacy of broadband has changed the picture for the industry and, crucially, for regulators. Following Comcast’s withdrawal of its bid for TWC in April, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the chief US media and telecoms watchdog, said the deal “would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation, including the ability of online video providers to reach and serve consumers”.With this in mind, the same regulatory concerns that derailed Comcast’s attempt to buy TWC may figure in scrutiny of any tie up between Charter and TWC.“We believe after the TWC-Comcast review, the government now believes Comcast is already too big, and Charter-TWC creates another Comcast,” says Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research. “It will get blocked.”As well as regulatory issues, Charter could face questions about how it is going finance a purchase of TWC, and also the level of indebtedness at the New York-based company after the takeover.Charter is expected to propose offering $195 a share for TWC — well above the $132.50 it bid for the New York-based company last year. TWC’s stock closed at $171.18 on Friday.In the current climate, size, price and leverage mean littleContinue readingHow Charter, which has a large debt load on its balance sheet, can finance a large cash offer for TWC may be a critical factor.Meanwhile, Mr Drahi has made a name for himself by using leverage to develop Altice’s European media empire — an approach he is now taking to the US.Altice only put $1.2bn of cash on the table to buy Suddenlink, in a deal that valued the target at $9.1bn including debt.There are questions about a possible counter bid by Altice for TWC. The most important one is whether, as such a new entrant to the US market, Mr Drahi is prepared to take on so much so quickly. The Suddenlink deal brings Altice’s shopping bill over the past 15 months to a staggering €36bn.But the other doubt is how he will fare when competing against his former mentor, Mr Malone, particularly if regulators are inclined to block a Charter purchase of TWC. For Mr Drahi, there is still much to play for.Additional reporting by Adam Thomson in Paris

Now, however, the neurotic director of Annie Hall is having second thoughts.Amazon’s deal with Mr Allen to produce a series for its streaming service was announced in January, hot on the heels of its surprise triumph at the Golden Globes, when Transparent, its series about a transgender father, was among the winners.But in an interview with the Deadline Hollywood news site, Mr Allen said he had “regretted every second” since striking the deal, as he revealed a surprising lack of familiarity with streaming, television — or Amazon.“I don’t even know what a streaming service is; that’s the interesting thing,” he said. “When you said streaming service, it was the first time I’ve heard that term connected with the Amazon thing. I never knew what Amazon was. I’ve never seen The Sopranos, or Mad Men. I’m out every night and when I come home, I watch the end of the baseball or basketball game, and there’s Charlie Rose and I go to sleep.”“Amazon kept coming to me and saying, please do this, whatever you want,” he said.“I kept saying I have no ideas for it, that I never watch television.”The online retailer did not give up, he added. “They kept making a better deal and a better deal . . . they offered a lot of money and everybody around me was pressuring me, go ahead and do it, what do you have to lose?”“I have regretted every second since I said OK. It’s a job within my usual schedule. But I am not as good at it as I fantasised I might be.”“I’ve been struggling and struggling and struggling. I only hope that when I finally do it — I have until the end of 2016 — they’re not crushed with disappointment because they’re nice people and I don’t want to disappoint them.”Mr Allen is among several big name directors and actors to have made the leap from filmmaking to creating original programming for a new generation of streaming services.I have regretted every second since I said OKDavid Fincher, the director of Gone Girl and The Social Network, was among the first with House of Cards, for Netflix. Since then, others have followed, such as the Wachowski siblings, best known for the Matrix trilogy, who are producing Sense 8 for Netflix.At stake is the future of home entertainment, with streaming services attracting viewers that once watched cable television. Streaming is also disrupting cinema viewing, with Netflix and Amazon producing their own films for distribution to their subscribers.Amazon recently unveiled plans to produce a dozen movies in 2015. Last year, Netflix unveiled plans to premiere the sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on its online service on the same day the film will appear in big-screen Imax cinemas. It has also signed an exclusive deal with Adam Sandler for the comedian’s next four films."

AT&T and the FCC declined to comment.Netflix was one of the leading voices in a broad coalition that opposed Comcast’s ill-fated $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable, which was terminated last month amid signs that regulators were planning to block the deal.However, a spokesperson said Netflix was not opposing the AT&T-DirectTV deal outright, but rather seeking remedies to ensure the combined company would not be able to abuse a dominant position.“While we are participating in the government’s review, we are not opposing the merger. We’ve been highlighting concerns about AT&T’s broadband practices and the need for appropriate remedies since last September,” the spokesperson said.AT&T-DirecTV was announced in the shadow of the Comcast deal. I don’t know if it was deliberate but it saved them from a lot of scrutinyNow that Comcast has pulled its offer for Time Warner Cable, many internet campaigners and companies have turned their attention to the AT&T deal, according to John Bergmayer, an attorney at Public Knowledge, the consumer advocacy group that also played a prominent role in the “Stop Comcast” coalition.“There is no doubt that AT&T-DirecTV was announced in the shadow of the Comcast deal. I don’t know if it was deliberate, but it saved them from a lot of scrutiny they otherwise would have got,” he said.Public Knowledge has petitioned the FCC to reject the deal, based on fears that it will hurt online video platforms and make the internet less open. Mr Bergmayer said that AT&T should be forced to sign up to the FCC’s latest open internet rules, which it is challenging in the courts, along with other telecoms groups.In its letter, Netflix argued that AT&T would be able to use data caps and usage-based pricing to make services like Netflix more expensive compared to its own online video offerings.The FCC seeks to make merger decisions within 180 days of a deal being agreed, but it stopped the clock on the AT&T-DirecTV deal in mid-March at the 170-day mark. On the same day it also paused its countdown on the doomed Comcast-TWC merger. The decisions were made to allow time for a District of Columbia appeals court to rule in a related case.At the time the FCC said: “The Commission reserves the right to restart the clock as it believes will best serve the public interest and it intends to provide further guidance as it becomes appropriate.”

Sales rose 1 per cent to $2.58bn.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 51 cents a share on sales of $2.54bn.“Our growth this quarter again came from multiple engines, with particular strength in the UK and emerging markets; our luxury and make-up brands; and online, speciality-multi and freestanding store channels,” said Fabrizio Freda, chief executive.The company said that sales were unfavourably affected in all of its geographic regions because of the strength of the US dollar.Sales in the Americas, which accounted for nearly 42 per cent of its sales last year, rose 4 per cent but climbed 8 per cent on a constant currency basis.In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which accounted for 38 per cent of Estée Lauder’s sales last year, sales fell 1 per cent but climbed 10 per cent on a constant currency basis.In Asia Pacific, reported sales were flat but 5 per cent higher when stripping out the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.The company also lifted its full-year guidance and said it expects constant currency sales growth of 6-7 per cent. It had previously forecast 5-6 per cent growth.Estée Lauder, which gained 15 per cent in the past year, was among the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500, rising 4 per cent to $86.90.Shares of car rental company Avis Budget declined nearly 4 per cent to $53.71 after the company reported an unexpected first-quarter loss as dollar strength weighed on its results.The company said it lost $9m, or 9 cents a share, as sales slipped 1 per cent to $1.85bn.

511;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-04-30T17:14:25Z;EU to probe popular US sites over data use and search;Brussels comes under pressure from Germany and France to crackdown on likes of Google and Amazon;Brussels is set to widen its front against US tech companies just two weeks after the launch of its landmark competition case against Google by initiating a separate probe into a wider range of online platforms.The move marks a first step towards tighter EU regulation of the internet and comes with the European Commission under pressure from France and Germany to take a tougher line on tech groups such as Amazon and Google.In a draft plan for a “digital single market” encompassing everything from online shopping to telecoms regulation, the commission said it would probe how online platforms list search results and how they use customer data. The latest draft of the plan, seen by the FT, will be approved by the commission next week.The plan could also bring in stricter rules for video-on-demand services such as Netflix and messaging apps like WhatsApp and Skype that have become big rivals to traditional European media and telecoms companies.Companies such as Airbnb and Uber are also likely to be roped into any investigation into platforms, which will aim to determine whether they are abusing their market power in the so-called “sharing economy”.The EU’s intensifying assault on big American tech groups has triggered accusations in the US, including from President Barack Obama , that the bloc is engaging in protectionism.The plan for a “comprehensive assessment” of online platforms comes after French and German ministers urged the EU to launch an investigation into the role played by the US internet giants.Earlier this week, the French economic minister Emmanuel Macron and German economic minister Sigmar Gabriel called for a “general regulatory framework for ‘essential digital platforms’” in a letter to the commissioner overseeing the reforms that was seen by the FT.They wrote: “We believe that the growing power of some digital platforms is a wider challenge that warrants a policy consultation with the aim of establishing an appropriate general regulatory framework for ‘essential digital platforms’.”The commission will start the probe “before the end of 2015”, according to the draft. It will look at the role of paid-for links and advertisements in search results, along with the ability of individuals and businesses to move from platform to platform.“Some online platforms have evolved to become players competing in many sectors of the economy and the way they use their market power raises a number of issues that warrant further analysis beyond the application of competition law in specific cases,” the 17-page document reads, in a clear reference to the Google antitrust case.Elsewhere in the draft, the commission said that it will “review” whether on-demand services such as Netflix should be subject to the same rules as traditional TV broadcasters. According to the document, on-demand services are sometimes “subject to lower obligations” than their television peers.We believe that the growing power of some digital platforms is a wider challenge that warrants a policy consultation’Other measures to be proposed include plans to make it easier for small merchants in the EU to sell goods to customers in other countries. As part of the measures, ecommerce groups would be subject to their own national laws rather than the buyer’s as well as a set of EU-wide contractual rights. The commission will also crackdown on the opaque pricing structures used by parcel companies for deliveries between EU countries.The commission said it would launch long-awaited copyright reform before the end of this year, which will probably spark a tussle between large media groups, artists and producers as well as consumer groups.Brussels will aim to introduce the “full portability of legally acquired content” and allow “cross border access to legally purchased online services”. A crackdown on online piracy will focus on “commercial scale infringements”, rather than individual abuses.Finally, the commission will launch another attempt to reform telecoms regulation in the EU, to apply the same rules for traditional telecoms groups and internet rivals such as WhatsApp and Skype.
512;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-04-28T18:20:39Z;Media: Comcast’s next act;After Brian Roberts’ $45bn bid for Time Warner Cable was blocked, will he move to counter the internet upstarts?;In sport, as in business, Brian Roberts does not like to lose. The amateur squash player has won five medals at the Maccabiah Games, often known as the Jewish Olympics. At the same time, he scored with Comcast, turning a company co-founded by his father in 1963 into America’s largest provider of cable television and broadband internet services.Comcast’s growth has been fuelled by aggressive dealmaking by Mr Roberts, who has masterminded the multibillion-dollar acquisitions of AT&T Broadband and NBCUniversal. But last week, the chief executive’s winning touch deserted him when Comcast withdrew its $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable after spending the past 14 months trying to convince regulators to approve it.The combination of the two largest internet and cable operators would have created a broadband behemoth that controlled the high-speed access of 57 per cent of connected US homes. But from the start, Mr Roberts’ deal faced stiff opposition. Open internet advocates and Hollywood writers joined Comcast rivals such as Netflix and Discovery Communications to lobby against the merger, arguing it would have too much control over the broadband and TV markets. The US justice department and Federal Communications Commission concluded that a tie-up was not in the public interest.“It’s not going to happen,” a flat Mr Roberts said when Comcast withdrew last Friday. “In the end, we’ve got to move on.”The question now is where Mr Roberts moves next. With a steady revenue stream flowing from millions of pay TV and broadband subscribers, Comcast has performed well even as the digital revolution has upended much of the media world. But a rapid reshaping of the television industry poses big challenges to Comcast and its competitors, leading some analysts to conclude that the company should push hard into next-generation wireless technology to satisfy rocketing demand for online video. Others say it should look beyond the US for growth.“Since Comcast announced the TWC deal last February the entire television landscape has changed,” says James McQuivey, a media analyst with Forrester Research.A generation of young “cord-cutters” has drifted away from cable, leading channel owners to, belatedly, try to reach them through other means. HBO, the premium network behind shows such as Game of Thrones and True Detective, recently launched a standalone, “over the top” service that does not require the kind of expensive, bundled subscription that Comcast sells.CBS, Nickelodeon, the children’s network, and the WWE Network are already selling their programmes directly to consumers, with new services also on the way from Comcast’s own NBC network and Showtime, the premium cable channel.And a new set of cheaper, online-only channel bundles is putting further pressure on the cable and broadbandpackages sold by Comcast for between $50 and $200 per month. Sony recently launched PlayStation Vue, an internet TV service that costs $50-$70 a month — much less than a typical cable package — and includes channels such as CBS, Nickelodeon, Fox and Discovery.Dish Network’s $20 a month Sling TV service has also made waves because it includes the sought after ESPN sports channel, as well as AMC, home of The Walking Dead zombie drama. Apple is stepping up its presence in online TV this year after holding talks with broadcasters including Fox and ABC. Verizon, the telecoms group, plans to launch an online video package for mobile devices.The new services come as digital video has surged in popularity — at the expense of cable TV. Netflix recently passed 60m subscribers, with 41m of them in the US: it is ploughing money into original programming such as Orange is the New Black and Daredevil to complement a broad library of licensed TV shows and movies. Amazon has also got into the digital video business, winning plaudits for original online programmes such as its Golden Globe-winning Transparent and commissioning a comedy series from Woody Allen.Netflix says its users streamed 10bn hours of video in the first quarter. That accounted for nearly 6 per cent of TV viewing in the US — and represented 43 per cent of the drop in cable and broadcast ratings (audience size), according to MoffettNathanson analysis of Nielsen data. “We believe Netflix’s US total streaming hours relative to traditional television will steadily rise,” says Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. The trend of lower TV ratings has been “gaining strength over the past few years as Netflix has gained subscribers”.From humble origins to a thwarted $45bn bid for Time Warner CableThe owners of cable channels are feeling the heat from these viewing trends, with Viacom among the worst hit. Controlled by 91-year-old billionaire Sumner Redstone, it has suffered some of the sharpest ratings declines, with viewing down 18 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to MoffettNathanson’s analysis. BET, which is aimed at African-American audiences, fell 22 per cent, Nickelodeon was down 17 per cent and MTV declined 14 per cent.Lower ratings mean lower advertising revenues. Cable channels owned by Comcast’s NBCUniversal are among those feeling the pinch: at NBCU’s cable channels, which include CNBC, USA Network and Bravo, revenues from advertising fell 5.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from a year earlier.Meanwhile, online video channels are surging. At a recent presentation to advertisers by Crackle, Sony’s ad-supported online video service, comedian Jerry Seinfeld mocked the networks that, two decades ago, provided the platform for his success. “The TV networks are hoping you don’t figure out that they are over and there’s nothing special about it,” he said. He said his show, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, which is returning to Crackle for a sixth season in June, attracted 100m total views last month. “What is the internet? It’s a way of reaching people — it’s just television.”Netflix has built its increasingly global business around the idea that “internet television is replacing linear TV”, or watching shows at the time they are broadcast, in the words of chief executive Reed Hastings’ recent letter to shareholders.“The world’s leading linear TV networks, such as HBO, ESPN, Canal Plus and BBC, are moving into internet TV,” he wrote. “Eventually, as linear TV is viewed less, the spectrum it now uses on cable, fibre, and over-the-air will be reallocated to expand internet data transmission. Satellite TV subscribers will be fewer and more rural. The value of high-speed internet will increase.”Not surprisingly, streaming video consumption is highest among the youngest consumers, with nearly three-quarters of households headed by someone under 35 subscribing to a service such as Netflix or Hulu Plus, according to Nielsen — the same consumers who are least likely to be pay-TV subscribers. Traditionally, advertisers have coveted these younger viewers.For the world’s biggest media companies, including Comcast, reaching that next generation means giving them access to content when, where and how they want to watch it.Richard Plepler, chief executive of Time Warner’s HBO, describes the premium channel’s new standalone service, launched this month, as a “millennial missile”. HBO says it is targeting the service at the 10m US homes that only have broadband connections — “a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped,” Mr Plepler said when he unveiled it.The big shift to online viewing explains why Comcast was so keen to acquire TWC. The consumers deserting linear television in favour of on- demand, online viewing still need internet access: a Comcast-TWC combination would have been the main gateway to those new services for more than 30m broadband subscribers. With the purchase of TWC blocked, Mr Roberts needs another route to growth.He has several options, including investing in new ways to deliver video services to customers Comcast does not currently serve. Comcast is limited to operating in markets where it owns and operates physical cable infrastructure — about 30-40 per cent of US households, according to Forrester. This is why it wanted to increase the size of its available market by combining with TWC.But new, wireless broadband technology may eventually mean that it can deliver services to US markets without needing any physical infrastructure. If it does not invest in this technology it risks losing out to competitors that do, says Mr McQuivey.Dish Network, the satellite TV group controlled by Charlie Ergen, has staked a large bet on US wireless spectrum, which could be used to deliver broadband internet. That could open the door to packaging its Sling TV service with a wireless internet connection — giving consumers an alternative to Comcast’s cables for their high-speed connections.“Say you can get television from Sling and broadband from a wireless broadband supplier like Google or Dish,” says Mr McQuivey. “Suddenly you don’t need Comcast for anything. Comcast is going to be threatened by a new set of broadband providers.” He says Mr Roberts should invest some of the funds saved on the TWC deal on wireless broadband, which could be deployed in markets where the company has no physical presence.The international market is another option for Mr Roberts. Comcast, which also owns the Universal movie studio and theme parks, has a minimal television or internet presence outside the US. With the TWC bid no longer viable, Mr Roberts may look to the “cable cowboy” John Malone for inspiration.The 74-year-old billionaire was behind much of the US cable consolidation but has spent the past few years on the acquisition trail in Europe, spending €35.3bn since 2010 on cable groups such as Virgin Media in the UK, Kabel BW in Germany and Ziggo in the Netherlands.Pay TV penetration is much lower in Europe — less than 60 per cent of available households compared with about 85 per cent in the US — so there is more room for operators such as Mr Malone’s Liberty Global group to grow.The European market would be more competitive than what Comcast has been used to. In the early days of the US cable industry, the companies that were first to lay their pipes in a town or city could operate in those markets unchallenged: for rivals, the cost of laying cable in an area that was already served was prohibitive. This led to the regional monopolies that still exist today: TWC is the sole cable operator in large parts of New York and Los Angeles, for example.But in the UK, operators are allowed to use infrastructure owned and operated by BT, which means multiple operators can serve the same market. A successful bid for Sky, the satellite operator that owns rights to English Premier League football, would give Comcast immediate entry to the UK, Italian and German markets, following the recent three-way merger between Sky, Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. A bid for Liberty Global would be another option.Or Mr Roberts could double the bet he made in 2013 when Comcast acquired Universal by buying another content company, such as Time Warner, which owns HBO, or ITV of the UK.Mr Roberts has proved he is willing to think big, having done some of the largest deals the US media and telecoms sector has ever seen — spending $72bn on AT&T Broadband and $30bn on NBCUniversal. But he has had some misses too, being rejected by Walt Disney after Comcast made a $54bn offer and now, 11 years later, with the failed bid for TWC.As a hardened squash player Mr Roberts knows all about working the angles to win. But with the rules of the media game evolving rapidly his next shot will need to be well placed.
513;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Hollywood studios win landmark victory against Popcorn Time;Court order requires UK’s biggest internet providers to block access to sites linked to app;"Hollywood has won a landmark victory in the UK against Popcorn Time, a popular app for illegally downloading movies that has been nicknamed the “Netflix for pirates”.The Motion Picture Association, a trade body that represents the six major Hollywood studios, on Tuesday won a High Court order requiring that the UK’s biggest internet service providers block access to four sites linked to Popcorn Time.This is the first time anywhere in the world that Popcorn Time sites, which receive several million visitors each month, have been targeted and ordered to be blocked.Hollywood has worried about Popcorn Time ever since it was launched just over a year ago, providing internet users with an easy way to watch films and TV programmes for free.What has caused particular concern is that Popcorn Time has opened the illegal filesharing underground to casual users.It has a similar kind of attractive design and easy-to-use interface as legitimate services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. But behind its glossy interface, the application relies on BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer filesharing protocol that has long been used by illegal sites such as The Pirate Bay.Stan McCoy, president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at the Motion Picture Association, said: “Popcorn Time has no legitimate purpose and it only serves to infringe copyright.”“The film and TV industry is comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women working hard behind the scenes to bring the vibrant, creative stories we enjoy to the screen; content theft undermines that hard work.”The High Court’s order requires that the UK’s five major internet providers — BT, EE, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media — must block their users from assessing four sites that provide the Popcorn Time app: popcorntime.io; flixtor.me; popcorn-time.se; and isoplex.isohunt.to.This legal process — provided for by Section 97a of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act — was first used by the MPA in 2011 and has subsequently been used by rights holders in the film, music and sports sectors to require UK ISPs to block access to illegal sites. A total of about 100 sites are now blocked under the act.Research by Incopro, an intellectual property protection company, has found that ISP site blocks have had a significant impact on illegal sites. On average, sites in the UK lose 73 per cent of their usage following a site block and maintain those levels consistently over time.Critics of site-blocking say it is ineffective because determined pirates can find their way to sites through virtual private networks or other methods that route their traffic via another country. Others argue blocking is dangerous because it could lead to censorship of the web."
514;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-04-26T14:54:59Z;Apple set to be latest to suffer dollar impact;Currency strength set to wipe more than $2bn from quarterly sales;A surge in the US dollar has already wiped more than $20bn from first quarter sales at the largest US companies, a sum larger than revenues generated by Intel, Caterpillar or Goldman Sachs in the first three months of the year, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.With the US earnings season approaching the halfway stage, that figure is likely to jump further. Apple, the world’s most valuable company, reports results on Monday and warned in January that the currency move could slice more than $2bn from quarterly revenues.So far during the current reporting period, General Motors, IBM, Procter & Gamble, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson have experienced $1bn-plus haircuts on sales as they translated revenues earned abroad back into US dollar terms.Known as “top-line growth”, revenues reflect how quickly a business is growing. In recent years, large multinational US company’s sales have benefited from the combination of a weaker dollar and robust expansion across emerging market economies.However, a sustained rise in the dollar since last summer and weakening global activity has weighed heavily on a host of blue-chip US companies.While 71 per cent of S&P 500 companies have eclipsed first-quarter earnings expectations, 55 per cent of corporates have failed to beat revenue forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ.“Top-line growth is incredibly challenged. The dollar is even a bigger problem than people thought,’’ said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG.However, US equities indices have reclaimed record territory, with investors cheered by overall earnings topping lowered expectations of analysts. The S&P 500 closed last week at a new peak of 2,117.69, while the Nasdaq has surpassed the dotcom bubble high set in 2000.“While earnings are not great, they’re better than expected,’’ said Mr Greenhaus.The analysis of earnings statements, slide presentations, conference calls and executive commentary spanned more than 100 of the roughly 190 S&P 500 constituents that have reported first-quarter results.The FT analysis showed a $20.1bn reduction in sales, which would have lifted the groups’ reported revenues of $762bn by 2.6 per cent. When excluding financials, sales would have been more than 3 per cent higher. While the technology industry has been particularly exposed to the shift in the dollar — it generates more of its sales abroad than any other sector — a broad swath of companies have warned of the effects.$20.1bnReduction in sales of the more than 100 S&P 500 constituents that have reported so farMcDonald’s, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Tyco, Coca-Cola, Kimberly-Clark, 3M, Caterpillar and PepsiCo were among the dozens that pointed to currency swings when delivering results.“Currency has been powerful headwind for all multinational companies,” said Dan Kelley, portfolio manager at Fidelity. “It is something companies are having to think differently about — what the implications are going forward and whether it makes sense to alter their cost structures.”Only half of the companies disclosed enough information to calculate the dollar’s effect on sales — itself a somewhat nebulous figure as executives must consider changes to underlying operations, volume of goods sold and divestitures or acquisitions along with foreign exchange swings.

YouTube is preparing its own subscription video offering, and Netflix recently topped 60m global subscribers.US adults spend an average of one hour and 16 minutes a day watching digital video, according to researcher eMarketer — more than double the 36 minutes in 2012.Vessel is trying to court content creators with a two-tiered model that offers them a cut of both subscription and advertising revenues, as well as a premium environment for their work. YouTube’s forthcoming ad-free service will also offer video creators a share of subscription fees.Subscribers to Vessel’s $2.99-a-month service are able to watch exclusive videos before they are released to the wider public. There is also a free tier that carries content similar to YouTube, but unlike Google’s mass market service, video creators must have their work accepted by Vessel.Both tiers carry advertising, and Vessel is offering content owners 70 per cent of the ad revenues, compared with YouTube’s 55 per cent.Google is preparing to launch a YouTube subscription service that will allow users to skip advertisements when watching online videos.Continue readingVessel will use its new funding to secure more deals with content creators to premiere their videos on its service. It has already signed up Discovery Communications, A+E Networks, Vivendi’s Universal Music and Warner Music Group. In addition, it will feature YouTube personalities including GloZell Green, who recently interviewed US President Barack Obama, and a reality show with actor Alec Baldwin.Vessel’s launch has come as media groups experiment with models to encourage consumers to pay for digital content.Jay Z, the hip-hop star, recently joined other popular musicians to relaunch Tidal, a paid digital music streaming service where artists can offer fans exclusives, such as recent videos from Beyoncé and Rihanna.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
516;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-04-16T11:01:33Z;Netflix: foreign policy;The video streaming service is doing well in the US, but international growth is costly;In the latest series of House of Cards, the American president is challenged by his rivals abroad, threatening his domestic agenda and marriage. Netflix, the maker of the show, is also facing challenges overseas, as it seeks to expand to 200 countries by the end of next year (from 50). The US business is doing well, with 40m paying members, up a sixth from last year, who contribute most of group profits. The overseas expansion is lossmaking.Netflix’s long-term success will depend, however, on whether it can replicate its US success in international markets, which account for less than a third of streaming sales. The lofty share price — trading at more than 100 times forecast 2016 earnings — seems to take international success for granted. But this is not guaranteed. Few countries in the world watch as much TV as Americans, or pay as much for it. Many big markets already have strong local leaders in video streaming. A Bernstein report found that in Germany, where Netflix launched in September, it is used less extensively than rival Amazon Prime. Other countries, such as Mexico, have limited broadband penetration.And the expansion is costly. The company reported $300m in cash outflows over the past 12 months, and expects the negative free cash flow to continue for the next few quarters due to international growth. Netflix is still profitable, but as the pace and scale of international expansion grows, that too could come under threat. Content streaming obligations (money the company has agreed to pay for future content), which are growing due to licensing deals and content for new markets, stand at $9.8bn, up 40 per cent from a year ago. The company expects earnings per share to fall to 26c next quarter, a fifth of where they were a year ago. All this may be forgivable for those who think Netflix can be profitable outside the US — and have the patience to wait for that day. For everyone else, Netflix does not look like compelling viewing.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

The company expects to add 2.5m customers in the current quarter.Netflix’s global ambitions were underscored on Wednesday by its announcement of a new partnership with the creators of the BBC’s Planet Earth for a nature documentary series called Our Planet.The programme, which will premiere on Netflix in 2019, is a collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund and Silverback Films, the production company led by Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey, who created Planet Earth, Frozen Planet and Blue Planet.“Netflix is clearly focused on replacing linear television with on-demand, ad-free programming on a worldwide basis. The company has begun to not only license content on a worldwide basis, but also create content that has worldwide appeal,” said Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research.Despite the bumper subscription growth, Netflix took a financial hit in the first quarter from foreign exchange swings and the costs associated with global growth and creating original content.Net income fell 55 per cent to $23.7m, or 38 cents a share, from $53.1m, or 86 cents a share, a year ago, well below the 60 cents Netflix had projected and analysts’ expectations of 69 cents. Stripping out currency losses, earnings per share would have been 77 cents.Less is more with PlayStation Vue, but cutting the cord is not as cheap as first appearsContinue readingRevenue rose to $1.57bn from $1.27bn, in line with expectations.Losses in the international business widened to $65m from $35m a year ago, as a $15m foreign exchange impact offset subscriber growth.The company raised $1.5bn in the debt market in February to fund its growth plans, which include substantial investments in original programmes.Users streamed more than 10bn hours of video in the first quarter, which saw the debut of the third season of House of Cards and the launches of the comedy series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and the drama Bloodline.“Our original content strategy is playing out as we hoped, driving lots of viewing in an economic way for Netflix while bolstering the positive perception of our brand and service around the world,” said Reed Hastings, chief executive, and David Wells, chief financial officer, in a letter to shareholders.Netflix’s surging subscribership comes as the streaming digital market that the company pioneered is seeing a rush of interest from media companies including Time Warner’s HBO, technology groups such as Apple, and Dish Network, the pay-TV provider.Mr Hastings said the proliferation of internet TV was beneficial to Netflix.“The attention of the new companies is only creating a bigger ecosystem and drawing in more people,” he said. “All the internet services are great values in comparison to the big [cable and satellite TV] bundles.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil

He also expected international profits to surpass US profits by 2020.Analysts who take a less optimistic view on the stock have raised concerns that over-the-top television launches, such as HBO Now, increase competition for viewers and consumer dollars at the Los Gatos, California-based company.Mr Mitchelson, however, said he did not believe these launches would hurt the company because in the long term, it could drive “cord cutting and expand the market’’ as viewers cancel cable television services and watch shows via online providers.The UBS ratings action comes after analysts at Citi upgraded the stock on Friday, bringing the number of brokerages covering the stock with a “buy” or higher rating to 24.Netflix shares, which have gained 46 per cent in the past year, rose 4 per cent to $474.68.Shares of JetBlue Airways rallied after the company reported a 9.2 per cent year-on-year rise in March traffic and a near 8 per cent rise in passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM), a key industry metric, according to preliminary figures.The company added that it now expected a 4.5 per cent year-on-year rise in PRASM in the first quarter, up from its previous guidance of 3 to 4 per cent.Helane Becker, analyst at Cowen & Co, said: “We believe this was driven by broad strength in the domestic market.” She added: “The March quarter also benefited from the earlier Easter and Passover holidays that pulled forward stronger demand from April. This will negatively affect April to the same degree.”JetBlue shares gained 4 per cent to $19.85, temporarily buoying other airline stocks including United Continental and American Airlines. Shares in both companies rose more than 1 per cent before paring back gains by the close of trading.Shares of Clovis Oncology, the US cancer drug company, gained 13 per cent to $87.49, after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and raised the price target to $117 from $68.Analysts said they now expect adjusted peak sales of $2bn for the company’s main pipeline lung cancer drug, Rociletinib, up from their previous estimates for $1.5bn. They also said they “now see higher probability of M&A”.Driven by an earlier rally in technology stocks, the Nasdaq Composite briefly crossed back above the 5,000 mark before closing the day 0.2 per cent lower at 4,988.25.Likewise, the broader S&P 500 struggled to find a footing as the first-quarter earnings season began.

519;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-04-10T19:41:02Z;Fredric Brandt, cosmetic dermatologist, 1949-2015;The man who was once dubbed the ‘Baron of Botox’;Dermatologist to the stars, Fredric Brandt had a client list that included Madonna, not to mention a string of others whose identities were kept private. While an ever more image conscious age ensured that the Miami physician became something of a celebrity himself, as a researcher he changed the way his profession administers cosmetic treatments such as facial fillers.For Botox, the botulinum toxin that was initially used in smoothing out wrinkles around patients’ eyes and mouth, Brandt developed a method that injected the paralysing substance into opposing muscles. At its best, for those who flocked to Florida for his treatments, the procedure brought much the same effect as a facelift.“The knife and scalpel were not his thing,” says Roy Geronemus, a partner in the New York practice Brandt also opened. “He used techniques that really hadn’t been done before, which eliminated or delayed the need for surgery.”Demand grew apace. “He liked to characterise himself as the world’s biggest user of Botox, and that was probably true,” says David Pyott, the recently departed chief executive of Allergan, which makes the drug and has just been taken over by the Dublin-based Actavis.The man once dubbed the “Baron of Botox” by W Magazine, the Condé Nast glamour monthly, expended much effort on cultivating his own appearance too. Along with an exercise regime that included daily sessions of yoga, Brandt underwent regular injections himself of the products he purveyed.Self-medication is not unusual for top cosmetic physicians, according to Mr Pyott, who says many elite practitioners inject themselves or ask their closest colleagues to do it for them. “They need to know how it feels and exactly what the product does to you.”What the doctor was less able to cope with were the bouts of depression to which he fell prone. Brandt hanged himself at home on Easter Sunday, aged 65.Fredric Sheldon Brandt, who is survived by his brother Paul, was born on June 26 1949 in Newark, New Jersey, where their parents owned a candy store. He graduated from Rutgers University and gained a medical degree at Drexel University, before completing residencies in nephrology and oncology.After settling on dermatology as a specialism, Brandt moved to Florida, launching a private practice in 1982. He became known as a leading authority on cosmetic injectables, opening his New York practice in 1998 where he treated many of his celebrity clients.Fittingly for an aesthete, he developed a passion for art, adorning his New York apartment, his Miami townhouse and his two practices with pieces by Damien Hirst, Richard Prince and Anish Kapoor. Even while launching a range of skincare products, authoring two books and hosting a radio show, he devoted most time of all to treating clients. The Miami practice became one of the largest of its kind, allowing him to participate in clinical research trials of the latest cosmetic injectables. “There were 15 exam rooms, all with great artwork,” says Mr Pyott.Colleagues describe a workaholic who often put in 12-hour days but who also found the time to indulge in retail therapy. Joan Kron, a veteran beauty journalist, joined him on several shopping trips followed by lunch in Barneys, the upscale Manhattan store. Brandt would eat only fish and vegetables, a diet apparently influenced by earlier indulgences in his parents’ sweet shop.Yet his unusually primped and puffed appearance threatened to overshadow his achievements in the clinic. Brandt was repeatedly mocked in the media, says Ms Kron. “Every time there was a profile done of him, he would ask if I thought they were making fun of him. In many cases they were.”A few weeks before he died, Net­flix streamed what was seen as a parody of him in a comedy series called Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Friends say that though the show hurt his feelings, Brandt was already coming to find his despairing inner gloom hard to endure.Yet for all his success in a field oft disparaged by other physicians, his friends describe a man who never stopped seeing himself as a real doctor — and with justification. When her mother, then 103, broke out in shingles, Ms Kron phoned Brandt for advice. Cancelling his afternoon appointments, he rushed to her with medication.His depression was kept from most who knew him — especially his clients, who during procedures were instead treated to boisterous renditions of show tunes. It was “a way of disarming their anxiety”, says Dr Geronemus. Or as Ms Kron observes: “Clowns are always the ones who are the saddest people.”

Creators will receive revenue from the fees but the letter did not say how much it would charge or how the fees would be split.“By creating a new paid offering, we’ll generate a new source of revenue that will supplement your fast growing advertising revenue,” the YouTube team wrote in the email, which asked recipients to update the terms of their contracts for the new service.The email implied the service could come as early as this year, saying: “It’s an exciting year for YouTube, as we push into uncharted territories.”YouTube is already working on a subscription service for its music videos, which is in beta testing, and users can subscribe to individual channels such as sports or language instruction channels, to watch their videos without ads.Most YouTube content is short-form videos, often uploaded by individual creators or vloggers rather than the expensively produced TV and movie content such as House of Cards or Modern Family seen on Netflix and Hulu.But users have been able to buy or rent individual movies and TV shows for a couple of years, and this move could attract more professional content, opening the way for a service that could prove a more serious threat to other companies offering streaming subscriptions.As younger consumers turn away from their TVs and reject costly cable subscriptions, YouTube could be among the technology company beneficiaries. Apple is also planning an online TV service, which it will serve through its Apple TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the matter, while Amazon streams content, including some original programming, to customers of its Prime service.A YouTube spokesperson said: “While we can’t comment on ongoing discussions, giving fans more choice to enjoy the content they love and creators more opportunity to earn revenue are always among our top priorities.”YouTube faces competition from an increasingly video-focused Facebook, which has seen a surge in the number of videos shared on the social network and is ploughing into the online video advertising market.YouTube made $1.12bn in net video advertising revenues in the US in 2014, according to eMarketer, which expects the site’s share of the total US digital video advertising market to slip from 19.3 per cent last year to 17.7 per cent by 2017.
521;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-04-08T15:10:47Z;BBC shifts focus to ‘internet-centric’ programme delivery;Technology chief says broadcaster has to change with audience habits;"The BBC is to be remodelled as an “internet-centric” broadcaster, as the web becomes the main way it reaches British viewers, according to the executive given the “poisoned chalice” of leading a technological transformation at the corporation.In his first interview since becoming the BBC’s technology chief last July, Matthew Postgate said the organisation was trying to adapt to younger audiences who watch television and listen to radio over the web on mobile devices.Some have suggested the BBC should become like Netflix and fund itself through viewer subscriptions. If you were in charge, what TV channels and radio stations would you offer?
Continue readingHe said this required changes in the way the corporation produced and delivered content to compete against internet companies that are encroaching on the territory of established broadcasters, such as Netflix and Amazon, .“It’s my job over the next five years to put in place the production foundations to be internet first,” he said, adding that media groups “are going to have to learn lessons if they’re going to be in a position to compete with organisations that were born in the digital age”.But Mr Postgate’s power to effect change may be restrained, as he moves into a role that has become politicised and described by some commentators as a poisoned chalice.In 2013, the BBC scrapped a £100m, five-year project called the Digital Media Initiative, which was designed to give programme makers full access to its archive. Tony Hall, director-general, said it was “better to close it now rather than waste more money trying to develop it further”, and the project received scathing criticism from a committee of MPs.In the aftermath, John Linwood, the BBC’s former technology chief, was suspended and then sacked, but last year he won a case of unfair dismissal against the corporation.Mr Postgate said the organisation had learnt lessons, and there was no longer any desire “to do very large, overarching, multiyear projects, but instead we’re thinking about technology as a more agile and iterative process”.Mr Postgate, whose salary is £225,000 a year, is a long-time BBC executive who previously led its research and development arm and was part of the team that launched the iPlayer service.A few months into the job, he has made several changes, including creating a “business change” team to assist departments as they shift towards digital processes and renaming his department “BBC engineering”, replacing “BBC technology”.“Engineering is something that you do, whereas technology is something that you buy,” he explained.Though accepting that the Digital Media Initiative was a fiasco, Mr Postgate remains committed to the idea of moving the BBC’s vast archive online and making the corporation tapeless.As quietly and cheaply as possible, the BBC has made some of the changes sought from the DMI project. For example, from this year, programmes are being produced using digital files rather than recorded on tape. “Rather than trying to deliver one large project, we’ve been taking off the different components and moving forward,” he said.As the corporation prepares to discuss its next royal charter after May’s general election, with the future of the licence fee up for debate, the BBC is desperate to show it can use technology to make savings.Part of the change is to deliver more programming online. Last year, the corporation said it would axe BBC Three, the youth-oriented channel that has been the home to comedies such as Gavin and Stacey and reality shows like Snog, Marry, Avoid?. Instead, BBC Three will be available online only, while its programme budget will be slashed from £55m to £30m.Mr Postgate said this was more than a cost-cutting exercise and reflected how the BBC was responding to its audience’s preferences. The BBC would continue to experiment with ways to deliver programmes, he said, and certain channels and shows would make more sense being accessed over the web.“I think the direction of travel for the BBC is that we need to make sure that our portfolio is relevant in the internet age,” he says. “BBC Three was a brand that you could move from one platform to another relatively easily.“The others you look at, something like Radio One, is already a brand that exists as much on other platforms as it does on FM [radio] or [digital radio], whereas BBC One ultimately is almost the home of the national conversation and it’s maybe suited to more broadcast-oriented technologies.”These trends will add to the strain on Britain’s broadband networks, as video traffic takes up more bandwidth.In the US, where Netflix accounts for as much as 35 per cent of internet traffic at peak times, the video streaming service has struck multimillion dollar deals with Comcast and Verizon, paying to ensure its films and television shows are streamed smoothly across broadband networks.But Mr Postgate rules out coining similar deals with the UK’s largest broadband groups, such as BT and Virgin Media. “We pay in the model of the internet that’s always been with us,” he says.Instead, he is focused on building the infrastructure required to provide new services. Mr Postgate said the corporation was likely to be screening programmes in “4K” — four times the resolution of current high-definition broadcasts — as standard by 2016.Some have suggested the BBC should become like Netflix and fund itself through viewer subscriptions. If you were in charge, what TV channels and radio stations would you offer?"

The charge reflects planned lay-offs, underperforming shows, weak ad revenue and announced plans to halt its share buyback programme.Shares fell 2 per cent to $67.28, taking the stock’s losses since the start of the year to more than 10 per cent.Analysts attribute the rise of subscription services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime as part of the reason for Viacom’s woes. The company, which owns MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount film studio, has been struggling with falling ratings as viewers increasingly turn to non-traditional outlets for entertainment.“While we’d argue the long-term benefits of cost savings trump the delay of roughly $1bn in stock repurchases, we expect a negative reaction from the market,” said John Janedis at Jefferies.The downbeat mood over Viacom did not extend to the wider market, however, with another round of corporate dealmaking helping to push US stocks higher.FedEx was temporarily the biggest gainer on the S&P 500. Shares in the US parcel delivery company rose 3 per cent to $171.16 as investors cheered its €4.4bn bid for European rival TNT Express.Warren Buffett gave shares in Axalta Coating Systems, a US company that manufacturers liquid coatings used by the car industry, a fillip. The stock rose 10 per cent to $31.11 after the billionaire investor snapped up $560m worth of shares in the company.Software companies are proving to be attractive targets for private equity groups. Informatica jumped 4 per cent to $47.79 after the Nasdaq-listed data software company agreed to be acquired by Permira and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.3bn. Their offer of $48.75 a share represents a 6.3 per cent premium to the company’s closing price on Monday.Among the fallers, General Motors shed nearly 3 per cent to $35.73, after the Canadian government said it would sell its multibillion dollar stake in the Detroit-based automaker nearly six years after it helped bail it out.Canada GEN Investment Corporation, which oversees the government’s stake in the carmaker, said it had entered into an agreement to sell 73.4m shares of its GM common stock to Goldman Sachs. The sale was scheduled to be completed on April 10.Canada Gen accounts for 4.56 per cent of GM’s outstanding shares and is the company’s third-largest shareholder, according to Bloomberg data. The stake would be valued at nearly $2.7bn based on Monday’s closing price of $36.66.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,076.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 17,875.42.

523;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Winning the right to see Top Gear on the Algarve;EU commissioner’s idea to end TV geoblocking is not realistic;One of the great benefits of the internet is the ability it gives people to access information on their computer or smartphone from anywhere in the world. True, the idea of a global commons has its limits, as the great firewall of China amply demonstrates. But even inside the EU’s single market, online consumers cannot easily access video content being broadcast from another European state.Take a situation, for instance, where Britons on the continent try to watch programmes on the BBC’s UK iPlayer. What they find is that the on-demand video service is unobtainable due to “geoblocking” — a practice that ringfences such content within national boundaries for copyright reasons. It is a headache for expatriates and for people living in smaller EU states where modestly-sized national broadcasters are likely to provide more limited fare.Andrus Ansip, the EU’s digital commissioner, wants to reduce these restrictions. As part of an ambitious drive to create a digital single market, he believes European consumers should be allowed to access cross-border television services, especially if they are willing to pay for them. The commissioner feels passionately about this, saying “deep in my heart, I hate geoblocking”. But while his anger may be genuine, it may blind him to the practical problems standing in the way.Polling data suggests that Europeans would not mind a less restrictive regime. According to the European Commission, one-third of EU citizens are interested in watching or listening to content from their home country when travelling abroad. One in five would watch programmes available in other EU countries. Europe’s Pirate Party, fanatically in favour of total internet freedom, argues that geoblocking means many consumers resort to online piracy. However, a more liberal regime would struggle to mesh both with intellectual property laws and cultural policies determined at a national level.Broadcasters may be keen to provide their services wherever consumers wish to receive them. But simply abolishing geoblocking would not allow them to do so. National copyright laws restrict their ability to broadcast content across borders without purchasing licences from the content owner for each territory the service reaches. Simply removing the mechanism by which these territorial limits are imposed is unlikely to be popular with copyright holders — and the national creative industries of which they form a part.Even if this problem could be overcome, it is far from clear that member states would welcome an end to geoblocking. A pan-EU model for rights distribution would most likely benefit major English language distributors such as Netflix. They have the financial clout to invest in major productions and sell them on a subscription model to a market of 500m people. This would marginalise smaller markets and less widely-spoken languages.That is not to say there is no value in Mr Ansip’s agenda. One area where he is correct to focus is ecommerce. Online shoppers in wealthier EU states tend to pay more for identical goods and services than those living in poorer states. Geoblocking sometimes plays a role in this, making it impossible to access the relevant website in a foreign language.Mr Ansip’s vision of a seamless digital market is admirable. But it will take considerable effort to achieve anything of substance. It is not clear whether the desire of expats for the right to watch Top Gear on the Algarve quite warrants the expenditure of political capital that would be necessary.

The New York Times may become a supplier of news to a technology-led distributor.The shift could be as significant for the technology industry as that of 1981, when IBM allowed Microsoft to provide the MS-DOS operating system for its new personal computers. It turned out to be a profitable power grab by Microsoft, placing software at heart of the computing industry, while hardware became a commodity.The new companies, such as Tesla, Netflix, and Warby Parker, the eyewear retailer, are dubbed “full-stack start-ups” by Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm. Instead of building the plumbing for others, like Oracle and SAP in corporate software, they sell products and services directly, exploiting their efficiency and scale.There is a historical symmetry in this. Microsoft’s oldest rival, the company that refused to confine itself to software, is Apple. Apple, now the world’s most valuable company, is hailed by Chris Dixon, a partner of Andreessen Horowitz, as “the canonical full-stack technology company”. It designs its own software and hardware, including computer chips, and operates its own network of retail stores.For the most part, though, “full stack” is a misleading term, taken from the manner in which modern software is built in modules that mesh with each other. This makes it sound like vertical integration of the kind pioneered by Henry Ford, whose company once not only built cars but owned rubber plantations, coal mines and railways — much of its network of supply.A few industries are still vertically integrated: some oil companies, for example, span upstream exploration and drilling, through downstream pipelines and refineries, to retail petrol stations. The trend, however, has been away from corporate monoliths and towards outsourcing to networks of suppliers. Even Apple contracts out the manufacturing of iPhones.Full stack often means “top of the stack” (or, confusingly, downstream in traditional industries), handling the customer relationship. Uber, one of Mr Dixon’s prime examples, is not a very integrated company. It does not directly employ drivers, although it is being challenged over the issue in US courts — it is a technology platform.But Mr Dixon is right that something notable is under way. Microsoft’s success came from combining technology with business innovation; it took over the high margin segment of the computer industry, which was then in the middle. Neither hardware manufacture nor retailing was as profitable as software, largely because Microsoft held a near monopoly while the other sectors both remained fragmented.Instead of building the plumbing for others, they sell products and services directly, exploiting their efficiency and scaleThe lure for full-stack start-ups is that the structure of many industries, not just the technology industry, can be reversed by the internet. The middle is often divided among suppliers, whether taxi drivers, news publishers or music labels, while a single network can reach millions of customers.The technology need not be very sophisticated. Although Uber has clever dispatch software, its largest advantage is that it works through an app on mobile phones, rather than needing people to sit in smoke-filled offices, fielding phone calls. It is bigger, faster and more efficient than thousands of little cab companies.Once it occupies the high ground of customer relationships, a company has two options. It can exploit its power to push suppliers into offering goods and services through its network on the terms it wants, as Spotify, Facebook and Uber are doing.Alternatively, it can turn into a true full-stack start-up, acquiring or contracting with suppliers to design, make and sell products. Two neat examples although both are small, are Warby Parker and Harry’s, a US start-up that sells men’s razors and shaving cream by monthly subscription, like a Spotify for chins. It makes the razor blades in its own factory in Germany.The striking thing about such start-ups is that although they are backed by venture capital and use software and the internet to their advantage, they are not really technology companies. Venture funds such as Andreessen Horowitz are investing in new business models, often with hundreds of millions of dollars to allow them to scale up rapidly, rather than new science.This contrasts with Andreessen Horowitz’s $20m investment this week in Improbable, a virtual reality start-up. It also evokes the complaint of Peter Thiel, the entrepreneur, that Silicon Valley prefers “incrementalist investment” to solving hard scientific problems. But if it works, why fight it?john.gapper@ft.com"
525;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-03-17T04:29:30Z;Apple close to launching online TV service;Group in talks with Fox and ABC to provide subscription streaming service;Apple is close to launching the latest step in its assault on the living room, with plans to start an online television service this year.The company is in advanced talks with US broadcasters including Fox and ABC to launch subscription streaming, according to people close to the negotiations. The news comes just weeks after the company announced a deal with HBO to bring its on-demand streaming app to Apple TV, its set-top box, next month, and cut the price of the service from $99 to $69.Viewers are increasingly looking to options that allow them to pick and choose individual channels for their TV service, instead of having to pay for predetermined bundles of networks, many of which they never watch.Observers have long speculated that Apple would launch its own over-the-top television service, which would go round traditional cable or satellite distribution in favour of streaming live video to consumers over the internet. Some believed that the iPhone maker might even release its own TV set.But Apple is increasingly seen as unlikely to add another screen to its family of devices. Instead, last week’s price could indicate that a revamped version of its set-top box is more likely.People with knowledge of the situation said that a new device was in the works last year, perhaps including the launch of the company’s App Store on TVs.For many years, Apple TV, which was originally launched alongside the iPhone in 2007, was described by Apple executives as a “hobby”. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said at an event last week that Apple TV had sold 25m units, up from 20m a year ago, making it a relatively small contributor to a company with revenues of almost $200bn in 2014.Nonetheless, Mr Cook said on several occasions last year that television was an area of “great interest”, generating more than $1bn in sales.“TV is one of those things that if we’re really honest, it’s stuck back in the ‘70s,” he said. “The interface is terrible.”Apple TV offers a range of channels, from the well-known such as Netflix, YouTube, CNBC and Sky News, to more niche content such as Crunchyroll, which shows Japanese animation.Some channels, including HBO, Watch ABC and Fox Now, are available only if customers also have a separate cable subscription. All have struck individual deals with the company’s media team to be included on Apple TV.Peers that point the way for what an extended Apple service could look like include Dish Networks’ Sling TV, which streams live TV to customers without a cable subscription for $20 a month, and Sony’s planned PlayStation Vue, an internet-TV service tied to its games consoles. Both have negotiated streaming deals with most of the biggest US networks.One holdout in Apple’s negotiations is said to be Comcast, but a person close to the situation said that failing to secure rights from its NBCUniversal subsidiary would be unlikely to prevent a launch in the coming months.Apple declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Additional reporting by David Crow in New York
526;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-03-16T17:04:06Z;Watchman device approval boosts Boston Scientific;Shares climb nearly 4 per cent on hopes of strong sales;Boston Scientific was one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500, after the medical device maker received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for its device intended to prevent strokes in patients with a heart rhythm disorder.The FDA approved The Watchman device on Friday, after the market closed. It reduces the risk of stroke in patients with irregular heart rhythms known as non-valvular atrial fibrillation and is an alternative to long-term warfarin therapy, which prevents blood clots.“Watchman would position the device as a second line, or alternative, treatment for a smaller segment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients. Surprisingly, the approved indication is much more positive than we had expected as the label essentially keeps the original $1bn-plus market opportunity intact and points to a sizeable population who would be indicated for the Watchman,” Tao Levy, an analyst at Wedbush, said.During an investor update, the Massachusetts-based company said it could generate $500m in Watchman sales over the next five years as many patients seek alternatives to warfarin and other anticoagulant therapies because of a history of bleeding while taking oral anticoagulant therapy.Shares of Boston Scientific, which have gained 32 per cent in the past year, climbed nearly 4 per cent to $17.24.King Digital Entertainment, the company behind the popular Candy Crush Saga game, rallied on Monday, after analysts at JPMorgan raised the stock to “overweight” from “neutral” with a $20 price target.Doug Anmuth, an analyst at JPMorgan, said the UK developer listed in New York continues to grow its network, already at 356m monthly unique users. It “is gaining significant scale benefits around marketing, cross-selling, and data that further distance the company from smaller competitors”, he said.Mr Anmuth added that the company’s Candy Crush Soda Saga “has reinvigorated the entire Candy franchise” and has done little to cannibalise Candy Crush Saga. The success of the Soda game also suggests the company could add more sequels to the Candy franchise. He also expects King to launch five new games in 2015. Shares of King Digital advanced 1 per cent to $15.04.Netflix shares fell 4 per cent to $422.08, after analysts at Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to “sell” from “hold” and lowered their price target to $380 from $450. The downgrade was driven by “what we perceive to be an intensifying competitive environment necessitating increased investment with uncertain return”, said Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore ISI.Hanesbrands shares advanced 3 per cent to $33.58, after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the US clothes marketer will replace Avon Products in the S&P 500, after the close on March 20.Shares of Salix Pharmaceuticals advanced 2 per cent to $172.75, on news that Valeant Pharmaceuticals had sweetened its bid for Salix and nudged Endo International out of the race. Valeant said it would boost its all-cash offer to $173 per share, from $158.S&P 500 utilities led the US benchmark higher, climbing nearly 2 per cent.The S&P 500 gained 1.4 per cent to 2,081.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3 per cent to 17,977.29.

527;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-03-02T18:03:16Z;Nasdaq hits 5,000 after 15-year gap;Resurgence of Apple drives US tech index to landmark;After an absence of 15 years, investors briefly watched the Nasdaq Composite trade above the fabled 5,000 threshold on Monday.The US technology benchmark previously stood above this level in March 2000 at the height of the dotcom bubble, only to experience a stunning decline with the Nasdaq plumbing a low of 1,114.11 by October 2002.Now with many global equity benchmarks recording all-time and multiyear highs, as central banks continue pumping money into the financial system, the Nasdaq is finally approaching a peak that many investors thought would take decades to reclaim. On an inflation adjusted level, the Nasdaq significantly trails its internet boom peak.While the S&P 500 surpassed its turn of the century peak in 2007, and has subsequently moved well into record territory during the past two years, the Nasdaq still remains shy of its record close of 5,048.62 and intraday peak of 5,132.52 set in March 2000.After falling back below 1,300 during the financial crisis, the Nasdaq has risen nearly 300 per cent as the technology landscape has evolved, driven by the resurgence of Apple, comfortably the world’s largest company.Meanwhile, the rise of Google and other innovative players that were not around in 2000, such as Netflix, Tesla, Facebook and LinkedIn, reflect a technology benchmark that has changed markedly during the past 15 years.Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, says the Nasdaq’s rise towards 5,000 has sparked some concern about a brewing valuation bubble but that is misplaced. “While tech suffers from some of the same valuation issues as other sectors, we find comparisons to 2000 inappropriate.’’Analysts say Nasdaq-listed companies have been buoyed by strong sales and earnings growth. The current trailing price to earnings ratio for the Nasdaq stands at 22 times. This measure soared to 72 times during dotcom fever and stood at 64 times when the benchmark previously visited 5,000.BlackRock says that, while US stocks appear fully valued, given the near-tripling of the S&P 500 since 2009, the tech sector is an exception.“Technology stocks have been buoyed by a run of good earnings, and still have some way to go given that they represent a growth sector as the economic cycle matures. In addition, the cash reserves of the largest tech companies enable them to cope with increased borrowing costs should the Fed raise interest rates this year,’’ says the asset manager.They also note how Apple, Cisco, Google, and Microsoft possess more than $360.5bn in cash reserves, almost a quarter of the total US corporate cash reserves.The implosion of technology stocks left deep scars and a lasting belief among many investors that revisiting such a peak would take decades. Here is the story of the Nasdaq’s decline and long upward slog in charts over the past decade and a half.Firstly, we can see how the Nasdaq has lagged behind the S&P 500 since the end of the internet boom in early 2000. Then we see how Nasdaq’s biggest three stocks have fared. Meanwhile, the recent rise in the technology benchmark has not been led by internet shares.Finally, we take a look at the Nasdaq’s sector components and the top 10 Nasdaq stocks in 2000 and now, with their respective P/E ratios.
528;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
529;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-02-26T18:33:49Z;Watchdog heeds Obama on net neutrality;Biggest government intervention in the internet in two decades could face legal challenges;The US has entered a new era of online regulation after rulemakers approved the biggest government intervention in the way the internet is run in almost two decades in order to stop broadband companies from blocking or favouring different websites.In a split decision at a tense meeting packed with activists, the US telecoms regulator adopted new “net neutrality” powers to ensure all internet traffic is treated equally by regulating broadband as a public utility.The move satisfied a call President Barack Obama made before last November’s midterm elections, but infuriated Republicans who called it an outrageous power grab.The Federal Communications Commission vote, in which commissioners split along party lines, was a victory for an open internet coalition that includes west coast digital companies such as Netflix and Democratic activists. It was a defeat for mobile and fixed broadband providers such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast.But it is likely to become bogged down in legal challenges from broadband companies or their allies, raising doubts over how long the new rules will stay in force. They are due to come into effect 60 days after being officially filed.Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman appointed by Mr Obama, said: “The action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one — whether government or corporate — should control free and open access to the internet.”“The internet is too important to allow broadband providers to be the ones making the rules,” he said. “This is no more a plan to regulate the internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech,” he addedAdvocates of the open internet principle — known as “net neutrality” — want to ensure that broadband providers are banned from setting up fee-based internet fast lanes or “throttling” content from websites that use a lot of bandwidth or compete with their affiliates.Ajit Pai, a dissenting Republican FCC commissioner, said there was scant evidence of such abusive conduct by broadband providers. “It’s all anecdote, hypothesis and hysteria,” he said.“I don’t know whether this plan will be vacated by a court, reversed by Congress, or overturned by a future Commission. But I do believe that its days are numbered,” he added.David Cohen, executive vice-president at Comcast, said it was “deeply concerned” about the route the FCC was taking. While the cable provider supported the principle of an open internet, it said resorting to utility-style regulation threatened to create “litigation and regulatory uncertainty and may greatly harm investment”.Other broadband allies say the move opens the way to forms of regulatory intervention used in the EU to break the stranglehold of former telecoms monopolies.Tim Berners-Lee, the British web pioneer, told the meeting via a video recording that the FCC’s action would preserve the ethos of “permission-less innovation” online and help to protect free speech and human rights. Watching in the audience was Steve Wozniak, the Apple co-founder, who has become a leading advocate of net neutrality.Mr Obama’s forceful call for net neutrality rules after last November’s election has turned the internet into one of the most hotly contested partisan issues in Washington, alongside immigration, energy policy and financial regulation.America’s business leaders are frustrated and alarmed by the FCC’s decision to impose Depression-era regulations on the internet, a foundation of innovation and prosperity in the 21st centuryTo loud applause from activists, the proposal was endorsed by a 3-2 vote with two Democratic commissioners supporting Mr Wheeler and two Republican commissioners opposing it.Michael O’Rielly, a Republican commissioner, accused the Obama administration of “disgraceful” interference in the FCC’s activities and said it had sought to “dictate an outcome for pure political purposes”.Reactions poured in after the vote, with the NCTA, a cable lobby group, slamming the FCC and calling on Congress to step in to stop the regulator. The FCC was “abandoning a bipartisan national commitment to limited government involvement that has reigned for decades”, it said.John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable, a lobby group for blue-chip companies, said his members supported an open internet but argued that the FCC was taking the wrong approach.“America’s business leaders are frustrated and alarmed by the FCC’s decision to impose Depression-era regulations on the internet, a foundation of innovation and prosperity in the 21st century,” he said.The move was cheered by small internet companies including Tumblr, a social media business, and Etsy, a Brooklyn-based online retailer. Chad Dickerson, Etsy’s chief executive, told the meeting: “Thank you for voting to protect the internet as an engine of economic opportunity.”Chip Pickering, chief executive of Comptel, which represents smaller network providers, said: “Today’s action is a defeat for those companies that want to exert gatekeeper control over the internet and a clear victory for individual choice, free expression [and] competition.”
530;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-02-22T20:02:12Z;Broadcasters fear falling revenues as viewers switch to on-demand TV;Concern over falling audiences and impact on advertising revenue;"With YouTube to watch, Instagram pictures to take and Facebook, Snapchat and other social media platforms to explore, a generation of young Americans that used to turn to television for entertainment is finding its fix elsewhere.They are watching on-demand services, such as Netflix and Hulu and the BBC iPlayer but turning off “linear” TV, or tuning in at a set time on a set channel. This migration has been gradual but is starting to show up in the quarterly results of some of the world’s biggest media companies — and investors are beginning to notice.Television executives started sounding the alarm last autumn when Viacom, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, and Walt Disney began reporting lower advertising revenues for some or all of their networks. Todd Juenger, senior analyst with Bernstein Research, called the ratings declines “alarming” and “unprecedented”.The trend has continued into the most recent round of financial results, with Viacom among the worst hit. The company, controlled by 91-year-old billionaire Sumner Redstone, has suffered some of the sharpest ratings declines, with viewership down 18 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to a MoffettNathanson analysis of Nielsen data.BET, which is aimed at African-American audiences, fell 22 per cent, the children’s network Nickelodeon was down 17 per cent while MTV declined 14 per cent.Viacom’s profits have held steady but on the company’s recent investor call, Philippe Dauman, chief executive, alluded to significant changes in audience habits. “It is no secret that there are far-reaching shifts taking place in our industry,” he said.His peers agree. In a nod to the popularity of subscription services such as Netflix, Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, owner of networks such as CNN and HBO, recently said television was “in the midst of a secular shift to on-demand consumption”. That has pushed networks including HBO and CBS to launch their own online offerings.At Viacom, the ratings decline is not only putting pressure on ad sales, but reducing the company’s leverage in negotiating with pay-TV providers that carry its channels. Some small operators, including St Louis-based Suddenlink Communications, which counts about 1m video subscribers, have dropped Viacom altogether. Suddenlink said Viacom’s pricing demands were too high.Viacom maintains its programming is still being viewed by young people and says they are just watching it in different ways. It has turned its fire on Nielsen, the consumer research company, whose ratings are the currency on which the $70bn television ad market depends.The broadcaster believes Nielsen’s measurements have not kept up with how people consume content. Such changes, it argues, are especially pronounced among younger audiences that watch its channels on smartphones and gaming consoles, which Nielsen does not measure.Mr Dauman said such “inadequate measurement” undermined “innovation” and disproportionately hit programmers such as Viacom. He has pledged to move away from relying on Nielsen ratings by boosting Viacom’s digital advertising inventory and selling more sponsorships and targeted ads that are inserted when shows are watched on demand. Viacom wants to increase the proportion of ad sales from those sources to 50 per cent in the next three years, from 30 per cent last year.Viacom is also loading more advertising into some programmes to generate more revenue, boosting commercial time by more than 4.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Mr Juenger at Bernstein Research.Channels aimed at young viewers are not the only ones being hit. Viewership among 18-to-49 year olds of primetime broadcast and cable shows — some of the most valuable television advertising available — dropped 7 per cent in the final three months of 2014, the third consecutive quarter that audiences shrank, according to MoffettNathanson, the analysts. “This is just about the worst decline we have seen,” it said.David Zaslav, chief executive of cable programmer Discovery Communications, added to the criticism of Nielsen, saying last week “there’s no question that it’s under-measuring . . . I think they will fix it over time, but it’s a problem”.He contrasted the US to Norway, where “anybody that watches anything, whether you watch it in a bar, you watch it at your vacation house, whether you watch it on your iPad, it counts”. Since Norway moved to a new measurement system last year, he said, TV viewership has swung from double-digit declines to a 15 per cent increase.Nielsen plans this year to introduce new tools to measure watching on digital devices which it says will provide a more comprehensive portrait of evolving viewership habits.It also acknowledges that viewing a programme after its original transmission has taken a toll on audience ratings: the traditional metric, known as “C3”, captures only the live viewing and what is viewed within three days of the show being aired.“What it looks like is a decline in ratings when in fact there is shifting viewing that is not captured,” said Megan Clarken, Nielsen’s executive vice-president of global digital products.But she also noted that consumers have more choices in what they watch. “There’s a competing landscape on the digital side with digital pure plays producing content.”That includes Netflix and Amazon, which are both spending more on hit shows such as House of Cards and Transparent, and Google’s YouTube, whose online video stars are particularly popular with young viewers.Mr Juenger at Bernstein Research argues that television is undergoing a “structural” migration from ad-supported networks to streaming video services. “We don’t think those viewers are coming back,” he warns.Nielsen wants the television industry to adopt a new standard of ratings that captures viewing no matter the screen or source, and has been developing its own “total audience” metric to measure digital content. “We think it’s important that the ratings we provide are reflective of what’s going on in the environment,” Ms Clarken said.But, she added, redefining the industry’s currency is ultimately up to the media owners and the agencies that buy commercial time. “It will be the marketplace who decides the numbers on which they trade.”While the TV industry struggles to hammer out new models for revenue and measurement, advertising executives say they are following consumers in expanding the definition of television itself to encompass on-demand viewing, streaming and digital video.“I believe you have to redefine what television is. It’s more about moving content,” said Amir Kassaei, chief creative officer for Omnicom’s DDB Worldwide, an advertising agency.“There is still the old media platform called TV, which is strong and you should use it if you need to build awareness and build a bigger audience. But the way people are interacting with moving content more broadly is changing, especially with young people. We have to be selective if we are trying to reach people in the right way.”Shrinking live TV viewing threatens broadcasters’ bottom linesThis week, 3m more viewers than usual tuned into watched EastEnders, the long-running BBC soap opera, as it broadcast live, writes Henry Mance.But that one-off success is unlikely to break a trend of falling live television viewing in the UK, as viewers switch to Netflix, DVDs and catch-up services. Now the question is whether advertising revenues — which have been increasing at broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 4 — will start to drop.The amount of time that British children spend watching TV has fallen by 22 per cent since 2010, according to industry data from Barb. Many industry figures have argued that the shift away from live TV is a kids’ phenomenon, which will disappear as audience grow older.In fact, says Toby Syfret, an analyst at Enders Analysis, “the habits of the parents are changing too”.Live television viewing has fallen 11 per cent among adults aged 35 to 54 since 2010. For those audiences, the transition to on-demand viewing is often an easier behavioural shift than, say, the move from print books to ebooks. Only among the oldest demographic — aged 55 and above — has live television viewing remained relatively unaffected, falling 2 per cent in the past four years.Broadcasters are, however, riding a recovery in advertising sales. ITV’s shares are at their highest since the dotcom boom, with ad revenues rising 6 per cent year-on-year in the nine months to September 2014.In the short term, the fall in television audiences may actually increase the price of TV advertising. Brands want their ads to be seen a certain number of times on television; as it becomes more difficult to reach audiences, the cost of doing so rises.Brands cannot switch their spending to Netflix, which does not show ads. The obvious option is to advertise more on online platforms — including ITV’s on-demand player and YouTube.For the moment, “advertisers and media buyers just do not see [YouTube] as a substitute for mass market reach”, says Ian Whittaker, an analyst at Liberum.“The big thing that prevents disruption is the content most people want to watch is produced by the big broadcasters,” says Mr Syfret.Broadcasters are therefore investing in making their own programmes. Some are also exploring revenue streams that would hedge against a decline in revenues. ITV launched its first pay channel in more than a decade last year, and offers ad-free digital subscriptions.This article has been amended since first publication to show correct figures for the chart labelled “Traditional v online TV”.Back to the top of the page"
531;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-02-05T12:54:00Z;Sling TV: on mission to cut US viewers’ ties to cable television;Internet broadcast service offers sports channels for first time;"I have an awful confession. I do not own the most ubiquitous domestic gadget of them all: a television set.After moving to the US a couple of years ago, I never got around to buying one. I already have more screens in my life than I can handle, what with smartphones, tablets, PCs and a digital projector. Netflix, iTunes rentals and YouTube provide more than enough to watch without shelling out $50 to $100 a month for live cable or satellite TV, on top of the $50 or so for broadband internet. Also, I’ve never felt I need a regular television set because I don’t watch regular TV, the sort that has dozens of channels to flick through.For all the hype around “cord cutting” — when customers ditch cable and satellite subscriptions — I am part of a minority. Barely 3 per cent of US households go without a TV set.Now a new service is taking aim at the estimated 12m US homes that do not have cable. Sling TV, subsidiary of satellite provider Dish Network, offers online streaming of live television from a selection of well-known channels for just $20 a month, with no annual contract. This internet broadcasting service is in invite-only testing at the moment, with a public launch expected shortly.Sports winSling TV complements Netflix and YouTube, while adding a killer feature that is very hard to find (legally) online: live sports. For the first time, ESPN and ESPN 2, the two most popular sports channels in the US, are part of the basic $20 bundle. Other live channels include CNN, Disney, TNT and Cartoon Network.Sling TV works on iPhones, iPads and Android devices, as well as the Roku 3 set-top box for big-screen viewing. Samsung and LG’s smart TVs, Microsoft’s Xbox One and Amazon’s Fire TV devices will follow, it says.Getting ESPN on board is a breakthrough, but many big names are missing, including other sports channels — which means no Super Bowl football or Major League Baseball — and some popular sources of drama: no HBO for Game of Thrones, which plans its own cable-free streaming service; no AMC, maker of Breaking Bad; no Showtime, which shows Homeland.Moreover, Sony is testing a competing internet TV service: PlayStation Vue will have some of the content Sling lacks, such as Fox’s drama and sports channels, CNBC and Nickelodeon.This patchwork of content rights will perplex British readers, who have been able to watch shows from the BBC and rival stations online for some time. In the past couple of years, BT and Sky have made it possible for customers to stream live football for the same price as broadcast or less. The US cable market has been harder to crack open. It is striking that this watershed moment has come not from Apple or Google, which have tried to figure out new ways into the living room for years, but from Dish, a “traditional” satellite network.US media companies license content with strings attached. You cannot record through Sling TV and on-demand viewing of previous broadcasts is available only for certain channels. ESPN and Disney ban pausing or rewinding live shows, now standard on cable boxes. Also, for reasons that are not obvious, the ad breaks on ESPN are filled with a blank screen and elevator music that almost made me wish for something more entertaining.Viewing pointsWhile such differences are annoying, the rest of Sling’s user interface is intuitive, both on a big screen and on mobile devices. You can browse what to watch next while watching a live show and channel hop as you would on a proper telly.Watching via Roku on my digital projector, on a speedy 80 Mbps broadband connection, picture quality was indistinguishable from broadcast and there was little or no lag or buffering over several hours. But some users might soon run up against their internet provider’s bandwidth limits, due to the data requirements of all that video streaming.The verdictFor all its achievements, Sling TV has one big flaw. If you are not a sports fanatic or news addict, is there anything left on live TV worth watching? Most of the best shows head to iTunes, Hulu or Netflix soon after broadcast. Cord cutting is as much about choosing a few great things to watch a lot as about ditching expensive cable services. Sling TV is technically and commercially innovative, but much of the content to watch on it is not. Perhaps I’ll hold off buying that TV set a little longer.Planet of the apps

532;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-02-04T18:09:01Z;Bonds / buybacks: too popular to be smart;Borrowing to repurchase shares is en vogue;"Thinking of issuing debt to buy back shares? Get in line. With interest rates low, company after company is taking to the debt markets to fund repurchase programmes. Buybacks are at the highest level in more than five years, according to FactSet, with nearly $600bn among S&P companies last year. US corporate bond sales hit an all-time high in 2014, at more than $1.5tn.Not all buybacks are equal. Some destroy value, some create it, and it is hard to tell them apart. Apple has spent $45bn on repurchases in the past 12 months. It issued $6.5bn in bonds this week at low rates; the proceeds will be used for more buybacks and dividends (Apple has oceans of net cash, but 90 per cent of it is overseas — hence the need to issue US debt and avoid repatriation tax). This approach has logic, given the cash and the fact that Apple’s cost of debt is lower than its cost of equity. Taking equity out of the capital structure — adding leverage — might make sense, depending on Apple’s other options. And taking out equity with buybacks rather than dividends is tax efficient for some investors.But few companies are as under-leveraged as Apple. And buybacks can crowd out other things — such as investments in research or hard assets. At IBM and Cisco, which repurchased $13bn and $4.5bn in shares over the past 12 months, respectively, research spending is lower than five years ago.Buybacks and leverage are tempting when things are going well. Having cash on hand is appealing in bad times — to maintain investment, protect the dividend, or do opportunistic deals.Some companies are — surprise — issuing debt to invest in their business. This week Netflix issued $1.5bn in debt to fund expansion. The company has been burnt by poorly-timed repurchases. It spent $200m buying shares in 2011 — just before its share price crashed. But the company seems to have learnt a lesson. Yes, buybacks can optimise a capital structure. Only investment creates growth.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

The rise of online streaming and on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have hit their broadcast cousin hard, but live sport remains largely the province of television, and American football in particular has seen a rise in its audience while viewing figures for other categories have plummeted, according to figures from Nielsen.As a result, advertisers will pay handsomely for this opportunity to catch more than 100m pairs of eyes: the average cost for 30 seconds of screen time during the Super Bowl hit $4.2m in 2014 — a 45 per cent real-terms increase.Broadcasters also know they are on to a good thing and have increased the amount of available time by 25 per cent over 10 years.But despite these changes, one thing remains the same: the bulk of viewers are young men, and this is reflected in the brands shelling out for Super Bowl slots. Four of the five biggest ad spenders since 2010 are brewers or car manufacturers.
534;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-01-21T19:05:26Z;Amazon: A very modern media mogul;Jeff Bezos is shaking up film and newspapers, but both sectors will test his customer-first, profits-later strategy;"The small circle of media moguls who control Hollywood’s biggest movie studios will dust off their tuxedos next month for the 2015 Academy Awards. The likes of Rupert Murdoch, of 21st Century Fox, and Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, each have an interest in the outcome with Birdman (Fox Searchlight) and American Sniper (Warner Brothers) vying for best picture.The moguls may feel an extra pang of anxiety this year, thanks to the arrival in Hollywood of an interloper from Seattle. Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, has set his sights on challenging the film industry’s well- worn production and distribution model, echoing his grand reshaping of the book industry.This week, hard on the heels of its surprise wins at the Golden Globes, when its Transparent series won two awards, Amazon unveiled plans to acquire, produce and release a dozen films a year. With Woody Allen signed up to develop a comedy series for Amazon’s video streaming service, Mr Bezos seems determined to shake up media content just as he transformed retailing.In the past two years, Mr Bezos’s media interests have extended far beyond Amazon’s core books and online retailing business. In 2013 he bought the Washington Post for $250m, and has set about driving a tech-led revival in newspaper publishing with the development of digital products. At the same time, Amazon was ramping up its streaming video service, building a presence in Hollywood and trying to establish itself both as a new buyer of programming and as a potential competitor to Netflix, the market leader in video streaming.There are clear reasons for Amazon’s interest in video, says James McQuivey, a media analyst with Forrester Research. Amazon, like Google and Apple, is intent on “building the infrastructure for your digital life”, he says. “The average person in the western world spends four to five hours a day on some kind of television or video experience. If you are trying to plot a path to world domination, as Amazon and Bezos are, you can’t ignore those four to five hours.”Bundled offeringUnlike Netflix, which offers video streaming as a standalone, monthly subscription, Amazon’s digital video service is bundled with Prime, its $99-a-year service that covers all delivery fees for its merchandise. Like Netflix, it was developed to build up a library of content: it licensed HBO’s back catalogue, giving it the right to stream some of the premium cable channel’s biggest hits such as The Sopranos and Deadwood. And it has appropriated a model established by Netflix, which has scored with original programming such as House of Cards, by commissioning series of its own.If Amazon is able to use video streaming to lure more customers to sign up for Prime, it may generate more sales of other merchandise, analysts say. “Competing with Netflix without charging money to be a member is a unique selling point Amazon has,” says Mr McQuivey. “Its whole model relies on making money from your total spend, even if on some individual transactions they lose money. If they sign you up to Prime and you watch video it makes you more likely to use their other services.”Amazon is playing catch-up in streaming: most of the market is occupied by Netflix, which this week revealed that it increased its number of subscribers to 57m.Netflix accounts for almost 35 per cent of downstream internet traffic in the US in primetime evening periods, according to Sandvine, which measures broadband communications. Amazon online video, by contrast, has doubled its own share over the past 18 months but is responsible for just 2.5 per cent of primetime upstream traffic.Amazon certainly has the resources to buy top television shows and movies, which will help it eat into Netflix’s lead. This week, Netflix said it would issue $1bn in debt to fund further international expansion and to pay for more original content, building on the $300m a year it spends on its own programmes.Amazon intends to use its Golden Globes success with Transparent, a series about a transgender father, to lift its standing in Hollywood. Jeffrey Tambor, who won a best actor at the Golden Globes, and Jill Soloway, the show’s writer and creator, were fulsome in their praise of the company when accepting their awards, with Mr Tambor saying Amazon was his “new best friend”.Larry Salz, a partner at the United Talent Agency who sold Transparent to Amazon, says the company “has been very collaborative and very aggressive in terms of pursuing top talent”. Amazon, he says, was willing to back a personal story that did not initially appear to be the type of series to draw a big audience. “I don’t know if it would have been the same experience on other networks …Amazon gives people the freedom to make shows that don’t necessarily have the most commercial or far-reaching appeal.”This is in line with Amazon’s strategy over the past 15 years in other businesses, where the company’s profits have taken a back seat to the efficiency of its service and customer satisfaction. It is a strategy that has recently begun to be questioned by some investors, with its shares tumbling more than a third in the past 12 months.One factor was its new Fire smartphone, whose dismal sales forced the company to take a $170m charge on production costs and unsold inventory, and slash the price of the phone from $199 to 99 cents. “The phone provided an easy excuse for people to wake up and realise that profits weren’t there,” says Mr McQuivey. “But it’s not like the profits were ever there.”In Hollywood, Mr Bezos’s customer-first, profits-later strategy will be put to use creating a place where artists want to work: hence Amazon’s recruitment of Mr Allen, whose movies win critical acclaim but rarely are blockbusters. The deal with Mr Allen has earned the company begrudging respect in certain Hollywood circles. “It won’t make them any money but it’s put them on the map,” one senior media executive told the FT.Delivering the PostIt is debatable whether owning the Washington Post will make Mr Bezos any money, either — at least, any that will make a difference to his vast personal fortune, which Forbes estimates is worth $27bn. But it has certainly raised his profile in political circles.There was hope when he bought the newspaper that Mr Bezos would be a benefactor of the internet age. “We may be going back to an era where there will be people with deep pockets and deep resources who will be committed to journalism,” Katharine Weymouth, the then publisher and the last generation of the Graham family to be involved with the Post, said after the deal.But there was caution, too, that Mr Bezos’s true motive might be to buy influence among Washington’s elite, particularly as Amazon enters new industries and faces new tax and government regulations. And given the pressure the company has put on the book publishing industry, many wondered how Mr Bezos would view the Post’s long print legacy.After completing the deal he sought to reassure the Post’s staff that he would not be involved in day-to-day management. Nearly 18 months later, the Post, thanks to Mr Bezos’s cash, has hired editorial and software engineering staff and launched a range of digital products. Ms Weymouth, whose great-grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought the Post for $825,000 in a 1933 bankruptcy auction, was replaced as publisher by Fred Ryan, founding chief executive of Politico, which was launched in 2007 as a digital competitor to the Post.Online traffic growth soared at the Post last year, which executives say shows the investments are paying off. Mr Bezos “came in with ideas, questions and capital”, says Marty Baron, editor. “Now we have the capacity to actually execute on these digital experiments.”Executives and staff say Mr Bezos’s influence in the newsroom has been limited to the new staff made possible by his investment. He is more involved on the business side, in discussions about strategy and in near-daily consultations with the paper’s chief technology officer, who has built up a robust engineering team developing software that is used in-house and may soon be licensed to other publishers. Shailesh Prakash, the Post’s joint chief technology officer and chief information officer, has credited Mr Bezos with helping him recruit better developer talent as the paper ramps up its digital offerings.The Amazon founder’s influence was also clear on a new Post app, launched in November, which put two daily digital editions of the paper on Amazon’s Fire tablets. It was the first collaboration between the two companies since Mr Bezos bought the Post.Mr Baron described the project as “recreating the bundle” of the print paper for the digital age. Some speculate further tie-ups may involve Amazon taking over delivery of the paper, in more print and digital formats.“It’s clear they would like to position the Post as the third national paper [alongside the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal],” Mr McQuivey says. “It’s not impossible but we would have to see a unique content strategy.”This article has been amended to clarify that Netflix accounts for almost 35 per cent of downstream traffic, not upstream.Taking on TinseltownAs Amazon’s flurry of Hollywood moves suggest, Mr Bezos has got the content bug. And he is becoming more aggressive: like Netflix, he is intent on putting pressure on Hollywood’s arcane system of theatrical “windows” — the periods that restrict where films can be shown or released. Netflix recently caused a minor outcry among cinema chains when it said it would release the sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on its streaming service on the day it appeared in Imax theatres and it looks like Mr Bezos is heading for a similar showdown. It can take up to a year for a film to appear on subscription video services after its theatrical release but Amazon wants to drive that down to as little as four weeks.At a minimum, Amazon’s new focus on video streaming and its recognition at the Golden Globes will speed the transition from traditional television viewing and a film experience controlled by cinema chains to a model where the consumer has more power and choice, says Walter Piecyk, an analyst with BTIG Research. “Amazon is being taken more seriously [in online video] now and that will help adoption of streaming. There’s a big opportunity for them to change how content is distributed.”“The traditional Amazon business model is taking an existing legacy business and grinding distribution models and disrupting them,” he adds. For Mr Bezos, the great disrupter of book publishing, reading and retail goods, forays into film production and newspapers could be just steps on the path to shaking up other industries.TimelineJuly 1994 Amazon is founded in Seattle.

Sales were hurt by a strong dollar and the company’s decision to divest some of its businesses.Profits slid 11 per cent to $5.5bn, or $5.54 per share. Wall Street analysts had expected IBM to report earnings of $5.26 per share on sales of $24.8bn. Adjusted earnings of $5.81 per share eclipsed forecasts.IBM said sales in the company’s growth markets fell 16 per cent from the same period a year ago. In Brazil, Russia, India and China, revenues slid 21 per cent, while sales in the Americas declined 9 per cent. Excluding divestures and currency shifts, IBM said Bric revenues slipped 8 per cent.The company sees 2015 operating earnings in the range of $15.75-$16.50 a share, with the lower end of its range below Wall Street forecasts for $16.50 per share.“While the company seems focused investing for a turnround, we were discouraged by both fourth-quarter results and 2015 guidance,” Bill Shope, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said. “We believe 2015 will be another transition year, and we expect the company to provide a road map for a recovery in 2016 and beyond at its analyst day next month.”In the past six months, IBM, which is the fourth-largest component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has cost the index 261 points. IBM shares which have fallen 19 per cent in the past year, fell 3 per cent on Wednesday to $152.09.Cree shares gained more than 4 per cent to $33.88, after the maker of energy-efficient lighting beat second-quarter earnings and sales estimates.The Durham, North Carolina-based company reported net income of $12.15m or 10 cents per share, on sales of $413.2m, topping estimates. Adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share also beat expectations.The company forecast adjusted earnings of 21-25 cents per share in the third quarter, with the high end of its forecast beating the 21 cents Wall Street had forecast. The high end of its revenue forecast in the range of $395m-$415m also topped estimates.A 1.9m increase in US streaming users in the fourth quarter, ahead of the 1.87m members Wall Street was looking for, and a 72 per cent jump in profits from the year-ago period pushed Netflix shares up more than 17 per cent to $409.28. The company also said it would reach 200 global markets by 2016 and forecast “material global profits” from 2017.Northern Trust was one of the best performing stocks on the US benchmark, after the bank reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales ahead of Wall Street estimates.

536;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-01-21T17:54:20Z;Amazon backs White House on net neutrality;Tech group’s rare intervention follows Republican opposition to FCC’s role;Republicans are stepping up their opposition to President Barack Obama’s plans to stop broadband companies from discriminating between online businesses, but in a rare public intervention Amazon has rallied to the White House’s side.There is growing bipartisan agreement that broadband companies such as Comcast and Verizon should not be allowed to slow data selectively or charge a premium for internet “fast lanes”, but Republicans and the White House disagree sharply on how to implement a ban.The fight over a principle called net neutrality pits the giants of telecommunications against content providers such as Netflix and Google’s YouTube, which require large amounts of bandwidth but do not want to pay extra to save their video viewers from buffering.Amazon, which has a growing video streaming business, joined the fray at a congressional hearing on Wednesday by warning Republicans against trying to dilute the powers of a telecoms regulator Mr Obama wants to use to enforce net neutrality.The president reignited debate on the issue last year by calling on the Federal Communications Commission, the regulator, to adopt new powers to enforce equal treatment of all internet users by reclassifying broadband as a public utility akin to the telephone system.But at the hearing on Capitol Hill, Republicans who now control Congress lashed out at the plan, which they said was outmoded and would perpetuate uncertainty.Their preferred solution is a draft bill that would use the greater powers of Congress to put into law bans on data “throttling” and the charging of tolls to prioritise content delivery.Greg Walden, the Republican chairman of a House subcommittee on communications and technology, said that if the FCC did what the president wanted it would be invoking “ageing [utility] rules developed for the 19th century railroads”.The courts have already twice prevented the FCC from introducing net neutrality rules and Mr Walden said new legislation was the only way to avoid further legal entanglements.European telecom operators would face strict rules guaranteeing unrestrained internet access for customers under “net neutrality” proposals from Brussels regulators, write Duncan Robinson and Daniel Thomas.Continue reading“We can do our job and draft a new law for this century, through the open and transparent legislative process that we are beginning today,” he said. “It is the only way to bring clarity and certainty to internet governance.”Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, said the FCC could adequately protect net neutrality using some of the powers recommended by the president. He told Republicans their draft bill would limit the FCC in several unhelpful ways.“Summarily blocking the FCC’s use of existing statutory enforcement authority could leave the agency helpless to address improper behaviours well within its authority,” he said, “and would leave consumers and businesses in the internet ecosystem without adequate certainty about the FCC’s enforcement powers.”Mr Walden told him: “I think we’ve got ways to address a lot of what you pointed out.”Broadband companies including Comcast and Verizon have vigorously opposed Mr Obama’s proposal, arguing that it would harm the open internet and discourage investment and innovation by internet providers. Verizon has also agreed with Republicans that the FCC would get bogged down in litigation.Tom Wheeler, the FCC chairman, is set to unveil updated net neutrality rules next month that are expected to rely on the powers the president outlined.
537;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Netflix: content now, cash later;The strategy is correct, but guarantees big swings in the shares;Producing a series such as House of Cards is not cheap. But Netflix says it is cheaper than the alternative: licensing all of its content from others. In its year-end report this week, the company said that the shows it makes are more efficient — in terms of cost per hours viewed — than the content it buys.The video streaming company spends roughly $300m a year producing its own shows, a figure that will rise. This year Netflix is releasing three times as many hours of original content as last year.The efficiency of its original productions highlights a dilemma for Netflix: it pays top dollar to stream others’ films. While the terms of these deals are not disclosed, licensing fees accounted for the vast majority of the company’s $3.7bn cost of content last year. Licensing commitments stand at more than $9bn. Partners such as Disney do not come cheap.In this context, spending tens of millions of dollars to produce a series such as Marco Polo, which premiered last month, makes sense. The downside is cash flow. For an original series cash is spent up front, as opposed to license fees that are often paid out over time. This is partly, but not entirely, offset by front-loading the amortisation schedule for original productions (in 2014, amortisation was still $1bn less than the cost of content).This cash-intensive phase is likely to last for quite a while. Netflix is planning to issue more debt this year, to help fund its international expansion and produce more original content. The company says it “intends to generate material global profits from 2017 onwards”. Translation: do not expect much profit from 2015 or 2016. Netflix’s shares are highly volatile, falling 20 per cent on October earnings then swinging up 16 per cent on this week’s numbers.Such ups and downs, good fun at the movies, are harder to enjoy in finance. They are, however, inevitable for a company determined to put expansion ahead of profit.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
538;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-01-21T00:13:30Z;Netflix to complete global expansion by 2016;Strong subscriber growth helps boost streaming company’s shares 12%;Investors appeared ready to back Netflix’s accelerated global expansion, sending shares of the streaming video company sharply higher as it laid out plans to spur international profit and invest more in original content.Shares surged 15 per cent in after-hours trading after the company said it would reach 200 global markets with broadband internet by 2016, earlier than it previously expected, and forecast “material global profits” from 2017.To fund its ambitions, Netflix said it would turn to the debt markets this quarter to raise at least $1bn in long-term debt.The upbeat outlook and better than expected subscriber growth in the final quarter of last year cheered shareholders who had been worried in recent months over slowing US growth, international losses and costs of licensing and producing content, which ballooned to $9.5bn in the fourth quarter from $7.3bn a year ago.Shares have fallen nearly 23 per cent in the last six months.Netflix added a net 2.4m international subscribers and 1.9m in the US in the quarter, more than it had projected, bringing its total membership to 57.4m. It projects international growth will continue to outpace the US in the first quarter.Fourth-quarter net profit jumped 72 per cent from a year ago to $83.4m, or $1.35 a share, from $48.4m, or 79 cents a share, aided by a tax benefit. Analysts had estimated 45 cents. Revenue rose 26 per cent to $1.48bn, compared with Wall Street’s expected $1.49bn.After a European expansion last year took Netflix to 50 countries, the service will launch in Australia and New Zealand by March and in “additional major countries” this year. It said it was “exploring options” in China, “all of them modest”. Reed Hastings, chief executive, said the company still needed to secure a licence to operate in China.Shifts in viewing habits around the world are proving an opportunity for Netflix, which began life as a company that rented DVDs by mail.“Acceleration to 200 countries is largely made possible by the tremendous growth of the internet in general, including on phones, tablets and smart TVs,” Mr Hastings said.The international business is still operating at a loss, which totalled $79m in the quarter. But Mr Hastings said he believed the global target could be achieved in two years while the company as a whole remained profitable.Its first wave of international markets, including Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, the UK and Latin America, are now profitable and “are going to be very significantly profitable going forward,” Mr Hastings said.Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG Research, said Netflix’s move was natural given the efforts it has made to secure global rights to the content it produces and licenses. “Once you are buying globally, it makes sense to be global.”Netflix’s push into original content has won it acclaim for shows including House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. Its most recent new series, Marco Polo, was received coolly by critics but will return for a second season in 2015. Total original programming, including new and returning series, films, documentaries and stand-up comedy specials will triple to 320 hours this year from 2014.The original programmes are “some of our most efficient” because they cost less to produce relative to viewing than the shows and movies it licenses from outside studios, Mr Hastings said.“We see original programming travel and carry the Netflix brand around the world,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer.Netflix’s success in expanding viewership for online programming has also sparked heightened competition from deep-pocketed rivals. Amazon has signed up Woody Allen to write and direct a new television series, and on Monday announced plans to begin producing and acquiring original films to show in cinemas and on its Prime video service. Time Warner’s HBO this year is launching its new subscription offering to people who do not pay for cable or satellite.Mr Hastings said the increased competition was a benefit for all streaming companies. “In ways we’re competitors but in other ways we’re co-pioneers,” he said of Amazon’s push into the market.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
539;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-01-16T17:32:42Z;Amazon v Netflix: Gatecrashing;Settle in for primetime battle of TV providers;"As Taylor Swift and Lorde enjoyed the spotlight at a Golden Globes afterparty last weekend, an unusual guest slipped in: Jeff Bezos, head of Amazon.com. Amazon had just collected two Golden Globes for Transparent, its original TV series, so his presence was well-earned. It was a little awkward though: the party was hosted by Harvey Weinstein and Netflix.Amazon is crashing Netflix’s party in more ways than one. In absolute terms, its video services still look small: broadband data from Sandvine show that Netflix commands 35 per cent of primetime traffic in North America, next to Amazon’s 3 per cent. Amazon’s traffic is growing fast, though. Its original content can only be viewed by members of Prime, and Amazon sees its original series as a way to attract users to Prime, which also offers free shipping. The company has produced eight original series, with several more in the works, including one directed by Woody Allen. It hasn’t disclosed how much any of this cost; as a marketing technique, it can’t be cheap.Regardless, the company’s deep pockets and early success do pose a serious challenge to Netflix. A Netflix subscription costs $8 a month in the US, roughly the same as Prime ($100 a year). Netflix’s membership growth rates have started to fall in North America, and the company has been spending heavily on originals to attract users. Netflix says only that spending on originals is less than a 10th of its cost of content (which was $3.5bn in the past 12 months). Global expansion is also eating up cash, and operating cash flow turned negative last quarter.Netflix has some big advantages over Amazon, notably an existing core of devoted TV watchers.

540;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-01-13T15:14:30Z;Amazon signs Woody Allen for his first television series;Director admits: ‘I don’t know how I got into this’;Woody Allen has joined the top Hollywood directors flocking to new digital video streaming services after striking a deal with Amazon to write and direct a new television series.Amazon’s recruitment of the critically acclaimed but controversial 79-year-old director follows its triumph at this week’s Golden Globes, when Transparent, its series about a transgender father, unexpectedly won two awards, beating rival shows from broadcast and cable television.The rise of Amazon and its rival, Netflix — the online service behind hits such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black — is indicative of a seismic shift in viewing habits, with viewers increasingly turning to streaming so they can watch shows on demand without the need for expensive cable or satellite subscriptions.Top Hollywood talent is migrating to these new services. David Fincher, the director of The Social Network and Fight Club, helped Netflix blaze a trail with House of Cards while Lana and Andy Wachowski, the directors of The Matrix films, are also making a series for Netflix.These directors have not abandoned established TV networks. Mr Fincher has a series in the works at HBO, the Time Warner owned premium cable network, while Steven Soderbergh, who has a project in development with Amazon, directed HBO’s critically acclaimed series The Knick. However, the distinction between film, premium television and the new generation of streaming services has blurred.The changes in viewing behaviour have not gone unnoticed by leading broadcasters and cable companies. HBO, the Time Warner-owned network behind Game of Thrones, is working on its own “over the top” streaming service which will be offered direct to viewers and bundled with broadband subscriptions.Amazon’s deal with Mr Allen brings the online retailing giant together with one of Hollywood’s sharpest wits. Amazon has ordered a full series of half-hour episodes, which will be available to subscribers of its Prime Instant Video service in the US, UK and Germany.“Woody Allen is a visionary creator,” said Roy Price, vice-president of Amazon Studios. Mr Allen joked: “I don’t know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I’m not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.”The director of classics such as Annie Hall and Manhattan worked in TV at the beginning of his career in the 1950s, writing for Sid Caesar. He has maintained a prolific streak into his seventies, scoring a hit with Blue Jasmine.However, he continues to be dogged by allegations that he sexually abused Dylan Farrow, his adopted daughter. The allegations — which he denies — resurfaced last year after Mr Allen had won a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, when Ms Farrow wrote an open letter in the New York Times accusing Mr Allen of abuse.
541;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2015-01-09T17:20:28Z;Pay TV: bundle of joy;Internet TV is for ‘cord nevers’ not ‘cord-cutters’;Opening the monthly US cable TV bill is a punch to the gut. Add $19.99 for this fee to $7.99 for that service and the total bill comes in well more than $100. This week, however, came something much cheaper. Satellite TV provider Dish Network unveiled its highly anticipated “over the top” package that will give subscribers access to a select group of networks, including the sine qua non ESPN, via the internet for $20 a month. That seems far better than $100, until you discover what is and is not in the $20 package.The traditional cable or satellite TV bundle is not limited to just a couple of hundred channels. It also extends to broadband internet, a digital recorder and the ability to watch programmes on TV, phone, PC or tablet. The Dish service, called Sling TV, is simply the ability to watch ESPN and 11 other networks of varying popularity, live on one device at a time. Notably the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, are not included. Adding in other ad hoc streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, or HBO, as well as the fast internet connection needed to consume this content, will total about $100. Not so cheap after all.So Dish is not for “cord-cutters” — those abandoning traditional pay TV. Sling TV is targeting an untapped segment called “cord-nevers” — the 10m US households who became adults eschewing pay TV entirely. These hipsters would never do anything so old fashioned as to buy a cable TV package, but may be cajoled into buying piecemeal services. A la carte is rarely cheap, but it suits those who want to pick and choose.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
542;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;TV Advertising: Very mad men;When TV ratings look bad, just claim they are wrong;"Kill the messenger. That might be an extreme reaction for America’s television networks, who have a grievance with Nielsen, the ratings data provider. For television, 2014 was a disappointing year in terms of ratings. That is problematic because the rating dive led to a fall in ad revenue across the sector.At the same time, clients are moving their ad spending towards digital (which is growing at a double-digit rate). So broadcasters are also moving online, eager to distribute their shows on phones, tablets, and laptops. But Nielsen’s ratings have not quite caught up to the “TV everywhere” phenomenon. So content owners will fight a two-front battle in 2015: prove that TV ratings, spread across all devices, are better than Nielsen says; and convince marketers that Nielsen data does not matter much anyway.Collectively in the third quarter, ad revenues for broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox) fell 0.3 per cent, while they dropped 0.7 per cent for the group of eight cable network owners such as Time Warner and 21st Century Fox, according to MoffettNathanson. Viacom, whose cable networks include Nickelodeon and MTV, has been outspoken in pointing out that Nielsen only captures viewing on traditional TV, tablets, or phones when viewed within a seven-day window where the original ads remain unaltered. The system misses those who watch several episodes weeks later, or watch through services such as Apple or Amazon.Nielsen is working on ways to measure viewership comprehensively. Netflix has said it does not care about ratings since it relies on subscriptions for revenue. Viacom, regardless, says it wants its proportion of ad revenue that is non-Nielsen-based to rise from one-third now to a half in a few years. One way to do that is to grow so-called “dynamic ad insertion” where spots are customised for viewers.E-marketer predicts that digital ad revenue will pass television spend by 2018 (at $80bn). Networks will have to be tough and creative to get their piece.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
543;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-12-22T19:10:36Z;Sky: All to play for;Broadcaster is facing the toughest competition of its 25-year history;"No company in the UK advertises more than Sky. The satellite TV provider spends 50 per cent more on marketing each year, £1.2bn, than it does on the rights to broadcast Premier League football. But many analysts believe that even vigorous promotion — the traditional route to new subscribers — might not get the company, whose biggest shareholder is Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, out of its current corner.Sky is facing the strongest competition in its 25-year history — with telecoms groups BT and Liberty Global on one flank, and online challengers such as Netflix and Google, on the other. In the past three years, its shares have underperformed all of those rivals.“The landscape has changed dramatically over the past five years,” says Daniel Kerven, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. “Sky is particularly vulnerable as it does not own the majority of its content [or] network.”More than any other European player in the market, Sky appears caught in the battle for control of the best content — and the pipe into audiences’ homes. In January, it will compete with BT in an auction for the English Premier League football rights. Analysts are waiting to see whether Sky will dig deep to maintain the coverage on which its past success was built — or allow its rival an even bigger slice of the pay-TV market.The auction comes against a backdrop of telecoms consolidation — with BT expected to buy the UK’s largest mobile operator EE for £12.5bn, and Liberty Global and Vodafone also committing billions to cable assets across Europe. There is, “for the first time”, a real chance that the business will be acquired by someone other than Mr Murdoch, says Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein.Sky’s strategic challenge is to prove that it is not too small to go it alone.Overcoming the doubters is part of Sky’s folklore. When Sky Television launched in 1989, “almost everybody said that we’d fail,” recalls one executive. In fact, the company prospered thanks to its dominance of top-level football rights. Two successive challengers, ITV Digital and Setanta, declared bankruptcy. A third, ESPN, withdrew quickly.Sky still had to prove it could diversify revenues beyond the high-end TV packages, as growth in subscribers began to dip. In 2006 the company started offering broadband; it is now the UK’s second-biggest internet provider. Under Jeremy Darroch, chief executive, the company has sold more products, including internet-connected HD boxes, making the same customers more profitable and more loyal.Other ventures were considered. Sky looked at copying the UK’s biggest supermarket Tesco by launching a banking service, and creeping into the internet of things by supplying smart water meters.Instead it is focused on two sources of growth. Its streaming service Now TV is aiming to sweep up the Netflix generation — those customers who do not want to pay up to £850 a year for satellite TV. Second, it is looking to replicate its UK success in other European markets where a smaller proportion of households have pay-TV.Sky’s strategic challenge is to prove that it is not too small to go it aloneThis year it bought controlling stakes in its sister companies, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, from its largest shareholder, Fox. That move and buying out most of the German group’s minority shareholders cost the company nearly £7bn, but made it Europe’s biggest pay-TV company by subscribers and revenues, with 20m TV customers in five different countries.“If I look across the enlarged business, we’ve never had more opportunities to grow,” says Mr Darroch. “By thinking about the market broadly and using multiple services to segment it, we are opening up new possibilities for growth.”But barely a month after closing its European deal, Sky is again on the back foot. BT has entered exclusive talks to buy EE — a move designed to strengthen its offering of “quadplay” telecoms services, comprising broadband, fixed line telephone, mobile phone and pay TV. The deal will also swell the customer base for its sports offering.“Without EE, BT does not have enough customers to sustain BT Sports,” says Claire Enders, a media analyst. “To have nearly 25m new customers to offer BT Sports to, that’s very meaningful.”BT has so far invested about £2bn in content to protect its telecoms business from Sky’s move into broadband. It is offering free sports channels, including coverage of the Premier League and, from next season, the European Champions League, to its high-speed broadband customers.“BT’s bringing down the price of sport, Sky’s bringing down the price of broadband,” says Dido Harding, chief executive of smaller rival TalkTalk.The competition has pushed Sky’s gross margins down nearly 6 percentage points since 2007.The momentum appears clear: BT has signed up more new broadband customers than Sky for five quarters in a row, since launching BT Sport. If BT can throw in rock-bottom mobile contracts too, it may start to chip away at Sky’s profitable 11.5m subscriber base.Sky is facing arguably its most existential threat. Its rivals have deeper pockets, while European expansion has left it with net debt of more than £5bn. “For a public company, their leverage is as far as it could possibly go,” says one banker. “They’re tied in a strategic and financial straitjacket.”Mr Darroch says content is “at the very heart” of the business. Sky spends £4.6bn a year on content — more than Netflix (£2bn) and the BBC (whose total public income is £3.7bn).But the company does not own the underlying assets. Much of its budget goes on sports rights, which are auctioned regularly. That lack of ownership makes it vulnerable. Sky owns the rights to five of the seven packages of Premier League matches, the most available to any single bidder. In terms of rights, the only way is down for Sky. In terms of prices, analysts agree, the only way is up.Its supporters say that both pessimistic scenarios are unlikely to be true: if Sky loses rights, its costs will probably go down. “They’ll go for a narrow range of games, but just make sure they’re good ones,” predicts Matthew Walker, an analyst at Nomura.Even so, Sky would struggle to replicate its dominance of sports in any other content area. Its channels have the rights to top drama, including HBO series, until 2020. But its offerings face competition from the BBC, maker of Doctor Who, ITV, home of Downton Abbey, and Net-flix, commissioner of House of Cards.The company also airs blockbusters from the six big Hollywood studios at least a year before they are available on other subscription services. But Netflix, Amazon Prime and other services do offer those shows afterwards and they are resetting consumers’ price expectations — both charge less than £7 a month, while Sky Movies costs £38.“People are more willing to pick and choose,” says Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg. “Movies are now so ubiquitous that I believe they’re no longer a driver [of growth for Sky].”The risk is that, as Now TV grows, Sky becomes just one cheap streaming offering out of many.“Sky faces a dilemma — if it makes its offering too attractive then it risks cannibalising its existing traditional pay TV subscribers; if not attractive enough it will struggle to gain traction versus new streaming entrants and lose market share,” says Mr Kerven at Merrill Lynch.Some industry figures argue that Sky could become a maker of content, as well as a channel for it. The company has signed a production deal with HBO. It has also bought Love Productions, which makes reality formats including The Great British Bake Off, the BBC’s most watched show, with up to 13.5m viewers per episode, this year. But the latter is intended to give Sky scale in international distribution: Love Productions’ shows are more likely to feature on free-to-air broadcasters.Sky is wary of increasing its investments in communications. Other European and US telecoms companies, from AT&T to Spain’s Telefónica, are betting that they can lure customers by offering cheap mobile phone packages, alongside broadband and pay-TV.But Sky does not own satellites. Nor does it own a broadband network, relying instead on a UK regulatory ruling that gave it access to BT’s network. The UK’s mobile market is notoriously competitive; investing would probably reduce Sky’s margins.Nick Delfas, an analyst at Redburn, predicts that Sky will reduce its emphasis on broadband and “avoid any significant direct investment in Italy, Germany, Austria and Ireland.”The biggest growth potential, however, may be in selling full pay-TV subscriptions in Europe. In Italy, where customer numbers have been falling, Mr Darroch is targeting richer, middle-aged consumers to get more bang for each euro of marketing spending. He has also promised to cut costs by €120m a year by 2017.While Sky Deutschland, which lost €133m before tax last year, added 304,000 subscribers, some Sky shareholders want more spending on advertising. “These businesses grow through consumer branding and consumer marketing,” says Jamie Wood, a partner at Odey Asset Management.But sceptics question whether Sky will be able to quicken growth in Italy, Germany and Austria, especially given that the management teams will remain the same. “The tricks of the trade at Sky have all been done,” says Ms Simon.In the longer term, Netflix, Google, Apple and other pay-TV players may compete for entertainment shows and sports rights on a Europe-wide basis. But Sky lacks the financial firepower to expand into other key markets, such as France.Some people familiar with Sky now suggest it may be a takeover target. Its subscriber base, its content and its technology could interest a telecoms company looking to add content to its distribution offering. Vodafone has expressed interest in content; both Comcast of the US and SoftBank in Japan have considered potential expansion in Europe.Alternatively French conglomerate Vivendi, which is cash-rich following the sale of its phone business SFR, could seek to merge the company with its French television arm Canal Plus. That would create a combined company better able to slug it out with telecoms and Silicon Valley companies.Whether Sky is acquired or not is likely to depend on the Murdochs, whose 21st Century Fox owns 39.1 per cent of the company. Bulls suggest that the family may seek to acquire all of Sky, as they did in 2010-11 before the phone-hacking scandal at their British newspaper arm made the move politically impossible.Sky’s European expansion could therefore be a tidying-up exercise to allow them to take full control of the entire company at a later stage. But others argue that the Murdochs’ decision to reduce Fox’s stake in European pay-TV — by selling its interests in Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia — could be the prelude for them to exit altogether.Fox has recently focused on content investments rather than distributors such as Sky, and unsuccessfully bid this year for Time Warner. In Europe, although it sold stakes in Italy and Germany, it did not sell Shine, Elisabeth Murdoch’s content business. Instead Shine has been merged with Endemol, the maker of Big Brother, to create the UK’s largest production studio.So where does that leave Sky? Will Fox still be its biggest shareholder in five years? “It’s fifty-fifty,” says Mr Aspesi of Bernstein."
544;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Rdio to roll out more TV platforms for music streaming;Music streamer ‘wants to be everywhere’;Rdio will put its streaming music service in more cars and internet-connected television sets next year as it looks to compete against a crowded field of larger competitors including Google’s YouTube and Apple’s Beats Music.Anthony Bay, who became chief executive last year and previously worked at Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, likened Rdio’s strategy to Netflix: “We want to be everywhere.”Cars have been a traditional stronghold for audio. Rdio already comes pre-installed in many Volvos, as well as in Teslas sold in Europe. It will announce new auto partners in January.Rdio will also roll out on more TV platforms in 2015 as sets play a larger role for music listening at home. “For many people, it is the best sound system that they have at home,” Mr Bay said. “A year from now, it would not be surprising if music is one of the material uses of a TV.”Earlier this month, Rdio announced an expanded partnership with Roku, the streaming set-top box, that gives the music service a dedicated button on Roku remotes alongside video services from Netflix, Amazon and Vudu.Devices of all kinds, including wearable technology, are a critical battleground for streaming media companies, said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer.“In the next several years, you’re going to see more and more licensing of these apps for all kinds of different devices. It’s going to be very important to have a presence there.”Apple plans to bundle the Beats subscription music service into its iOS operating system next year, extending its potential user base to hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads.Rdio, founded in 2010 by Skype co-creator Janus Friis, combines a free, ad-supported internet radio service, like Pandora, with subscription on-demand streaming, like Spotify’s paid offering.Cumulus Media, which operates broadcast radio stations in 110 US cities, holds a 15 per cent stake in Rdio, in exchange for access to Cumulus programming and advertising sales by Cumulus’s sales team.Rdio has never revealed subscription or user numbers but its reach is thought to be significantly smaller than Spotify’s 50m users, of whom 12.5m are paying subscribers, and Pandora’s 76.5m active listeners.A survey of US smartphone owners by Edison Research this year found just 1 per cent had downloaded Rdio’s app compared with 50 per cent for Pandora and 9 per cent for Spotify.Mr Bay says he sees opportunity for Rdio to gain listeners, both in the US and around the world, with a push to appear on more devices paired with the launch in September of its free radio service.Available in 20 countries, it offers a catalogue of 30m songs compared with 2m for Pandora. Rdio is betting that having both radio and on-demand music available within the same app will give it an advantage over Pandora.This “freemium model”, which offers users free music through the radio player with the option to pick specific artists and albums and download tracks if they sign up for the paid service, also differs in a key respect from Spotify.Rdio does not offer free on-demand streaming, meaning it has evaded disputes with artists such as Taylor Swift, who pulled her entire catalogue from Spotify last month in a dispute over how the streaming service values her work.“There’s been a growing backlash,” Mr Bay said. “All streaming is not created equal.”shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
545;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-11-19T11:55:46Z;Predictions for 2015: Google to buy Netflix?;;"Is it too early to make forecasts for 2015? Not for CCS Insight, a UK-based technology research firm, which is already confidently predicting that a major internet player will buy Netflix, and Vodafone will buy Sky, by the end of next year.“All Web players are looking for a stronger presence in paid-for video, something Netflix has achieved with remarkable success… Yahoo, Alibaba and Google are potential suitors,” CCS says in an upcoming report. If Google does not buy Netflix, it will launch its own video streaming service in 2015, it predicts.Further bold/foolhardy predictions below.The focus on video streaming reflects how telecoms, media and technology groups are looking to gain access to exclusive content.Selling out was once on the mind of Netflix’s chief executive Reed Hastings, who approached DVD rental chain Blockbuster in 2000. But he has since built an independent business with a market capitalisation of $23bn. Whether Google, whose YouTube service is looking into video subscriptions, is a likely buyer is anyone’s guess.CCS also predicts a tie-up of Vodafone and Sky, which would create a European quadplay operator with the resources to bid aggressively for sports rights. Sky has recently completed a £6.9bn European expansion, which makes it a pay-TV provider presence in two of Vodafone’s biggest markets, Italy and Germany. CCS explains the rationale for a merger:“In Germany Sky offers only pay-TV and Vodafone is making an aggressive push into fixed line services and needs to strengthen its pay-TV service. In Italy, Sky offers only pay-TV and Vodafone has broadband and mobile.”CCS does not detail the potential obstacles – including a) Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox’s 39.1 per cent stake in Sky, and b) Vodafone’s recent decision to sell pay-TV in the UK, which marks it as a potential competitor to Sky.Among the other predictions for 2015 is that internet acquisitions will occur at multiples higher than that which Facebook paid for WhatsApp. Facebook’s $19bn acquisition of the loss-making messenger service worked out at $42 per user, compared to $30 per user in Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012. CCS says:“As Alibaba, Tencent and others expand their presence in Western markets, most notably in the US, they will take a bigger role in the acquisition of start-ups. This means the number of potential buyers is larger, and valuations will be bid up.”Predictions, though, are a tough game. A year ago, CCS Insight’s predictions for 2014 included Twitter buying messaging service Snapchat and satellite-television provider Dish Networks buying T-Mobile US. In the event, Snapchat is close to receiving investment from Yahoo, while Dish has reportedly contacted T-Mobile US’s owners Deutsche Telekom about a future sale.10 predictions for 2015 and beyond

546;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-11-10T18:43:35Z;Net Neutrality: Taking sides;Internet infrastructure is expensive and somebody has to pay;One of the big mysteries in corporate America is whether telecom regulators will allow the Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger, announced in February, to close. President Obama’s comments on net neutrality on Monday might provide a clue: the government is going to make the business of delivering internet less attractive. This could undercut some of the objections to the deal.The White House statement said Mr Obama favoured reclassifying internet service providers such as Comcast and TWC as “common carriers”. Such a move by the Federal Communications Commission (which is independent of the president) would regulate ISPs like utilities. The president favours prohibiting “paid prioritisation” in which content providers buy access to faster distribution. Netflix struck such deals with several ISPs (including Comcast) this year but has since complained about them.The net neutrality debate has taken on a David v Goliath flavour. Scrappy Netflix heroically provides television and movies for just $8 per month while distributors gouge profits from their control of the pipes.The Netflix monthly fee roughly reflects the cost of acquiring content. The question then is whether that fee should jump to reflect the operating and capital costs Comcast incurs to deliver that content. Comcast and Time Warner are profitable businesses, unlike Netflix. But they are extremely capital intensive.Comcast shares shed four per cent on Monday, perhaps to the delight of its oft-irritated customers. But schadenfreude aside, US internet service remains slow and expensive compared with the rest of the world. It is fun to fantasise about reallocating Comcast profits to Netflix. But consumers and their advocates should think about what competitive framework would lead to the necessary investment in broadband infrastructure. The costs of delivering content can be shared, but not avoided.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
547;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-11-10T17:28:53Z;Washington urges ban on internet ‘fast lanes’;Cable groups protest at president’s call for broadband to be regulated as a public utility;"President Barack Obama has urged the US communications regulator to ban so-called internet “fast lanes” and reclassify broadband service as a public utility, sparking outrage among cable and telecoms groups.Mr Obama on Monday weighed in for the first time with specific recommendations for the Federal Communications Commission, which is revising its definition of “net neutrality”– the principle that all internet traffic be treated equally.His intervention follows a flood of opposition to the agency’s proposals, which has prompted about 4m comments to the FCC on the issue.The heart of the FCC’s proposal would allow ISPs to charge services like YouTube to reach customers at higher speeds, though only on “commercially reasonable” terms. That provision sparked uproar among consumer groups and companies like Netflix.Joining consumer groups and technology companies like Google and Facebook, the president said there should be a ban on paid prioritisation that would technically allow internet service providers to charge content companies like Netflix to reach consumers at higher speeds.“Simply put: no service should be stuck in a ‘slow lane’ because it does not pay a fee,” Mr Obama said. “That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the internet’s growth.”His comments triggered a sell-off in shares of cable companies, which are among the biggest broadband internet providers. Comcast, the world’s biggest cable operator, closed down 4 per cent, Time Warner Cable was off 5.1 per cent and Charter Communications down 6.2 per cent. Comcast is seeking regulators’ approval for a takeover of TWC.Comcast, whose executives have been prominent donors to Mr Obama, and telecoms groups such as Verizon have vigorously opposed the president’s idea that the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service as a public utility.Verizon said so-called “Title II” reclassification “would apply 1930s-era utility regulation to the internet” and be a “radical reversal of course that would . . . threaten great harm to an open Internet, competition and innovation.” The company added that reclassification would “likely also face strong legal challenges and would likely not stand up in court”.Michael Powell, chief executive of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, said the industry association was “stunned” at Mr Obama’s intervention. “This tectonic shift in national policy, should it be adopted, would create devastating results.”Comcast said reclassification would be “a radical reversal” of a decade of precedent that would harm investment and innovation.However, Mr Obama was cheered by open internet advocates such as Harvard Law School’s Susan Crawford and companies such as Netflix. “Consumers should pick winners and losers on the internet – not broadband gatekeepers,” said a spokesperson for the subscription video service. “This is a bold move.”The FCC has already lost two court challenges on net neutrality, including a lawsuit brought by Verizon. That loss prompted the agency to propose net neutrality rules for the third time, hoping the latest measure would stand up in court.One of the big mysteries in corporate America is whether telecom regulators will allow the Comcast/Time Warner Cable merger, announced in February, to close. President Obama’s comments on net neutrality on Monday might provide a clue: the government is going to make the business of delivering internet less attractive.Continue readingTom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, said he was “grateful” for the president’s input and added that the legal questions around net neutrality show the agency has more work to do. “We would need more time to examine these [measures] to ensure that whatever approach is taken, it can withstand any legal challenges it may face,” said Mr Wheeler, indicating the debate could go into next year.Ted Cruz, the prospective 2016 Republican presidential candidate, highlighted the political heat around the issue, describing net neutrality as “Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.”Mitch McConnell, the Republican who is set to become Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said the president was abandoning years of a regulatory light touch, which had proven to be successful. “The Commission would be wise to reject it,” he said. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said his chamber would resist the push for additional regulations.Mr Obama’s comments put more pressure on the FCC to toughen its initial proposal.“The president who promised to take a back seat to no one on Net Neutrality has finally gotten in the driver’s seat,” said Craig Aaron, president of Free Press, which advocates an open internet. “And he may have saved the internet at the moment it was in the greatest jeopardy.”"
548;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-11-09T13:18:44Z;Having signed the multiyear contract, Netflix wants to put Comcast genie back in ‘fast lane’ bottle;FCC may offer compromise that protects content providers;In the second season of House of Cards, Netflix’s blockbuster political drama, viewers became acquainted with Raymond Tusk, a billionaire industrialist and éminence grise of the US president. Mr Tusk was the embodiment of all that is wrong with corporate America: mighty, monopolistic and far too close to the White House.Just 10 days after the release ofthe second series in February, Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, announced a landmark deal that had been hammered out in the same Washington back rooms frequented by Mr Tusk’s fictional lobbyists. His company agreed to pay Comcast an undisclosed sum, said to be $15m-$20m a year, in exchange for faster and more reliable access to the cable group’s broadband customers.Since then, Netflix has made no secret of which of the two companies it thinks most closely mirrors Mr Tusk’s conglomerate.The agreement he made was so important because it set a precedent that content companies like Netflix should pay companies like Comcast to access their customers, and led to a string of similar agreements with other internet providers including Verizon.The film and television streaming group had for the first time agreed to pay for an internet “fast lane” to reach customers, trampling over the principle of net neutrality, whereby the internet should be a level playing field with no such fast lanes or tolls.This idea had been an article of faith for Netflix and many of its West Coast neighbours including Amazon and Facebook. A start-up would be guaranteed the same speed and access to its customers as a behemoth such as Google.A decade after the term was coined by a Columbia University professor, the concept has also captured the public imagination. Ever since the Federal Communications Commission, the US telecommunications watchdog, passed a rule that would pave the way for a paid-for internet fast lane in July, it has received a record 3.9m comments from the public, mostly opposing the plans.The last time the FCC had to deal with an outcry anywhere near that size was when a “wardrobe malfunction” led to images of singer Janet Jackson’s bare breast being beamed live to 111m viewers during the 2004 Super Bowl. Total number of comments then: 1.5m.On the opposing side of the argument is a clutch of companies that are best described as the “pipe guys” – broadband and cable groups such as Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications, as well as telecommunications networks including Verizon and AT&T. Time and again, they point to one statistic: Netflix and YouTube, Google’s video site, account for half of peak internet traffic in North America, so why should the pipe guys stump up the investment to subsidise the content providers’ growth?Netflix says it had no choice but to hold its nose and do the deal with Comcast. “The degradation in quality that customers were experiencing in late 2013 led to a rise in complaints and cancellations,” the company said. “We just couldn’t ignore it any more.” After signing the multiyear agreement, download speeds jumped markedly.Netflix now wants to put the genie back in the bottle. It fears the deal has set a precedent that all content providers will have to transfer some of their revenues to the pipe guys.The company sees a cautionary tale in the fees that cable and satellite companies pay to broadcasters in return for their content. In 2006, six years after the fees were introduced, they were worth $200m. Now they are worth almost $5bn, a figure that is set to almost double to $9.3bn by 2020, according to SNL Kagan.If the fees Netflix pays to the pipe guys are to grow at anywhere near that rate, it could put a strain on the company’s business model. It has marketed itself as an ultra-cheap alternative to the $100-plus packages offered by traditional pay-TV providers, with plans starting from $7.99 a month.It would be hard to maintain such low prices if Netflix were handing out hundreds of millions annually to Comcast and its peers. Last month, the group blamed its lacklustre third-quarter earnings on price hikes, warning “slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth”.Comcast said: “Netflix executives conceded our interconnection agreement ‘works great for consumers’ and . . . have repeatedly said interconnection was in no way related to their recent price increases which were driven by programming costs. The cost of interconnection is minuscule compared to the amount Netflix spends on programming.”Mike Mooney, senior vice-president and group general counsel at Level 3, a communications company that owns much of the internet infrastructure in the US, warns that the likes of Verizon and Comcast have a vested interest in pushing up Netflix’s prices because they have their own competing content to sell: Comcast owns broadcaster NBC, while Verizon is expanding its fibre video service.“Do only wealthy content providers who can afford the fast lane succeed? They have an incentive to heavily congest the slow lanes so more people move to their fast lanes,” explains Mr Mooney, who says they are in an enviable position. “They are in the catbird seat. Either they get more money off of their rivals, or their rivals’ customers suffer substandard quality.”The issue has also become a partisan battle in Washington. Last month, President Barack Obama said he was “unequivocally committed to net neutrality” and firmly against “the notion that somehow some folks can pay a little more money and get . . . more exclusive access to customers”, earning cheers from his Silicon Valley audience.Yet Tom Wheeler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, is in an unenviable position. His previous attempt to ban fast lanes was thrown out by the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit following a challenge from Verizon.Now Mr Wheeler is trying to find some kind of compromise. One option that has been floated is a hybrid approach that would strictly regulate the “back end” of the internet – including deals with Netflix – while giving the pipe guys more freedom when it comes to selling to consumers, a plan that Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson research, has described as a “grand bargain”.Verizon was quick to say that any “so-called hybrid” approach “would be unlikely to stand up in court”.TechFreedom, a think-tank that does not disclose its backers, but which regularly speaks up for the pipe guys, said: “King Solomon wasn’t serious when he proposed splitting the baby. Let’s hope chairman Wheeler isn’t either.”Free Press, a think-tank on the opposing side of the debate, described the plan as a “Frankenstein” form of net neutrality and warned the “legally dubious hybrid proposals won’t protect internet users”.As Frank Underwood, Kevin Spacey’s fictional US president in House of Cards, would no doubt tell Mr Wheeler, the problem with grand bargains is that they end up disappointing everybody.Fast lanes rulingIn January, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit threw out the FCC’s attempts to ban internet fast lanes. Its reasoning was technical but important.Under existing rules, broadband providers are classified as “information services” rather than “telecommunications services”. That means they are regulated with a much lighter touch, and the court ruled the FCC’s attempt to introduce tough new rules was a case of over-reach.The court said if the FCC wanted to ban fast lanes, it would have to reclassify broadband providers as “telecommunications services”.But the last time the FCC attempted something that radical, during the tenure of Mr Wheeler’s predecessor Julius Genachowski in 2010, it prompted an outcry among Republicans, who passed a bill in the House of Representatives that threatened to slash the watchdog’s budget.People close to Mr Wheeler say he has little appetite for the same fight.Although reclassifying broadband companies is still an option, Mr Wheeler is seriously exploring some kind of compromise designed to appease Netflix and its supporters, including the US president, without prompting a string of legal challenges.One plan that was floated last week would split broadband regulation into two. The “back end” of the network – the part where Netflix connects to Comcast et al – would be a tightly-regulated telecoms service.That means the FCC would be able to police deals like the one Netflix did in February. Those deals would not be banned outright, but Comcast and other broadband groups would be forced to show they were good for consumers.Retail broadband – the part where Comcast et al. connect to their customers – would continue to be a lightly-regulated information service, which Mr Wheeler hopes will assuage concerns that the FCC is tying up the internet in red tape.
549;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-11-04T23:39:55Z;Fox warns that the traditional US cable bundle is ‘fraying’;Rising digital viewership and on-demand services pose challenges to pricey packages;The traditional US cable bundle is “fraying” as younger viewers flock to Netflix and other streaming sites, but pricey packages of hundreds of channels will remain the way most people will watch television “for years to come”, according to 21st Century Fox’s chief operating officer.Chase Carey told analysts on Tuesday that bundles still had “great value to consumers” by allowing them to “buy a breadth and choice of programming, and that includes sports”.His comments come as television programmers and distributors are grappling with how to adjust to rising digital viewership and the popularity of on-demand services like Netflix and YouTube.CBS, the US broadcaster, and HBO, Time Warner’s premium cable network, recently announced streaming subscription services that would allow viewers to watch programming without a pay-TV subscription.Dish, the satellite TV company, is aiming to launch an online video service by the end of this year. Priced at $30 a month, it would target “the 18 to 35-year-old who’s not paying for TV today”, said Charlie Ergen, Dish chairman.“When it comes to the emergence of new digital platforms, we view this as the most exciting and important opportunity for future growth,” Mr Carey said.Fox is a part owner of Hulu, the advertising-supported online video service, along with Comcast and Walt Disney.Mr Carey was speaking as Fox reported better than expected revenue and adjusted profit in its fiscal first quarter, lifted by movies and cable TV.Earnings of 39 cents a share, adjusted to exclude some items, compared with 33 cents a share a year ago, ahead of the 36 cents analysts had estimated.Revenue rose 12 per cent to $7.89bn, ahead of an expected $6.25bn, on strong growth in affiliate fees from cable networks and the box office success of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and The Fault in Our Stars.Net income fell 17 per cent to $1.04bn as costs rose. The results included a $172m net after-tax gain related to Fox’s share of BSkyB’s sale of shares in ITV.Fox has shaken off a difficult year at the box office for much of the film industry. In its movie unit, operating profit surged 40 per cent on a 17 per cent increase in revenue thanks to hits including the latest Planet of the Apes sequel, which grossed more than $700m in worldwide ticket sales.Operating profit at cable networks rose 5 per cent on 15 per cent revenue growth. Fox said higher programming expenses offset strong increases in the affiliate fees paid by cable providers to carry channels such as Fox News and FX as well as higher advertising sales.The picture was less rosy in broadcast TV, where operating profit fell 24 per cent on flat revenue. Ad sales were down 5 per cent as Fox struggled with lower viewership for its slate of autumn shows.“Clearly, the initial ratings at the Fox broadcast network season are below our original expectations,” said John Nallen, chief financial officer.Mr Carey said he believed the overall decline in broadcast ratings was more reflective of changing ways of watching TV. “The issue is an increasing amount of viewership is occurring in ways and places not reflected in traditional ratings,” he said.Even as they express enthusiasm over new digital platforms, many television groups are wary of cutting off the valuable revenue they earn from cable providers, which pay to carry their networks.Mr Carey said he expected traditional cable packages would remain the “primary” choice of consumers “for years to come”, but acknowledged that for some, particularly younger viewers, other kinds of bundles might be appealing.Analysts expect that some of the forthcoming video services from HBO, Dish and Sony may be offered as packages with broadband internet, creating a new kind of television bundle.Fox shares rose 1.3 per cent to $33.75 in after-hours trading in New York.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
550;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-10-26T16:34:58Z;Comcast: Broadband battleground;The group may become the world’s largest media company. Content companies are worried;"Ralph Roberts, the 94-year-old co-founder of Comcast, was seriously ill last year, spending 85 days in bed after being stricken by double pneumonia. His son, Brian, Comcast’s chief executive, visited regularly to check on him and update him about the company — the largest cable television and broadband provider in the US and the owner of the NBCUniversal broadcast network and film studio.During one visit, Mr Roberts told his father that Comcast had been approached to see if it was interested in buying The Washington Post. “My dad’s lying there and we agreed that the newspaper business wasn’t a good fit,” he recalls, sitting in his office at Comcast Center, the gleaming 58-floor skyscraper that towers over Philadelphia.The Post was eventually bought by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But Mr Roberts had also been approached by Glenn Britt, the late chief executive of Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator, to discuss a deal. “I said to my dad: ‘What about Time Warner Cable?’” recalls Mr Roberts. “His eyes opened. He said: ‘For that, I’ll get better’.”The elder Mr Roberts went on to recover from the double pneumonia and Comcast made an audacious $45bn offer for Time Warner Cable, grabbing the company from under the nose of John Malone, the “cable cowboy”, whose Charter Communications had pursued TWC for months.The proposed takeover is being studied by regulators, who are expected to decide whether to approve it by early next year. If the deal goes ahead, it will create the world’s biggest provider of broadband and cable television services, reshaping the media landscape in the process. The prospect of an enlarged Comcast — which will leapfrog Walt Disney as the world’s largest media company — has sparked anxiety among content companies. The recent, shortlived $71bn bid for Time Warner, owner of HBO and CNN, from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox was driven in part by a need to create a company big enough to stare down Comcast in negotiations on distribution over its cable systems.A combined Comcast-TWC will supply some of the largest metropolitan areas in the US with cable television services and, more significantly, will be the largest provider of fixed-line, high-speed internet access. More than 40 per cent of homes with speeds of 10 mbps — which is necessary to view streaming video services such as Netflix — will get their broadband service from Comcast-TWC. For fixed-line homes capable of receiving speeds of 50 mbps, the combined company’s share will jump to at least 50 per cent, according to Free Press, a non-profit group that campaigns for a free and open internet.Comcast has developed rapidly over the past 50 years, becoming one of the world’s largest media groups. From one acquisition to the next, it now serves customers across America and has a powerful position in cable video and the supply of high-speed internet services. Its origins, though, were rather more humble.The proposed merger of the top two cable providers has generated a storm of protest. Companies such as Netflix, Discovery Communications and other critics have lined up to urge the Federal Communications Commission to block the deal because the combined companies will wield too much market power.“If it is permitted to merge with TWC, for at least half of American households the only choice for high-capacity internet will be Comcast,” says Susan Crawford, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School and the author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.She equates Comcast’s power in high-speed internet provision with the great monopolies of the past, such as the railroad barons of the late 19th century.There is “no consumer benefit” to the Comcast-TWC combination, she says, urging the Department of Justice, which is also reviewing the deal, to act. “It has a public-interest standard to uphold and if it is driven by the facts it will block the merger. This is about freedom of information flows in America.”Want to start an online business that uses bandwidth? You will have to go to ComcastTo understand why Comcast and its expansion plans have attracted such opposition, it is necessary to look at the company’s origins and its place within the evolution of the US cable industry. American homes used to get their television signals over the airwaves. That began to change, slowly, in the 1940s and 1950s in areas that were hard for broadcast signals to reach. Originally called “community antennae television”, cable systems were developed that received a single TV signal and distributed it to multiple homes. Cable was an efficient way to pump multiple channels into individual homes and, over the years, the number of systems grew exponentially.Comcast was born in 1963 when Ralph Roberts, an entrepreneur from Philadelphia, bought American Cable Systems, a 1,200 subscriber cable television operation in Tupelo, Mississippi. It was not his first company: previous ventures included a revolutionary golf putter, a men’s accessories business and a stint working for Muzak, selling the inoffensive recorded ditties played in shops and lifts.The cable business model reminded him of Muzak, in that once an initial capital investment had been made revenue would recur — and keep recurring. “You put up a tower and some equipment,” Ralph Roberts told William Novak, the author of the official Comcast history, An Incredible Dream, “and they paid you every month.” Cable, he added, “looked to me like the greatest business in the world”.Another reason it was, and remains, an appealing business is because a crucial element of the industry in Ralph Roberts’ era still holds true today: the lack of competition.“The cable industry has never competed against itself,” says Leo Hindery, the former president of TCI, the cable operator that was eventually sold to AT&T and then to Comcast. The capital cost of laying cables was so prohibitive that once an operator had laid pipes in a particular street or neighbourhood, it effectively had that area to itself.Satellite television changed that dynamic. “Satellite could paint the whole sky,” says Mr Hindery, referring to operators such as DirecTV and Dish, which were unconstrained by the limits of physical cable infrastructure. With satellite’s coast-to-coast reach cable operators had to bulk up and, starting in 1998, they did in a period Mr Hindery calls the “summer of love”. Individual operators such as Comcast swapped systems with other providers — “at least two-thirds of the nation’s subscribers changed hands”, says Mr Hindery.Consolidation continued apace as operators linked individual cable systems, increasing the size of their regional markets. “We moved from an industry that once had 100 operators to 50, then 20,” says Mr Hindery. Fast forward to 2014 and there are even fewer operators; if the Time Warner Cable sale is cleared, the number of cable companies serving 5m or more subscribers drops from four to three.The prospect of the largest operator in a particular industry buying the second largest would normally set regulatory alarm bells ringing but Comcast executives are confident the deal will be cleared. “There is nothing in this transaction that will lead to a reduction of competition in any [US] markets,” says David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice- president — and the architect of the company’s political and regulatory strategy.Comcast operates across a swath of the northeastern US in cities such as Philadelphia and Boston, as well as Florida and parts of the west coast. Time Warner Cable has markets that include New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. “There is no competitive overlap and there is not a single consumer in America who will have less choice after this transaction,” says Mr Cohen.Comcast’s size and heft in the market for broadband provision is where opponents of the deal believe the TWC transaction could fall foul of antitrust authorities.“If the deal goes through it will make Comcast the gatekeeper over the future of communications,” says Craig Aaron, the president and chief executive of Free Press. “Want to start an online business that uses bandwidth? You will have to go to Comcast.”Comcast points out that it faces competition in broadband from a range of players: telecoms companies such as Verizon and AT&T offer broadband — as well as television services — to their subscribers. Google, which has laid high-speed fibre lines in Kansas City, also has designs on the broadband market.Yet none of these operators has as many customers as Comcast. The company and its cable peers have an inbuilt advantage over potential competitors from other sectors: the networks and cables they laid over the past decades. It turned out that the cables laid by Comcast to carry TV signals were also big enough to carry broadband signals. Broadband is on the way to becoming Comcast’s biggest business — and also gives it a natural hedge against “cord-cutting” cable customers who are cancelling their monthly video subscriptions.Younger viewers that have grown up watching online video may balk at expensive bundles of channels sold by the likes of Comcast and its competitors. But if these viewers want to watch streaming video offered by Netflix or new “over the top” services announced last week by CBS, the broadcast network, and Time Warner’s HBO channel, they will still need a fast internet connection, which is where the largest provider in the US — Comcast — comes in.Most American homes lack competitive choices for fixed high-speed internetWhether the FCC will allow Comcast to complete the TWC deal is up for debate, although Comcast has taken steps to head off potential concerns. “We’re going to sell and spin off about 4m customers,” says Mr Roberts, referring to a complex deal the company struck with Charter Communications. The move will keep Comcast’s share of the cable video market below a 30 per cent limit recommended by the FCC.Prof Crawford says Comcast reducing its share of the video market is “irrelevant”. The bigger issue, she says, is its power in broadband. “What really matters and what is really bringing profit to cable these days is infrastructure and the delivery of information.”Comcast, though, is relaxed about its share of the broadband market; Mr Cohen does not anticipate any regulatory concerns. This, he says, is because there no such thing as a “national” broadband market: consumers buy their services from local providers. “You can’t buy broadband as a consumer nationally. Relevant markets in antitrust [regulations] are driven by people’s ability to purchase services in the relevant market.”The FCC is taking increased interest in the broadband marketplace. Tom Wheeler, its chairman, recently expressed concern over the lack of competition in high-speed broadband provision. “Most American homes lack competitive choices for fixed high-speed internet,” he said. “Where meaningful competition is not available, the commission will work to create it.”Laying out a policy framework to deliver more competition, he added that “where meaningful competition is not available, the commission will work to create it”.It is unclear what this stance means for the deal; Comcast will have to wait to find out. What is clear is that the future of the media industry — which for so long has been gripped by a debate about whether content or distribution is “king” — will be contested on a broadband battlefield. A bigger Comcast will be ready for that fight.The Roberts family: Maintaining control and forging political linksFor all the big takeovers it has pulled off — AT&T Broadband for $72bn including debt in 2002; NBCUniversal for $30bn in 2013 — Comcast remains tightly controlled by the Roberts family.Brian Roberts’ stake in Comcast is worth about $1.2bn. But the company has a dual-class share structure; with about a third of the voting stock, he has effective control over the company that his father started with Julian Brodsky and Daniel Aaron.There was never any doubt that he would follow Ralph Roberts into the company. “If you found me at 10 and asked me: what do you want to do? I would have said ‘I want to work with my dad’,” Roberts says.As a young man he worked for Comcast in a range of roles — sales, marketing and “climbing poles”. “It was a fantastic apprenticeship,” he says.He was made president of Comcast when he was 30 and went on to oversee the most intense period of the company’s growth. “When I got out of college in 1981 we had almost $40m in revenue. We generated about $65bn in revenue last year and the business continues to grow.”The company’s growth has been matched by the forging of deep political connections. David Cohen, its regulatory and political chief, has hosted several fundraisers for Barack Obama. (The president joked at a 2013 fundraiser at Mr Cohen’s home that he had visited so frequently “the only thing I haven’t done in this house is have [the Passover] Seder dinner”). Mr Roberts has played golf with the president at Martha’s Vineyard.The influence of Ralph Roberts continues to shape Comcast. The elder Mr Roberts was himself profoundly affected by the Great Depression; as a child he saw his father lose everything. Ralph “always liked to keep a lot of cash and a lot of debt on the balance sheet”, says Mr Roberts. “But he liked to keep the cash because we’ll always be ready for a rainy day and with cash we can also be opportunistic.“If you lived through the Depression it changes you forever. You live your life assuming everything you have can be taken away from you. And that’s how Comcast got built.”This article has been amended since original publication. Professor Susan Crawford says at least half of all American households will only be able to receive high-capacity internet from Comcast, not two-thirds as previously stated."

552;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-10-19T16:24:05Z;TV’s big guns turn their sights on the digital upstarts;New streaming services from HBO and CBS show how the networks are fighting back;Television is cutting the cord. As viewers take control over what they watch and when they watch it, the companies behind the most popular shows are taking distribution into their own hands and squeezing more money from hits such as Game of Thrones and The Good Wife.HBO, the premium network owned by Time Warner, and broadcaster CBS unveiled plans to sell their services to people in the US without cable or satellite subscriptions last week. The moves are the biggest yet by traditional TV companies to reach consumers directly over the internet as they try to battle back against upstart streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.The networks are in many ways at opposite ends of the spectrum. HBO, home of Boardwalk Empire and Girls, has previously only been available with a pay-TV subscription. CBS, whose hits include The Big Bang Theory, the CSI franchise and David Letterman, has been broadcasting for free since 1941.Now both networks will sell online subscriptions aimed at a growing segment of Americans for whom watching television no longer means paying for cable, waiting for a show to air live or watching a series unfold slowly over a season.CBS and HBO will not be alone for long. Disney’s ESPN is planning a new online service to show professional basketball games. Sony and Dish are snapping up content for new internet video packages. Last week, SoftBank of Japan bought DramaFever, a streaming site that specialises in Korean television shows and movies.“Paradoxically, all of this is confirming the importance of television in people’s lives,” says James McQuivey, analyst at Forrester Research. “The reason we’re paying so much attention to HBO and CBS is that we know people want to watch those networks. Whoever can figure out how to give viewers [TV programmes] in a more convenient way is in a position to reap a significant windfall.”Consumers are watching more content online at their own convenience, shifting power away from the distributors that once held absolute control over when and how shows were aired. Content producers argue their product has even more value as viewing platforms proliferate and programming unbundles.“The growing availability of on-demand content, whether it’s through television, digital video recorders, video on demand or broadband delivery is providing consumers with a greater ability to control what, where and when they watch their favourite programmes,” Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner chief executive, told investors last week.Television providers and networks have championed “TV Everywhere”, which allows people to watch online – but only by logging in with their cable or satellite subscriptions. Online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon have demonstrated there is a market for digital video untethered from pay-TV.Mr Bewkes attributes these digital groups’ success to making on-demand video more consumer-friendly. “The tech company world has turned it on faster and better. Now it’s time for [the TV industry] to turn it on and market it vigorously,” he says. “We’ve had to say today, ‘We’re also going to do it’,” he says of the HBO announcement.CBS and HBO have the advantage of owning outright their extensive libraries, while the digital companies license the vast majority of their shows. Netflix is beginning to make its own programming but it does not own the rights to its biggest hit, political drama House of Cards, in several of its new European markets.New online subscription service for US viewers cuts ties with cableContinue reading“Netflix has done a beautiful job of making themselves appear to be HBO, but they’re not HBO. They don’t own the content,” adds Bruce Leichtman, president of Leichtman Research Group.But the question hanging over these digital experiments is whether the availability of more premium programming will accelerate the shift to internet viewing, potentially cannibalising the networks’ existing cable TV operations.HBO and CBS executives say there is no reason to fear the services will lead more people to cut their cable cords.Analysts are not so sure. Hulu Plus, a digital video service owned by Fox, Disney and Comcast, “hasn’t really imploded the media ecosystem”, says analyst Anthony DiClemente.But “taken together, adding HBO Go, CBS All Access and others could drive an acceleration in cord-nevers or cord-shavers or cord-cutting”, he adds, referring to consumers who have never paid for cable, those who subscribe to cheaper packages with fewer channels, and those who have given up their subscriptions.What is clear is that consumers’ choices are expanding rapidly.“Some people are already calling today a new golden era of television. I don’t think we’ve even begun to see how interesting television can be once the people who create the content have the financial incentive to make it even better,” says Forrester’s Mr McQuivey.
553;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
554;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;HBO/Netflix: tearing down the wall;New online subscription service for US viewers cuts ties with cable;Beyond the wall lies a dangerous world of ice, magic and giants, in the HBO hit series Game of Thrones. But beyond the wall is exactly where HBO will go, by offering a new online subscription service for US viewers who don’t have pay TV. (Previously, HBO was available in the US only to pay-TV subscribers.)The move helps HBO reach an audience who may not subscribe to cable TV (at least 10m homes in the US have broadband but no cable subscription). Starting next year, HBO will offer subscriptions through multiple channels, including via Xbox or alongside broadband, as well as though direct online subscription a la Netflix. HBO’s margins reflect the premium nature of its content – it produces TV shows in-house, and has exclusive rights to films from Fox, Warner Brothers, Universal and Summit. HBO has $5bn in revenue and 35 per cent operating margin.This will also raise pressure on Netflix, whose operating income margins fell to 4 per cent of revenues in the most recent quarter. Netflix reported earnings on Wednesday that missed guidance on new subscriptions, sending the share price down 25 per cent. Part of the reason for the slow subscription growth was higher subscription prices, suggesting Netflix doesn’t have much room to raise prices. Netflix pays dearly for the content that it buys, and its in-house hits, such as Orange is the New Black, are expensive to produce. HBO, on the other hand, benefits from its longstanding deals with big studios, including Warner Brothers, which, like HBO, is owned by Time Warner.Yet there is probably room for both Netflix and HBO to coexist, as their content and price-points are quite different. HBO’s subscription price, likely $15 or more a month, will be higher than Netflix at $9. Netflix is increasingly focused on content creation, recently announcing a deal to produce four films with Adam Sandler. As more competitors venture beyond the wall, content will be king.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
555;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-10-15T23:04:39Z;Netflix shares plunge on profit warning;New subscriber growth disappoints with 3m additions;Netflix shares plunged after the streaming video company gained fewer new subscribers than expected in the third quarter and warned fourth-quarter earnings would be sharply lower than Wall Street’s estimates.The shares fell 26 per cent to $330 in after-hours trading as the disappointing forecasts overshadowed a quarter in which earnings rose 86 per cent to $59.3m, or 96 cents a share, from $31.8m, or 52 cents a share, beating Wall Street’s 91 cents estimate. Revenue rose 27 per cent to $1.41bn, in line with analysts’ expectations.Netflix expects to add 4m new subscribers in the final three months of the year and post earnings of 44 cents a share, nearly half the 84 cents forecast by analysts.The addition of a net 3m subscribers in the three months ended September was below the 3.7m Netflix had projected, as international and domestic subscriber growth was slower than expected.“This quarter we over-forecasted membership growth,” Reid Hastings, chief executive, wrote in a letter to shareholders. He chalked up the slower US growth to the decision in May to raise prices for new members by $1 to $8.99 a month. “Slightly higher prices result in slightly less growth,” he said.The news came the same day that Netflix learned it will soon face more competition in the popular streaming video space, in which it holds a dominant position.Time Warner’s HBO, the premium channel behind Game of Thrones and Boardwalk Empire, said it would begin offering next year internet subscriptions in the US to people who do not pay for cable or satellite television, in a significant change to its business model.Mr Hastings addressed the subject in his letter, saying that he had been expecting the move. “It was inevitable and sensible that they would eventually offer their service as a standalone application. Many people will subscribe to both Netflix and HBO since we have different shows, so we think it is likely we both prosper as consumers move to internet TV.”Speaking on a webcast to analysts, Mr Hastings said HBO was “one more channel [so] there’s not much of a change in the direct competitive landscape.” He added, however, that the premium network would be another competitor when it comes to bidding for content from studios such as Warner Bros.Netflix has been expanding beyond its US base and launched services in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg during the quarter.Mr Hastings said its existing international businesses in Canada, the Netherlands, Ireland, the UK and Latin America were now collectively profitable.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareilThis article has been amended from an earlier version
556;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-10-15T16:57:54Z;HBO cuts ties to US cable subscriptions;The Time Warner-owned premium network behind Game of Thrones is to go ‘beyond the wall’;HBO, the premium network behind Girls and Boardwalk Empire, will launch an online streaming service in the US next year that does not require a traditional pay-television subscription.“It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO,” Richard Plepler, the unit’s chief executive, told investors in parent company Time Warner on Wednesday. “We will go beyond the wall,” he added, in a reference to HBO’s wildly popular series Game of Thrones.The offering will target the 10m homes in the US that pay for broadband internet access but do not have cable or satellite service. About half of those households already pay for streaming video services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.“That is a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped,” Mr Plepler said.He said the “over the top” offering would also create opportunities in international markets and “has the potential to produce hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue” for the premium network. HBO already offers a broadband-only service in the Nordic region.HBO did not provide any details about how pricing or whether the service will be offered as part of an internet service package.It will continue to be sold through cable and satellite providers, and said it would work with current partners as well as new ones to reach the 80m US households it says do not subscribe to the channel.The move appeared squarely aimed at Netflix’s dominance in online video streaming. ComScore estimates that 32 per cent of US households subscribe to Netflix. Shares in the company, which was due to announce earnings after markets have closed, were down 3 per cent in late morning trading.“This move by HBO was inevitable from the moment that people started streaming TV shows online,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester. “While pay-TV operators are certainly furious today, other cable programmers like Viacom and A&E are thrilled that HBO is shining a light down a path they may all have to contemplate in the future. None of them will have as easy a time as will HBO, but they all know they need an escape hatch for that moment when the current, bundled TV model begins to collapse.”HBO’s announcement came as Time Warner executives laid out their case that the entertainment company can achieve better growth and value as an independent group after rejecting a takeover offer from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox earlier this year.Time Warner will double earnings by 2018, CEO Jeff Bewkes told investors at an event three months after Mr Murdoch’s $71bn bid became public.“The fundamental plan is to invest in great content, leverage technology, expand internationally and efficiently deploy capital,” Mr Bewkes said. “I’m extremely comfortable that we have more than sufficient scale to compete effectively.”The company projects that adjusted earnings per share will rise from last year’s $3.77 to reach $6 by 2016 and more than $8 a share by 2018.Mr Bewkes touted Time Warner’s leaner profile as an entertainment company after shedding assets including AOL, Time Warner Cable and the Time Inc publishing division.“One of the advantages of being a more focused company is that our divisions naturally collaborate more,” he said.Time Warner will step up investment in original content with more partnerships between the Warner Bros film and TV production studio, Turner Broadcasting and HBO.Turner, the home of CNN, TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network, accounts for more than half of Time Warner’s operating income. It will double investment in original programming to $1bn by 2018, said John Martin, the unit’s chief executive.The division will work with Warner Bros to create more children’s programming, he said. “Today, Turner is dramatically underpunching its weight in the kids’ business.”The money for new programming will come in part from cuts Time Warner has been making across its businesses. Turner is eliminating 10 per cent of its workforce as it works to contain costs. That includes lay-offs at its flagship news channel, CNN, which along with its peers has suffered ratings declines this year.Warner Bros has also said it will cut jobs this year.“Time Warner now has the chance to prove it is worth more on its own than anything Fox was in a position to offer,” wrote Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, ahead of Wednesday’s presentation.Time Warner shares were up 1.1 per cent in late morning trading at $71.36. They have dropped 17 per cent since Mr Murdoch withdrew his bid in August and are trading around where they were before the offer became public in July.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
557;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-10-12T14:52:04Z;Starz to launch in international markets;US pay-TV network strikes deal with Sweden’s Parsifal;Starz, the US pay-television network behind shows such as Spartacus and Black Sails, has struck a deal to build an “over-the-top” video streaming service that will launch in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America.The company is creating the international Starz Play service with Peter Ekelund’s Parsifal Entertainment, which helped launch HBO’s streaming service in Nordic countries.The deal, which the company will unveil on Monday at the Mipcom television market in Cannes, comes as more channels launch video streaming services that circumvent traditional distributors, such as cable and satellite companies.The battleground of this so-called over-the-top distribution has been driven by the success of Netflix and HBO Go in the US, and services such as the BBC iPlayer in the UK, which has led other operators to enter the marketplace.Netflix, which operates in the US, Latin America and the UK, recently launched in several other European countries, while HBO, the premium cable network behind shows such as Game of Thrones, has scored in the Nordic market with its HBO Go digital platform.Most innovation in over-the-top services is taking place outside the US.“What we focused on is how quickly and dramatically HBO succeeded with its Nordic programme,” said Chris Albrecht, Starz chief executive – and the former chief executive of HBO.“The amount of money and capital investment needed to build these new platforms is a fraction of what it is to build a linear [television] channel,” he said. “This gives us an international business that has real potential.”Parsifal, a Swedish media group, has invested alongside Starz in the new venture, together with unnamed financial institutions. “We’re seeing a lot of indigenous investors willing to partner with US companies to make a stand in their own territories,” added Mr Albrecht.Mr Ekelund has experience of streaming services, having worked with HBO on its Nordic venture. “Viewing habits are changing,” he said. “With on-demand behaviour consumers are getting used to another way to watch television.”CBS, the owner of Showtime, which competes with HBO and Starz in the US, is also exploring an over-the-top streaming service. “Is there some time in the future that could happen? Absolutely,” said Les Moonves, CBS chief executive, recently.Shares in Starz have doubled since the company was spun out of John Malone’s Liberty Media at the beginning of 2013.It is among the companies that could be an acquisition target in the expected consolidation of the media sector, following the proposed $45bn takeover of Time Warner Cable by Comcast.The prospect of a Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination was one of the motivations for the recent $71bn pursuit of Time Warner by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.Fox abandoned the bid this summer after only a few weeks when its shares went into decline.
558;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-10-03T22:37:29Z;Brussels clears telecoms groups of ‘throttling’ services of rivals;European companies accused of ‘throttling’ services of rivals;"Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefónica have been cleared by regulators of “throttling” the services of rivals– avoiding a potentially bruising competition case.Last year, European Union officials raided the offices of the three telecoms groups over allegations that they were deliberately limiting access to data-heavy services, such as YouTube and Skype.But, on Friday, the European Commission said that, following a review, the practices of the telecoms companies “do not appear to breach EU antitrust law with a view to shutting out competitors from either the internet transit market or internet content markets”.Tensions between web-based services and telecoms companies have increased in recent years, as sites such as Netflix and Skype place a growing strain on operators’ networks.Large telecoms companies want to be able to charge web companies based on how much data they use. However, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said this week that this would amount to being “held hostage” by internet providers.“We should not have to pay for your network any more then you should have to pay for our content,” he argued.Telecoms companies have accused regulators of being overly aggressive toward them in recent years, making life more difficult for companies struggling with slow growth in Europe. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said European regulators should take this into account. “The industry is not returning enough capital in Europe,"" Mr Colao noted. ""The commission needs to accept that something has gone wrong.”"
559;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-30T06:58:36Z;Netflix in deal with BT-backed YouView;Agreement struck with platform owned by telecoms groups and broadcasters, including the BBC;Netflix is to sign a deal with UK telecoms groups, including BT and TalkTalk, to make its television shows and films available on their set-top boxes.The US streaming service has agreed a partnership with YouView, the internet TV platform that is owned by a consortium of telecoms groups and broadcasters, including the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5.Netflix is expected to be available on the platform by the end of the year, according to people familiar with the talks. That would leave BSkyB, with its 11m TV subscribers, as the only pay-TV provider in the UK to avoid on-demand services by other content owners.Telecoms groups have had mixed views about supporting Netflix, which consumes considerable broadband bandwidth and often competes with their own attempts to create TV services.BSkyB is yet to make its programmes available on Netflix in the UK, and Sky Atlantic, its flagship drama channel, competes with the streaming service’s high-end programming such as Orange Is The New Black.BT has so far focused its pay-TV efforts on sports content, rather than competing with Sky and Netflix on entertainment programming. TalkTalk does not generate any of its own content, while two other YouView partners – Channel 4 and the BBC – have made some of their old programmes available on the service.Netflix is also in talks to sign commercial arrangements with BT and TalkTalk that would bundle subscriptions into their customer offers in exchange for a minimum revenue guarantee.The US group has struck similar deals with internet service providers in other European markets, including Deutsche Telekom in Germany and Bouygues in France. Although already available online and through its app, access to the set-top box gives Netflix a means into the living rooms for consumers who would rather use and watch TV sets.YouView had a slow start following arguments among its shareholders, although those appear to have been resolved as BT and TalkTalk step up their TV offerings on the platform. It is planning to launch a new low-cost set-top box later this year, which will retail at little more than £100, although most sales are likely to continue to be bundled as part of a BT or TalkTalk subscription.Netflix has used exclusive access to hit US drama series such as Breaking Bad and the remake of House of Cards to push its service in the UK, and already has a similar deal with Virgin Media.
560;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Hollywood feels Netflix’s cutting edge;Streaming company pounces with deal for Crouching Tiger sequel;Netflix is challenging Hollywood’s carefully protected system of release “windows” for films by striking a deal with the Weinstein Company to premiere the sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on its streaming service.The film will be released at the end of August next year to Netflix’s 50m subscribers in more than 40 countries, and to big-screen Imax cinemas simultaneously, the streaming company said.The deal puts Netflix on a collision course with other cinema chains and exhibitors, which have fiercely resisted the so-called “day and date” release of movies, whereby they are launched in cinemas and on digital services on the same day.When Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, first floated day and date releasing in a speech last year, it prompted John Fithian, chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners in the US, to accuse the company of trying to “kill the cinema”.However, in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Sarandos said the simultaneous release of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend was a “natural evolution” of what the streaming service had already done with television programming.Netflix has already produced its own TV shows, including political drama House of Cards, and made the entire series available to be watched by subscribers from a single date – leading to a phenomenon known as “binge viewing”.“We were able to shake up the way television shows get distributed in favour of the consumer,” said Mr Sarandos, pictured. “We’re trying to innovate with movies on behalf of the consumer in the same way.”He acknowledged that Netflix was likely to encounter a “push back” from exhibitors and cinema chains over its Crouching Tiger release. But he argued that there would be demand for more films to be launched on Netflix, in conjunction with a simultaneous theatrical release.“It shouldn’t be such a big deal that we’re offering consumers choice in 2014,” he said. “We hope it will become the norm over time.”It’s like a big sporting event. People still go to the stadium even though they can watch it at home at the same timeRich Gelfond, chief executive of Imax, expressed confidence that the availability of the movie on Netflix would not hinder the cinema-going experience. “It’s like a big sporting event,” he said. “People still go to the stadium even though they can watch it at home at the same time.”The Crouching Tiger sequel is being produced by Harvey Weinstein and shot in the super high definition 4k format, for showing on Imax screens. Mr Gelfond said it would represent “a test” for Imax, which generates 60 per cent of its revenues from international markets. Imax will be the sole distributor of the film in China because Netflix is not yet available in the country.“Traditional movies will still be launched through traditional [release] windows,” said Mr Gelfond. But he predicted that simultaneous releasing of movies in cinemas and on digital services could be effective in slower months – such as the end of the summer – when there are fewer films in cinemas.“The moviegoing experience is evolving quickly and profoundly,” said Mr Weinstein, adding that Netflix was “at the forefront of that movement”.Mr Sarandos said the Netflix deal showed how the role of the internet in content distribution had changed. “There was a time when the internet was mostly for the lowest-quality content,” he said. “Deals like this turn that on its head.”
561;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-28T12:34:42Z;Branson’s big holiday offer – give us a break;A fixed entitlement tells us it is OK to take time off – even if our work is far from done;"Imagine working for an employer who treated you like a grown-up and let you take as much holiday as you liked. Wouldn’t that be lovely?This is the deal Sir Richard Branson is extending to his private staff, and almost everyone has judged it very lovely indeed. Last week, he wrote a blog post extolling his own smart move and in the comments below he was deemed to be showing the way to a better future. Sir Richard isn’t the first to introduce this policy – for years Netflix has been declining to monitor how much time its people take off – but he is the first to see how much good publicity can come from it.“It is left to the employee alone to decide if and when he or she feels like taking a few hours, a day, a week or a month off,” he explained, his words accompanied by a photo of him lolling in a hammock, smartphone in hand, the Caribbean Sea lapping beneath him, and the fronds of a palm tree almost touching the locks of his hair.Alas, there is a catch to all this sunshine and sand. Sir Richard goes on to explain that staff will only take time off when they “feel a hundred per cent comfortable that they and their team are up to date on every project”.Suddenly the deal looks like a staggeringly poor one for the people who run the entrepreneur’s office. In all the decades that I have worked, there has never been a single moment when I was 100 per cent comfortable that I was on top of everything. I can’t believe it is any different at Virgin.The trouble with modern work is that it is endless. You are never through it, which means that judging when to take a break is very difficult indeed. A fixed holiday entitlement tells us it is OK to take a break – even though our work is far from done.When it comes to holidays, we are pulled in two different directions. The more disaffected we are, the more holiday we want to take; the more ambitious, the more we’re inclined to take none at all.In neither case should the choice be left entirely to us. Those who would rather be on permanent holiday need to be told to come to work; those who can never bring themselves to take a break need to be told to take one.It is possible that the no-fixed-holiday policy might work if we all had a clear idea of what an acceptable amount of holiday looked like. But we don’t have a clue. It varies not only between people but between countries. In Europe we like a great deal of it – particularly in France where workers take a delightful 30 days – while in the US no one believes in holidays at all. The normal amount is 10 days, but only wimps actually take that. What is thought reasonable also varies between sectors – some teachers viewanything less than three months as an outrage – and even between companies in the same industry.Given all this, when we take a new job we need to know what the going rate is. If our employers won’t give us a hint, we have to work it out ourselves. A no-policy rule does not mean that no one is counting, but that we will all start monitoring each other’s holidays obsessively in order to work out how much to allow ourselves. It will take a brave person to book two weeks in the sun if their boss always settles for a long weekend.Flexible working has been the worst deal for professional workers – and the best one for their employers – that there has ever beenSir Richard says he hopes the scheme will be soon be copied by all his subsidiaries. But here I spot another catch. Is he really going to tell Virgin stewardesses, who currently are not at liberty to choose their own shade of lipstick, that they can take off as much time as they like? Or does he mean that the enlightenment will spread only as far as managers – which doesn’t sound terribly enlightened at all?Although the deal itself is a dud, it does have logic on its side. Netflix points out that as we no longer expect people to work 9 to 5, and we trust them to work from home, it is madness to cling to the idea of fixed holidays. This is quite right. But it still doesn’t make it a good idea, at least not for the employee. Flexible working has been the worst deal for professional workers – and the best one for their employers – that there has ever been. Productivity soars, not because everyone is happy to be given freedom, but because they find they never stop working. Netflix reports that its choose-your-own holiday policy has made productivity go up even further. I can quite believe it, and don’t approve one bit.This doesn’t mean the traditional way most employers approach holiday – keeping a minute track of all absences – is the right one. Excessive monitoring is almost always a bad idea. And the notion of an annual entitlement that cannot be carried over so that people end up taking holiday when it suits no one – that makes no sense, either. The answer is simple. Companies should state how much holiday people are expected to take, and then leave it up to them to take roughly that amount, give or take a day or two, as they see fit.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

Not a chance when it comes to marriages in media. US cable companies Comcast and Time Warner Cable are in the midst of the Federal Communication Commission’s review of their $44bn tie-up. This week, Comcast replied to the reams of feedback the FCC received about the deal. Comcast in effect accused Discovery Communications of extortion, alleging that Discovery demanded higher rates for its programming in exchange for supporting the deal. Throw in bad blood between Netflix and Comcast and the rehearsal dinner becomes a drunken brawl.There are two ways a Comcast/TWC clan, which would have 30 per cent share of the business, could change the market. Discovery and its peers would have less leverage in negotiating prices for its programming. In recent years, networks such as Discovery increased the fees they charged Comcast, TWC, DirectTV and other distributors faster than the distributors could increase consumers’ prices.Pay TV bills have risen enough that subscriber counts are falling. If consumers still want to watch TV programmes without a cable plan, however, they require internet connections. That is the second front of this war. Netflix opposes the merger because the new Comcast would be a dominant internet provider. Netflix has already voluntarily entered into “interconnect” agreements with Comcast and other broadband providers such as Verizon to ensure the quality of its streaming. But like Discovery, it remains leery about Comcast’s control of distribution.Comcast is paying for Time Warner with shares. Based on Comcast’s recent price, which is in effect unchanged from the February announcement, Time Warner shares are trading at a 7 per cent discount to the implied deal value. The betting says that the minister shouts down the rabble and that the happy couple will head off for their honeymoon.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
563;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix: Eurovision;Video-streaming site being introduced in six European countries;For an inmate, transferring to a prison means becoming instantly ostracised – as the protagonist in Orange is the New Black discovers. In a new facility, there are new gangs and new bullies: the rules of the game are never the same. Netflix, the subscription video-streaming site that produced the hit series, is making a big transfer of its own as it introduces its service in six European countries (including France and Germany) this week.The rules of the game are certainly different. Unlike the US, continental Europe has a hearty offering of free public TV that includes hit shows. And Netflix is not a first mover in these markets because the continent’s cable and media companies – and its state broadcasters – already offer plenty of ways to stream shows on demand. Add to that some Europeans understandably liking their own shows better. Netflix’s House of Cards, a smash hit in the US, flopped on German TV. The language barrier is a part of that problem. Only a fifth of Netflix’s offerings in France will be in French.Netflix has been the new kid on the block before, and come out on top. The company’s non-US revenues (from Canada, the UK, Nordic countries and Latin America) have doubled in the past year, while losses have steadily narrowed, hitting $15m last quarter. Two-thirds of Netflix’s new paid subscribers last quarter were outside the US (although, tellingly, most non-US subscribers are Anglophones, according to MoffettNathanson.) The company says its international segment would have been profitable by the end of this year – if it weren’t for all the launches, which will contribute to expected international losses of $42m this quarter.The prize is worth it, though. Just ask any prison gang: the more territory you control, the greater your clout when negotiating with others. Netflix stands to gain not only more subscribers (assuming it can get them) but also a stronger negotiating position with content providers. Given the cost of the expansion, it will need that muscle.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex
564;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Bouygues Telecom to offer Netflix service on set-top boxes;;Bouygues Telecom said that it will carry Netflix on its set-top boxes from as early as November, becoming the first French operator to team up with the video-on-demand service.The announcement, which came on the same day that California-based Netflix launched its services in France, is a potentially important step forward for Netflix as it undertakes its biggest international push to date.This week the subscription-based service will be rolled out from France to Germany and then Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg on successive days.But Netflix had so far failed to strike an agreement with France’s telecoms operators, which provide the set-top boxes that most households use to watch television.Executives of the country’s television stations, including Canal Plus, the pay-TV service owned by media and entertainment group Vivendi, had cited the lack of an agreement as one of several factors giving them confidence to compete effectively with Netflix.Bouygues Telecom’s decision could potentially encourage other providers to follow suit.Meanwhile, Numericable Group, a cable provider that this year agreed to buy Vivendi’s SFR mobile and broadband operator, at the weekend said that on Monday it would launch a Netflix-type service of its own.Orange, the country’s largest telecoms group by subscribers, does not yet have an agreement with Netflix – although last week, the company hinted that it could happen in the future.Bouygues Telecom, part of the Paris-based Bouygues construction, telecoms and media conglomerate, is France’s third-biggest operator with 14.5 per cent of the country’s mobile market and about 8 per cent of broadband customers, or 2.2m customers.Like other French operators, it has suffered from a cut-throat price war in the mobile sector since Iliad, the group controlled by French billionaire Xavier Niel, began offering its Free mobile services in January 2012 with ultra-low offers.More recently, however, Bouygues has made a big push to gain market share in the broadband market, undercutting rivals’ offers and extending the country’s fierce mobile telephone price war to the broadband and set-top box market.On Monday, Olivier Roussat, Bouygues Telecom’s chairman and chief executive, said that he was “delighted” to announce the partnership deal. “We intend to continue enhancing our offer so that customers can enjoy the best innovative content,” he said.
565;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-14T17:01:44Z;Netflix ready for its European close-up;;If there was any doubt in Marseille that Netflix was coming to town, Childéric Muller, a local politician, dispelled it this month when he tweeted: “Marseille is the new black.”The reference to one of Netflix’s most popular shows – Orange Is The New Black – and Marseille, the name of the company’s first original French series, came ahead of a big European push by the streaming video service. This week, the California-based company will launch its service in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg on successive days.“This is the biggest international launch we’ve ever done,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, in an interview. “It represents nearly 80m broadband households and about 200m people.”Rodolphe Belmer is not taking Netflix’s debut in France lightly. As managing director of Canal Plus, the pay-television arm of Paris-based Vivendi, he has been beefing up investments across the board, writes Adam Thomson.Continue readingNetflix has disrupted traditional viewing patterns with its on-demand service and original productions, such as House of Cards, shaking up the television hierarchy in Hollywood and beyond. The number of people using it recently hit 50m – 35m of its subscribers are in the US – propelling its shares to new heights.With a market capitalisation of almost $29bn, Netflix is approaching the value of longer established media companies, such as CBS, the US broadcast network, which has a market value of $30.6bn, and Viacom – the owner of Paramount Pictures, MTV and Nickelodeon – which is worth $33.5bn.International expansion is critical to its growth prospects, which is why this week’s launches are so important. “There’s still room to grow in the US but all of Netflix’s incremental growth will come from elsewhere,” said Paul Vogel, an analyst with Barclays.Netflix has been preparing the ground in France for several months to assuage concerns that its arrival will threaten the country’s cultural protection regulations.“Being culturally sensitive is one side of the coin,” said Mr Hastings, pictured below. “The other side is that French people love content. It is a nation that loves movies and takes movies very seriously.”Marseille, a drama about the city’s political machinations, is a statement of intent, he said. “We want to make it great for French speakers but also want to take it around the world.”China, a potentially huge market for Netflix where House of Cards has a cult following, is “a way off”, he said, but the company is looking at expanding into Asia. “Korea, Japan . . . there are great opportunities”.Netflix’s profits have been held back by its investments outside the US but its operations in Latin America, the UK and elsewhere are starting to bear fruit: excluding this new round of European launches Netflix’s non-US operations are on track to be profitable by the fourth quarter, the company said.There are obvious advantages to operating in more markets. It gives Netflix more clout when striking global licensing deals for shows, such as its recent agreement with Warner Brothers for the Batman spin-off, Gotham. Netflix has the right to air the show starting in 2015 in all of its territories.Rival distributors of television programming are consolidating and combining their operations – particularly in Europe – for similar reasons. Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox recently sold Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia to British Sky Broadcasting, in which it holds a 39 per cent stake – in effect creating a pan-European satellite player.Matthew Garrahan on the massive protest against proposed changes to net neutralityContinue readingJohn Malone’s Liberty Global, meanwhile, is assembling a network of European cable television operators, including Virgin Media in the UK and Unity Media in Germany, and is introducing a common operating platform for each market.Netflix has no physical infrastructure – no pipes to lay or satellites to launch – but has had to strike deals with internet providers in each of its new countries to ensure its video data can travel at adequate speeds to its customers.Rival distributors, particularly in France, have already expressed their displeasure at Netflix’s arrival. “We certainly expect shots from competitors and we’ve seen a lot of that,” Mr Hastings said. “They’re concerned because we bid up the costs of content. That’s good for producers, artists and talent. It’s not as good for the distributors.”But he insisted that Netflix has not affected audiences for television viewing. “Netflix does not mean disaster for Canal Plus or others in France or Germany. HBO [in the US] has more viewers than ever. The more incumbents make great shows the more they will grow.”Ultimately, he is hopeful that the company’s new markets will embrace video streaming as consumers have in the US and, more recently, the UK. “The benefit of streaming video and internet television is control,” he said. “You get to watch when and where you want and that’s powerful.”
566;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;France broadcasters braced for Netflix debut;;Rodolphe Belmer is not taking Netflix’s debut in France lightly. As managing director of Canal Plus, the pay-television arm of Paris-based Vivendi, he has been beefing up investments across the board.These include in Canal Play, the company’s popular video-on-demand service, in which he is investing millions of euros in content and advertising.“We know that there is always appetite for the new kid on the block, and Netflix will be a tough competitor,” Mr Belmer told the Financial Times.But like many of his French rivals, Mr Belmer is also confident that Netflix’s arrival will have a limited impact on the overall market.One reason, he said, is that French consumers are used to watching content on a television, via a set-top box provided by their telecoms operator, as part of a triple-play package of internet, television and fixed-line phone.Canal Plus paid the operators €150m last year to carry its services.But Netflix has not yet signed any agreements with the operators. That means that the US company wants to persuade consumers to watch content online instead, via their computers or other devices.“In the US and the UK, they did not have to fight against an existing consumer habit,” said Mr Belmer. “In France, they will.”A second reason is that for all France’s emphasis on the exception culturelle, the French public loves US content – and they already have it in abundance. An estimated 50 per cent of content shown on French television comes from the US. “There is no latent demand for it because it is so widely available already,” Mr Belmer said.One thing Netflix’s presence could do, however, is put pressure on French regulation.Since the 1980s, the country’s broadcasters have had to channel a percentage of their annual revenue to fund the French film industry.Broadcasters have long complained that the contributions are unfair and belong to a pre-internet era. The fact that Netflix, and other internet-based video-on-demand companies, are not subjected to the same rules may help the broadcasters to make their point more forcefully.
567;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-11T15:54:28Z;Online companies join battle over ‘internet slow lanes’;Massive protest erupts against proposed changes to net neutrality;A fierce battle is raging for the hearts and minds of web users – a battle that, if the heated rhetoric from each side is a guide, could have serious ramifications for the future of the internet.In one corner is a loose coalition of popular online services, such as Netflix, Reddit, Kickstarter and Foursquare, together with free speech and liberal advocacy groups. In the other are anti-tax organisations, cable companies such as Comcast, and telecoms providers including AT&T and Verizon.Their fight centres on “net neutrality”: the principle that all web traffic should flow across networks to users at the same speed, unimpeded by restrictions or the prioritising of certain traffic.It is a nebulous, complex issue that provokes responses ranging from the impassioned to the apathetic. On his HBO TV show, the comedian John Oliver recently said of net neutrality: “The only two words that promise more boredom in the English language are ‘featuring Sting’.”But this week saw a massive online protest against proposed changes to net neutrality principles. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates US internet provision, wants to give internet service providers the ability, under certain conditions, to charge companies such as Netflix for using high-speed networks.Opponents claim that this will skew the competitive landscape and create a two-tier internet. A website produced by a coalition of tech and free speech groups calling itself “Team Internet” this week urged all web users to tell the FCC to drop its proposals. On Wednesday, websites supporting the protest displayed large, slowly spinning circular icons – the symbols that appear when a website or online video takes too long to load – to draw attention to the issue.Their campaign generated 420,000 submissions to the FCC in a single day, while 146,000 calls were made to Congress and the White House, according to Fight for the Future, a non-profit group that is part of the coalition.Google, one of the prime movers in a campaign that helped to defeat another proposed reform of the web – the Stop Online Piracy Act of 2011 – has also joined the fray over net neutrality. It sent an email this week to supporters of the anti-SOPA campaign, urging them to “stand for an open internet”, saying: “Internet policy should be like the internet itself . . . free and inclusive”.Most critics of the FCC’s proposals want to reclassify broadband provision as a public utility. This, they claim, would prevent the creation of online fast lanes for companies willing to pay more. But opponents of reclassification say it would slow innovation and deter companies from investing in high-speed broadband networks. On a website called www.dontbreakthe.net, another coalition makes the case for not reclassifying broadband as a public utility, arguing that public utilities are “lousy at delivering high tech services”.Broadband providers, it says, “are constantly pushing the boundaries of technology to keep pace with exploding demand. If you regulate broadband like you regulate water, competition will evaporate.”This may or may not be true. While the market for broadband provision is supposed to be competitive with both cable and telecoms providers vying to offer services, in some big markets such as New York there are areas where only one operator offers high-speed services.But in other parts of the US, telecoms groups are belatedly getting in on the act after the cable sector stole their thunder. Cable companies had realised a decade ago that the pipes carrying analogue TV signals into homes could also carry high-speed internet traffic. The switch from analogue to digital channels has freed up space in those cables, enabling companies such as Comcast to offer a range of internet services at faster speeds.Now, telecoms operators are fighting back – and this competition should eventually heat up. AT&T and Verizon are both pushing fast internet access, and offering pay-TV as part of their bundle of services.In the meantime, the FCC will have to wade through a vast trove of comments and submissions as it draws up new principles on net neutrality. And while it remains a complex subject, public interest is growing. When John Oliver took aim at the FCC’s proposals and urged his TV audience to contact the regulator, irate viewers sent more than 1m submissions. Unlike Sting’s Broadway musical The Last Ship, perhaps net neutrality is not that boring, after all.Matthew Garrahan is the FT’s media editormatthew.garrahan@ft.com
568;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-09T18:41:28Z;Netflix joins net neutrality protests;Popular websites warn of a two-tiered internet;A coalition of some of the web’s most popular sites – including Netflix, Kickstarter and Reddit – will on Wednesday stage an online protest, warning that proposed changes to “net neutrality” rules will create a two-tiered internet.The companies want to cover the web with spinning circular icons – the graphics that appear when a website or video is taking a long time to load – to symbolise the slower download and streaming speeds that they claim are inevitable if the proposals become law.In April, the Federal Communications Commission proposed changes that would allow internet service providers, under certain conditions, to charge companies such as YouTube and Netflix for using higher speed networks – and providing better quality video streams.The FCC move followed a US court ruling that found it had initially overstepped its powers by imposing rules on net neutrality – the principle that all internet traffic should be given equal treatment.However, the new proposals sparked an uproar, and led to the FCC receiving about 1.1m public comments in the initial feedback period – fuelled, in part, by the comedian John Oliver, who used his HBO television show to call for action. Responses to those comments are due next week.“Consumers, not broadband gatekeepers, should pick the winners and losers on the internet,” said Netflix in a statement.“Strong net neutrality rules are needed to stop internet service providers from demanding extra fees or slowing delivery of content to consumers who already have paid for internet access. Any FCC rules must ensure access to content without ISPs favouring, impeding or charging particular content companies.”The coalition, which has billed itself “Team Internet” against “Team Cable”, reunites some of the companies and advocacy groups that successfully mobilised web users in a mass protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act. That legislation, which aimed to protect intellectual property, was dropped two years ago by US lawmakers.But in the net neutrality debate, lawmakers have also weighed in against the FCC’s proposals. Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, sent a letter to the FCC on Monday saying that she was worried that the FCC plan would allow broadband providers to discriminate against the kind of content that “consumers and innovators create and enjoy”.“I oppose special internet fast lanes, only open to those firms large enough to pay big money or fraught enough to give up big stakes in their companies,” Ms Pelosi wrote.She said she favoured the FCC reclassifying broadband providers as public utilities as a way of safeguarding net neutrality – a move advocated by others who oppose the FCC’s current proposal. However, such a reclassification could also be subject to legal challenges and is opposed by broadband providers including Comcast, Verizon and AT&T.The FCC has already lost two court cases challenging its net neutrality rules, prompting it to propose its latest plan.The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on net neutrality next week. Congress also held hearings on the topic before the August summer break.
569;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-09T11:35:55Z;A Netflix for independent film fans;The demise of the DVD has opened the door to a start-up that provides movie buffs with the extras;We are witnessing the death knell of the DVD, a market that once accounted for up to 60 per cent of a film’s revenues, now declining at up to 10 per cent a year, according to industry figures.The blame is laid at the door of video streaming services, dominated by Netflix, Apple’s iTunes service and Amazon.com. However something is being lost that these services do not provide – all those extras you would get alongside the film in a DVD box, such as deleted scenes and behind-the-camera footage.Enter a start-up operating in London called We Are Colony, a video-on-demand service designed to provide online movie-goers with the kind of independent film archive previously available only in niche video rental shops (remember them?) plus rare extra content such as scripts.Founder and chief executive Sarah Tierney is an award-winning film and television producer.Her pitch is to use video-on-demand to connect filmmakers with passionate fans of the medium. We Are Colony has only been available since June, but already has thousands of users in more than 100 countries.Initial investment in the company came from the owners of the UK digital agency Zone, followed by money from the Technology Strategy Board, the Digital R&D for the Arts Fund and SeedCamp, the early-stage technology business accelerator programme.“The kind of content we provide appeals to fans and film producers,” Ms Tierney says. “We provide the stuff you cannot get anywhere else.”Niches are important for most disruptive business models. The one thing this business cannot do, however, is recreate the musty smell and peeling wallpaper of an art house cinema.
570;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-09T06:00:52Z;Netflix versus the BBC: who makes drama more efficiently?;;"Which is better value: Netflix or the BBC?Some TV viewers – especially younger ones – seem to think the answer is Netflix. It has cool new shows, including House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. And a subscription costs UK viewers roughly half as much as the BBC – £6.99 a month, compared to the BBC’s licence fee, which works out at £12 a month.But the BBC wants to knock down the Netflix-mania, at least when it comes to drama.The broadcaster, which scored big at last month’s Emmy Awards, where the hit series Sherlock won seven awards, argues that it delivers more drama with less money than the US streaming service:For the value of 2 series (22 hours) of House of Cards, British audiences got 14 series and nearly 80 hours of drama; from Luther to Crimson Field, from Call the Midwife to The Fall, from Sherlock to Burton and Taylor.The numbers would appear to back up their claim: Netflix paid a reported $100m for House of Cards – which equates to about £2.8m per hour. The BBC’s most expensive dramas probably cost about £1.5m per hour.But the comparison isn’t entirely fair: for Netflix, House of Cards was a statement of intent, marking its arrival as a serious content producer. In contrast, the BBC has years of pedigree that attracts stars. Its biggest dramas, Doctor Who and Sherlock, are successful franchises that it has long owned.The real question is can the BBC still attract the best talent – and generate new hits – when its budgets are significantly less than those of Netflix and its peers?Already, series of Sherlock are short because actors have more lucrative commitments in the US. Domestic rivals are also muscling in. ITV, having commissioned the on-screen successes of Broadchurch and Downton Abbey, is building a strong production business. Sky is partnering with HBO, the US cable network, on drama projects. There is a race to invest, with distributors seeing content as their insurance policy against the rise of Netflix, YouTube and so on.The BBC’s response, ahead of a debate on the renewal of the licence fee, likely to start in earnest next year, has been to team up with like-minded broadcasters. It is in talks to sell a stake in BBC America to AMC, with which it co-produced the high-end drama An Honourable Woman. But whether that is sufficient remains to be seen.In the short term, spending less per hit may seem like a virtue. In the medium term, it is a weakness.—p.s. Why is the BBC making these arguments? The public service broadcaster is trying to argue that it spends the £3.7bn a year it receives from British licence fee payers efficiently. Critics argue that the BBC wastes money on bureaucracy and that its in-house productions, like Doctor Who, could be made more cheaply by independent companies. The broad comparisons above do not answer those critics directly; they seek instead to change the terms of the debate."
571;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-09-03T00:57:45Z;Netflix calls on Batman for global push;;Netflix has secured exclusive global rights to Warner Bros’ new Batman series Gotham as the video streaming company ramps up its international business.It is the first time the Los Angeles-based company has signed a deal with a studio to stream a television show in all of its territories, giving it a greater hold over global distribution of content as its international subscriber growth accelerates.“The way we get more global is to get closer to the producer,” said Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer. The company did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.Netflix passed 50m subscribers in the second quarter of this year, with most of the growth coming from outside the US. However, only about a quarter of its subscribers are international, suggesting that the company has a lot of room to expand beyond Canada, Latin America, the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia.It is launching in Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg this month, a move it says will lift its international addressable market to more than 180m households with broadband, twice the number of current US broadband households.In some of those new markets, Netflix does not own the rights to stream its own originally produced content, including the lauded political series House of Cards, which is carried by the pay-television company Canal Plus in France, for example. Securing global rights to shows such as Gotham means it can enter new markets with a strong line-up of both original programming and other studios’ content.“It used to be that you could wait for a year to see if a show was going to be successful before you bought it” for international markets, Mr Sarandos said. In an age where plot twists are discussed in near-real time on Twitter, he said that Netflix was seeking to “close the gap between the first [international] availability and the US broadcast”.Netflix will also be taking on more risk by signing a deal for a show before it has aired anywhere and proved to be a success or failure.For Time Warner’s Warner Bros, cutting a global deal with Netflix marks a change from its usual practice of licensing content country by country.This is a well-established global brand. It should play everywhere we operate and everywhere we’re going to operate“It was a unique opportunity, a compelling offer and we decided at this particular time for this particular show, we would go ahead and make this deal,” said Jeffrey Schlesinger, the studio’s president of worldwide television distribution. “The advent of Netflix international is a great benefit because it added a new player and an incremental stream of revenue.”But he added that “there is a lot of competition out there” in international streaming, including Amazon in the UK and Germany, a new Australian venture by Nine Entertainment and Fairfax, and pay-TV companies including BSkyB, Foxtel and Sky Deutschland.“One alternative is going with one company in multiple countries. Another is going into multiple countries with multiple players. Different deals will lead us in different directions,” Mr Schlesinger said.Making a show quickly available on a streaming platform can allow it to build up a larger audience than it would on broadcast alone and attract viewers who are able to catch up on a season before the next one airs – a habit that helped boost the popularity of acclaimed shows including AMC’s Mad Men and Breaking Bad.Gotham, which premieres in the US on the Fox broadcast network later this month, will appear on Netflix in 2015. The exact timing of availability in different countries will depend on when the show airs on local television in each region, but Netflix says streaming will begin as soon as possible after the broadcast run.The series, based on DC Comics characters, tells the story of young Bruce Wayne before he becomes Batman, and rookie detective James Gordon before he becomes Gotham City police commissioner.“This is a well-established global brand. It should play everywhere we operate and everywhere we’re going to operate,” said Mr Sarandos.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
572;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Shelf improvement;In 2013, Nielsen data show we bought 323 million books. Many of them appear to be on my bedside table;"I do not have a good track record with New Year’s resolutions. But this summer, for probably the very first time, one of my pledges is still going strong. I have not bought a single book since last December.It was as I tried to squeeze all 784 pages of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch – my final purchase of 2013 – on to an already overcrowded bookshelf that I realised I had a problem. Piles of books were all over the house, many of them unread. There were unopened political doorstops; texts from the undergraduate canon with embarrassing student notes on 10 pages – “heteronormative cliché!” was a particular favourite – before my attention petered out; stacks of classics consigned to the “one day when I have time” category. Clearly my supply and demand assessments were way, way off.And so the pact began. My rules were simple. Books could be accepted as gifts or used when needed for work. They could be purchased for others, but not as a backhanded way of smuggling them into my own library. My fellow Brits may have spent £2.2bn on books in 2013 but I was no longer going to be one of them. Every page I turned in 2014 had to come from those already inside my house.Imposing artificial restrictions to create some semblance of order on the stuff that clogs up our lives is nothing new. I’d even attempted it before with some success: vowing to use up every last bar of novelty soap and oddly scented bottle of moisturiser before shelling out for new ones. But I found that cleanliness is a lot easier to manage than literary predilection.When it comes to possessions, things are made worse by the fact that my generation awkwardly straddles a divide. Old enough to remember the mix tape but young enough to be digital natives, we have managed to accumulate in both camps. Box sets sit forlornly by our televisions as we click through the almost infinite offerings of Netflix. Photo albums jostle for space while we download image after image on to our laptops. Even among the most fanatical technophiles, it is rare to go into a house with not a single book in sight.Enter ever more elaborate systems of management. When it comes to literature, many book lovers curate the deluge of material that surrounds them. Some plough their way through one particular author or read exclusively about the Middle East or Victorian statesmen. Others organise their shelves by spine colour or religiously revisit the same five favourites annually. My new tactic of reading only what I already own turns out not to be new at all: Susan Hill wrote a whole book on the subject, Howards End is on the Landing, in 2009. (For obvious reasons, I haven’t been able to buy it.)But coping strategies often dissolve in the face of temptation. And temptation is everywhere. There is always another review, recommendation or must-read list. Despite the habitual gloom that surrounds publishers, sales and our reading habits, there is also no shortage of material. A recent study by the International Publishers Association showed that the UK published more new titles and re-editions per person in 2012 than any other country. In 2013, Nielsen data show we bought 323 million books.Many of them appear to be on my bedside table. There is always the decluttering option of the ebook, which accounted for a quarter of books bought in the UK last year. But an over-crammed and under-read Kindle can be as guilt-inducing as a buckling shelf. Then there is the hydra that is online reading. Chop off the head of one must-click article and there are immediately five more links clamouring in its place. Gone are the days when you could tick anything off your reading list completely: the internet is the gift that won’t stop giving.…And so the fightback begins.For me, strategy piled on top of strategy as I started to alternate first fiction and non-fiction, then locations and periods. I focused on the uncracked spines, only heading for an old favourite when the novelty got too much. A typical pattern consisted of Graham Greene’s The Heart of the Matter (an undergraduate casualty), followed by Ted Sorensen’s memoirs (purchased summer 2009 for holiday, jettisoned as too heavy for suitcase) and then Sense and Sensibility (much better the second time around).Seven months in, I’ve probably got through about 20 previously neglected books. The bank account is a little healthier, the shelves under no additional strain and my sense of guilt considerably smaller. Next year I may even tackle my wardrobe. And the local bookseller has nothing to worry about. Five months to go and I’ll be knocking down his door. Unless someone wants to give me the new JK Rowling?alice.fishburn@ft.comIllustration by Luis Grañena"
573;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-07-28T15:07:23Z;Investors more wary over tech stock run;;"True believers in the long-running US equity bull market, which has confounded sceptics and sparked worries about another brewing stock market bubble, focus on the leadership by this generation’s so-called ‘game changers’.Among the high-profile companies seen redefining their industry are the likes of Amazon and Google as well as Facebook, Netflix, Tesla and various smaller companies at the frontier of hyper growth prospects in biotechnology, social media and the internet.The penchant among some investors for the racier side of the market reflects the lacklustre nature of the US economy in recent years. Against the backdrop of less than compelling broad activity, investors have bet big on companies that are growing quickly or, in the case of biotechs, possibly on the cusp of being transformed by developing a cutting-edge drug.“The market is interested in companies that can grow independently of the economy and they are willing to pay higher multiples for those,” says Robert Stimpson at Oak Associates.After a notable swoon a few months ago, many of these so-called momentum stocks have rebounded as economic data have been mixed and underlying volatility loitered near a record low, helping propel the broad S&P 500 into uncharted territory.The Nasdaq Biotech index, for example, has risen about 20 per cent from its April low, while Netflix has rebounded more than 30 per cent from its April nadir, with Gilead Sciences, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Tesla also recovering in the region of 25 per cent since the spring sell-off.Such a performance has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which warned earlier this month that valuation metrics for smaller firms in the social media and biotechnology industries “do appear substantially stretched” despite a notable downturn in equity prices for such firms early in the year.Steve Weeple, senior investment director at Standard Life Investments, says the Fed has raised an important point about the rise in valuations of small companies in social media and biotech; namely the importance of being a diligent stock picker.“When the success of strong companies filters down to smaller companies in the sector that have not yet delivered, investors need to be wary,” says Mr Weeple.In the case of Facebook, Mr Weeple says they are impressed by the company’s ability to monetise its advertising opportunities, without detracting from its social media purpose.Big earnings results from the likes of Facebook and Gilead last week have only underlined that valuations are secondary for companies at the frontier of growth.“Relying on valuations as the basis for making a decision about buying companies that are in the process of redefining their industry is not the right approach,” says Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG. “Investors should gauge their growth prospects. That is the difference between a Tesla and a GE.”And prospects remain highly appealing on that score.Adam Parker and his equity team at Morgan Stanley say revenue estimates for the next year suggest technology, internet and software will most likely be the three fastest growing industries in the market.“So on the one hand managing a portfolio with no exposure to trends like cloud, big data and analytics seems foolhardy. On the other hand, high growth rates in many of these stocks are already implied by today’s prices.”The question now is whether these companies can rally further or are poised to consolidate and deliver lower returns, particularly should the economy accelerate above an annualised growth rate of 3 per cent. Under that scenario, investors should rotate away from momentum stocks to cyclicals. However, the economic outlook remains a big wild card.“There is a legitimate argument that with the end of quantitative easing there will be slower growth,” says Mr Stimpson.“Social media names are all expensive. It is more of an indication of growth companies receiving a premium valuation in periods where growth is harder to come by.”So long as the economy muddles along and implied volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix slumbers near a record low, betting on growth stocks and ignoring high valuations appears to have traction as the defining strategy for US equities.Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, says relying on momentum as an investing strategy only works when volatility remains contained. “These stocks can run further, even with stretched valuations, so long as the Vix stays low.”For some investors, however, missing out on the final growth flourish is prudent as they anticipate a strengthening economy.Richard Madigan, chief investment officer at JPMorgan Private Bank says it sold out of high-growth momentum stocks at the end of last year in anticipation of a stronger US economy this year.“A year ago we felt good about high-growth companies as the economy was not expanding quickly. Now the economy is improving and we are not willing to pay a premium for growth stocks.”Mr Koesterich adds: “In a world in which stretched valuations leave stocks dependent on the Fed’s cheap money policies and vulnerable to bad news, we’d continue to emphasise a value bias.”"
574;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;BSkyB invests in virtual reality start-up;;BSkyB has doubled its bet on virtual reality, investing a further $400,000 in Californian start-up Jaunt – a specialist in creating panoramic 3D video effects.The move puts the UK’s pay-TV provider at the forefront of efforts to use these technologies for television, following Facebook’s $2bn acquisition of Oculus Rift, a maker of augmented reality headsets.Jaunt – in which Sky also invested $350,000 in December 2013 – allows broadcasters to film 360 degrees, and give viewers an immersive 3D experience by displaying their content on devices such as Oculus Rift’s headsets, rather than traditional television screens or mobile devices.“Jaunt will let you travel to faraway places, experience breathtaking natural vistas, sit front row at your favourite concert and courtside at the game – all from your living room,” the company says on its website.However, some previous leaps in audiovisual technology, such as 3D cinema and television, have fallen short, in part because few films were made using the format.“If there isn’t enough content available when you launch it big-time, people get very jaundiced,” said Steve Dann, chief executive of Amplified Robot, an augmented reality and virtual reality company in London.With 360-degree 3D technology, content makers face the additional challenges of having to conceal the presence of the production crew – who can no longer simply be hidden behind the camera as they are in today’s films and television – and avoiding jerky playback of pictures, as viewers move their field of vision.Sky, which opened a small San Francisco office this year, said its investments in Jaunt would provide “additional insight into developments within the field”.Its investment in Jaunt follows backing for other technology start-ups including Roku, which makes devices to stream online video, and Beamly, a social networking app focused on TV which was formerly known as Zeebox. It has also invested $8m in the venture fund Luminari Capital.Sky has been seeking to reinvent itself as a provider of a broader array of media services in order to compete with online video providers such as Netflix.Nearly 5.7m Sky households – more than half of the company’s TV customers – have installed internet-connected high-definition boxes.Jaunt said Sky’s first investment in its technology was part of a $6.7m funding round, with other investors including Redpoint Ventures, a backer of Netflix, and Dolby chairman Peter Gotcher.“VR as it exists today is mainly about video games,” its chief executive Jens Christensen said in April. “We want to broaden the VR experience to mainstream entertainment.”Jaunt has not disclosed the investors in its latest round.
575;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-07-27T07:20:49Z;Sitting on the fence is an attractive option;Sharp rotations across asset classes have left investors battered and uncertain what to do next;This year has been a brutal one so far for fund managers, though you would not know it from the headline figures. Equity markets have moved largely sideways and volatility has remained low, but underneath this apparent calm, sharp rotations across asset classes have left many investors feeling battered, confused and uncertain about what to do next.In 2013, equities outperformed bonds by the biggest margin for many years, with the Japan Topix, the Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 posting gains of 54 per cent, 38 per cent, 32 per cent and 37 per cent respectively.The confidence this created led many managers to ratchet up their risk levels coming into 2014. Unfortunately for them, the performance of equities has not mirrored that of last year. As of July 14, Japan is down slightly, the Nasdaq is flat and the S&P 500 has experienced only modest gains. At the same time, GSCI soft commodities, gold and equities from emerging markets, such as Brazil, are among the top performers year to date, having sat at the bottom of the performance table in 2013.Further pain has come from the short positions many took on 10-year bonds, believing that yields would rise to 3 per cent. When rates went in the other direction, falling to 2.5 per cent, sharp losses were felt across the board.There were widespread losses at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second as the market in momentum stocks such as Netflix, the video-streaming service, Tesla, the electric carmaker, and Amazon, the online retailer, sold off. The catalyst for this was probably Janet Yellen’s comment in her first press conference as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve that the US would be likely to start raising interest rates about six months after it had finished winding down quantitative easing. After that, the markets went into something of a tailspin. Carnage ensued, as so many investors were concentrated in just a few names.In response to all this, managers have taken risk off the table as they try to figure out their next move. Few know it yet. In the great bull/bear debate, the number of “neutral” readings is higher now than it has been since 2003 – in other words, most people have no idea what will happen next. And in a low-visibility environment where virtually all recent bets have failed, sitting on the fence is an attractive option.One of the main things investors are struggling to come to terms with is the fact that both bonds and equities have been rising recently. Are yields moving lower because the situation in the US is worse than it appears and the equity markets (which are also moving up, albeit modestly) have got it wrong? Or are equities right and bonds overvalued, which would raise the prospect of a bond rout in the near future? Surely they cannot both be right?I think equities are probably right and that the US economy is in good shape. In June, 288,000 jobs were created and the unemployment rate declined to 6.1 per cent. But the reaction to these numbers was fairly muted, which suggests people are treating them cautiously.Ultimately, everything depends on when the Fed raises interest rates. This is what the market is trying to work out – its problem is that the Fed probably does not know yet either. If there is a repeat of last year’s yield scare it could cause chaos, but I do not think that will happen. Yields are more likely to move slowly up to around 3 per cent on 10-year Treasuries. I believe the Fed will raise rates in the second or third quarter of next year. Yields will probably begin moving before then as the markets anticipate the rise, leading to a sell-off in bonds.All of which means that I think now is probably a good time for a lot of investors to begin looking at risk assets again. European risk assets in particular look like good value and the US looks reasonably priced, although as the sharp sell-off in early July showed, both markets remain vulnerable.The picture is mixed in emerging markets. It will probably be a difficult period for the larger EM countries, particularly those such as Brazil and South Africa that fund in US dollars and run big current account deficits. On balance, however, I think the signs are that it is a good time to be “risk on”: the world is growing, margins are good and there are some very good opportunities out there.Andy Warwick is a portfolio manager within BlackRock’s diversified strategies team
576;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-07-24T12:58:52Z;Slingbox M1: watch TV anywhere on any device at any time;The new Slingbox is cheaper, easier and the best way to watch any TV you could have watched at home;"Technology has made it much easier to watch television in more locations and on more devices. I have been testing the latest “place shifting” device from Sling Media, designed to deliver your TV programmes, movies and recorded video to you, wherever you are.Slingbox M14/5

On holiday overseas recently, I was able to watch television coverage of my favourite baseball team on my laptop screen, even though the New York Yankees games were not carried by the satellite TV operator where I was staying.Sitting next to the pool, lemonade in hand, I had two options at game time. I could watch the action on my laptop or smartphone by signing up to MLB.TV Premium, a monthly $25 cloud-based subscription service. Or I could watch the games by logging in to my Slingbox 350, which was hundreds of miles away next to my TV at home and streaming programmes from my home cable TV provider over the internet.I chose the second option because once you have bought and set up the Slingbox, accessing live TV programming is free. Also, my Slingbox is plugged in to a Tivo set-top box so I can watch movies and other programmes, such as a Yankees game, when I like.While more cable and satellite operators allow their subscribers to watch some channels on mobile devices using so-called TV-anywhere apps, Slingbox owners can watch anything they could have seen on their TV at home, anywhere in the world, on any device and in full HD.Now Sling Media is bringing out the latest Slingbox, the M1. As a fan, I eagerly unplugged my 350 model and set about testing the new version.The M1 may look rather ordinary – a black plastic box the size of a small box of chocolates – but several distinguishing features make it worth checking out, including built-in WiFi, improved app support and a lower price than the Slingbox 350.Pricing and set-up: At $150 (UK pricing is yet to be announced), the M1 is the lowest-priced Slingbox so far. Set-up is also easier because the M1 has built-in WiFi networking capabilities, so it can be hooked up to a home network without needing an Ethernet cable. Previously only the pricier Slingbox 500 – renamed Slingbox TV – had WiFi capabilities.As well as connecting to your home WiFi network, set-up involves connecting the M1 box to the component video outputs on your cable or satellite set-top box, and setting up a Slingbox account online. One small gripe: an HDMI connection would have been better, as it would involve a single cable and higher quality video.How it works: As with the other Slingboxes, the M1 takes video from your cable or satellite TV box, or digital video recorder, and streams it over the internet to a wide variety of devices. For Windows PCs and Macs, you use a free browser plug-in; for iPads, iPhones, Android smartphones and tablets, and Windows phones, you use dedicated mobile apps that cost $15.I used the M1 to stream TV programmes to my Samsung smartphone and an iPad in various rooms in my house, before venturing out into the wider world. I then put it to the test via a mobile broadband WiFi hotspot while commuting to the office. The video quality was noticeably sharper over my home network but still acceptable over the slower mobile broadband link.You can also use the M1 to view all the content available on your main TV on a second set, whether at home or elsewhere. For that you need a Roku streaming media box or Apple TV, and the Slingplayer mobile app on an iPad or iPhone to control what channels appear on the second set.The verdict: I was impressed by the performance of the M1 and the updated Slingplayer mobile apps. Sure, you can use the web-based mobile apps now offered by cable TV operators and others, but a Slingbox device is still the easiest, cheapest and the best way – without paying for a second cable or satellite TV subscription – in which to watch any TV you could have watched at home, wherever you are.Planet of the AppsWhat it is: Trip Finder from Momondo, free web appWhy you should try it: Say you want a family holiday in a hot destination with a heavy dose of culture, leaving next month and have a limited budget – but you are not sure where to go. Trip Finder, launched this week, helps users find the appropriate destination from among nearly 200 locations worldwide based on your criteria.

577;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-07-22T17:07:16Z;Chipotle outpaces rivals on strong sales;Results contrast with those from McDonald’s;Chipotle continued to outpace rivals in the fast food sector, reporting strong gains in same store sales as peers including McDonald’s, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell fail to ignite consumer interest.Profits at the chain known for its steak and barbacoa tacos climbed 26 per cent to $110.3m, or $3.50 a share, in the quarter to June 30. Sales climbed 29 per cent to $1.05bn as same-store sales rose 17.3 per cent.Analysts on Wall Street had expected profits of $3.09 a share from sales of $990m.The results contrasted with those from McDonald’s, which once again saw tepid demand in the US for its burgers and fries. Same-store sales at the company’s US outlets declined 1.5 per cent in the quarter, a steeper dip than analysts expected.While McDonald’s has continued to focus its strategy around lower cost items through its dollar menu, executives at Chipotle have lifted prices at the chain’s 1,600 restaurants since April, a decision they argue has offset rising food inflation.The move received little push back from Chipotle’s fervent following and the company now expects same-store sales to increase by a “mid-teens” percentage over the remainder of this year.“We continue to believe Chipotle [is] the best growth story in restaurants,” Jeffrey Bernstein, an analyst with Barclays, said. “With most restaurants struggling to drive positive traffic, Chipotle remains an anomaly, justifying an outsized valuation.”Shares in the Mexican restaurant chain soared 12 per cent to $659.77 on the news, while McDonald’s retreated 1 per cent to $96.27. Taco Bell owner Yum Brands advanced 1 per cent to $74.84.Harley-Davidson led the benchmark S&P 500 lower on Tuesday after the company cut its outlook for full-year shipments.The motorcycle maker now forecasts a 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent rise in shipments this year compared to 2013. In April, it had predicted growth of between 7 and 9 per cent.The company pinned the blame on poor weather and a lull in sales of one of its models before the release of a new version later this year.Harley-Davidson shares fell 5 per cent at $63.46.Profits at Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest soft drinks maker, slipped in the second quarter as sales in the US failed to lift off.The company said net income fell 3 per cent to $2.6bn, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of June. Revenues were also under pressure, falling to $12.6bn from $12.7bn.Coca-Cola, which built its brand and fortune selling the world fizzy drinks, is grappling with a US market that is losing its taste for sugary drinks.The company said Coca-Cola volumes in North America edged up 1 per cent in the quarter, while overall sales in the region were flat.Shares in the company fell 3 per cent to $41.19 while rival PepsiCo declined 1 per cent to $89.17.Crocs, the struggling maker of colourful plastic clogs that were ubiquitous a decade ago, announced it will close or convert up to 100 of its stores and lay off 183 employees.The closures are expected to save $4m in 2014 and $10m in 2015, as Crocs seeks to save cash and revive its business.Crocs announced the move along with second-quarter earnings that were ahead of Wall Street expectations. Shares of Crocs advanced 13 per cent to $16.72.Netflix shares dipped 5 per cent to $431.09 after the company said its international expansion would drive losses in the division higher.The company, which started in the US, has expanded aggressively across Europe and racked up losses of $712m abroad since 2012.The initial losses have not dented Netflix’s ambition beyond the US. It plans to add service in France and Germany this September. Analysts with Jefferies said the expansion would “pressure” the company’s margins.Overall, US equity markets rose after a report showed the sale of previously owned homes recovered more than expected and core inflation in the country eased.The S&P 500 advanced 0.5 per cent to 1,983.53, touching a new record high earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 17,113.54.

578;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;International growth takes Netflix past 50m subscribers;;Netflix passed through the 50m subscriber barrier in the second quarter as the streaming video subscription operator doubled profits and laid out plans to launch its service in France and Germany in September.Netflix now has more than 36m subscribers in the US, having added 570,000 in the quarter, and almost 14m internationally, a rise of 1.1m.“We’ve seen tremendous adoption of online viewing,” said Reed Hastings, chief executive. “Whether it’s Argentina, Brazil, Finland, the UK . . . it’s been quite consistent.”The jump in international subscribers exceeded the company’s forward guidance – particularly in Brazil, where net additions rose in recent weeks, something of a surprise given the nation’s focus on the football World Cup tournament.“That’s nothing that we’re specifically doing,” Mr Hastings said. “It’s growing demand from consumers for control to click and watch what they want.”Company losses on its international operations narrowed to $15m in the quarter. Mr Hastings said the international side of the business would run “at about . . . break even” as it expands into new markets.The company operates in 40 countries but Mr Hastings has his eye on new territories – although he told the Financial Times that Netflix had no imminent plans to launch in China.In a letter to investors he wrote the company only targets “about one-third of current global broadband households, providing a great opportunity to build on our international success beyond 2014”.Netflix licenses its film and television programming from Hollywood studios and producers, a relationship that faces a shake-up if Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Group succeeds with its $80bn offer for Time Warner.No longer a “story” stock, Netflix has profits, not just member or revenue growthContinue readingMr Hastings said a combined Fox-Time Warner would not be a “positive” for Netflix. “It’s never good to have consolidated suppliers, which is what it would be for Netflix,” he said. “But I don’t think it’s a material negative. We have a very broad range of content suppliers.”The Fox-Time Warner bid has sparked talk of a consolidation round in content production to match the frenzy of dealmaking on the distribution side of the media sector, with recent blockbuster deals involving Comcast and Time Warner Cable, and AT&T and DirecTV.As an online distributor and producer of its own programming, Netflix fits somewhere between production and distribution, but Mr Hastings said he did not anticipate the company becoming a takeover target. “We’re not a [cable operator] and we don’t carry channels,” he said.Revenues for the quarter rose from $1.07bn to $1.34bn. Net income increased from $29.5m to $71m. Earnings per share increased from $0.51 to $1.18.The shares were up 0.7 per cent in after market trading at $455.01.
579;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
580;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-07-14T17:39:34Z;BBC attacks alternative to licence fee;;The BBC has responded to calls for reform of its licence-fee financing, saying that an alternative subscription model would create “many more losers than winners”.The broadcaster is facing increasing scrutiny of its £3.7bn in public funding with critics focusing on the rise of online viewing and on the harshness of jail terms for some non-payers.James Heath, director of policy, said subscription – which is widely seen as the most credible alternative to the licence fee – would not “maximise the value for money that the public as a whole gets from the BBC”.The intervention comes as subscription models gain momentum, both among the BBC’s critics and among its commercial rivals.Streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify both offer subscriptions, while broadcaster ITV allows viewers to pay to watch online programmes without advertising.However, Mr Heath said a subscription for watching the BBC would encourage a focus on richer viewers, reduce investment in UK television productions, and increase marketing and enforcement costs by several hundred million pounds.A hybrid model – in which a subscription were introduced only to watch BBC Three, BBC Four, BBC Online and BBC iPlayer – would reduce the licence fee by less than £17 a year, he said.About 53 per cent of people would prefer the BBC to be funded by a licence fee, opinion polls commissioned by the broadcaster show.“Subscription is the least favoured method of funding the BBC (behind advertising) and support for it has, in fact, declined by half over the last 10 years,” Mr Heath wrote.The findings conflict with those of a rival poll this month by ComRes, which found that 51 per cent of public would scrap the licence fee.Another survey by YouGov found that the popularity of the licence fee varied significantly depending on how the question was phrased.How the BBC is funded is due to be decided by the government before the broadcaster’s current charter expires at the end of 2016.
581;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Weinstein eyes TV sale for online era;;Harvey Weinstein is considering selling a stake in his television production business, saying that his Hollywood connections could help to further the ambitions of online distributors such as Netflix, Yahoo and Google.The potential sale comes as studios, internet providers and online streaming services compete for control of the best television content.It could allow Mr Weinstein, one of the entertainment industry’s most colourful characters, to take advantage of high valuations for TV assets, while improving the distribution of his company’s new shows such as Cement Heads and Mob Wives.“One plus one could equal 10,” Mr Weinstein told the Financial Times, while cautioning: “This is an idea only. We could do it, we could not do it.”The Weinstein Company, which he founded with his brother Bob in 2005, is best-known for its film business, with Oscar-winning hits including The King’s Speech and The Artist.The company, which settled its debt with Goldman Sachs two years ago, does not disclose its financial performance.Its TV arm includes 22 reality formats, as well as some drama shows. The company would seek a valuation in excess of the $360m that UK broadcaster ITV agreed to pay for reality TV producer Leftfield this year, a person familiar with the situation said.Mr Weinstein said he would discuss options with friends this month at the annual Sun Valley media conference hosted by investment bank Allen & Co.One possibility would be to partner with a studio that could improve The Weinstein Company’s reach overseas.Mr Weinstein said he was “disappointed” that Project Runway, a reality show that is popular in the US, had not become successful in the UK and Germany.He would not sell out completely from the television business, but would be willing to sell a majority stake “if it really, really makes sense”, he said. Asked whether he would continue to run the business, he added: “I hope so.”Changing consumer behaviour – including a rise in streaming, and a fall in cable subscriptions – has pushed media companies to invest in television content.Cable company Liberty Global and pay-TV programmer Discovery Communications agreed to buy UK production company All3media for £550m, while Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox is in discussions to merge Shine Group with Endemol and Core Media, which are owned by private equity firm Apollo.Netflix, Amazon and Yahoo have committed millions of dollars to original productions to lure viewers away from traditional television.“This is a pivotal moment,” said Mr Weinstein, 62. “When my four-year-old daughter is more digitally adept than pops, it’s time to wake up.”
582;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:21:58+0000;Regeneron boosted by Sanofi buying;;Drugmaker Regeneron surged after its majority investor Sanofi tightened its grip on the company, amid a wave of consolidation in the global pharmaceutical industry.Sanofi raised its stake from 20 per cent to 22.5 per cent, as part of an agreement allowing the French company to buy up to 30 per cent.Shares in Regeneron jumped 7 per cent to $303.46 after a regulatory filing showing Sanofi had been buying in May and June at prices up to $303.28.The two companies are involved in several drug partnerships, including an experimental cholesterol drug called Alirocumab, which has high sales potential but is being assessed for its effect on brain function after a Food and Drug Administration request earlier this year.Credit Suisse rated Regeneron as an “outperform” stock this week, with a target price of $340, based on a competitive analysis of its vision loss drug Eylea*.While most major drug company mergers were being driven by cost concerns, analyst Jason Kantor said he did not believe Regeneron was a likely candidate for a bidding war.Most merger activity had been “trying to strip costs out of big pharma organisations or about, like we’ve seen, lowering corporate tax rates,” Mr Kantor said. In contrast, the acquisition of smaller companies for specific products or growth areas remained limited.Shares in medical device maker Cooper rose 8 per cent to $146.68 on news it would buy Sauflon Pharmacueticals, a contact lens maker. The purchase price was set at $1.2bn.Shares in Netflix rose 7 per cent to $473.07 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the internet streaming service to “buy” from “neutral”. The value of the company has doubled from a year ago.The new target price of $590, up from $380, was based on a view that the global subscription opportunities would “drive sustained outperformance”, bank analysts said.“We estimate that Netflix’s addressable audience of subscribers will more than double over the next three years to 207m as the company adds six new markets this year and two to four markets annually thereafter,” analysts led by Heath Terry wrote in a note.“As Netflix adds content offerings, like the children’s category, and consumption becomes more personal/mobile, we believe the mix of multi-stream plans will increase, driving average revenue per user expansion beyond the basic $8.99 plan.”Shares in NRG Yield rose 4 per cent to $53.96 after the electricity company completed an acquisition of assets from NRG Energy for $349m in cash plus the assumption of $657m in project debt.The acquisition adds 590 megawatts of operating capacity to the electric utility company’s portfolio. NRG Yield mainly serves as a vehicle for NRG Energy to own, operate and acquire contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets.Shares in NRG Energy dropped 2 per cent to $36.35. The company was trading 38 per cent higher on Tuesday than a year before.The energy sector was weaker overall, with FirstEnergy shares down 2 per cent to $34.01, Chesapeake Energy about 1 per cent lower at $29.23, and Southwestern Energy down 1 per cent to $45.00.US equities began the new quarter on a positive note, as the S&P 500 rose 0.67 per cent to 1,973.32 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 129.47 points, 0.77 per cent, to 16,956.07, and the Nasdaq Composite index jumped 50.47 points, 1.14 per cent, to 4,458.65.The rise came in spite of data showing the pace of expansion in America’s manufacturing sector was little changed in June. The latest survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed the index stood at 55.3 last month, down from 55.4 in May and short of economists’ forecasts of 55.9.Although the sector only accounts for just over 10 per cent of the US economy, it has been one of the better performing since the crisis.The sector still expanded - any reading above 50 on the ISM index indicates growth - but June was the first month since January that expansion failed to quicken from the prior month.* This article has been amended from the original to correct the name of the Regeneron vision loss drug to Eylea, not Darpin as previously stated. Darpin is being developed by Allergan.
583;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-06-25T22:32:14Z;Q&A: what exactly is Aereo?;;On Wednesday the US Supreme Court ruled that online TV service Aereo was illegal, in a landmark decision that dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia said “will sow confusion for years to come”.What exactly is Aereo?Launched in February 2012, it is a TV streaming service that allows consumers in several US cities to access broadcast television shows on their PCs, laptops and smartphones, watching them live or recording them for later viewing.It has received nearly $100m in venture funding, much of it from Barry Diller’s internet group IAC.“Until now, watching free, over-the-air television required a giant rooftop antenna or awkward rabbit ears. Aereo changed all that,” the company proclaimed.Aereo charges $8-$12 per month for access to about 30 channels – a fraction of the cost of a more extensive cable or satellite subscription. It does not disclose subscriber numbers.Why were big broadcasters so worried about such a tiny start-up?CBS, Fox and others now rely not only on revenue from advertisers. In recent years, they have begun reaping billions of dollars from cable, satellite and telecoms companies, which they charge for the right to transmit those shows to their subscribers.The average household now indirectly pays up to $2 per month per broadcaster as part of their cable package – totalling $4bn a year for the networks, according to SNL Kagan. Analysts expect that sum to keep on climbing.Aereo put those so-called retransmission fees at risk, because cable companies would push to pay broadcasters less if their channels were available cheaply online.What was riding on this case?If Aereo won, it could have continued to operate, launching in more cities across the US. Within four years, it may have reached one in twenty households, causing broadcasters’ free cash flow to fall 22 per cent, rating agency S&P forecast.A New York appeals court had ruled that the service was legal, deeming that it did not transmit “to the public”, only to one subscriber at a time. Supporters believed Aereo had discovered a legal loophole, but many legal observers thought the service would face problems in the Supreme Court.What did the Supreme Court conclude?By a 6-3 majority, the Justices ruled that Aereo does breach copyright laws. Aereo transmits a public performance of the TV shows – making it more like a cable company than a mere provider of consumer equipment, the court found.“This is a worrisome decision, not because it kills Aereo, but because of the way that it does it,” said Steve Kramarsky, an intellectual property lawyer.“If Aereo is [breaching copyright in the way defined by the court], it’s hard to see how Dropbox isn’t doing it,” he said.What do Aereo and its backers do now?“It’s over,” said Mr Diller. But it may not be.Aereo’s founder and chief executive Chet Kanojia hinted at a way forward after the verdict: “We are disappointed in the outcome, but our work is not done. We will continue to fight for our consumers and fight to create innovative technologies that have a meaningful and positive impact on our world.”Jim Nail, an analyst at research company Forrester, said: “I simply don’t believe that Chet and Barry Diller don’t have a plan B. They’ve got 18 patents pending.”What’s the wider significance?Mr Kanojia said the ruling could have a “chilling effect” on new technologies.It is possible that other cloud systems, such as remote digital video recorders (RS-DVRs), could be considered breaches of copyright under the majority’s reasoning. But analysts expect the courts to act pragmatically to balance commercial and consumer interests.“While the legality of RS-DVR may not stand up in court, we believe there is a key difference between RS-DVR (as deployed by [Cablevision]) and Aereo – [Cablevision] pays for the right to serve content to customers, Aereo did not,” said Morgan Stanley analysts.More broadly, cable companies and broadcasters will have to keep adapting to changing consumer behaviour.That includes the shift to online viewing, and the fact that some viewers only want to pay for a small selection of programmes, rather than a cable package typically costing more than $80 a month.“Free-to-air broadcast television should not be available only to those who can afford to pay for the cable or satellite bundle,” Mr Kanojia said.Wednesday’s decision was a step away from television unbundling, but with Netflix and Amazon also challenging old models, it is unlikely to be the final movement.
584;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-06-17T16:58:31Z;Netflix switched on by upbeat analyst report;Rise caps recovery from low of below $300 struck in April;Netflix shares received a boost from an upbeat report from analysts at Morgan Stanley, contributing to a 37 per cent rebound in the stock since it hit a low in April.The tech sector, including Netflix, has benefited as investors revisited stocks sold off in April. At the time, fears of stretched valuations weighed on the broad Nasdaq Internet index. Netflix itself was pressured by fears the costs to stream its service over internet providers like Verizon and Comcast could surge in the future.Netflix shares rose 3 per cent to $443.65 by close of trading on Tuesday, capping a recovery from the low of below $300 struck in April amid the broad sell-off in the tech-related sector.Analysts with Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the film streaming company with an ‘overweight’ rating and $500 price target, which would make it only the 14th US company with a market capitalisation of more than $1bn that trades at or above that price.Morgan Stanley estimates Netflix will reach 108.6m paid subscribers by 2020, as domestic growth slows and the company shifts its focus abroad. The investment bank projects that 48 per cent of total subscriptions by that date will originate outside the US, with a heavy focus on Europe and Latin America.“Proven success in initial markets provides a road map to success in new markets and, as in the US, scale should allow Netflix to leverage content investments and drive margins,” analyst Benjamin Swinburne said.The investment bank also tempered concerns around the net neutrality debate, which has seen Netflix sign agreements with Comcast and Verizon to provide faster service to subscribers.“The regulatory risk for internet service providers is asymmetric, with significantly more downside than upside. Imposing further restrictions in the last mile, including aggressive metered billing or peering charges, could backfire,” Mr Swinburne added.Shares in Expedia rose on a broker recommendation, up 4 per cent to $77.62 after Susquehanna Financial Group upgraded the travel bookings website operator to “positive” from “neutral”, with a new target price of $90.Earnings per share estimates for 2014 and 2015 were respectively 3 per cent and 4 per cent too low and the “valuation isn’t stretched”, according to analyst Brian Nowak.Expedia was expected to have three sources of growth over the two years within its core brands, and monetisation trends were improving, Mr Nowak said. Susquehanna has subsequently raised its 2015 earnings per share estimate by 5 per cent. Its 2014 estimate remained unchanged.The cooling in the housing market evident in the latest figures from the US Commerce Department caused investors to look more critically at the home building sector.Though Wall Street economists expected a narrower decline in starts, new home construction fell 6.5 per cent from a month earlier in May, to an annualised pace of 1.001m new homes.Building permits, a leading indicator of “groundbreaking” on new homes, also declined in the month, falling 6.4 per cent to an annualised pace of 991,000.The slide in permits issued suggests somewhat stagnant growth ahead, as homebuilders continue a tepid pace of expansion.This followed separate figures released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders, showing that although builder confidence was recovering it remained below levels from a year ago.Shares in D.R. Horton, the largest US residential housebuilder, fell 1 per cent to $23.48, and shares in NVR construction fell 0.2 per cent to $1,119.83.In contrast, shares in Lennar and PulteGroup, other home construction companies, rose 1 per cent to $41.30 and $19.62 respectively.Shares in SolarCity increased 18 per cent to $64.53 after the solar energy company announced plans to acquire Silevo, another solar technology and manufacturing company.SolarCity will pay $200m in stock with the option of an additional $150m if certain conditions are met. Shares in the company were up 79 per cent on Tuesday from a year earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 27 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 16,808.49, the S&P 500 gained 4 points to 1,941.99 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.37 per cent to 4,337.23.
585;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-06-03T23:04:39Z;Internet access costs set to sap digital content spending;;Consumers’ willingness to pay for digital content is in danger of being held back by their rising spending on internet access, according to a new forecast that raises questions about the media industry’s hopes for streaming music and video subscriptions.The report from consultancy PwC, to be released on Wednesday, estimates the total size of the industry will grow to $2.15tn by 2018. But the fortunes of the market’s three segments will vary, with internet access revenues growing faster than both consumer spending and advertising.That suggests internet providers such as Time Warner Cable and AT&T will be poised to capture a growing share of industry revenue. Streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify, the latter of which had Macklemore & Ryan Lewis as its most popular music artists last year, will also be well-positioned to lead growth in consumer spending, as they capture subscribers willing to pay for round-the-clock access to movies, television shows and music.However, while consumer spending will still make up the largest portion of industry revenue, the balance is shifting as the cost of internet access itself may be sapping willingness to pay for digital content.By 2018 PwC predicts consumer spending will slip from 45 to 41 per cent of total industry revenues and advertising will fall from 30 to 29 per cent as outlays on internet access rise from 25 to 30 per cent, driven in large part by mobile use.“A concern for content providers is that spending on internet access may be taking share away from spending on content and services,” PwC said.Internet access will drive more consumer spending than any other product or service over the next half-decade, PwC said, growing to $636bn by 2018. The trend has been one factor behind a recent dealmaking wave in the cable and telecommunications sectors from Europe to the US. Consumer revenue is expected to reach $875bn and advertising is forecast to grow to $640bn in the same period.Digital content, which is generally cheaper than traditional books, music, video games and news, is forecast to rise to 17 per cent of consumer spending excluding internet access in 2018 from 10 per cent in 2013.That contrasts with a faster migration to digital advertising. A third of ad revenue is expected to come from digital in five years, compared with 14 per cent in 2009 and 25 per cent in 2013, as the industry shifts its focus to digital marketing efforts to reach a more precisely targeted audience.The divergence highlights what PwC calls a “huge challenge” for companies wishing to monetise consumers’ digital appetites and suggests the industry will still rely heavily on advertising and business-to-business spending.“The irony is that, ultimately, we’ve never consumed so much and paid so little,” said Marcel Fenez, PwC global leader for entertainment and media.Overall, PwC forecasts the global media and entertainment industry will grow at a 5 per cent compound annual growth rate from $1.69tn in 2013 to $2.15tn in 2018. That is down from the 5.6 per cent five-year compound rate the consultancy predicted last year and only slightly above last year’s 4.9 per cent annual rise.Total digital spending will grow at a 12.2 per cent compound rate over that same period, and will account for 65 per cent of revenue growth.The success of subscription-based models like Netflix and Spotify is evident in PwC’s prediction that streaming video and music will be two of the fastest-growing consumer segments over the next half-decade, with compound growth rates of 28.1 and 13.4 per cent, respectively. By contrast, digital music downloads are set to grow just 3.3 per cent.But Mr Fenez said that in order to capture a greater share of digital spending, companies need to adopt more “flexible” business models.“What people pay for are differentiated experiences. If people are only interested in the basic [content], inevitably they will find it somewhere free,” he said. “It’s not just the convenience of content, it’s the convenience of payment.”Some may prefer to pay a fixed monthly subscription each month while others would rather pay on a per-item basis, so companies should “offer more choices and better experiences”.Emerging market consumers are predicted to contribute the fastest growth in the next five years. China, Brazil, Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Argentina and Indonesia together will account for 21.7 per cent of global revenue in 2018, up from 12.4 per cent in 2009.China’s clout in particular will be felt as it eclipses Japan as the world’s second-largest entertainment and media market, behind the US, with revenues of $213bn in 2018.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
586;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-05-30T16:09:12Z;BSkyB’s head of content to step down;;The architect of BSkyB’s move into high-quality TV drama is to leave the company, as it seeks to build a stronger entertainment platform in order to compete with rivals such as Netflix and BT Group.The departure of Sophie Turner Laing, managing director of content, means that Britain’s largest pay-TV company by subscribers will have to appoint its first new senior executive in nearly three years.Sky has sought to emphasise the importance of non-sports content after losing the rights to Champions League football to telecoms group BT.“As a passionate believer in creative change, it is now someone else’s turn to drive the next phase of growth in content at Sky,” Ms Turner Laing said in a statement.She will leave the company later this year. She is yet to decide her next move, but told staff that it would be in the “creative world”.Among Ms Turner Laing’s achievements was a partnership with US network HBO, which has given Sky exclusive rights to programmes such as fantasy drama Games of Thrones until 2020.Game of Thrones has proved one of the broadcaster’s biggest hits, garnering nearly 1m viewers, plus a sizeable on-demand audience.However, the main entertainment channel Sky 1 has less than 1 per cent of live viewing in the UK – less than free rivals such as Dave, More 4 and BBC3.Under Ms Turner Laing, Sky has also dramatically increased its investment in British television to about £600m a year. That has heightened competition with the BBC, which is facing a budget squeeze, and ITV, which has spent more than £300m on production companies to build up its own production arm.“With the support of an excellent team, Sophie has helped us to make a step change in the scale and ambition of our entertainment offering,” said Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive.Sky said that it would begin a search for Ms Turner Laing’s replacement in due course. All of its current executive team have been in place since 2011, representing rare continuity among British blue-chips.Sky’s shares are roughly at the same level where they started the year, as investors hesitate before the next auction of Premier League football rights, expected later this year or early in 2015.

That means the big screen, high-definition television in our living room would be underused were it not for new devices designed to enable couch potatoes like me to watch internet-based video services on TV.Apple TV Rating: 4/5 ($99/£99)
The Apple TV device provides a quick and easy way to watch television shows and films, and listen to music bought via iTunes on an HDTV. You can also use Apple’s AirPlay technology to stream content wirelessly from your iOS device to your HDTV, or see exactly what is on your display including photos, video clips or web pages mirrored on the big screen. Apple TV, one of the first streaming media devices to support Netflix, has been adding other third-party services such as HBO Go and Watch ESPN.For ease of use, Apple TV is hard to beat, especially if you are an iPhone, iPad or Mac user. But the set-up process does involve using the small wireless remote to enter account information on a virtual keyboard on the TV screen.Google Chromecast Rating: 4/5 ($35/£30)Google caused a stir when it launched its Chromecast streaming media stick last year at a rock-bottom price. It works with Android-based smartphones and tablets, as well as iOS devices. It plugs into an HDMI (high definition media interface) socket on the rear of most HDTVs, takes power from a nearby USB port and uses your mobile device as a remote control.Chromecast is designed mainly to stream or “cast” content from a Chrome web browser running on a Windows, Mac or other device to an HDTV. In casting mode, what you see on your smartphone or PC is what you get on the screen, though I did experience a few hiccups.Google has also been adding support for more online services, including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, Pandora and Google Play Music.Chromecast is great value and likely to get better as Google and third-party developers add new apps, but it is neither perfect nor as intuitive as some rivals.Roku HDMI stick Rating: 5/5, $50/£50
Like Chromecast, the Roku device is small and plugs into an HDMI port. But it is controlled via its own mini remote and works mainly as a conduit for third-party services. In fact, through its online Channel Store, the Roku supports more than 1,000 apps, such as Netflix, Amazon Instant, HBO Go, Spotify, Rdio and YouTube.Recent additions include a Slingbox app (see below) so you can stream content from one location (the next room or thousands of miles away) to another using a Slingbox device at one end and the Roku HDMI stick at the other.For anyone wanting to access the broadest range of third-party apps, the Roku HDMI stick would be my top choice. It is easy to set up, has a great interface and search function, and at $50 is still half the price of most of the competition.Amazon Fire TV Rating: 4/5, $99
Amazon’s Fire TV, the newcomer in streaming, is the most powerful streaming media device available. Easy to set up, it is a set-top box rather than an HDMI stick, but despite its small size it includes Ethernet, USB, HDMI and hi-fi audio connections. It also comes with eight gigabytes of storage for games or apps and has a small remote.It makes use of Amazon’s big Instant Video library and covers a wide range of content from top-notch sources. Its innovative features include a voice-search function for finding films, TV shows or games that worked well despite my British accent.Fire TV is also trying to appeal to gamers. Amazon has made it easy for developers to adapt games to run on Fire TV and is offering an add-on gaming controller for $40.I liked the performance and advanced features. But Fire TV is one of the more expensive streaming media devices, and you really need to be a subscriber to Amazon’s Prime Instant Video to make the best use of it.Planet of the appsWhat it is: SlingPlayer for iOS or Android devices, $14.99Why you should try it: If you are a SlingBox owner, this app enables you to watch and control your living room television from virtually anywhere over an internet connection. If you also have a Roku media player, such as the Roku HDMI stick, you can stream this content on to another HDTV wherever you are."
588;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix to expand video streaming in Europe;;Netflix is pushing deeper into Europe with plans to launch its streaming video service in Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria by the end of 2014, the company said.The expansion, which gives Netflix access to millions of potential customers in continental Europe, comes weeks after the company revealed that its global customer base had grown to more than 48m.Netflix offers a mix of movies, television programming and original content, such as its series House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. The company already operates in the US, Canada and Latin America and in the past two years launched in the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia.Its US growth has come at a cost, with Netflix clashing recently with cable operator Comcast. Netflix and other digital delivery systems, such as Hulu, have disrupted the pay television industry, which is rapidly consolidating.AT&T has agreed to a $48.5bn deal to buy DirecTV, the satellite television operator. Comcast, meanwhile, has agreed a $40bn purchase of Time Warner Cable, which is being scrutinised by regulators.Netflix has called for the deal to be blocked, saying the combined company would have too much control of broadband provision. It has also expressed concern about Comcast’s ability to “charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers”.Netflix recently struck a deal with Comcast to pay the cable group an undisclosed fee for “interconnection” – in effect connecting its streaming film and television service with Comcast’s internet network to ensure faster access.It later accused Comcast and other big internet providers of using their “market position” to impose tolls for access to their networks, hindering online video operators’ ability to provide a quality service. Comcast hit back, calling Netflix’s claims “inaccurate”.Netflix is expanding internationally as Amazon, Netflix’s biggest rival, invests in its own streaming service.Amazon recently struck a deal with HBO, the pay-channel owned by Time Warner, for the right to screen some of its biggest hits, such as The Sopranos and The Wire. Analysts estimate Amazon is paying $250m over the multiyear deal.
589;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;AT&T/DirecTV: Coming out on top;$50bn on DirecTV doesn’t look bad compared to the alternatives;Take heart, AT&T shareholders. There are even more scary ways for the company to squander its capital than by spending $50bn on DirecTV. Diving head first into pay-TV seems like an odd decision but at least in DirecTV, AT&T is going after a big, highly profitable business. Yes, the deal might have little long-term strategic logic. But better to pay the right price for a strategically weak deal than to overpay for a strategically sound one.Should AT&T snap up DirecTV, it will get 20m US subscribers. Put them together with AT&T’s 5m video customers, and there may well be some savings when it comes to programme buying. Unfortunately, satellite transmission does not lend itself to good broadband internet connections. So unlike cable TV companies such as Comcast, which have prospered by adding internet subscribers, DirecTV brings only a flat TV subscriber count (although it does have a faster-growing base of 18m Latin American subscribers).DirecTV does, however, bring $4bn of annual free cash flow. That will come in handy – in 2013 AT&T spent $38bn on acquisitions, capital expenditure, dividends and share buybacks when its cash flow from operations was just $34bn.If AT&T really wanted to capture the future of TV distribution it could buy Netflix. That would cost about $25bn, or half of DirecTV. But Netflix had no free cash flow in 2013. And therein lies the conundrum for the incumbent media titans. Their size precludes direct consolidation plays, as AT&T discovered when regulators quashed its proposed T-Mobile purchase. But buying upstarts cannot be financially justified.Wisely, AT&T this year announced it would spend $500m on “over-the-top” television delivered via the internet rather than by cable, satellite or fibre. And while AT&T investors wait for OTT to take off, they can enjoy DirecTV’s cash flows.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
590;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-05-12T21:14:19Z;Weibo leads tech sector rebound;;The US technology sector began the week with a rebound as investors picked through the dozens of momentum stocks that have been felled by the rotation out of high-growth companies despite volatile swings over the past 10 weeks.The list included gains by Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and TripAdvisor – all of which have declined over the past three months – as well as Weibo, which has trodden water since its initial public offering in April.China’s answer to Twitter surged in part on Monday due to optimistic commentary from brokerage Piper Jaffray, which initiated coverage of the company with an “overweight” rating and $25 price target. This compares with the IPO price of $17 a share.“It is the best pure play social networking platform in China,” said analyst Gene Munster. “At current levels, Weibo shares trade at a slight discount to the company’s peer group and . . . we believe that Weibo deserves to trade at a premium multiple to the group given our expectation for higher growth.”Mr Munster said the company had well positioned itself with small and medium sized businesses in China, and had substantial room to grow its business in that market.The company has had a rocky debut since floating, with shares falling more than a fifth since a peak in April. Strategists at Citigroup said first-quarter earnings trends had brought “growth into question” for small and mid-cap stocks, taking valuation concerns to the forefront.“Short term, our trading indicators suggest oversold conditions, but it may take more conviction in improving macros to change sentiment,” said Citi’s Scott Chronert.Shares in Weibo rose 9.3 per cent to close at $19.52. Facebook climbed 4.5 per cent to $59.83, Twitter advanced 5.9 per cent to $33.94 and Netflix increased 5.1 per cent to $345.45. TripAdvisor rose 5.8 per cent to $89.51.Overall, the broader Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 4,143.86, although trading volumes were roughly 6 per cent lower than the index’s 30-day trailing average.Gogo Wireless, the company that provides in-flight WiFi, jumped 6.2 per cent to $12.67 after reporting better than expected sales in the first quarter.The company said sales rose 35 per cent from a year earlier to $96m, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Losses narrowed from the year ago period to $16.9m, or 20 cents per share. Analysts had on average expected a loss of 25 cents a share.Shares in the company had been blunted in April by AT&T’s announcement that it would partner with Honeywell to offer a similar service.Peabody Energy advanced 2.4 per cent to $19.11 as investment bank Morgan Stanley lifted its view of the company to “overweight” and increased its price target by 50 per cent “in light of the ongoing modest recovery in the thermal coal market and bottoming met coal prices”.“We believe Peabody is currently the best way to get exposure to these two themes while still managing downside risk,” said analyst Stephen Byrd.Hillshire Brands agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods for $6.6bn, including debt, sending shares in Pinnacle up 13.2 per cent to $34.47.Under the terms of the deal announced by the companies on Monday, Pinnacle investors will receive $18 in cash and 0.5 Hillshire shares for each Pinnacle share they own.Hillshire’s offer is also an exit for private equity group Blackstone, which still owns just over half of Pinnacle following the food producer’s initial public offering early last year. Hillshire shares fell 3.2 per cent to $35.76.US equity markets rose on Monday despite rising tension in Ukraine over the weekend. There was little on the economic diary to drive stocks, as many investors waited for Tuesday’s retail sales report for an update on how the world’s largest economy has fared.“It just looks like the market is starting the week by completely placing geopolitical risks on the back burner,” said TD Securities strategist Gennadiy Goldberg.The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,896.65, a record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 16,695.47.
591;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-04-27T17:01:57Z;Hollywood studios eye China streaming deal to beat piracy;;"Hollywood’s biggest film studios are working with Tencent, one of China’s largest internet groups, on a Netflix-style streaming service that aims to beat piracy by delivering new films to homes across China just two weeks after their US theatrical release.Warner Brothers has a minority stake in Tencent’s Hollywood VIP service, which streams older films from several studios on a subscription basis but also makes new titles available to rent online for as little as $1.Warner Bros’ latest hit 300: Rise of an Empire is among the titles available to rent; the film is still showing in cinemas in the US and other markets.Valued at $130bn, Tencent is the world’s fourth-largest quoted internet group after Google, Facebook and Amazon, operating a vast social media, ecommerce and gaming platform used by more than 500m people a month. More than 100m people pay to play its social games or use WeChat, its mobile messaging app.Hollywood VIP launched quietly at the end of 2012 and has attracted “a few hundred thousand” subscribers, according to Tencent and Warner Bros. However, this is the first time they are making new films available.The service has hundreds of titles, showing a mix of Chinese films and Hollywood fare: Walt Disney recently began licensing its films to the service, joining Universal Pictures, Miramax and Lions Gate Entertainment.The aim was to transform a market where digital film piracy is rife by giving consumers a legitimate way to watch new films, said Ron Sanders, president of Warner Bros worldwide home entertainment distribution.Hollywood has consistently failed to overcome intellectual property theft in China, missing out on hundreds of millions of dollars in sales as pirates sell copies of brand new films on DVD or online.“How can we truly say we are frustrated with China not buying our content if we won’t make it available in the time appropriate for the consumer market place?” said Mr Sanders. “We have a long way to go but this new model could be applicable for other markets.”Tencent is using its other digital businesses to promote Hollywood VIP: WeApp customers will be able to share films with each other using the messaging app, for example.“In the western world movies go through a very clear windowing process,” said James Mitchell, chief strategy officer at Tencent. “They appear in theatres and then a few months later they move to DVD, then later they move to online distribution services.“In China, windowing hasn’t really developed so we thought there was an opportunity to get movies [to audiences] in a way that was more timely.”Netflix, which operates in the US, Europe and Latin America, is close to reaching 50m subscribers but it is unclear how big a streaming service could become in China.“In China historically there hasn’t been the training of paying for in-home entertainment in the same way [as the US],” said Mr Mitchell. “We’re about people who were not paying for movies and the benefit is they get a better experience.”The US has a more mature video-streaming market, with Netflix and Amazon vying for supremacy in the living room. Amazon last week struck a deal with Time Warner’s HBO to gain access to some of the pay-channel’s most popular shows, such as The Sopranos and The Wire."
592;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-04-25T20:03:20Z;No net result in Brazil;;NETMundial, the global talking shop held this week in São Paulo on the future of the internet, finished its second and final day on Thursday with not much more to show for itself than a pledge to keep talking.During the opening ceremony on Wednesday, former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden provided the main focus with his allegations that his country engaged in widespread espionage using the internet, even looking in on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s private communications.But although participants waved placards and sported masks of Snowden’s face, and the spied-on Rousseff even provided some stern words in her opening remarks, the word espionage did not make it into the event’s document.Instead, there was the more polite word – surveillance. And surveillance, according to the document, is all right mind you – as long as it doesn’t violate “human rights”.By Thursday, the Snowden masks had been discarded in a corner in the main room. The discussion had moved to an issue with potentially more profound immediate implications for our daily lives – internet neutrality.On everyone’s lips was a proposal by the US Federal Communications Commission that would allow internet service providers to charge companies such as Netflix and YouTube more to reach consumers at higher speeds or with better quality, raising concerns about the end of “neutrality”.So contentious is the issue that during his speech at NETMundial, Daniel Sepulveda, the leader of the US delegation, asked that the discussion about the neutrality be deferred to the next phase of this internet flying circus, the planned Internet Governance Forum in Turkey in September, because it was locking up other discussions.The conference document seemed to agree with the US position, mentioning net neutrality only as an item for further discussion, alongside such subjects as “different roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in internet governance” and issues of jurisdiction over the internet.Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo summed up the conundrum well:There is no consensus on the definition of the concept of neutrality, which makes different countries and different sectors seek to adopt the concept that most is favourable to their interests.The discussion about neutrality and the possibility that internet service providers could charge their clients more for access to different parts of the web is also becoming a political hot potato in Brazil.Although the Marco Civil, Brazil’s new internet legislation, which Rousseff approved on Wednesday, is aimed at ensuring privacy, the private sector has already started looking for loopholes.According to Folha de S. Paulo:The companies understand that, according to the text that was approved, there is no violation of law [that is, of net neutrality] if the same deal [on access to services] is offered to everyone in the market.As the event came to an end on Thursday, Hamadoun Toure, Secretary-General of the International Telecommunications Union, the UN body, concluded that the conference had brought the internet community closer together than ever.In reality, however, the various parties could hardly be further apart.
593;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;FCC accused of violating net neutrality;;A US government agency staunchly defended new “net neutrality” rules to be proposed on Thursday, after critics blasted the measures for violating open internet policies and disadvantaging small entrepreneurs.The US Federal Communications Commission is proposing new rules that would allow internet service providers to charge companies such as Netflix and YouTube more to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality, but only if they meet a new standard of “commercial reasonableness” that will be judged by the FCC.After two successful court challenges, this is the agency’s third attempt to propose rules that uphold net neutrality, the principle that requires all internet traffic to be treated equally. The criticisms of the new rules reflect the challenges the FCC faces in crafting measures that would satisfy public interest groups, survive a court challenge and avoid a turf war with other regulators.“The FCC is inviting ISPs to pick winners and losers online,” said Michael Weinberg, vice-president of Public Knowledge, a group that advocates openness on the internet. “The very essence of a “commercial reasonableness” standard is discrimination. And the core of net neutrality is non discrimination. This is not net neutrality.”Public interest groups like Public Knowledge urged the FCC to stick to its original stance of preventing ISPs from charging for faster access to customers, which would promote equal treatment of small businesses trying to reach consumers online. They said the FCC should use its authority to reclassify ISPs as common telecommunications carriers, which would allow the agency to enforce net neutrality.But that move would likely create opposition from the Federal Trade Commission, which could see the reclassification as encroaching on its ability to protect competition and consumer privacy among ISPs. The FTC, which does not have jurisdiction over common carriers, has told the FCC in the past that it would oppose a reclassification, according to people familiar with the matter.An FCC official denied the agency was reversing its position, saying it had never suggested a blanket no-discrimination measure, but instead prohibited unreasonable discrimination. Because a US court rejected that foundation but suggested the FCC could impose rules based on the commercially reasonable standard, the agency was proposing measure that could finally be enforceable, the official said.“There are reports that the FCC is gutting the open internet rule,” said Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman. “They are flat-out wrong. There is no ‘turnaround in policy’. The same rules will apply to all internet content.” He added that behaviour that harms consumers would be prohibited.The new rules could usher in tiered broadband pricing sooner than expected, which could result in additional revenues for ISPs and also help content providers like Netflix provide additional offerings and better quality service, according to a Barclays research note.Under the new proposal, ISPs would be able to enter into individual agreements to charge content companies for preferential treatment to reach customers at higher speeds. But they must meet a new “commercial reasonableness” criteria that would be determined by the FCC on a case-by-case basis.Broadband providers would still be required to provide a base level of service to subscribers, and the FCC would still prohibit discrimination or blocking of websites under the new rules.In February, broadband provider Comcast reached a landmark agreement with Netflix to charge the content company an undisclosed fee to reach Comcast consumers at faster speeds.Since then, Netflix has been criticising Comcast’s bid to take over Time Warner Cable, which would create the largest cable and broadband provider in the US. Netflix says the merger would give Comcast too much power over internet access in the US.Comcast has said the TWC deal would improve customer service, including internet access, and Netflix’s opposition is based on inaccurate claims.The FCC will vote on the draft measures at a meeting on May 15. If approved, the commission will then seek public comment on the plans before finalising them.In January, a US court sided with Verizon Communications and said the FCC overstepped its authority in imposing net neutrality rules, but upheld the agency’s ability to regulate certain practices of ISPs, including how they manage traffic. The FCC said in February it planned to propose new rules instead of appealing the court’s decision.
594;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:16:29+0000;Pace positions itself for video streaming;;The revival of Pace, the maker of television set-top boxes that has overcome a range of problems in recent years, picked up steam on Thursday as the company reported a continuing boost in profit margins and said it was on track to meet its revenue target of $2.7bn in 2014.The Yorkshire-based FTSE 250 group has benefited as its former rivals, including Cisco and Google, have wavered in their commitment to cable TV hardware at a time when more consumers are choosing to watch video via internet streaming services such as Netflix.Pace’s biggest customers are cable providers in the US such as Comcast, DirecTV and AT&T.The company said operating margins would rise from 7.8 per cent in 2013 to 8.5 per cent this year. The improvement is due to cost-cutting measures including outsourced manufacturing and the January acquisition of Aurora, a higher-margin US business that helps cable broadcasters allocate and expand the amount of data they can provide to consumers.“Pace has made a good start to the new financial year. Forecast demand for both current and new products is building as the year progresses,” said chairman Allan Leighton at the group’s annual general meeting.Free cash flow was expected to be $185m, down from $209m last year.Nick James, analyst at Numis, said: “Pace are well-placed as the leaders in the status quo of cable, but they’re mitigating their risks of disruption by building their software and infrastructure business.”With the Aurora acquisition, and the expansion beyond set-top boxes into software and hardware that help companies offer combined cable and internet services across multiple devices, Pace is trying to position itself for a market in which more video is streamed online, analysts say.Even so, the onward march of internet-based devices such as Amazon’s Fire TV and Apple’s TV are the biggest risks to the business over the long term. Amazon recently struck a deal with HBO, the cable and satellite television network, to stream its shows, including hit series such as The Sopranos and The Wire, to its US customers. In results announced on Wednesday, Apple said its TV business now generated sales of more than $1bn.By comparison, Pace’s sales of set-top boxes and media servers hit $1.98bn in 2013, accounting for 80 per cent of its sales.Shares in the company jumped as much as 5 per cent on Thursday morning before settling down to a slight gain at mid-afternoon.
595;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-04-23T22:25:18Z;FCC shifts stance on net neutrality rules;;New US “net neutrality” rules will be proposed on Thursday that would allow internet service providers to charge companies such as Netflix and YouTube more to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality, but only under certain circumstances.The Federal Communications Commission had originally opposed such charges for faster access, in an effort to require that ISPs treat all traffic equally, but a US court ruled three months ago that the regulator had overstepped its authority after a legal challenge from Verizon Communications.Tom Wheeler, FCC chairman, will hand out a draft of the proposed new rules to other commissioners on Thursday, before a vote at the regulator’s May 15 meeting. If approved, the commission will then seek public comment on the plans before finalising them.In January, the US court of appeals upheld the FCC’s authority in some areas to regulate practices of ISPs, including how they manage traffic. The FCC said in February it planned to propose new rules instead of appealing the court’s decision.Under the new proposal, internet service providers could charge content companies for preferential treatment to reach customers at higher speeds, but only on “commercially reasonable” terms. The FCC would decide whether the terms were acceptable on a case-by-case basis.“Broadband providers would be required to offer a baseline level of service to their subscribers, along with the ability to enter into individual negotiations with content providers,” the FCC said.What the baseline level of service should be and the specific standards for what would be deemed “commercially reasonable” are some of the topics that will be subject to public comment.Other net neutrality proponents have argued that no preferential treatment should be allowed under any circumstances. The FCC would still prohibit discrimination or blocking of web sites, and require broadband providers to make additional disclosure on internet traffic under the proposed rules.The debate over net neutrality rules has come up in cable company Comcast’s move to take over Time Warner Cable, which would create a giant in the US broadband market. Netflix has come out against the merger, which faces tough antitrust scrutiny, because it says the combined company would have too much control over internet access in the US.Comcast has said Netflix’s opposition is based on inaccurate claims. Comcast needs approval from the FCC and the US Department of Justice, among other regulators.In February, Netflix and Comcast struck a landmark deal in which Netflix would pay Comcast an undisclosed fee for faster access to Comcast customers. But since then, Netflix has become more vocal in its opposition to the Comcast-TWC deal.The Wall Street Journal reported on the FCC’s new rules on Wednesday.
596;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Amazon inks deal to stream HBO shows;;Amazon raised the stakes in its battle with Netflix for supremacy in online video streaming by striking a deal with HBO to gain access to some of the most popular shows from the pay-TV channel’s library, including The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and The Wire.The programming will be made available to US customers on Amazon’s Prime Instant Video service. Netflix, which this week revealed it was nearing 50m global subscribers, is the market leader in video streaming but Amazon has invested heavily in original programming and library content to attract viewers.Morgan Stanley analysts estimated the HBO shows could cost Amazon $200-$250M over the multiyear deal. Bernstein Research analysts said such an investment would fit its forecast that Amazon’s spending on content for its streaming service will jump from about $1.2bn last year to about $2bn in 2014.HBO produces some of the most in-demand programming in the world, with recent hits including Game of Thrones and True Detective.It has over the years had an uneasy relationship with Netflix: Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, HBO’s parent company, once referred to Netflix as “the Albanian army”.Netflix has also amassed a vast content library, striking an exclusive deal with Walt Disney, and has encroached on to HBO’s turf with its catalogue of original programming, winning plaudits for shows such as House of Cards.HBO programming has been conspicuously absent from Netflix’s streaming service and its deal with Amazon is the first time it has licensed its programming to an online streaming group.Netflix shares closed more than 5 per cent lower in New York on Wednesday, following the Amazon-HBO announcement.HBO and Amazon declined to comment on the value of the deal, or its length. But proceeds will be invested in new HBO programming and in HBO Go, the company’s streaming service that is available only to HBO subscribers.“As owners of our original programming, we have always sought to capitalise on that investment,” said Glenn Whitehead, HBO’s executive vice-president of business and legal affairs. Amazon was the best “partner to entrust with this valuable collection,” he added.As part of the deal, HBO Go will be included in Amazon’s new Fire TV, its new streaming set-top box which will go head to head with rival devices such as Apple TV when it launches this year.The HBO-Amazon deal is the latest sign that the living room is the new battle ground for technology groups and content providers. Google and Apple have launched devices to enable video streaming of content on TV sets while providers such as Netflix have upended traditional TV viewing patterns with subscription services that allow audiences to choose when and where they watch their favourite shows.Netflix this week traded barbs with Comcast, the cable group that hopes to acquire Time Warner Cable in a deal worth $40bn, calling for it to be blocked by regulators on antitrust grounds. Comcast hit back, saying in a statement that Netflix’s opposition was based on “inaccurate claims and arguments”.

Most notably, the average transaction size of purchased public companies has swelled to $6.4bn.”Shares of Allergan climbed 15.25 per cent to $163.65.Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 1,879.55 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 0.4 per cent to 16,514.37. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.97 per cent to 4,161.46.

Comcast plans to offload as many as 4m subscribers following its proposed $40bn acquisition of Time Warner Cable in a two-stage deal worth $18bn-$20bn, a person familiar with the situation confirmed.The company in is in talks to sell 1.5m subscribers to Charter Communications, which Comcast outbid for Time Warner Cable. The remaining 2.5m subscribers would be spun out into a new public company, this person said.The divestiture will help ease regulatory concerns about the Time Warner Cable purchase while funds raised in the sale would go towards reducing Comcast's debt burden and into the company's share buyback programme.Michael Angelakis, Comcast's chief financial officer, told an earnings call that ""cash proceeds . . . can be used for return of capital to Comcast shareholders"".Comcast also scored with its line-up of programming from NBCUniversal, with shows such as The Voice, The Blacklist and The Tonight Show drawing audiences and advertisers. Its Universal movie studio also had a good quarter, aided by the box office performance of hits such as Lone Survivor and Ride Along.Advertising revenues at NBCUniversal almost doubled, thanks to the impact of the Sochi Winter Olympics, which the network covered exclusively in the US. The games generated $1.1bn of revenues for Comcast. NBCUniversal, which also owns cable channels, generated total revenues of $6.88bn, compared with $5.34bn in the comparable quarter.Excluding the Winter Olympics, NBCUniversal revenues were up 8 per cent to $5.77bn.Across Comcast, revenues increased from $15.3bn to $17.4bn, while net income rose from $1.43bn to $1.87bn. Earnings per share were $0.71, compared with $0.54 last time.However, Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable has begun to run into criticism, with Netflix this week calling for regulators to block the deal because it was not “in the public interest”.“If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass over 60 per cent of US broadband households . . . with most of those homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband,” Netflix’s chief executive Reed Hastings wrote on MondayComcast hit back, saying Netflix’s opposition was based on “inaccurate claims and arguments”.On Tuesday, Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, sounded a positive note about the Time Warner Cable deal. “The more planning we do for our proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, the more excited we are by the opportunities for the combined company,” he said.This story has been changed to amend the number of new subscribers from 25,000 to 24,000"
599;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix trades barbs over Comcast’s TWC deal;;Netflix has traded barbs with Comcast over the cable company’s $40bn takeover of Time Warner Cable in a sign of potential hurdles in the path of a deal that faces scrutiny from antitrust authorities.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, used a quarterly earnings letter to outline the company’s opposition to the deal, claiming it would give Comcast too much control of high-speed internet provision in the US.“If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass over 60 per cent of US broadband households …with most of those homes having Comcast as the only option for truly high-speed broadband,” he wrote. “We respectfully think it’s not in the public interest to have one company control a majority of US residential internet [provision],” he told the FT. “Our view is that the best remedy is to block the merger.”Comcast hit back, saying in a statement that Netflix’s opposition was based on “inaccurate claims and arguments”. Netflix claimed in the earnings letter that the combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would “possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers”.Netflix recently struck a deal with Comcast to pay the cable group an undisclosed fee for “interconnection” – effectively connecting its streaming film and television service with Comcast’s internet network to ensure faster access. It later accused Comcast and other big internet providers of using their “market position” to impose tolls for access to their networks, hindering online video operators’ ability to provide a quality service.Netflix has raised concerns about the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal hindering “net neutrality” – the principle that ensures telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates for data and content services regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.Netflix is free to express its opinions. But they should be factually based“Netflix is free to express its opinions,” Comcast said in its statement. “But they should be factually based. And Netflix should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about net neutrality. Rather, it’s about improving Netflix’s business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the internet and not just to Netflix customers.”Mr Hastings’ comments on Monday came as Netflix revealed its subscriber base had grown to more than 48m, with 4m people joining its service during the quarter.It added that it planned to increase the price of its monthly subscriptions. “Our current view is to do a one or two-dollar increase, depending on the country, later this quarter for new members only,” said Mr Hastings. US subscription is currently $7.99 per month.Monthly payments for existing members would stay the same for a “generous time period”, he added.Netflix expects subscriber growth to slow in the second quarter, in line with previous years and seasonal trends. It expects its international business to be profitable by the end of the fiscal year but said it would plough those profits into new territories.The company is known to be looking at launching a service in France and Germany. Netflix already operates in Canada, the UK, Ireland and Latin America, as well as the US.“We are approaching 50m global members, but that is far short of HBO’s 130m,” wrote Mr Hastings, referring to the Time Warner-owned premium cable network. “We are eager to close the gap.”Netflix subscriptions have been boosted by the company’s original series, such as the second series of House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey, and Orange is the New Black.February 2014: Comcast has ended a six-month battle to consolidate the fragmented US pay-TV market.Revenues for the quarter rose to $1.27bn, compared with $1.02bn in the comparable quarter last time. Net income increased from $2.7m to $53.1m. Earnings per share rose from $0.05 to $0.86.Comcast’s proposed takeover of TWC has also angered Charter Communications, the cable TV operator in which John Malone’s Liberty Media owns a 27 per cent stake.Charter had hoped to acquire TWC and spent months pursuing it. It recently filed legal documents contesting the proposed merger, claiming that the deal had been subject to a “flawed process”.Netflix shares were up close to 6 per cent to $368 in after-market trading.
600;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-04-18T12:38:25Z;Online originals face battle to win over advertisers’ hearts;;"Jerry Seinfeld rides in cars with comedians; Sarah Jessica Parker goes behind the scenes of the New York City Ballet; Seth Meyers stars as a cartoon superhero – welcome to the vast, varied and increasingly star-studded world of original online video series.Chasing the $236bn global television advertising market, internet companies, newspapers and magazine publishers are producing a proliferation of television-like series designed for people to watch on their smartphones, tablets, computers and web-connected televisions. Not to be eclipsed, traditional networks such as Comcast’s NBCUniversal are also pouring resources into digital video programmes.The originals range from short four- to eight-minute clips, such as Ms Parker’s docudrama city.ballet. on AOL, to television-series length programmes, such as Mr Meyers’ animated comedy The Awesomes on Hulu.More than a dozen companies, including AOL, Google, Hulu, Microsoft and Yahoo, will host presentations in New York in the coming weeks to showcase their latest video programmes to advertisers as part of the third annual Digital Content NewFronts event.“There is a massive wave here,” says Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video. “Here’s why it matters: If you really want to create a meaningful video brand today, you have to have a mix of really good technology and really differentiated content.”The week-long event comes weeks before US television broadcasters host their own glitzy parties for advertising buyers to showcase their upcoming programmes as part of the annual “upfront” market, when the networks sell about two-thirds of their commercial inventory of advertising space.Despite the flurry of programming announcements and the buzz surrounding original web series – bolstered this year by the critical success of Netflix’s originals House of Cards and Orange is the New Black – advertisers say that web producers still have much to prove before they start committing TV-sized dollar sums to the digital video programmes. (Netflix and Amazon, which also develops original content, don’t sell digital video ads and make money via subscriptions.)Factors holding back advertising spending on the programmes are the limited audiences for most series, high prices, the quality of the shows and issues measuring both viewers and the return on the ads, marketing executives say.“The originality of the original online series is behind us,” says Rob Norman, chief digital officer of WPP’s GroupM, the world’s largest online ad buyer overseeing more than $5bn in billings. “Unless these come with significant audiences then significant dollars are not going to follow them.”Indeed, traditional television continues to dominate ad budgets as marketers seek a one-stop shop for reaching mass audiences, and TV continues to deliver. Ad spending on broadcast and cable television is expected to reach $68.5bn in the US this year, more than 11 times the $5.89bn directed toward digital video, according to eMarketer, a market research company.A growing number of US homes are utilising streaming devices, such as the Apple TV box, Google’s Chromecast and Roku, or internet connected televisions to watch online video, according to media consultancy and research group Frank N Magid Associates.Read more“It is safe to say that nobody has cracked the code on digital video to get a huge audience behind any of their properties,” says John Muszynski, chief investment officer at Publicis’ Spark media buying group. “There are some good signs of programmes starting to get traction.”As people spend more time watching video on digital devices, television’s hold on ad budgets is expected to decline. Ad spending on television is set to increase a tepid 3.3 per cent this year while spending on digital video is expected to surge 41 per cent.“Younger audiences, 18- to 34-year-olds, are spending more and more time watching video and not just on television,” says Carl Fremont, global head of digital for WPP’s MEC ad buying group. “That audience is very coveted by marketers.”A significant factor that has deterred advertisers from premium online video is expensive ad rates. Marketers buy commercial time based on the number of people who will see the spot. With audiences for online programmes often limited, that makes less commercial inventory available for sale and leads to higher prices.Two years ago, internet companies set the rates for digital video ads at about a 50 per cent premium over cable television, according to ad executives.Prices have steadily decreased. Last year the average rate for an in-stream online video advert that reaches 1,000 people was $23.03, 38 per cent more than the average rate for cable television advert targeted at the 18 to 49-year-old audience, according to research firm SQAD. Network television commands the highest rates, charging an average of $44.11 to reach 1,000 people in the 18 to 49-year old audience.Younger audiences, 18- to 34-year-olds, are spending more and more time watching video and not just on television. That audience is very coveted by marketersTo lure more viewers and ultimately advertising budgets, online outlets are pouring more resources into marketing their original series. Hulu, for instance, promoted the new season of its supernatural comedy Deadbeat at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and advertising on bus shelters in New York. The show also is featured prominently on Hulu’s site.“The biggest question we get is how are you going to promote these shows,” says Peter Naylor, head of ad sales at Hulu, the online video service owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast. “A lot of people can pursue this original content avenue, but you have to go out of your way to make sure that it is discoverable and that you are building an audience for the marketer.”Some experiments are starting to pay off. Citi, the financial services company, is returning this year as the sole sponsor for the second season of the city.ballet. series on AOL which follows the lives of company members of the New York City Ballet. The series has gained about 14m views to date.Video ads for Citi appear before the start of each episode and paid off in return-on-investment measures, according to Pete Stein, global chief executive of Publicis’ Razorfish, the digital marketing agency that brokered the deal on behalf of Citi.“I don’t know if I would say that [advertising on online original series] has reached prime time,” he says, “but it is on everybody’s radar.”"

Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Google all closed down 4 per cent or more.In Europe on Friday morning, the regional FTSE Eurofirst 300 index opened down 0.9 per cent as technology hardware stocks, particularly chipmakers, joined the sell-off.French defence electronics group Thales fell 4.5 per cent to €45.69, undermined also by a downgrade to neutral from JPMorgan. UK chip designer Arm Holdings, which has been at the vanguard of other recent tech sell-offs, fell 4 per cent to 964p, while German chipmaker Infineon Technologies lost 2.8 per cent to €8.15. ASML Holding, the Dutch maker of chip manufacturing equipment, shed 2.2 per cent to €64.34.In Hong Kong on Friday morning, Tencent shed 6 per cent to HK$48.96 and software maker Kingsoft lost 5.7 per cent to HK$29.15, while newly listed BAIOO Family Interactive tumbled as much as 14 per cent. South Korea’s Naver, which owns chat app Line, dropped 3.1 per cent to Won741,000 while Japanese game developer GungHo slid 4.4 per cent to Y520.“Up until now, we were cutting fat. But now we are cutting muscle,” said Geoffrey Porges, senior biotech analyst at AllianceBernstein. “I have every expectation that this sell-off will last at least for a quarter or two.”The average fall for Asian internet stocks in the past month has now topped 20 per cent.However, analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a report: “We see the current share price weakness as a short-term correction, rather than the ‘burst of bubble’.”Traders said they expected the US market to rebound on Friday.After hitting a record this month, the S&P 500 has fallen 3.3 per cent, indicating that investors are not getting out of equities but deserting higher-growth companies in favour of more established stocks.Biotech’s multiyear rally had been among the most scrutinised aspects of the US market’s bull run since companies in the sector are experimenting with treatments they hope will become medical breakthroughs. But those experiments often have binary outcomes, leaving investors vulnerable to sudden swings in a company’s fortunes.Biotech stocks soared into record territory in late February, notching up gains of more than 20 per cent for 2014. Thursday’s fall took the year-to-date decline for the sector's index to 2.2 per cent.The sell-off was most severe among small-to-mid-cap biotechs, which had ridden a wave of investor enthusiasm that help fuelled large capital inflows.Pharmacyclics, a clinical-stage drug company working on cancer treatments, lost 9.6 per cent to $93.26. Larger companies in the sector, however, also fell sharply. Gilead Sciences, whose pricing of a breakthrough hepatitis C drug has faced scrutiny from politicians and health organisations, declined 7.3 per cent to $65.48.Investors pointed to aggressive short selling of the iShares exchange traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq Biotech index for exacerbating daily volatility.Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management, said the growth potential for biotechs remained promising but the sector had become expensive.“In terms of investment stories, it's good for investors but prices have run up so much that I think we are seeing some aggressive traders pushing it around.”Heavy selling pressure is expected to take a toll on biotechs hoping to raise capital in the coming weeks. Analysts said it was likely that many would be forced to delay offerings.Mr Porges said: “What I am looking for now is mergers and acquisitions to start again in the sector because business development teams at pharmaceutical companies are a lot more excited.”Additional reporting by Josh Noble in Hong Kong and Neil Dennis in London
602;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Controls for the gamer in every mobile user;New gadgets aim to create a niche market of game-controller accessories;"Hundreds of millions of people regularly play video games on their smartphones and tablets. Yet only a fraction of this number are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for the latest Xbox or PlayStation console. The makers of several new gadgets hope to bridge that gap and create a niche market of game-controller accessories for players who want to go to the next level – without spending a fortune.Amazon Fire TV plus controller (Rating: 4/5); Logitech PowerShell (3/5); SteelSeries Stratus (4/5)The most prominent of the new products is Amazon’s new Fire TV, which launched in the US last week, costing $99. As well as offering the usual selection of online video services, such as Netflix and YouTube, Amazon’s main point of differentiation against other TV streaming boxes from Apple and Roku is a games controller. Costing an extra $40, the joystick looks much like a PlayStation or Xbox controller and is pretty robust despite the lower cost.Fire TV runs a version of Android, Google’s mobile software, and so the device in some ways competes with a handful of games controller peripherals that have been released for use with smartphones and tablets in recent months.Last year, Apple began to allow iPhone accessories companies to make controllers for the first time. Logitech, best known for its keyboards and mice, was among the early manufacturers to join this new category with its PowerShell, and recently cut its price from $70 to $50 (£59.99 in the UK).An iPhone (version 5 or later) slots into the middle of the PowerShell, making it look something like an elongated version of Sony’s PlayStation Portable handheld. It has a four-way button, rather than a full joystick, to control direction, which can feel heavy-going after a while. But as an integrated device with an extra battery to extend play, it works well to while away a commute or long journey.One alternative is the Stratus by SteelSeries, a Danish peripheral maker focused on gaming. This compact, standalone controller uses Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to recent iPhones and iPads, for a somewhat pricey $79.99.The Stratus is harder to use on the move than the PowerShell because the iPhone or iPad has to be propped up somewhere, and the joypad is a little on the small side for longer gaming sessions. Nonetheless, the ability to play with a separate controller on a bigger tablet screen is satisfyingly similar to a “proper” console.Today’s smartphones, tablets and TV set-top boxes do not have the same graphical capabilities of an Xbox One or PlayStation 4. Indeed, many of the early games being produced for Fire TV or these mobile controllers are retro “ports” (games converted from one platform to another) from the 1990s or early 2000s – think Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega’s Mega Drive or Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for PlayStation 2.But graphics have never been everything in gaming, especially when downloads for mobile or Fire TV typically sell for a tiny fraction of the price of traditional console software. Here, these devices have a big advantage over dedicated gaming handhelds such as Nintendo’s 3DS and Sony’s PlayStation Vita.Of course, many mobile games such as Angry Birds and Candy Crush Saga have achieved huge popularity without the need for such a device – the only controller they require is a finger.The market for anything more advanced remains to be proved, and many in the mobile gaming industry are sceptical that it exists. But lapsed gamers such as myself might want to do more than slide candy or fling birds around, for longer than those games’ usual five-minute sessions.For me, each of these products has shortcomings that would make me hesitate to recommend a purchase before more games appear for them; developers have to lend support for these peripherals.Nonetheless, together they show that cheap hardware and low-price mobile games can produce an experience compelling enough to make a casual gamer want to pick up a joystick again.Planet of the AppsWhat it is: Cover, free for Android onlyWhy you should try it: Cover, which was acquired this week by Twitter, takes over the homescreen of your Android smartphone.

603;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland.

The offering had been priced at $26 on Thursday night, more than earlier projections. GrubHub sold 4m shares in the offering, while selling stockholders offered another 3.4m for sale.Citigroup and Morgan Stanley acted as joint bookrunners for Friday’s offering. The flotation follows a busy first quarter for IPOs, with the average amount raised in the period reaching a record, according to data from Dealogic.The rise stood in contrast with a difficult month for the tech sector stalwarts, including Facebook and Twitter, which have each fallen more than 10 per cent. King Digital, the maker of Candy Crush, continues to trade below its offering price.Google A class shares, which carry minimal voting rights, ended the day down 4.59 per cent to $545.25, the second day of trading after a split to create a C class of stock which carries no voting rights.Amazon fell 3.25 per cent to $322.78 and Netflix shares were down 4.9 per cent to $337.31, as momentum stocks on Nasdaq were hit hard.A week long spotlight on the business of rapid fire stock trading also knocked down the valuations of the publicly traded companies at the heart of a debate over whether US stock markets are “rigged”.Shares in US online brokers suffered some of the largest losses on Friday as ETrade fell 7.83 per cent to close at $20.43, TD Ameritrade lost 4 per cent to $30.71 and Charles Schwab declined 4.79 per cent to end at $26.06.KCG, an algorithmic trading company that also executes orders on behalf of clients, lost 6.81 per cent to $10.47. Major US stock and derivatives exchange operators including Nasdaq OMX, CBOE and ICE also fell.The scrutiny of the US trading industry was prompted by the release of Michael Lewis’ latest book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt.Elsewhere, CarMax, the largest US used-car dealership chain, slid after the company reported fourth-quarter results shy of Wall Street forecasts.The firm said sales rose 9 per cent to $3.08bn, led by a 7 per cent advance in same-store sales, compared to expectations for $3.18bn. Profits declined 7 per cent to $99m, or 44 cents per diluted share, nearly a dime below analyst forecasts.CarMax said it would lift its share repurchase programme by $1bn. Shares dipped 4.21 per cent to $45.56.Finish Line strengthened following a broker upgrade to ‘overweight’ from ‘equal-weight’ as analysts at Morgan Stanley called the company their “top small-cap idea”.The shares rose by 1.13 per cent to $27.16 as Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said the investment bank expects strong athletic footwear sales trends to continue through 2014, with Finish Line likely to benefit from exclusive Nike offerings.“Finish Line’s last quarter showed the company can deliver even in a very poor mall traffic environment,” Mr Sole said. “A strong new product pipeline and the continuing health and wellness trend should sustain Finish Line’s premium running footwear business through 2014.”Athletic footwear sales have like “troughed” as recent data points to an acceleration, Mr Sole added.First Solar climbed as much as 6 per cent before paring its gains on Friday to just under 2 per cent, closing at $69.72, as analysts at Citi lifted their price target on the firm.Analyst Shahriar Pourreza said the company’s outlook “remains robust”, raising his target on the firm to $87 from $63.“The company has already contracted/booked 75 per cent of the earnings in 2015 and 40 per cent for 2016 so material upside remains as business mix changes and First Solar continues to diversify globally,” Mr Pourreza said.Overall, US equity markets struggled for direction after the month’s non-farm payrolls report showed payrolls expanded by 192,000 in March. The figures were marginally below Wall Street forecasts.The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.25 per cent to end at 1,865.09 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.96 per cent to 16,412.71. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 2.6 per cent to close at 4,127.73.
605;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-04-03T15:16:31Z;Amazon breathes new Fire into television gaming debate;;Tech companies including Apple, Google and Netflix have been redefining the idea of television for some time. But Amazon’s announcement on Wednesday of its Fire TV set-top box was not just about how Americans can increasingly rent movies or binge-watch drama series over the internet. It was also about video games.Amazon hopes that by propelling itself into the world of Minecraft and Disney Pixar’s Monsters University games – which will both be available via Fire TV – it will entice more people to stay within its so-called “ecosystem”, enjoy more content and spend more money on its growing number of services.“Amazon sees the television as a portal through which it will be able to drive commerce in time to come, so it needs unfettered access to you over this platform,” says Yousseff Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.“These games are becoming more immersive – they’re hands-on. Through Fire TV people will interact with the television in a different way.The company “definitely has a longer-term vision”, he adds. “Changing people’s behaviour takes years and this was the first step in a multiyear process. Gaming is just one mechanism to achieve this.”Amazon has worked with developers including Electronic Arts and Sega to bring free and paid-for games to consumers through Fire TV, alongside movies and TV programmes.Games, including favourites such as The Walking Dead and Asphalt 8, can be played using a smartphone, a tablet or a separate Fire game controller, which can be bought for $39.99.A forthcoming update to Apple’s $99 TV box is also expected to have gaming as a focus.The moves of Amazon and others show that TV sets are not in danger of dying out. Americans spend, on average, more than five hours a day watching television, according to Nielsen.Amazon’s target customers are not the “hardcore” gamers who have helped the latest generations of Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation to sell better than expected since their launch last year.On average, paid games on Fire TV cost just $1.85. And that catalogue is supplemented by thousands of free games.With their reputation for being addictive, games such as Angry Birds and Candy Crush Saga have proved that even non-gamers can be drawn in.But the failure of Nintendo’s Wii U to replicate the success the original Wii console has left some analysts questioning the role of a device such as the Fire TV.“We expect casual gamers to continue to opt for the convenience and low pricing of games for mobile phones and tablets, at least until Fire TV is considered a viable gaming device,” says Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities.He questions the price of the device’s controller add-on, which is high relative to the games it can play.“Although Amazon has many notable partners lined up, we do not expect Fire TV’s gaming initiative to be successful, as we do not anticipate that consumers will perceive a need to play mobile games on their TVs,” Mr Pachter adds.Changing people’s behaviour takes years …Gaming is just one mechanism to achieve thisWhile it is unlikely to threaten the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4, the device could challenge Android-based “micro-consoles” such as Ouya and PlayJam’s GameStick, says Piers Harding-Rolls, analyst at IHS. The latter products were both helped to break through by the Kickstarter crowdfunding site.Fire TV is more technically powerful than those rivals. But it also has the advantage of Amazon’s large existing customer base, with credit cards already linked and ready to buy.Julie Uhrman, chief executive of Ouya, which makes Android-powered gaming consoles for TVs, says a focus on gamers gives her start-up an advantage over its larger new rival.“It’s great validation of the space,” she says. “Two years ago people questioned us – now others are following.”There is another key difference between Ouya and groups such as Amazon. “For us, games are not simply an ‘added bonus’ – they’re the whole point.”
606;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-03-24T17:14:26Z;Netflix shares fall on talk of Apple service;Nasdaq hit by biotech and social media selling;Netflix shares fell almost 7 per cent on concerns about competitive threats to its online film and series streaming service after an unconfirmed report that Apple was in talks with Comcast about a rival service using an Apple set-top box.The report in the Wall Street Journal said that discussions between the world’s most valuable company and the nation’s largest cable provider were in early stages and many hurdles remained.But any talks would come amid industry jostling on the issue of free delivery of content over the internet as providers seek to gain access to faster broadband speed and better services. Shares in Netflix finished down 6.67 per cent to close at $378.90.“Folks don’t understand the Comcast-Apple box and somehow think that because someone changes their set top that they would cancel Netflix for a service that does not even exist,” said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible.The Nasdaq Composite was also hit by weakness in Twitter stock, down more than 4 per cent to close at $48.78, following a ban on the online messaging service by Turkey’s prime minister.The social media sector was also affected with Facebook shares down 4.67 per cent to $64.10 and Google down more than 2 per cent to $1,157.93.Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has in the past also threatened to block Facebook and Google’s YouTube.Herbalife shares surged after its largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, once again tightened his grip on the nutrition supplement company.Shares in Herbalife rose as much as 9 per cent after the company announced it would nominate and back three Icahn appointees to its board. The decision takes the activist investor’s hold of the 13-seat board to five. The shares eventually closed up 6.7 per cent, at $52.86.Hunter Gary and Jesse Lynn, employees of Icahn Enterprises, will be nominated for seats with terms expiring in 2016, according to a statement filed with US securities regulators.James Nelson, an Icahn Enterprises independent director, has also been nominated.Icahn Enterprises, which owns 16.8 per cent of outstanding shares, added it could increase its stake to as much as 25 per cent.Mr Icahn, who has waged a bitter public battle against investor Bill Ackman over the company, said he remained confident in the company’s board.The shares, which have been subject to volatile shifts over the past month, had fallen more than 30 per cent since the year’s start as the Federal Trade Commission opened a formal investigation into the company’s practices.Biotechnology shares were on track for another poor performance as shocks from a US Congressional committee’s questions over drug costs continued to weigh on the sector.The Nasdaq Biotech index fell by just over 3 per cent, adding to a 4 per cent slide on Friday that was triggered by a letter from the House Energy and Commerce committee to the chief executive of Gilead.The lawmakers questioned Gilead’s plans to sell the 12-week treatment, Sovaldi, for $84,000.Epizyme, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Zogenix and Novavax all fell by more than a tenth as nine in ten stocks in the index fell. Larger companies, including Gilead, Mylan, and Grifols also slid.The sector had reached an apogee earlier this year as sales estimates for some of the costliest drugs rose.The letter on Friday, which argued the cost would saddle state Medicaid programmes with unaffordable bills, tempered that euphoria.The sector’s decline weighed on the larger Nasdaq Composite, which was down 1.18 per cent to end at 4,226.39.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.16 per cent to close at 16,276.69, while the S&P 500 index finished 0.49 per cent lower, at 1,857.44.
607;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;AT&T hits back at Netflix over ISP fees;;AT&T has hit back at Netflix, calling the chief executive of the film and TV streaming service “arrogant” for arguing it should not pay extra fees to internet providers for its heavy bandwidth use.Jim Cicconi, who heads the telecoms company’s public policy team, said there was “no free lunch” and therefore “no cost-free streaming movies”.In an post entitled, “Who should pay for Netflix?”, he said the advent of streaming videos was driving consumer bandwidth consumption to record levels, requiring investment in broadband networks to build more capacity.The telecoms provider responded to a post by Reed Hastings on Thursday that criticised AT&T’s rival Comcast for violating the principle of net neutrality, which ensures telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates for data and content services regardless of the amount of data being used.“Mr Hastings’ arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix. That may be a nice deal if he can get it. But it’s not how the internet, or telecommunication for that matter, has ever worked,” he said. Mr Cicconi added that when Netflix delivered DVDs by mail, the customer paid for the cost of delivery, which he said was the equivalent of all broadband customers being made to pay for the heavy bandwidth use of Netflix users.“It would’ve been neither right nor legal for Netflix to demand a customer’s neighbours pay the cost of delivering his movie,” he said. “If there’s a cost of delivering Mr Hastings’ movies at the quality level he desires – and there is – then it should be borne by Netflix and recovered in the price of the service.”This latest spat in a series of disputes over “net neutrality” comes as the Federal Communications Commission is conducting public hearings on the subject. The Netflix blog post was submitted to the FCC.In the post, Mr Hastings hinted that Netflix had few options other than to agree to a deal with Comcast struck just last month to pay an undisclosed fee for “interconnection”. He accused Comcast and other big internet providers, of which AT&T is one, of using their “market position” to impose tolls.Comcast responded to the post, saying that no one had a stronger commitment to the open internet than the company. David Cohen, executive vice-president, said Netflix and other providers had always paid for their connection to the internet and had “ample options” to ensure customers received good performance at a “fair price”.
608;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-03-20T22:54:46Z;Netflix targets Comcast over ISP fees;;Netflix has accused Comcast and other big internet providers of using their “market position” to impose tolls for access to their networks, hindering the ability of online video operators to provide a quality service.Netflix struck a deal with Comcast last month whereby it will pay the cable group an undisclosed fee for “interconnection” – effectively connecting its streaming film and television service with Comcast’s internet network.But in a blog post published on Tuesday, Netflix hinted that it had been left with little choice. With some internet providers, “Netflix performance has been constrained, subjecting consumers who pay a lot of money for high-speed internet to high buffering rates, long wait times and poor video quality,” wrote Reed Hastings, chief executive.“Once Netflix agrees to pay the ISP interconnection fees, however, sufficient capacity is made available and high-quality service for consumers is restored.” Comcast is currently the only company Netflix has agreed to pay for “interconnection”.Comcast swiftly responded to Mr Hastings’ blog post. David Cohen, executive vice-president, said: “No company . . . has had a stronger commitment to the open internet than Comcast.”“Providers like Netflix have always paid for their interconnection to the internet and have always had ample options to ensure that their customers receive an optimal performance through all ISPs at a fair price,” he said.The Netflix blog post comes at a sensitive time for Comcast, the largest cable operator in the US. It is currently preparing for regulatory scrutiny over its $42.5bn bid for Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable group.Regulators are likely to take a close look at Comcast’s position in the broadband market, with the combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable set to supply an estimated 40 per cent of online US households with internet service upon completion of the takeover.He may not trump Comcast’s bid for Time Warner, but it is too soon write off John Malone, writes Matthew Garrahan.Continue readingThe Netflix blog post is being submitted to the Federal Communication Commission as part of its public hearings into “net neutrality” – the principle that ensures telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates to data and content services regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.In January, Verizon, the telecoms operator, won a landmark case against the FCC when a US court ruled that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing net-neutrality. The court ruling could clear the way for online video operators to be charged for the data streamed by consumers on high-speed lines – an issue of concern to Netflix and other video services, such as Google’s YouTube.In the blog post Mr Hastings called for “strong net neutrality” to prevent “ISPs from charging a toll for interconnection to services like Netflix, YouTube, or Skype . . . to deliver the services and data requested by ISP residential subscribers”.Instead, “ISPs must provide sufficient access to their network without charge”, he said. “Without strong net neutrality, big ISPs can demand potentially escalating fees for the interconnection required to deliver high-quality service. The big ISPs can make these demands . . . because of their market position.”
609;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-03-13T19:16:08Z;In a tech bubble with a twist, the big danger is bonds;The more money that floods into fixed income, the more risky any reversal;"Seth Klarman, the publicity-shy manager of the $27bn Baupost hedge fund, has given investors a slap. In his quarterly investment letter, he declared capital markets are in the grip of a wild bubble.“Any year in which the S&P jumps 32 per cent and the Nasdaq 40 per cent while corporate earnings barely increase should be a cause for concern,” he wrote, pointing to “bubbles” in bond and credit markets, and “nosebleed stock market valuations of fashionable companies like Netflix and Tesla”.It might sound reminiscent of 1999, when “fashionable” technology stocks last soared on this scale. But there is a twist: today it is not equities but bond markets that may yet be the most significant cause of concern.In recent years an astonishing amount of money has quietly flooded into fixed income funds, which buy corporate bonds, emerging markets bonds and mortgage debt. And as the US looks more likely to raise interest rates, creating potential losses for bondholders, the flows could reverse – creating destabilising shocks for regulators and investors alike.Consider the numbers. Just after Mr Klarman issued his warnings, the investment research group Morningstar produced analysis that suggests US investors have put $700bn of new money into the most mainstream taxable US bond funds since 2009. Since bond prices have risen, too, the value of these funds has doubled to $2tn. That is striking. But more notable is that these inflows to fixed income have outstripped the inflows to equity funds during the 1990s tech bubble – in both absolute and relative terms.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates (using slightly different forms of calculation) that $1.2tn has flowed into global bond funds since 2009, compared with a mere $132bn into equities. And a new paper from the Chicago Booth business school estimates that inflows to global fixed income funds have been almost $2tn since 2008, four times that of equity funds.Given this, it is no surprise that investment grade companies have been rushing to sell bonds at rock-bottom yields (this week General Electric, Coca-Cola and Viacom were just the latest). Nor is it surprising that junk bond issuance hit a record last year; or that Moody’s, the US credit rating agency, warned this week that investors are so desperate to gobble up bonds that they are buying instruments with fewer legal protections than ever before.But the $2tn question is what might happen if, or when, those flows change course. Until recently it was often presumed that corporate bond investors were a less skittish group than equity investors; fixed income funds were not prone to quite such wild sentiment swings. However, the four economists who penned the Chicago Booth paper argue that this is no longer the case.Analysing market data since 2008, they conclude bond market investors have an increasing tendency towards volatile swings and herd behaviour. That is partly because of fears that the US Federal Reserve could soon raise rates. But the sociology of asset managers is crucial, too. “Delegated investors such as fund managers are concerned with relative performance compared to their peers [because] it affects their asset-gathering capabilities,” they note. “Investing agents are averse to being the last one into a trade [which] can potentially set off a race among investors to join a sell-off in a race to avoid being left behind.” And while such behaviour can affect all fund managers, the Chicago analysis suggests bond fund managers have recently become much more skittish than their equity counterparts.One sign of this occurred last year when bond markets, fearing the Fed was about to tighten monetary policy, had a “ taper tantrum”, the Chicago Booth authors say. They warn that “bond markets could experience another tantrum” when the “extraordinary monetary accommodation in the US is withdrawn”. And since it is now the bond funds, not banks, that hold the lion’s share of corporate bonds, if another taper tantrum does take hold that could be very destabilising.Today, as in 1999, nobody knows when that turning point might come. But the more money that floods into fixed income, the more dangerous any reversal could be. Investors and policy makers alike need to heed the message from the Chicago paper – or from Mr Klarman. History may not repeat itself; but, when bubbles occur, it does have a tendency to rhyme.gillian.tett@ft.com"
610;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-03-09T18:44:27Z;Why China’s leaders love to watch ‘House of Cards’;The Netflix show’s depiction of US corruption confirms Chinese perceptions, says Kurt Campbell;If articles in the China-watching press are to be believed, we have recently learnt a lot about the viewing habits of senior Chinese leaders. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, reportedly considers the American classic The Godfather his favourite western cinematic indulgence. Wang Qishan, the former vice-premier of finance and now ultimate arbiter for discipline on the Communist party’s standing committee, is said to favour House of Cards. Mr Wang has purportedly told colleagues in Zhongnanhai, the cloistered leadership compound, to keep abreast of the Netflix hit. He apparently was so transfixed by early episodes that he instructed underlings to check the release date for season two.The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policy makers and commentatorsPolitical heavyweights from authoritarian regimes tend to favour muscular US movies such as Rambo and Scarface. Apparently, the Latin American strongman Manuel Noriega had a library filled with violent American VHS video tapes (before the era of DVDs).But when members of the Chinese political class are asked about their American cinema favourites, it is movies about official corruption, political double-crossing and state violence that are most often mentioned. This western programming is complemented by a range of Chinese-produced shows whose plot lines resemble the twists and turns of Dallas, the 1980s show that followed the family feuds unfolding inside a fictitious Texas oil dynasty. Indeed, a number of western actors in China have found a niche playing roles as corrupt politicians, warmongering military officers or seductive female executives on the prowl.What lies behind this fascination with political intrigue? It is possible that the Chinese view the portrayal of politics in House of Cards as quintessentially American – perhaps even an accurate depiction of the workings of US government. But of course, the American show is adapted from a BBC series from the 1990s. The lead character in the British version, Francis Urquhart, rises to become prime minister through behaviour that is if anything even more diabolical than that of Frank Underwood, his American counterpart.Westerners often dismiss talk in the Chinese media of the country’s encirclement by the US as exaggerated political rhetoric. But in my experience, even the most cosmopolitan Chinese interlocutor harbours a deep ambivalence and uncertainty about Washington’s strategic intentions. It is widely believed that, beneath the surface, America’s vaunted democracy is rife with injustice and corruption.What is also interesting about House of Cards – especially, perhaps, to Chinese viewers – is its sophisticated depiction of issues of the kind that complicate US-China relations. Examples include a naval stand-off between China and Japan, and frequent contretemps over currency and cyber security. Permeating the entire script is a nervous sense that China is on the rise and here to stay. Some episodes have the US president engaging with strong Chinese leaders, who themselves manoeuvre deftly behind the scenes.The shows may also echo something familiar in the modern Chinese experience. The recent saga of Bo Xilai, his wife, his security chief and the death of a British businessman are eerily reminiscent of the dirty political deeds perpetrated by Underwood in his quest for power.There is nothing particularly sinister in finding oneself bewitched by the conspiracies unfolding in House of Cards. President Barack Obama has revealed his own fascination with the show. He even confessed a pang of envy for the “efficiency” with which things get done in the fictional Washington of its creation. Still, I am waiting for a senior Chinese official to tell of being moved by the depiction of the human spirit in, say, 12 Years a Slave.For those of us impatient to binge on another season of House of Cards, it is delightful to think that the Chinese leadership might share our plight. Many expect Underwood’s ambition of reaching the Oval office to be fulfilled in season three. If so then Beijing, like the rest of us, will be watching how he fares – and how he uses dark arts against the rising power across the Pacific.The writer is chairman and chief executive of The Asia Group and a former US assistant secretary of state
611;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T03:00:57+0000;Seth Klarman warns of impending asset price bubble;;One of the world’s most respected investors has raised the alarm over a looming asset price bubble, calling out “nosebleed valuations” in technology shares like Netflix and Tesla Motors and warning of the potential for a brutal correction across financial markets.Seth Klarman, the publicity-shy head of the $27bn Baupost Group whose investment opinions have attracted almost a cult-like following, said that investors were underplaying risk and were not prepared for an end to central banks reversing a five-year experiment in ultra-loose money.While noting that he could not predict exactly when a significant market correction would occur, Mr Klarman wrote in a private letter to clients: “When the markets reverse, everything investors thought they knew will be turned upside down and inside out. ‘Buy the dips’ will be replaced with ‘what was I thinking?’ . . . Anyone who is poorly positioned and ill-prepared will find there’s a long way to fall. Few, if any, will escape unscathed.”Baupost, which is closed to new investment, returned $4bn to clients last year.The warning by Mr Klarman, who has won a devoted audience for his highly cautious, value-driven approach, and whose out-of-print book on investment sells second-hand for as much as $2,900 on Amazon, comes after US shares surged by almost a third last year. Many well known technology companies, such as Facebook, more than doubled.“Any year in which the S&P 500 jumps 32 per cent and the Nasdaq 40 per cent while corporate earnings barely increase should be a cause for concern, not for further exuberance,” Mr Klarman wrote.“On almost any metric, the US equity market is historically quite expensive. A sceptic would have to be blind not to see bubbles inflating in junk bond issuance, credit quality, and yields, not to mention the nosebleed stock market valuations of fashionable companies like Netflix and Tesla Motors,” he wrote. The Baupost Group declined to comment.Any year in which the S&P 500 jumps 32% and the Nasdaq 40% while corporate earnings barely increase should be a cause for concern, not for further exuberanceSince central banks slashed interest rates to record lows and began a policy of buying up government bonds after the 2008 market crash, the S&P 500 has rallied by more than 150 per cent to new all-time highs. Bond yields have fallen sharply and many other assets, from fine art to property in Singapore and London, have leapt in value.Mr Klarman is exceptional among hedge fund managers for often holding the bulk of his portfolio in cash, yet still generating annualised returns of 18 per cent since 1983 using often highly concentrated investments.The Boston-based investor was recently ranked as the fourth-best performing hedge fund manager of all time for generating $21.5bn in returns over its history, coming behind George Soros, Ray Dalio and John Paulson.
612;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Virgin Media in broadband fightback;;Virgin Media will offer twice the broadband speed of any other retail provider in the UK, as it seeks to revitalise its business following last year’s $16bn takeover by Liberty Global.Sales at Virgin Media were about £150m lower in 2013 than had been forecast at the time of Liberty’s acquisition, following a war for broadband customers between BT and BSkyB, and a disappointing performance in its business-to-business division.Virgin will now offer households up to 152 Mb per second, instead of its current maximum speed of 120 Mb per second.Broadband speeds have become a concern for media companies such as Netflix, which want consumers to be able to stream music and videos more easily over the internet.“The usage on the Virgin Media Network is running over 50 per cent higher than the same time last year,” said Tom Mockridge, Virgin Media’s chief executive. “We need to meet that demand.”Virgin Media uses its own fibre network, unlike BT, Sky, TalkTalk and EE, which all rely on BT’s Openreach network and currently offer up to 76 Mb per second.Mr Mockridge shrugged off BT’s plans to launch a 300Mb per second retail service for a limited number of customers.“They can always find one home in Chelsea and pump a big pipe into that,” he said. Virgin’s fibre network currently covers about half of UK households.The company’s previous management had forecast that revenues would grow 6 per cent in 2013 to £4.3bn.In fact revenues only grew 2 per cent, Liberty Global said this month.“Frankly maybe the acquisition caused a little bit of the hiccup,” said Mr Mockridge, noting that the company is cutting about 600 management jobs.“[But] maybe Virgin Media as a standalone company might not have had the resources to make the investment [in faster broadband].”Virgin Media added 103,000 broadband customers last year, half as many as in the previous year.BT added 615,000 customers amid an aggressive sports rights push, while BSkyB’s customer base increased 892,000, largely thanks to the acquisition of O2’s fixed-line business.“Liberty Global will be looking to reinvigorate Virgin Media through 2014,” wrote Andrew Hogley, an analyst at Espirito Santo, in a note to clients earlier this month.“Whilst not competing on content rights, Virgin Media will need to keep up with the innovation being delivered by BSkyB and leverage its ability to deliver video on demand across multiple devices, quad play offers and higher broadband speeds.”
613;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-02-26T15:41:38Z;Do it like a software developer;Can other workplaces learn from how technology companies organise themselves?;"Software developers: probably our new overlords. Or at least it can feel that way in our increasingly digital lives. The past few years have brought a steady flow of initiatives – such as the “Hour of Code”, the “Year of Code” and “Code Year” – that seek to make us all a bit more “developer”.But there is more to learn from software developers than just programming. The revolution in technology has also brought us innovations in working and people management practices.Welcome to the company
Take the way working life starts for recruits at many traditional companies. Highlights of the first week may include: reading stacks of outdated documentation, an unconscionable ratio of introductions to cognitive cap­acity, an embarrassing need for someone to be called to collect you from the lobby as a security pass proves perplexingly difficult to acquire, and a few too many glances at the time.Contrast this with the approach taken by a well-known, developer-led company. A class of 30 to 60 people forms, comprising a mixture of recent, and significantly less recent, graduates. They spend the first few days on introductions to relevant systems. Then they are set tasks. Pulled from a company-wide system, these tasks are features to be added to the company’s online platform. Mentors offer guidance and before the week is out, their work is released to clients.That is the first of seven weeks in Facebook’s Bootcamp, which all engineering recruits, and everyone who will work with them, go through.Resilience drills
Also deploying a militaristic term for a common working practice is Net­flix, with its “Simian Army”. Its first soldier was Chaos Monkey. This simian, which was entered into service in 2009, is a program that randomly disables systems running Netflix’s video­streaming service (as if a monkey had been let loose with a wrench in a data centre). The idea is that by deliberately causing damage to the system, the company constantly checks its resilience to known points of fragility.It is a valuable way to learn. Tara Swart, chief executive of consultancy The Unlimited Mind, and a neuroscientist and leadership coach, says: “Visualising something or actually ex­periencing it is very powerful on the brain. Just theorising about it is not quite the same.”Such “experiences” must be spontaneous enough to be realistic, but controlled enough to avoid actual failure. Chaos Monkey is allowed out only on weekdays, when software developers are around and the load on the site is rel­atively low. Yury Izrailevsky, vice-president of cloud systems and infrastructure, says: “In reality, fail­ures will occur no matter what, and usually if you wait for them to occur naturally, that will happen at the worst possible time. And it’s much better to constantly go through the drills on your own schedule.”While the benefits of realistic re­hearsals have long been recognised in industry as well as the armed forces, practice drills in service organisations are less widespread, apart from the occasional test that involves using a back-up office location. A more useful test might see business-critical emp­l­oy­ees randomly told to stay away on a given day, in an effort to test resilience to so-called key-man risk.On a mission to network
Back at Facebook, the unusual induction programme does not just serve to familiarise recruits with the company and its systems. Being given real problems to solve spurs productive introductions to company veterans. As David Recordon, the 27-year-old engineering manager who runs Bootcamp points out, it helps people “to get over an innate human fear of being someone who’s new and going to get help from someone who’s been here for a while. And just not feeling bad about that.”Finding your niche
Working with veterans also helps Bootcampers identify the projects they want to work on at the end of the seven weeks, since being hired by Facebook does not come with assignment to a particular team. Mr Recordon says finding a team – there are more than 100 of them spanning about a dozen different areas – is about discovering the “maximum intersection of passion and impact”. He gamely admits it might sound “a little corny”.“Don’t just play on your phone, program it,” encourages Barack Obama in a video promoting the “Hour of Code”. Launched towards the end of 2013, the initiative encouraged people from all walks of life to participate in a one-hour introduction to programming during Computer Science Education week.It is a bandwagon former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg has been on for a while. He announced his participation in a different initiative – “Code Year” – on Twitter back in 2012. Nearly half a million flocked to the free online learning platform Codecademy that year. The platform has since upped the stakes this year by encouraging would-be coders to: “learn to build something in 2014” in under four weeks.The UK is also in on the trend. This February saw the launch of the “Year of Code”, heralding a revamp in the curriculum for computing in schools. The campaign itself, however, was criticised as something of a PR disaster by those who noted the lack of involvement by certain organisations that have long promoted computer science in the UK.Dr Swart says identifying an emp­loyee’s enthusiasm is a particularly efficient approach. While people may feel drawn to improve on things they are bad at, doing so requires a great deal of effort to ach­ieve relatively small gains. It is a function of the brain having to work hard to create new connections (synapses) between neurons and even to grow new neurons associated with the skill, she explains.Working instead on improving an area of natural talent or already advanced skills is literally the path of lesser resistance as the brain instead creates further connections and speeds up existing ones. “If you are already good at something, then you can just get better, faster,” says Dr Swart.Unbounded holiday
Another practice beloved of technology companies, and those of the start-up variety in particular, is the “take what you need” policy for paid time off, including holidays and sick leave.While adherents of the unlimited holiday approach use it as a way to attract top talent, it is not without difficulties. Chief among them is that employees simply may not understand what is deemed acceptable by colleagues and management. As a result, they nervously avoid taking holiday at all. Or, in some cases, they forget to take it because with no deadline for taking it the pressure is off.It is a problem for which non-technology firm The Motley Fool, a financial services company, has a novel solution. Founded in 1993, the company has had a policy of having no policy ever since it had employees to not apply a policy to.The solution is the Fool’s Errand. One employee a month is randomly selected to go on a two-week holiday that must be taken within a month, with $1,000 of spending money thrown in as an extra sweetener. A preselection of 10 finalists allows the ultimate winner of that month’s draw – which takes place at a company-wide meeting of its 290 employees – to be done in a fun way.Last year, Motley Fool’s director of external communications Matthew Trogdon was selected from the line-up by a pet. A customer visiting its of­fices had brought her dog and all the finalists were given pet treats to offer. The dog went to Mr Trogdon first.He says the Fool’s Errand serves as “a monthly reminder that ‘we want you to go on vacation and it’s OK to go on vacation’.” It also, inadvertently, forces the company to test for resilience against key-man risk. But according to Mr Trogdon that “just happens to be a valuable byproduct”.The FT has yet to confirm whether the winner has ever been chosen by a monkey. Maybe the next time."
614;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-02-24T13:16:16Z;Netflix / Comcast: strange bedfellows;Relationships between Netflix and cable companies remain in flux;It’s easier to cheer for David than Goliath. That doesn’t make David right. On Sunday, Netflix and Comcast said they would establish “a more direct connection between Netflix and Comcast”. That is, Netflix will pay Comcast to ensure its video data moves faster.So, the disruptive content provider (yay!) is squeezed by the cable monopolist (boo!). Consumers root for the upstart – $7.99 a month is cheap for the wide, if slightly second-rate, slate of programming it delivers so conveniently, especially next to that $80 cable television package. But look at it another way: Comcast and its peers have invested billions in the infrastructure that makes fast internet possible (yay!) and Netflix free rides on that infrastructure (boo!), which is why it can charge its 32m US subscribers so little each month. Or how about this possibility: Comcast and Netflix have formed a cosy arrangement (boo x 2!). Comcast cuts Netflix a good deal, and Netflix keeps quiet as Comcast pushes its Time Warner Cable merger past the authorities.Because no financial details about the deal are available, interpretations proliferate. One thing is dead certain, though: the relationship between Netflix and the cable companies will remain fractious and in flux. Each side has problems to resolve. Netflix, with $3.6bn of revenue in 2013, had net income of $17m and negative free cash flow. It hasn’t shown that buying and producing content, then selling it at the current price, is a sustainable business. It needs to raise prices or add a lot more subscribers. It will fight to avoid the former and, if it does the latter, the pressure on cable companies’ TV businesses will increase. The cable companies, in turn, will need to charge Netflix or its customers still more for the growing stream of video traffic. Cheer for whom you like, and be assured: there is plenty of fighting still to come.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
615;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-02-24T00:41:29Z;Netflix to pay Comcast for better speeds;Faster streaming for cable operator customers;Netflix and Comcast have struck a landmark agreement for internet providers and content distribution companies, with Netflix agreeing to pay to ensure faster, smoother access to its library of programming for Comcast customers.Netflix is paying Comcast – which is in negotiations to buy Time Warner Cable in a $45bn deal – to attach “caching boxes”, or servers that can be deployed in local data centres, to the cable company’s broadband network, accelerating access speeds for Netflix customers.Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal follows last month’s court victory by Verizon, the telecoms group, over the Federal Communications Commission. A US court ruled that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing so-called “net neutrality principles”.The ruling could clear the way for internet providers to charge fees to companies that send large amounts of data across their networks.The FCC said last week, however, that it planned to issue new rules in an attempt to prevent internet service providers from striking special deals with content companies for better delivery.The net neutrality principles have ensured that telecoms groups and internet providers charge the same rates to data and content providers regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.Netflix content accounts for about 30 per cent of downstream traffic in the US during peak periods and is among the companies which could be targeted.Netflix said the deal with Comcast, one of America’s largest broadband providers, was unrelated to the net neutrality ruling.The agreement was a “peering” deal, the company said on Sunday. “Netflix is not receiving preferential network treatment. This type of interconnection is common in the industry. What we want to do is give customers really good service so their stream is not getting buffered or slowing down.”The company already pays content delivery networks, such as Akamai, for access to larger broadband networks operated by the likes of Comcast. Under the deal struck with Comcast, Netflix will cut out the middleman and pay Comcast instead.The move to pay Comcast to take up Netflix’s “Open Connect” service comes as Netflix has been offering the service for free to European internet providers, such as Virgin Media.Following the deal, the company is likely to have to pay other large US internet providers to take up the service, said a person familiar with the matter.
616;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Amazon finds less passionate name for Lovefilm streaming service;;Was it too passionate, too patronising – or just not quite as catchy as Netflix?Whatever the reason, Amazon has decided to ditch Lovefilm as the name of its European movie streaming service, three years after it bought the company for £200m.The new identity is as enticing as an Excel spreadsheet: Prime Instant Video.It may also be overly optimistic – given the speed of British broadband connections, “calling anything instant and video is risky”, notes one observer.Nonetheless, the name change reveals an aggressive new strategy by Amazon, which now has fewer streaming customers in the UK than Netflix.The ecommerce group wants subscribers of its two-day delivery service Prime to buy Lovefilm and vice versa.That looks like a good deal for customers of Lovefilm, who currently pay about £72 a year and can now choose whether or not to pay an extra £7 for express delivery.But customers of Amazon Prime will see their next annual bill rise from £49 to the “low price” of £79, whether they want Lovefilm or not.If this bundling works, Amazon will “sidestep direct competition with subscription video rivals [such as Netflix] and bolster uptake of the Amazon Prime subscription service”, said Richard Broughton, an analyst at IHS, a research company.2004 Founded as an online DVD rental business, before launching a streaming service a year later2006 Merges with the less excitingly named Video Island and ScreenSelect, giving the combined company about one-fifth of the UK’s market for DVD rentals2008 Acquires Amazon Europe’s DVD rental business, in a deal which makes Jeff Bezos’ ecommerce company a major shareholder2011 In the year it reports a maiden profit, Lovefilm is bought by Amazon for £200m, scotching hopes of a big tech IPO on London’s Stock Exchange2014 The brand becomes DVD-only once more, after Amazon’s European streaming service is renamed Amazon Prime InstantMeanwhile, for Lovefilm, once a darling of London’s tech scene, this is pretty much the end of the road.The brand already survived one near miss – before selling out to Amazon, the company merged with larger rival ScreenSelect (founded by Alex Chesterman, now of property website Zoopla).Lovefilm will remain the name of Amazon’s DVD rental business, but most attention will switch to Amazon Prime Instant Video.Ian Maude, of Enders Analysis, said: “Amazon is a much stronger consumer brand.”For newcomers to streaming subscriptions, the price of Prime Instant Video may or may not look enticing.The £79-a-year pricetag compares unfavourably with Prime Instant Video’s cost in the US ($79 a year), but it is only slightly more than the annual cost of Netflix in the UK (£72, excluding free trial).Given its aggressive approach, perhaps the service should simply have been called LoveAmazon.
617;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:32+0000;FCC plans new rules to free web traffic;Proposals follow adverse court decision;The US Federal Communications Commission will propose new “net neutrality” rules, prohibiting internet service providers from charging companies such as Netflix or YouTube to reach consumers at higher speeds or quality.The proposals comes just one month after a US court ruled the agency had over-reached in its powers in that area.The new measures would prevent internet service providers from striking special deals with content companies for better delivery. The rules would also prevent broadband services from blocking access to websites and discriminating against content providers.The proposals are part of the FCC’s effort to require internet service providers to treat all traffic equally, in what is known as net neutrality, a principal which was dealt a blow in a case brought by Verizon Communications to challenge the agency.The court, however, upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate some aspects of internet service provider practices, including requiring them to disclose how they manage traffic. The agency is using that authority to issue the new rules.A US court ruled in January that the Federal Communications Commission over-reached its powers in imposing “net neutrality” rules on internet service providers.Continue reading“Preserving the Internet as an open platform for innovation and expression while providing certainty and predictability in the marketplace is an important responsibility of this agency,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said.After the court ruling last month, the FCC said it would consider its options, including an appeal.But on Wednesday, the agency said it would not pursue additional legal action, and would continue to consider whether it could move to reclassify internet access as a telecommunications service – which the FCC could use to impose its internet rules.“The proposed FCC actions would enhance transparency for consumers so they know if and when their internet service provider is slowing down or blocking online content,” said Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, who co-sponsored a bill to restore the net neutrality rules after the court decision.FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai was critical of the agency’s move, saying “net neutrality has always been a solution in search of a problem”.“The internet was free and open before the FCC adopted net neutrality rules,” he said. “It remains free and open today“.The growing power of internet service providers is one of the concerns expressed by critics of Comcast’s $45.2bn bid for Time Warner Cable. Comcast has offered to extend net neutrality rules to TWC customers, as part of its efforts to win regulatory approval.“FCC chairman Wheeler has taken a thoughtful approach which creates a path for enforceable rules based on the appropriate authority outlined by the Court’s findings,” said David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice-president, who is in charge of guiding the TWC deal through the regulatory process. “We continue to be committed to work with Chairman Wheeler and the commission to play a constructive role going forward that will continue to allow the Internet to flourish.”The FCC will seek public comment and is aiming to finalise the rules in the next three months at the earliest.
618;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-02-17T18:57:52Z;Television: More power to the cord;Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable is raising consumer concerns over broadband pricing;Marshall Maher is wreaking havoc on the media business. The 38-year-old Manhattan marketing executive is an avid television watcher. He is a fan of the Netflix original political drama House of Cards, keeps up with the HBO series True Detective and calls Sunday Morning, the weekly news programme on broadcaster CBS, “like church for me.”But Mr Maher has not paid for a traditional television subscription for two years. After subscribing to a Time Warner Cable video package for several years, he cancelled the service, cutting his bill from about $140 a month to the $45 he pays the cable operator for high-speed internet.While the cable company used to provide him with CNN, sports network ESPN and dozens of other channels as part of the monthly package, Mr Maher has customised his own programming menu. He is able to watch the programmes he wants to watch when he wants to watch them using a Google Chromecast digital media player, an $8 a month Netflix subscription, the Amazon Prime streaming service, his parents’ password for the HBO GO TV app and a digital antenna for free, over-the-air broadcasts.“The proliferation of options just started to reach a tipping point,” he says. “There just seemed to be so many tools that you could use to cobble together a similar or even better experience without all the fat. I’m opting out of a broken system.”Mr Maher is not the only one. In the past two years, about 1.4m customers cut their video subscription with Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable operator in the US. Millions more have cancelled their video services with other providers. These so-called cord cutters, along with a broader transformation in how people watch television, are a growing threat to the foundations of the media industry, upsetting the balance of power between television distributors, programmers and viewers.Last week, Comcast, the cable industry leader, made a move to win that power back, announcing a $45bn deal to acquire Time Warner Cable. The combination of the top two US cable operators would control about a third of the country’s video and broadband customers. It is expected to face close regulatory scrutiny.The tie-up could help the cable group regain leverage over programmers, which have seen the value of their content surge with the proliferation of new outlets such as Netflix. It would also give it a national platform to create a stronger competitor to Netflix and Amazon, as well as more control over the broadband networks that the online streaming services need.The companies are all fighting to secure their piece of the $143bn US television market and $387bn global television market for today and the future. The fallout is likely to have broad ramifications on TV and internet innovation in the US that are likely to ripple across the world.“The world changes very rapidly with technology. Over the last 25 years we’ve seen that, and it’s accelerating its pace of change,” Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said last week. “Our company wants to evolve and help lead that change. I think we’re uniquely in a position to do that and to accelerate.”Consumer advocates fear that a Comcast-Time Warner Cable tie-up would place too much power in the hands of one company. (Comcast also owns NBCUniversal, the entertainment group.) They fear that the combined company would push up the prices of video and broadband services and exert more control over television networks and internet connectivity speeds.Some analysts question whether the deal as it is currently structured would receive the green light from regulators. Already, some lawmakers have expressed caution.“Of course, the threshold question must be whether the creation of an even larger video and broadband juggernaut results in greater choice and lower rates for consumers. This has not been my experience with previous mergers of this size,” says Senator John Rockefeller, chairman of the commerce committee.When Mr Roberts’s father Ralph Roberts founded the company in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1963, the cable industry comprised tens of thousands of local franchises that did not overlap. The technical infrastructure required to lay cables meant that cable operators were the only show in town for people who wanted to pay for television subscriptions.The cable industry gradually consolidated. Comcast emerged as the largest, amassing almost 22m video subscribers. But the cable companies retained their monopolistic hold over local regions, barely competing in the same towns and cities. Comcast and Time Warner Cable, for instance, do not operate in any of the same postcodes across the US.That dynamic has changed. Cable companies now face competition from satellite providers, such as Dish and DirecTV, and telecoms, such as Verizon and AT&T, that are now offering video. At the same time, the cable companies are battling the rise of cord cutters.That rivalry has been a boon for television programmers. Each new television service is seeking to lure customers with an ever more robust line-up of programming, increasing the demand for quality content. Programmers are telling distributors to pay up.Content costs for distributors are soaring, increasing 8.9 per cent across the cable industry in the third quarter, according to Nomura. This is putting pressure on the profit margins of cable operators, which are raising subscription rates and emphasising broadband to keep growing.“This is the golden age for content companies that have the best programming,” said Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, the media group, which last week announced that its revenues rose 8 per cent in 2013. Record growth was fuelled through digital streaming deals and international syndication, among other sources.People are watching more television than before, but not just on a couch with a remote control in hand. The average American spends a total of 37.9 hours a week – or more than 1.5 days – watching video on traditional televisions, the internet and mobile phones, according to Nielsen, the measurement group.“The good news is that we are just beginning to find a whole new set of ways to monetise our programming on new platforms” such as Amazon, Netflix and Hulu, Mr Moonves said.…The benefits of the new internet platforms for traditional programmers are neatly demonstrated by a decision CBS took in 2009. The company shocked the media world when it pulled Without a Trace, the successful police drama, from its primetime line-up.The programme, which followed a missing persons unit, was attracting viewers and making money. Yet costs for the show, then in its eighth year, were almost $4m an episode. And CBS owned just half of the programme, which meant it made less money on syndication deals.So CBS pulled Without a Trace and slotted in The Good Wife, a new legal and political drama series that cost just $2m an episode – and CBS owned 100 per cent of it.If The Good Wife could attract comparable ratings, CBS executives would have a more profitable asset on their hands that would continue delivering revenues for years to come.The bet paid off, but in more ways than most television executives imagined in 2009. At the time, the market for digital video had just started taking off. Netflix had launched its streaming service but it was largely a perk for its DVD subscribers. Amazon had yet to launch a rival streaming service. Apple’s iPad tablet had yet to hit the market.Today, CBS makes money on the programme on traditional television and a web of digital outlets. The Good Wife attracts millions of viewers each week for its traditional television broadcast. CBS also streams the programme via its mobile app and sells the rights to subscription video and on-demand services, including Amazon and Hulu Plus, a basic cable network, local broadcasters and international distributors.“A hit show for us goes on forever and continues to pay dividends,” said Joe Ianniello, chief operating officer at CBS. “It’s like a snowball rolling down the hill.”Cable companies and other distributors are now trying to keep that snowball from turning into an avalanche.“The history of the business is replete with the industry solving its Balkanisation and scale problem through joint effort. I think it can be done again,” said Liberty Media’s John Malone, who led a wave of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s. (Liberty backed a hostile offer from Charter Communications to acquire Time Warner Cable until it was trumped by Comcast last week.)Television distributors and programmers historically worked together to promote industry growth. But cable groups and programmers have fought increasingly frequent public battles over the rising price of content.…Last summer, a battle between Time Warner Cable and CBS led to the channel going dark for millions of customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas for about a month. Time Warner Cable lost 306,000 of its 11.7m residential video customers. It was one of more than 80 broadcaster blackouts in the past two years.“The water is boiling now,” said Todd Juenger, a media industry analyst with Bernstein Research.Industry executives say cable companies could have far greater bargaining power with programmers if they had a near-national US footprint, as Comcast-Time Warner Cable would. Comcast executives play this down, saying only a “distinct minority” of the $1.5bn in savings expected would stem from programming costs.Scale would also help the company develop technologies to compete with digital, satellite TV and phone companies – and stem the advance of the cord cutters. Comcast now offers Streampix, a streaming service at $4.99 a month, that offers unlimited access to television programmes and films on TV, tablets and smartphones.“They should be able to create a far more serious competitor,” said Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research.But Mr Greenfield cautions that regulators might seek to limit Comcast’s ability to compete with rivals such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Some cord cutters worry that a Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal will lead to higher prices, fewer options and bad customer service. In an industry with a reputation for dismal service, Comcast and Time Warner Cable rank at the bottom of customer satisfaction studies.“When two giant companies merge, in particular these two, I don’t think it has got to do with delivering better, more efficient programming to customers,” Mr Maher adds.——————————————-Broadband speeds: US pays more for slower online accessIn the US, customers are paying higher prices for internet speeds that fall far behind other countries across the globe.Comcast subscribers in San Francisco, for instance, in 2013 paid $114.95 a month for download speeds of 105 megabits per second. By comparison, in Seoul, the South Korean capital, people paid $31.47 for download speeds of 1,000 megabits per second, according to the New America Foundation.Industry observers attribute the slow speeds and higher prices to a relative lack of competition for broadband.In many US markets, consumers have few choices for a provider other than their local cable operator. Research shows that in markets where more companies offer competing services – such as Kansas City, where Google is deploying a new fibre broadband project – prices drop and speeds increase.As cable operators face dwindling numbers of video subscribers, they are becoming increasingly reliant on their broadband businesses, with many increasing prices.“Many American consumers take high prices and slow speeds to be a given, but our data demonstrates that it is possible to have faster, more affordable connectivity in cities of comparable density and size,” the New America Foundation said in a recent report.“Our data also shows that the most affordable and fast connections are available in markets where consumers can choose between at least three competitive service providers.”The worry among consumer advocates is that a combination of Comcast and Time Warner Cable will reduce competition, not increase it. They also express concern that an industry behemoth would start charging more for access to the web, impose usage caps and slow speeds for online streaming outlets such as Netflix and Amazon.John Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, says: “At a time when the future of video is increasingly online, policy makers have to weigh very carefully the ability of big companies to leverage their control of the internet to shape how Americans access and receive content and to limit new consumer-centric video services.”
619;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Gap jumps on higher earnings hopes;US retailer records stronger than expected sales in January;Gap shares rose at their fastest pace in three months on Friday as the US retailer lifted its earnings expectations and recorded stronger than expected sales in January.The owner of Banana Republic and Old Navy said it now forecast quarterly earnings between 65 cents and 66 cents per share, ahead of guidance set last year. Gap benefited from a 1 per cent advance in same-store sales in the first month of the year, compared to Wall Street forecasts for a 1.1 per cent decline.Sales at Gap and Old Navy, the company’s two largest brands, were both up on the same month last year, while Banana Republic logged a 10 per cent drop.Glenn Murphy, the chief executive of Gap, said January’s gains left the company’s quarterly same-store sales up for the eighth consecutive quarter.“Management originally expected it to be difficult to lever expenses given the loss of the 53rd week, but was able to do so from disciplined expense control,” UBS analyst Roxanne Meyer said, referring to the change in Gap’s fiscal calendar.Gap rose 5.8 per cent to $42 at the close of New York trading.Expedia shares climbed 14.3 per cent to $74.45 to lead the benchmark S&P 500 as profits jumped 14-fold to $94.7m, or 70 cents per diluted share, in the three months to December.The company said its acquisition of Trivago, the German travel search engine, last year was paying dividends, with sales in the division rising 85 per cent from a year earlier.Net sales at Expedia, which also operates the Hotwire and Hotels.com websites, rose 18 per cent from a year earlier to $1.2bn, as hotel bookings grew 25 per cent.Analysts at more than a dozen investment banks lifted their price targets on the company, with Evercore analyst Ken Sena noting the company saw improvements across geographies.“Strong bookings performance driven by the lower-margin air business and traction within the Expedia Traveler Preference programme resulted in strong bookings trends,” Mr Sena said. “In addition, strength across brands and stability within Hotwire led to a seemingly brighter outlook on the business.”Travel booking site TripAdvisor jumped 9.5 per cent to $84.45 following Expedia’s results, while Priceline climbed 5 per cent to $1,195.Netflix shares touched an all-time high in afternoon trading as analysts at Stifel Nicolaus upgraded the company to “buy” from “hold”.Analyst Ben Mogil said Netflix would benefit in an increasingly bifurcated environment, particularly among a generation of consumers who are no longer subscribing to cable television.“In an environment where video subscribers are increasingly bipolar in their consumption patterns, Netflix remains a very attractive programming option suited towards both cord-cutters/nevers/shavers as well as heavy video users,” he said.Shares of Netflix rose 5.4 per cent to $429.98 while Mr Mogil set a $475 price target.Insurance provider Cigna weighed on equity markets, falling 9.25 per cent to $77.47 as profits slid 11 per cent from a year earlier. The company said net income totalled $361m in its fourth quarter, or $1.29 per share, compared to $406m a year ago.Cigna forecast sales would grow between 4 and 7 per cent this year, shy of Wall Street forecasts.Investors shrugged off a disappointing report from the labour department that showed the US economy added 113,000 jobs in January, below expectations for 180,000.Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey pointed to annual revisions by the agency, which showed the March 2013 employment level was 369,000 higher than earlier thought.“With the annual benchmark revision, there is more strength in the labour market than we thought,” Mr Rupkey said. “The American economy is a veritable jobs-creating machine: 2.1m in 2011, 2.2m in 2012 and 2.3m in 2013.”The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,797.02 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.06 per cent to 15,794.08. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite index advanced 1.7 per cent to 4,125.86.

He said that the subscriptions are complementary. “If you look at Netflix, viewing is higher in HBO homes, and HBO viewing is higher in Netflix homes,” he said. “So those are add ons.”He noted that the network won 27 primetime Emmy awards, the most of any network for the twelfth year in a row and with Cinemax added 2m US subscribers in 2013, the biggest increase in 17 years. “HBO remains in a league of its own.”But the network isn’t standing still. Said Mr Bewkes: “HBO’s going to up the ante again in 2014, increasing its original series hours and investment in original programming.”Here’s a breakdown of the battle, by the numbers:US SUBSCRIBERSHBO: 28.5mNetflix: 33.4GLOBAL SUBSCRIBERSHBO: More than 130m (combined with Cinemax)Netflix: 44mREVENUESHBO: $4.9bn in 2013, up 4 per centNetflix: $4.4bn in 2013, up 21 per cent*PROFITSHBO: $1.7bn in operating income in 2013, up 8 per centNetflix: $228.3m in operating income, up 356 per cent*Companies likely use different accounting principles
621;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Comcast records rise in subscribers;;Comcast, the largest US cable operator by subscribers, had an increase in video subscribers during the fourth quarter, bucking a six and a half year trend of losses.The company added 43,000 video subscribers in the fourth quarter, following investments in its X1 and Xfinity high tech television product, up from a loss of 7,000 video subscribers in the same period the year before. The company also increased its tally of broadband and voice customers.The news is a boon for the cable operator as the industry battles fierce competition for TV services from satellite and telecom operators. They are also challenged by “cord-cutting”, where people cancel pay-television subscriptions and turn to cheaper online streaming alternatives, such as Netflix and Hulu.Yet Comcast’s reversal in the video subscriber losses is not expected to last because it typically faces much bigger declines in the second and third quarters. It is instead focused on losing fewer video customers. In 2013, Comcast lost 305,000 video subscribers, 336,000 in 2012 and 459,000 in 2011.“Comcast’s return to positive video subscriber growth, even if it is only for a single quarter, is an unmistakable sign that their days of losing share to satellite are almost over,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with MoffettNathanson Research.Comcast is making more money off its existing customers. The average monthly total revenue per video customer in 2013 was $159.61, up 16 per cent from $137.51 in 2011.The news came as Comcast reported a 9.9 per cent increase in net income for 2013. Total revenues were $64.7bn in 2013, up 5.8 per cent from 2012 excluding revenues from the Olympics and Super Bowl. The growth was fuelled by its cable group and NBCUniversal entertainment group.During a conference call on Tuesday, Comcast did not discuss its role in consolidation of the fragmented US cable industry.Time Warner Cable, the second-largest US cable operator by subscribers, is facing pressure from some of its largest shareholders to engage with rival Charter about an offer that it deemed “grossly inadequate”. This week news emerged that Comcast had entered discussions with Charter about which assets it might buy should Charter win its battle for Time Warner Cable.Time Warner Cable, which faced record losses in video subscribers in the most recent quarter, reports earnings on Thursday. The company plans to host an extended conference call with its new chief executive to discuss the company’s strategy.
622;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-01-26T20:33:17Z;Change of channel in the air for BSkyB;;"Investors in BSkyB are at an impasse.Britain’s biggest pay-TV operator is delivering solid performance, with sales growing nearly 8 per cent a year and £500m of cash committed to share buybacks.But it is also facing the most serious challenges in its history.Rival BT has spent nearly £2bn on sports rights, while streaming services such as Netflix offer dramas and films.“Pay TV is a fantastic business when it’s a monopoly. It’s not as good when it’s competitive,” says Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Bernstein.For the past two years, Sky has attracted fewer new television customers, and its shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 (see graphic). The proportion of analysts rating the company a ‘ sell’ is at its highest since the year 2000, according to Bloomberg.Ahead of BSkyB’s quarterly results on Thursday, some are suggesting radical action. Here are some of the options that its executives may consider.Join forces with VodafoneIf the potential for new TV subscribers is limited, Sky could opt to sell its existing customers more products – such as mobile phone contracts.Virgin Media and TalkTalk offer mobile phone contracts with broadband and television packages; BT is following suit with a big push this year.The market is at an early phase, but there are potential advantages for customers. “What you want is seamless transmission of data inside and outside the home,” says Polo Tang, an analyst at UBS.That has led to speculation that Sky and Vodafone might join forces, either via an agreement that lets Sky use Vodafone’s mobile networks, or a full merger of the two companies.It is thought unlikely that Vodafone, whose UK revenues are £5bn a year, would try to buy BSkyB, whose market capitalisation is more than double that.For the mobile phone group, it would be “like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut”, says Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg.However, the two companies could start cross-marketing their products. Already, Sky’s sports channels are available to customers of Vodafone.Contrary to media reports, no high-level meetings have taken place, said people close to the two companies, and Sky might wait to see whether BT’s mobile offering delivers before going down a similar path.Accept a takeover by FoxThe phone-hacking scandal in 2011 capsized an attempt by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, Sky’s largest shareholder with a 39.1 per cent stake, to buy the company outright.There is speculation that 21st Century Fox could resurrect the move.That would give Fox operational control and allow it to take cash generated by BSkyB directly, rather than through dividends.“The current way in which they hold the stake is not terribly attractive for them,” says Mr Aspesi of Bernstein.21st Century Fox also owns all of Sky Italia and a majority stake in Sky Deutschland, so it could consolidate the three businesses into Sky Europe.The scale of the combined entity would facilitate bidding for sports rights and investment in new online services, helping to compete with Netflix, Amazon and others.Fox had discussed the possibility with its shareholders, James Murdoch, the deputy chief operating officer, said last year.Two factors could accelerate a bid by Fox.First, Sky’s market capitalisation fell £1bn after the loss of Champions League rights to BT.Second, the political environment may be more hostile in the UK after the 2015 general election.“Sky’s valuation is so dependent on the outcome of the [2015 Premier League rights] auction that the rational thing for Fox to do is to wait until that outcome is known,” wrote Credit Suisse analysts in a note to clients.Moreover, in creating Sky Europe, Fox may face opposition from BSkyB investors who may not welcome exposure to Italy, where pay-TV subscriber numbers have fallen.Sign a wholesale deal with BTFor years, Sky’s trump cards have been premier sports and entertainment. But now that BT has a similar hand, the company might have to rethink its strategy.A wholesale deal with BT – with each company making its channels available through the other’s packages – could remove the risk of spiralling sports rights inflation.Jeremy Darroch, Sky’s chief executive, said he would sign a deal if it was at the right price and encompassed all of BT’s sports content.Yet privately he may still believe that Sky can outlast and outbid BT, thereby regaining its dominant position.Others argue that the negotiating leverage is with BT, which can wait until after the 2015 Premier League auction before deciding at what price to sell its channels to Sky.Start a price war with BTDespite losing the Champions League rights, Sky says it is committed to increasing prices for its subscribers.There is an alternative – offering cheap broadband and line rental to threaten BT’s core business.The prospect of a price war could dissuade BT from upping the ante in the next Premier League auction, which analysts expect could see bids of more than £1bn a year.Alternatively, Sky could bid very aggressively in the auction.“Sky could justify £1.6bn [a year, for six of the seven packs of games] if this forced BT out of the wholesale content market,” wrote Credit Suisse analysts.Yet any short-term sacrifice, whether in the form of a price war or a high bid for Premier League rights, might undermine the bullish argument for BSkyB’s shares, namely that the broadcaster generates solid revenue growth.ConclusionOf all the options, an acquisition by Vodafone and a telecoms price war with BT appear the least likely.Other moves, such as a so-called quadplay offering that also includes mobile services and the creation of Sky Europe, would appear to have clear benefits.So far Sky’s management has given little hint of a strategic jump. But that does not mean they are not considering one."
623;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-01-23T17:35:49Z;US airlines drop despite profit growth;;US airlines United Continental Holdings and Southwest stumbled on Thursday as earnings season continued its brisk pace and equity markets declined.Shares in United fell as much as 4 per cent to $47.00 before recovering to close at $48.33, after the company said passenger revenue per available seat mile would be flat to 2 per cent in the current quarter.The guidance, from the parent company of United Air Lines, was coupled with the airline’s quarterly results, which showed the carrier swung to a profit of $140m, or 37 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss of $620m a year earlier. Sales increased 7 per cent from a year earlier to $9.3bn in the fourth quarter.Shares in Southwest ended 2.39 per cent lower at $21.25 even after the group reported a 172 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit. Net income increased to $212m, or 30 cents per diluted share, on sales of $4.4bn.The declines on Thursday follow a strong start for the airline sector in 2014, with carriers making up five of the top six performing stocks in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.Nutrition company Herbalife declined on Thursday after Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts sent letters to US regulators calling for an investigation into the company’s business practices.The senator’s questions follow investor Bill Ackman’s contention that Herbalife operates a pyramid scheme, which the company has vigorously denied.“I have seen reports from Massachusetts residents that suggest Herbalife is a pyramid scheme,” Senator Markey wrote in a letter dated Wednesday.Shares tumbled 10.38 per cent to $65.90 following the announcement.US defence company Lockheed Martin fell 3.93 per cent in New York, ending at $150.50 following its quarterly results, which showed the sixth quarter of sales declines.Profits dropped to $488m, or $1.50 a share, for the quarter from $569m, or $1.73, a year earlier. Overall revenues fell to $11.5bn from $12.09bn.The company, which has been trimming costs and jobs as the pockets of its largest customer, the US government, shrink, said it was hit by fewer deliveries of its military jets in the period.Netflix led the S&P 500 on Thursday, after the company reported a sixfold increase in profits in the fourth quarter and a 2.3m increase in domestic subscribers after market close on Wednesday.The streaming movie and television provider said profits rose to $48.4m, or 79 cents per diluted share. Sales increased 24 per cent to $1.2bn in the three months ending December.The domestic subscription gains were at the high end of the company’s earlier guidance and the company said it was seeing improvements in its international operations, which now count more than 10m members. Shares rose 16.48 per cent to $388.72.Union Pacific advanced 3.36 per cent to $174.17 after posting its first rise in volumes for six quarters, helped by more shipments of agriculture, cars and industrial goods. The railroad said it saw signs the US economy was “slowly strengthening”.Chief executive Jack Koraleski said the railroad had been able to pass along higher prices to customers and had growth across most of the goods it moves.Profits at the largest US railroad rose 13 per cent from a year earlier to $1.2bn, or $2.55 a share, topping Wall Street forecasts. Sales increased 7 per cent from a year ago to $5.6bn.Overall, US markets declined sharply on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 more than 1 per cent lower since the year began. A report from the labour department showed initial jobless claims rose 1,000 from a week earlier to 326,000, while existing home sales climbed by a better than expected 1 per cent in December.“Both series indicate an economy that is doing quite well, almost at normal levels,” Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey said. “The only concern is the sudden loss of emergency unemployment benefits.”The S&P 500 fell 0.89 per cent to 1,828.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.07 per cent to 16,197.35, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.57 per cent to 4,218.87.
624;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-01-22T23:30:39Z;Netflix subscriber numbers surge;Hastings says will ‘vigorously protest’ internet provider fees;Netflix shares spiked more than 17 per cent in after market trading when the film and television streaming service reported increased US subscriber numbers at the high end of expectations.The company, which recently scored its first Golden Globes victory, when Robin Wright won for her performance in House of Cards, also said it was eyeing new European markets after successful launches in other international territories.Netflix total subscribers increased to 44m, with 2.3m added in the US in the fourth quarter – about 300,000 more than the midpoint of the company’s guidance. Internationally, Netflix added 1.74m new subscribers.“We plan later this year to embark on a substantial European expansion,” wrote Reed Hastings, chief executive, in his quarterly letter to shareholders, adding that there was a “big international opportunity for Netflix”.Netflix suffered a recent setback when Verizon, the US telecoms group, won a landmark case against the Federal Communications Commission. A US court ruled earlier this month that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing so-called “ net neutrality” principles.The court ruling could clear the way for online video operators to be charged for the data streamed by consumers on high-speed lines: Netflix content is responsible for about 30 per cent of downstream traffic in the US during peak periods and is among the companies which could be targeted.Mr Hastings acknowledged the possibility of internet providers attempting to hit Netflix with fees, which he said the company would resist.“There are some draconian scenarios where ISPs block Netflix . . . we think that is very unlikely,” he told an investor call. “If major ISPs were to block Netflix or other services it would fuel the fire for other regulation. In the short term it’s very likely there will be no change.”In his letter to shareholders, he said the company would “vigorously protest” and “encourage our members to demand the open internet they are paying their ISP to deliver” if internet providers blocked Netflix video streams.Netflix has held its lead in online video despite the emergence of new competitors. Mr Hastings said much of the company’s growth could be attributed to the “tailwind” of internet video, pointing to Hulu – the online video site owned by Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox and NBCUniversal – increasing paid subscribers by 65 per cent, despite having three chief executives in 2013.There was “lots of activity, which may affect us on the margin,” he added, pointing to Verizon’s recent purchase of Intel’s fledgling online video platform as well as Sony’s plans to launch an online video system.Netflix’s revenues for the three months to December 31 rose 24 per cent to $1.2bn, from $945.2m in the same period last time. Net income increased to $48.4m from $31.8m. Earnings per share were 79 cents, compared with 52 cents previously.The shares leapt 17 per cent to $390.5 after the market close, valuing the company at almost $20bn.
625;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-01-22T23:16:03Z;Netflix: calling the tune;As with the radio site Pandora, competition will slow, rather than destroy, the film and TV service;"To divine the future of Netflix, think about music rather than video. Netflix is proceeding nicely; it said on Wednesday it had added a better than expected 2.3m subscribers in the US, sending its shares up 17 per cent in late trading.Headlines have been dominated, however, by copycats such as Verizon, Amazon, and Sony, which are unveiling rival internet television services. The scrum in TV looks strikingly similar to last year’s tussle in internet radio. Pandora, the pioneer in streaming music, was pronounced dead repeatedly as deep-pocketed rivals including Apple, Google, and Spotify were expected to overwhelm it. But a funny thing happened: Pandora’s market share grew (it has 70 per cent of internet radio) and its stock price has surged more than 250 per cent since the start of 2013.This week Verizon announced it was buying Intel’s digital TV service, OnCue. Amazon has been rumoured to be negotiating with cable channels for its own TV service. Sony and Apple also lurk. These services want to offer programming across devices. The challenge for the upstarts is to build an interface that consumers can easily navigate and to acquire the programmes they want to watch.Pandora’s success is two-pronged. First, its listeners appreciate the algorithm that determines playlists. Second, its 70m users give it unique leverage with carmakers and electronics manufacturers that embed Pandora in cars and TVs. Similarly, Netflix has a large subscriber base (44m worldwide) that often prefers it for its original programming, such as House of Cards.The question is how competition will slow, rather than destroy, Netflix and Pandora. Both trade above 85 times 2014 earnings, reflecting how their entrenched positions are expected to translate into eventual earnings growth. For now, investors have agreed that first mover means first place.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
626;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
627;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-01-16T11:08:11Z;Internet ruling threatens extra costs for Netflix and YouTube;;Online video viewing has become so pervasive that two companies – Netflix and YouTube – are now responsible for more than half of all US downstream internet traffic in peak periods.The growth of these video services – Netflix now has about 30m US subscribers – has not gone unnoticed by telecoms and cable groups, such as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast, which supply the bulk of internet access in the US.This week, Verizon won a landmark case against the Federal Communications Commission, when a US court ruled that the regulator had over-reached its powers in enforcing so-called “net neutrality” principles. Net neutrality has, until now, ensured that telecoms groups charge the same rates to data and content providers regardless of the amount of data being downloaded or streamed.However, the court ruling could clear the way for online video operators to be charged for the data streamed by consumers on high-speed lines.Whether the internet providers will charge for this access – and hit Netflix and other video providers in the pocket – is up for debate. Netflix declined to comment, but the company, which accounts for about 30 per cent of downstream traffic in the US during peak periods, may find that its popularity with US viewers protects it from unwanted extra costs.The company’s subscription service and its portfolio of original programming – such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black – have won critical acclaim and driven subscriptions. Netflix shares have also recovered strongly following a rocky 2012, more than tripling in value during 2013.Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, said it would be “irrational” for an internet service provider to hit Netflix with charges. Broadband revenues are being driven by strong subscriber growth, he wrote in a research note. They [Verizon] wouldn’t have spent all this money if they didn’t think they could get 5 to 10 per cent revenue growth by charging the people who put data into their pipes. And the biggest data hogs are the video guys“When you look at what consumers are doing with their fatter, faster broadband pipes, you find two key services: Netflix and YouTube.” Mr Greenfield said. “If an ISP said to Netflix ‘pay us for access to our broadband customers or we will slow you down’, and Netflix refuses to pay, the ISP ends up hurting its own customers – and discouraging those subscribers from using the service that is driving them to pay for faster broadband speed tiers in the first place.”But not everyone agrees that the court ruling poses no threat. “Verizon spent tens of millions of dollars on this case,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “They wouldn’t have spent all this money if they didn’t think they could get 5 to 10 per cent revenue growth by charging the people who put data into their pipes. And the biggest data hogs are the video guys.”He expects internet providers to “extract” a fee per gigabyte of data transmitted. “It should mean higher payments by Netflix [to internet providers] and/or higher payments by Netflix subscribers.”Netflix shares fell slightly on Wednesday as investors absorbed the impact of the court ruling, while shares in Verizon and Comcast both rose.Netflix has been working behind the scenes to take pressure off high-speed lines and improve the definition and quality of its video streams. Last year, it began offering cable and telecoms providers “caching boxes” – servers that can be deployed in local data centres and used to cache Netflix programming. These boxes, part of a programme dubbed Open Connect, make it easier to stream higher definition content and reduce the amount of data coursing over high-speed networks. Virgin Media and BT are using the programme in the UK. In the US, Netflix is in discussions with operators, but it is unclear which – if any – will sign up.Netflix and Google are not the only companies supplying large amounts of data to internet users. The Internet Association represents several companies that could also be affected by the challenge to net neutrality – including Facebook – and has taken a tough stance over new charges. Michael Beckerman, its chief executive, warned in a statement that the internet was “an amazing platform” which “should not be taken for granted”.He said member companies supported “enforceable rules that ensure an open internet, free from government control or discriminatory, anti-competitive actions by gatekeepers”.
628;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2014-01-09T09:06:46Z;Digital film sales resuscitate Hollywood revenue stream;;Digital purchases of movies are increasing so rapidly they will have eclipsed slumping DVD sales by the end of 2014, returning Hollywood’s most important revenue stream to growth, according to one of the largest film studios.Mike Dunn, president of 20th Century Fox home entertainment, told the Financial Times that digital sales were rising each quarter thanks to “early windowing” – releasing films to buy online before they are made available on DVD and Blu-ray.The industry-wide decline in DVD sales has hit Hollywood hard over the past seven years. The big studios – Walt Disney, Universal, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Warner Brothers and Fox – are making fewer movies as a consequence of the decline and trying to rein in production and marketing budgets.But digital sales are increasing fast enough to offset the fall. “I think it will tip this year,” said Mr Dunn.Digital purchases of films rose 50 per cent in 2013 compared with 2012 according to a report released this week by the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents movie studios, retailers and technology groups.New players have joined a market which has been dominated by Apple’s iTunes, boosting sales, the report said. Comcast, the world’s largest cable operator, and Target, the US retailer, launched digital movie services during the year, in which the best-selling titles included Despicable Me 2, Twilight: Breaking Dawn and Wreck-It Ralph. “Comcast has made a meaningful difference,” said Mr Dunn.Digital spending on movies rose to $1bn in 2013, which continues to represent a small fraction of total US spending on home entertainment. Consumers spent $18.2bn on movies to watch in the home during the year, down from the 2004 peak when they spent almost $22bn.The low cost of producing DVDs made them Hollywood’s highest margin business for close to a decade, fuelling a production boom and spiralling salaries for top stars. When sales began to fall studio profits were hit: the industry’s move to Blu-ray, a higher-definition format, stemmed some of the decline and growth in new services, such as video-on-demand, has also helped.However, nothing has grown as rapidly as digital distribution, which has gathered momentum since studios began making movies available to buy online before their release on Blu-ray. “Home entertainment is so critical for Hollywood that if this space shows growth it changes everything,” said Mr Dunn.“Consumers have responded positively to studios introducing early windowing and cloud storage,” said Dan Cryan, senior analyst with IHS, the media research firm. The growth of subscription services, such as Netflix, were also boosting studio revenues, he added.Hollywood studios have had a big presence at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Several deals have been struck on new distribution formats, such as Comcast, Netflix, Paramount and Amazon agreeing to stream their new high-definition content in the 4K format to Samsung’s new range of televisions.
629;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-12-19T00:01:30Z;Baidu and Rakuten strike online video deal;;Viki, the online video service owned by Japanese ecommerce group Rakuten, will this week bring TV shows and movies from around the world to China through a partnership with the country’s largest search engine Baidu.The agreement, which highlights how the internet is changing the way TV content is distributed, gives Viki access to a country that remains untapped by rival streaming sites such as Netflix and YouTube.Under the deal, Viki will bring licensed shows from the US, UK, Japan, Korea and 11 other countries to Baidu Video, China’s largest video site.The content – such as Falling Skies, the science fiction series produced by Steven Spielberg – will be subtitled in both Chinese and English thanks to Viki’s community of volunteer translators.Viki specialises in licensing television content for online distribution outside of the home market. What makes the company unique is that it can provide subtitles in more than 100 languages due to the efforts of its international community of viewers.Under their partnership, Viki and Baidu will share the advertising revenues derived from the videos.Razmig Hovaghimian, Viki’s chief executive and co-founder, said that while TV and film rights holders had traditionally viewed “the long tail” of international markets as relatively unimportant, this was starting to change.“If you open up the rest of the world and get subtitles on it, it’s a massive market,” he said.Mr Hovaghimian said the fourth series of Falling Skies, which is due to be released next summer, will be available for viewing in China within 48 hours of its broadcast in the US.“We also want to take Chinese content to the rest of the world with 150 languages subtitled,” he added.China is the world’s largest video market with 450m online video viewers, or nearly 80 per cent of its internet-connected population, according to Viki.The company, which was acquired by Rakuten in September for an undisclosed sum, said it attracts more than 26m viewers each month and that its community of fans has translated more than 450m words.Online video streaming has become one of the fastest-growing parts of the media sector, with subscription services such as Netflix and advertising-funded services such as Hulu starting to challenge traditional broadcasters.
630;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-12-16T14:11:09Z;Netflix wins rights to air ‘Breaking Bad’ spin-off;;The eagerly awaited spin-off of Breaking Bad, the critically acclaimed cable television series, will air first in big international markets on Netflix in a deal that affirms the new global heft of streaming online video.Netflix has acquired the rights to Better Call Saul from Sony Pictures Television, which produced Breaking Bad, the story of a chemistry teacher turned drugs kingpin. It will screen the spin-off in the UK and Ireland, Scandinavia and Latin America before it is shown on television.Based on the shady lawyer Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul will air first on Netflix in territories where the company’s service is offered. Netflix and SPT declined to comment on the value of the deal, which will be announced on Monday.The agreement has big implications for the international television licensing industry. US-based television producers and studios usually negotiate with international broadcasters on a region by region basis.But Netflix’s global expansion – the company has grown to more than 40m subscribers– and increasing consumer appetite for on-demand, streaming internet video, has changed the market.Netflix will show each episode internationally immediately after its US broadcast. Steve Mosko, president of SPT, said this would help curb piracy. “The odds of it being pirated decrease the closer it is shown to the date that it airs in the US,” he said. “We love the fact that it will stream around the world . . . it will create global attention for the programme.”In the US and Canada, Better Call Saul will air first on AMC, the cable channel that also broadcast SPT’s Breaking Bad. Netflix has the right to screen the new series in the US and Canada after its run on AMC*.Breaking Bad became a knockout commercial and critical hit around the world, winning this year’s Emmy for best drama and inviting comparisons with HBO’s The Sopranos.“It was one of the most sought after properties and the fact that we are able to get Saul . . . shows that over the top [viewing] has arrived,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer for Netflix, referring to streaming services that cut out the need for cable or satellite subscriptions.Netflix shares have tripled this year since the launch of its own original series, such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. The company now competes with top cable channels for the best programming and has helped fuel interest in long-running shows by making older episodes available.In the US, AMC’s ratings for Breaking Bad doubled in its final season thanks to viewers being able to catch up on the show on Netflix.In the UK, Breaking Bad briefly appeared on Channel Five. But when the broadcaster stopped showing the series, Netflix – which had only recently launched in the UK – began airing it, which helped build awareness for the new service and momentum for the programme.* This article has been amended from the original, to reflect the fact that show will not be aired immediately after its US broadcast.
631;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Curtains for Blockbuster’s remaining UK stores;;The final curtain has descended on the UK arm of Blockbuster, the struggling video rental business that entered administration in October.The administrator Moorfields said on Thursday that the last 91 stores are closing and over 800 jobs will be lost.Blockbuster initially went into administration in January as its business model struggled to compete against rivals including Netflix and Lovefilm that allow customers to stream films directly to devices such as televisions and tablets.In March the company was given a second chance after its purchase by Gordon Brothers Group, a US private equity firm. But the failure to secure licensing rights from Dish Network, Blockbuster US’s parent company, for an online service led to the company falling into administration again.A joint statement issued by administrators Simon Thomas and Nick O’Reilly said: “We were unable to secure a buyer for the group as a going concern and as a result had to take the regrettable action to close the remaining stores.”The news comes at the end of a year in which the British high street suffered a series of failures. In January camera retailer Jessops and entertainment products chain HMV collapsed within days of Blockbuster as they also struggled to adapt to online competition. Fashion retailers Republic and Nicole Farhi, as well as shoe retailer Barratts followed later in the year.The last Blockbuster stores will cease trading on December 16 with all remaining stock sold off at up to 90 per cent discount.
632;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-11-26T17:19:46Z;US cable-TV: customer is king;Pay-TV providers need to focus on customer retention;For all the dealmaking hype, cable television remains a consumer product. Remember that as the industry’s latest round of consolidation unfolds. The Time Warner Cable/Charter Communications buyout saga continues, with Comcast diving into the fray, either as enabler or spoiler.With content distributors proliferating (Netflix, Apple, Hulu) and content providers (cable and broadcast networks such as ESPN and CBS) raising prices, cable companies want the industry to shrink to just a few multi-regional players. They may be right. But before piling on the merger debt, pay-TV providers need to consider customer retention.Banks, bonds markets, sovereign wealth funds, equity investors, Liberty Media and bake sales are all reportedly in line to help Charter (enterprise value: $28bn) acquire TWC ($61bn). Comcast ($172bn) could also help Charter by buying bits of TWC that complement its own business. But Comcast, which just bought out all of NBCUniversal from General Electric, may be cautious. Its shares were already up a fifth this year.TWC’s crown jewel is its big (14m) but shrinking customer base. Charter has just 4m subscribers but board member John Malone and chief executive Tom Rutledge believe that their acumen befits a bigger empire. If so, TWC itself should acquire Charter and install the pair as bosses.To understand why this matters, recall Charter’s history. Heavy debt and under-investment led to its 2009 bankruptcy. Mr Malone’s quarter stake in Charter comes from the vultures who bought Charter debt.Perhaps a beefed-up TWC will be able to push back on content costs. If the smaller company buys the larger, however, the result could be another big debt pile, an LBO-like five times the cash flow of the combined company. This could lead to scrimping on service and system upgrades – a precarious move when cable substitutes such as satellite, wireless, internet and fibre optics are increasingly available.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
633;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;PS4 and Xbox vie to dominate living room;;Earlier this year, executives from Sony and Microsoft drew a clear battle line between their two new games consoles: the Xbox One was pitched as an all-in-one entertainment hub while the PlayStation 4 was – in the words of Sony chief Kaz Hirai – “all about the gamers”.That stance marked a reversal from the launch of the two companies’ previous consoles in the mid-2000s, when the PlayStation 3’s Blu-ray drive was almost as big a selling point as its gaming capabilities. Microsoft added support for other video services such as the BBC iPlayer only later in the Xbox 360’s life. Both consoles have subsequently become among the most popular ways to view video streaming services such as Netflix.“The last generation of consoles were a brilliant example of a Trojan horse strategy,” says Dan Cryan, analyst at IHS. “People bought them for the games then realised they could do all this other stuff.”For 2013, Microsoft is putting greater emphasis on the Xbox One’s media capabilities, which include the ability to use its Kinect voice and motion sensor to hop between live cable or satellite channels or search for particular TV shows. “All in one. Input one,” screamed Xbox banners at this summer’s E3 games conference, a reference to Microsoft’s aspiration that its console be the only cable input needed into its customers’ televisions. The Kinect sensor’s infrared transmitter allows it to act as a universal remote control for other living-room devices, such as a speaker system.But in the run-up to this month’s launch of the two consoles, the ground between the two rivals seems to have narrowed.Sony last week responded with its announcement of a range of digital entertainment apps for the PS4, including Amazon’s Instant Video, Hulu Plus and Netflix, as well as its own Music and Video Unlimited services. Up to eight PlayStation owners can chat to each other remotely through its Party mode while watching movies or playing games.Both companies are keen to use the consoles to stake a claim in the living room, which is yet to be dominated by one or two large technology companies as PCs and mobile devices have been.Apple’s long-expected move into television will not arrive until 2014 at the earliest, despite chief executive Tim Cook’s insistence earlier this year that TV was of “intense interest”. For now, its $99 Apple TV box still seems more like a hobby, amid reports that the company is still struggling to secure the content rights it wants.Similarly, growing expectations that Amazon would launch a set-top box akin to the Apple TV or Roku have also failed to materialise in the lead-up to Christmas.“There are a whole raft of advantages that go along with being tied into the biggest TV in the house,” says Mr Cryan. “The TV upgrade cycle is not very fast. If you’re going to try to get widespread penetration [in the living room], a games console is a great way of doing it.”

The agreement, one of Netflix’s biggest bets on original programming, aims to replicate Marvel’s cinematic success: its movies, such as The Avengers and this year’s Iron Man 3, are among the biggest box office hits of recent years.Netflix has commissioned four series – plus a miniseries – based on the Marvel characters Daredevil, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage. Netflix and Disney would not comment on the deal’s value but it is likely to rival the $100m the streaming service paid for two series of its acclaimed House of Cards series.Alan Fine, president of Marvel Entertainment, said the agreement was “unparalleled in scope and size”, adding that the “serialised epic” would expand “the narrative possibilities of on-demand television”.It follows last year’s film distribution agreement between Disney and Netflix, which begins in 2016: under the deal, Netflix will screen all Disney’s live-action and animated movies in the pay TV “window” after their release in cinemas and on DVD.Disney also set a release date of December 18, 2015 for Star Wars: Episode VII – the next instalment in the series, which will be directed by JJ Abrams. “We’ve chosen a date which will allow the creative team to make a great film,” said Bob Iger, chief executive. It is the same date that Avatar, still film’s biggest ever box office hit, was released, he added.At the theme parks, profits were up on increased consumer spending, thanks to a slowly recovering global economy. The release of the animated movie Planes fuelled merchandising sales, with the consumer products division reporting a 30 per cent leap in operating income to $347m. Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer, said Planes had been “an incredible juggernaut” in consumer products.Operating income for the quarter at the cable networks division, which includes the ESPN channel, slipped $95m to $1.3bn – although this was because of a timing shift in the recognition of fees from affiliate partners. With the timing shift stripped out, operating income would have risen by $77m, thanks to higher advertising revenue at ESPN.Disney’s interactive division, which has traditionally struggled to make a profit, ended the quarter in the black due to the release of the Disney Infiniti console game.Revenues across the company for the 12 months to September 28 rose from $42.3bn to $45bn. Net income increased from $6.2bn to $6.3bn. In the final quarter, revenues rose from $10.8bn to $11.6bn, while net income rose from $1.24bn to $1.39bn.Full-year earnings per share rose from $3.13 to $3.38; in the quarter they increased from 66 cents to 77 cents.Disney shares fell 2.1 per cent in after-hours trading to $65.75."
635;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-11-07T17:49:46Z;Netflix teams up with Marvel for superheroes series;;"Netflix has made one of its biggest bets yet on original programming after striking a four-series deal to develop shows based on superhero characters created by Walt Disney’s Marvel Entertainment division.Demand for original programming, such as its acclaimed House of Cards series, has fuelled a sharp increase in Netflix shares, which have tripled since the beginning of 2013.The company has commissioned four series – plus a miniseries – based on the Marvel characters Daredevil, Iron Fist, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage. Netflix and Disney would not comment on the deal’s value, but it is likely to rival the $100m Netflix paid for two series of House of Cards.Alan Fine, president of Marvel Entertainment, said the agreement was “unparalleled in scope and size”. He added that the “serialised epic” would expand “the narrative possibilities of on-demand television”.Its foray into original programming has allowed Netflix, which streams films and television shows, to compete with big pay-TV channels, such as Time Warner’s HBO, for the best content.Netflix recently revealed it had surpassed 40m subscribers globally. Its growth comes as the number of people subscribing to cable television services has taken a hit, with many younger customers “cutting the cord” and cancelling their subscriptions in favour of cheaper, online alternatives such as Netflix and Hulu. Cable, satellite and telecoms companies that offer pay-TV services lost a combined 200,000 subscribers in the most recent quarter.Cable operators suffered the most, losing more than 600,000 subscribers, according to a report by SNL Kagan, but that was offset by subscriber gains for satellite and telecoms. Telecoms companies, such as Verizon, are taking market share from cable TV operators.The Disney deal comes as Netflix’s rivals intensify their own efforts in original programming. Amazon is investing about $100m in original shows this year, including Alpha House, a political comedy written by Garry Trudeau, author of the Doonesbury comic strip.Amazon has bundled access to its original shows and library movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime, its $79 premium shipping service. It will spend about $1bn on content this year; Netflix, by contrast, will spend an estimated $2.5bn, with about $200m on its own original productions.The Netflix-Marvel deal follows last year’s film distribution agreement between Disney and Netflix, which begins in 2016. Under the deal, Netflix will screen all Disney’s live-action and animated movies in the pay TV “window” after their release in cinemas and on DVD.The agreement covers titles from Disney’s Pixar and Marvel divisions, as well as Lucasfilm – which is producing new Star Wars films for Disney. Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4bn.Its latest deal caps a remarkable turnround for Netflix, which has recovered from a grisly 2011 when a botched rebranding, price increase, and separation of the company’s DVD and streaming business caused the shares to tumble from $300 to $60."

The news sent Netflix shares up 10 per cent in after-market trading, with the company opening the morning well into positive territory.However, shares sank quickly in the first 90 minutes of trading and closed 9.2 per cent lower to $339.10, after Bank of America issued a note that said the elevated stock price was “difficult to justify”.The streaming television provider is up just less than 400 per cent in the past 12 months and has a price-to-earnings ratio of 186. By contrast, the S&P 500 has a p/e ratio of 16.8.The day’s broad rally helped the Nasdaq Composite index to shake off the decline by Netflix to add 0.2 per cent to 3,929.57.The S&P 500 gained 0.6 per cent to a record close of 1,754.67 and touched a fresh intraday record high of 1,759.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 15,467.66.A busy day of earnings also helped drive some companies higher as investors look to balance sheets for justification of higher share prices.Whirlpool shares rose after it reported earnings per share of $2.72 that soundly beat estimates and revenue that grew 4.2 per cent.Investors drove Whirlpool shares 11.6 per cent higher to $146.14.Lockheed Martin showed its ability to shake off US budget cuts, as it announced that it had raised its full-year 2013 earnings per share projections to $9.20-$9.50 and that third-quarter net earnings were up 20 per cent.Lockheed shares moved 3.8 per cent higher to $130.05.Cloud software company VMware reported on Monday after the market close that third-quarter earnings per share beat estimates, and a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $1.29bn that met expectations.VMware shares were up 2.8 per cent to $85.00.Delta Air Lines gained 3.2 per cent to $25.49 after it reported earnings that also beat earnings per share predictions and a revenue increase in line with estimates.Coach benefited from a quarterly earnings report that was little improved from the previous year, but did beat estimates with earnings per share of $0.77. However, investors were unimpressed, sending shares down 8.2 per cent to $49.75.Apple shares, which have rallied 9.1 per cent in October back above the $500 level, took a step back on Tuesday. The iPhone maker was off 0.3 per cent to $519.87 despite the company’s event that included the announcement a the new iPad Air model.The broader market moves followed the delayed release of September’s non-farm payrolls data, which showed the US had added a less-than-expected 148,000 jobs. The downbeat news helped reinforce investor belief that the Federal Reserve would not begin to taper its quantitative easing programme in the near future.The jobs report sent 10-year Treasury yields to a three-month low, which helped utilities stocks, with the sector up 1.3 per cent. Utilities, which tend to have stable share prices and high dividends, perform particularly well when interest rates remain low.Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said the rally was a continuation from September, when the market began the month with 11 positive days in 12 sessions.“This is a market that has picked up from September and kind of veered off during the shutdown and debt ceiling debate. It’s picking up from where it left off when Ben Bernanke said no taper,” she said. “It’s one of the most accommodative periods in the calendar for equity markets. In addition to that, you’ve got the credit markets helping to set the stage for the market moving higher.”While continued faith in the Fed’s liquidity programme was driving the market higher, Ms Krosby noted that investors were taking profits in some of the year’s biggest gainers and piling into businesses that demonstrated revenue growth.“You have a number of companies, important companies, coming out with better earnings and some actually coming out with better top-line revenue growth. Mind you, not all of them. We’d like to see more, but it’s been enough to give the market this push higher.”
637;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-10-22T17:42:53Z;Jobs and earnings: multiple choice;There are some US stocks that are worth owning;"The great and terrifying thing about market analysis is that there is always more data. Unsatisfied with one source? Add another. Still, it is tricky to ignore the US jobs report, which sputtered out its September reading on Tuesday. Even allowing that the report is noisy, a slowing trend is evident. On a three-month rolling average, the US is adding 140,000 jobs a month; six months ago the rate was more than 200,000.If jobs growth is weakening, though, some companies are managing to do well – and not just innovative companies, such as Netflix, which take share in sluggish markets. Tuesday brought strong earnings reports from two companies in mature, competitive industries that are sensitive to consumer spending. Delta Air Lines saw passenger miles grow slightly and revenue per mile tick up; total passenger revenue was up 7 per cent as a result. Whirlpool’s appliances sales in North America rose 11 per cent on a unit basis. Shares of the companies – which do not look terribly expensive – popped.So certain stocks are worth owning, despite a long rally and slowing GDP growth. In aggregate, however, company performance confirms the jobs report. Net margins on S&P 500 companies may touch their 2006 record of 9.6 per cent this quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. This has protected earnings growth. However, sales at S&P 500 companies are unlikely to grow at all between the second and third quarters.Stock pickers will find opportunities in companies such as Delta and Whirlpool. Bulls on stocks generally must believe one of three things: (a) margins can exceed record levels (b) sales growth will pick up, despite what the jobs report suggests, or (c) monetary policy can keep stock valuations expanding indefinitely. Sceptics will keep checking box (d), none of the above, despite recent experience.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
638;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix: stay tuned;Group gains leverage but can it raise its subscription price?;One long year ago when Netflix had just 28m subscribers and a $70 stock price, its concerns were as long as one of its old movie queues. Could it quickly grow subscribers in a world of upstarts such as Amazon Prime, Hulu and iTunes? Was it imperilled by cable companies that could easily create their own on-demand offerings and happened to be the gatekeepers to the high-speed internet pipe that Netflix survived on? Since then it has successfully answered most of those questions and others. But beyond that, it has dramatically gained leverage. Netflix’s partners and rivals may now need it just as much as it needs them.Netflix boasts 40m streaming subscribers around the world. It added more than 2m in the third quarter. Its shares rallied a 10th in late trading and are up 400 per cent since the beginning of the year. Its earnings per share came in at 52 cents, a few pennies ahead of expectations. Cash flow metrics, perhaps the key measure of performance given the costs of acquiring content, were mixed though. Cash flow from operations of $35m exceeded net income. However, free cash flow was just $7m and fell from the previous quarter. Thus, Netflix has little free cash flow despite a market cap of nearly $25bn.The worries about cash flow, though, have taken a back seat since the narrative is now that Netflix is a must-have product for TV viewers. It has shown that it can produce shows (House of Cards, Orange is the New Black) that are worth paying a subscription of $8 per month for even if the content it buys remains uneven. Cable companies, fighting their own content cost battles, will consider embedding Netflix in their boxes thinking they might as well sell more broadband. So the questions of leverage are now: can it raise the subscription price and by how much?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
639;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-10-21T22:35:44Z;Netflix beats expectations with 40m subscribers;;Netflix shares surged about 10 per cent in after-market trading as the film and television streaming service reported it had passed 40m global subscribers and tripled profits in the third quarter, beating analysts’ estimates.The company behind the development of series such as House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black has rebounded strongly from its torrid 2011, when its shares collapsed from $300 to $55 after a botched rebranding and price rise. Netflix is among the S&P 500’s top performers for the year so far, with its shares rising more than 300 per cent.New subscriptions have been driven by its original programming and a new series of hit cable shows, such as Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead, said Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, in his quarterly investor letter.Much of the subscriber growth in the quarter came from new countries where Netflix has launched, such as Netherlands, with the streaming service now available in more than 40 countries. International subscribers rose 1.4m to 9.2m.But it also added 1.3m new subscribers in the US to about 31m, giving it more subscribers in the region than Time Warner’s premium cable channel, HBO.HBO is regarded as the gold standard in the TV industry and consistently wins more Emmy awards than other networks.Netflix won its first Emmy recently, when David Fincher won best director for directing House of Cards. “We have a long way to go to match HBO’s 114m global member count or their well-deserved Emmy award leadership,” Mr Hastings said.Netflix plans to double its investment in original content programming – it spends about $200m a year – and has also changed how it amortises its content costs, bringing it more into line with viewing trends.“When we started with original content we didn’t have specific data about viewing patterns over time for content that premieres on Netflix,” Mr Hastings wrote. “We decided to use straight line amortisation based on our experience with TV series from other networks.”However, with viewers tending to “binge-view”, or watching a whole series in a short period, the company is “accelerating the amortisation of such content commensurately”.Netflix has been aided by a new generation of viewers who have grown up with a preference for watching movies and series online, preferring it to traditional television. “The growth of smart TVs and internet TV devices, such as AppleTV, Roku, and Chromecast, are increasing the availability of TV streaming platforms,” Mr Hastings wrote in his letter. “Tablets and phones also are rapidly growing as Netflix viewing platforms.”Net income for the quarter rose from $7.7m to $31.8m, while earnings per share increased from 14 cents to 52 cents. Revenues were $1.1bn, compared with $905m in the year-ago quarter.The shares were surged $35.97 to $390.96 in after-market trading.
640;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-10-14T22:04:50Z;Aereo / Netflix: frenemies;Litigate or co-operate on TV retransmission;To litigate or co-operate? Such is the dilemma before US TV broadcasters. Their recent revival stems from the growing fees they charge cable providers to retransmit the same programming that they provide for free over the air. The start-up Aereo is threatening the “retrans” gravy train. Aereo offers an internet TV replay service that records broadcast TV – but it does not pay the broadcasters, as cable distributors must. Lawsuits to reign in Aereo so far have failed, but the Supreme Court may now weigh in. Cable companies, on the other hand, are beginning to find ways to incorporate Netflix – the streaming video company they once considered a mortal threat – into their service. Broadcasters would do well to take a similar approach, and consider how to become “frenemies” with Aereo.For all the fuss, Aereo is small. The $8 a month service is available in just a few markets and has perhaps a few thousand subscribers. So the financial hit broadcasters are taking is tiny for now. But cable companies could come up with their own Aereo copycat. They have already used Aereo to push back on retrans payments. And those payments are expected to approach $6bn by 2018, up from $200m in 2006, reckons SNL Kagan. CBS, headed by retrans godfather Les Moonves, has seen its shares jump 250 per cent in the last two years.Netflix and big cable have not historically been buddies. But after sniping for years a few cable companies may add Netflix to their set-top boxes. Netflix has 35m users but desperately needs more. And cable companies also use their pipe to sell broadband, the lifeblood of Netflix. The zone of co-operation between Aereo and broadcast TV is less obvious. It must start with using Aereo to bring in incremental viewers. But finding common ground is still better than betting it all on a fight in court.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
641;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-09-30T11:16:21Z;Samsung heir apparent Lee Jae-yong faces tough investor test;;"South Koreans sometimes remark that Samsung’s founding clan is the closest thing they have to a royal family. So when the patriarch Lee Kun-hee last year promoted his only son to the vice-chairmanship of Samsung Electronics, it heightened anticipation of a forthcoming dynastic succession.In the nearly 26 years since Mr Lee succeeded his own father as chairman of Samsung, the steely, private billionaire has overseen the group’s rise to become one of the world’s most powerful conglomerates, with interests ranging from construction to life assurance.But the clear jewel in the crown is the electronics company, now the world’s top technology group by sales. While other parts of the Samsung empire are expected to be passed down to Mr Lee’s two daughters, most analysts presume that Samsung Electronics will be led by his son, Jae-yong, who has spent most of his adult life rising through its ranks.Yet a share price fall of 11 per cent since the start of June, driven by concerns about smartphone margins, shows that investors are already wondering whether Samsung can maintain its meteoric growth – and these questions are bound to grow louder approaching the eventual succession.Few of Samsung’s 246,000 employees have ever seen the 71-year-old Lee Kun-hee in person, but many of them are intimately familiar with his personal legend. Company lore celebrates the giant bonfire built on Mr Lee’s instructions during Samsung’s early forays into mobile phones, with thousands of substandard handsets consigned to the flames as a graphic warning to their developers.Most revered is the “Frankfurt Declaration” he made in 1993 at that city’s Kempinski Hotel, where he told assembled executives to “change everything but your wife and children” as he outlined an approach to management commonly described as “perpetual crisis”.This ruthless style has been vindicated by results. Lee Byung-chul, who founded Samsung as a small rural trading concern in 1938, had already built it into one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates. But it was under the second chairman that Samsung became a leader in some of the biggest global electronics markets: first in memory chips, later in televisions, and most recently in mobile phones.Despite his iconic standing within the company, Mr Lee has kept his distance from its day-to-day operations. Although business people in Seoul mutter darkly about his apparently ailing health, one person close to the company says that in recent months he has started regularly working at the Seoul headquarters, beginning at 6am. But for most of his time as chairman, he has worked from a private office next to his home, with executives visiting for regular consultations.Company operations continued as normal after the chairman resigned from the company amid a corruption scandal in 2008; he returned nearly two years later after his conviction for tax evasion was overturned by the South Korean president.“The nature of the chairman’s role is that it’s very, very much in the background,” says Mark Newman, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein who previously worked in Samsung’s strategy department.This has made it difficult for investors to be certain of how far Mr Lee should be given personal credit for the company’s recent success, and how far it is the doing of an executive team composed of some of South Korea’s most brilliant and ambitious managers.“Over the past 20 years they have built a platform in which professionals make decisions in a very systematic manner – it’s unlike Apple in that respect,” says Marcello Ahn, a fund manager at Quad Investment Management in Seoul. “That’s the reason why I’m not that much concerned about [the leadership succession].”But any indication that a handover is imminent is bound to focus market scrutiny on the credentials of an incoming chairman who has been groomed for the role since childhood. Aged 45, Lee Jae-yong is more outgoing than his father, and fluent in English and Japanese after studying business at Keio University and Harvard Business School.His first prominent position within the company came with his appointment in 2007 as chief customer officer, an unusual title that drew sneers from critics who assumed it would be a sinecure. But it meant that he found himself acting as a regular point of contact with Apple founder Steve Jobs.Despite a bitter court battle over disputed smartphone patents, Apple remains a huge customer for Samsung’s component business, and the younger Mr Lee was the only Asian executive invited to Jobs’s memorial service in 2011.Over the past 20 years they have built a platform in which professionals make decisions in a very systematic manner – it’s unlike Apple in that respect. That’s the reason why I’m not that much concerned about [the leadership succession]Investors in Samsung will hope that this reflects an aptitude for managing relationships with foreign businesses – a vital attribute now that Samsung has moved from simply exporting electronics at low prices to managing a complex international web of customers, suppliers and partners.Samsung's move into Smart TV, for example, means that its television business now relies not only on producing hardware, but also on nurturing partnerships with content providers. Lee Jae-yong’s links in the US, where he mixes regularly with the political and business elite, helped him win support from companies including Amazon, Netflix and Verizon for Samsung’s Smart TV business, according to one person close to the company.At home, however, some criticise the presumption that the chairmanship will be passed down within a family that owns less than 5 per cent of Samsung Electronics’ stock, maintaining control instead through a web of cross-shareholdings between subsidiaries. Lee Kun-hee’s efforts to ensure a smooth succession led to his conviction, in 2009, of complicity in the illegal sale to his son of bonds of another Samsung subsidiary.Moreover, some investors argue that the younger Mr Lee is unproven in management. He has received criticism over an ecommerce venture that failed in the early 2000s, in which he was the controlling shareholder, although he did not hold an executive position.“Personally, I don’t think JY has ever proven himself,” says one former senior investor. “Everything was given to him. There is lots of scepticism around.”Some people who know the younger Mr Lee say such criticism is unfair, and that he has been heavily involved in recent successes including the Galaxy smartphone range. One former Samsung executive says Lee Jae-yong has already effectively assumed the duties of a chief executive without the title, while his father takes a non-executive supervisory role.In any case, Mr Lee will face a stern test when he eventually takes charge. The recent share price decline reflects investor nervousness about Samsung’s reliance on the maturing smartphone market. While the company has identified a cluster of new growth areas ranging from biotechnology to solar energy, company insiders admit these are years away from making significant contributions to the bottom line.“It’s difficult to criticise the way Samsung has conducted itself because it’s been so successful,” says Jonathan Pines, who manages an emerging Asia portfolio for Hermes Fund Managers. “But like in a game of chess, everyone is looking at the next move.”This article has been amended to reflect the fact that Lee Jae-yong was the controlling shareholder but not an executive in an earlier ecommerce venture."

Another strong data release from China, this time indicating that industrial output, investment and retail sales had improved, helped to boost some of the largest US manufacturers. Vanguard Industrials ETF was up 1.4 per cent to $88.23.General Electric added 2.1 per cent to $23.87, Honeywell International gained 2.1 per cent to $84.13, and United Technologies ticked up 1.7 per cent to $106.26.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6 per cent to 3,729.02, but was hampered by a sharp drop in Apple shares following the company’s announcement of its newest slate of iPhones.Apple, which traded slightly lower before the release event, extended losses to 2.3 per cent at $494.64, taking the company back below the $500 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 15,191.06.Nike, Goldman Sachs and Visa all received a boost on news that they will be added to the Dow.All three companies moved sharply higher, with Nike up 2.2 per cent to $66.82, Goldman shares 3.5 per cent higher to $165.14, and Visa 3.4 per cent better to $184.59 after the news broke on Tuesday morning.Nike has enjoyed a strong run in 2013 for consumer stocks and posted strong earnings thanks to higher prices and cheaper materials.The sports apparel company’s shares are up 29.5 per cent on the year to date. The companies will replace Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard after the close of trading on Friday September 20.The three spurned stocks took the news in their stride, with Alcoa off 0.4 per cent to $8.05, Hewlett-Packard 0.4 per cent lower to $22.27, and Bank of America advancing 0.9 per cent to $14.61.Delta Air Lines rose sharply in its first day on the S&P 500. Shares in the carrier were up 4 per cent to $22.63 and are now up 13.8 per cent since Monday.Urban Outfitters and ConAgra were among the day’s worst performers on news they were in danger of missing earnings expectations.Urban fell 10.2 per cent to $38.35 after a regulatory filing showed that third-quarter same-store sales were below analyst estimates. The drop took the retailer into negative territory for 2013, off 2.6 per cent.ConAgra shares dropped 6 per cent to $31.54 after the company reduced its 2014 guidance.BlackBerry was off 5.1 per cent to $10.94, continuing a recent volatile run as sale rumours swirled around the handset maker. Reports on Tuesday morning said the company had laid off a chunk of its US sales force.Shares in BlackBerry are off 21.6 per cent in the past three months.Tuesday’s gains put the S&P 500 up 3.1 per cent during its September streak. However, it has been overshadowed by an even more impressive run from the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks.The Russell is up 4.4 per cent in September, taking it near its 2013 highs of 1,063.52.However, the US indices are not alone. In the past six sessions, Tokyo’s Nikkei is up 6.3 per cent, the Shanghai Composite has risen 6.7 per cent, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index is better by 3.6 per cent.
643;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-08-14T18:40:47Z;Microsoft to fund remake of BBC’s sci-fi cult classic ‘Blake’s 7’;;Microsoft has agreed to finance a remake of the cult BBC TV science fiction series Blake’s 7 for its Xbox Live digital network, according to people familiar with the situation.The deal represents the latest move by the technology company to create new video programming for the Xbox, which it has repositioned as an entertainment hub. It has sold 76m Xbox consoles and has close to 50m subscribers to Xbox Live, a digital media network that allows users to compete against each other and download video.Microsoft declined to comment, but a person familiar with the deal said the company had agreed to finance development and production of the show, although it had not committed to a full series.Microsoft has replaced the Syfy cable channel, part of Comcast’s NBCUniversal group, which was originally lined to up to remake Blake’s 7.Best known for its shaky sets and improbable storylines, Blake’s 7 ran for four series on BBC TV in the late 1970s and early 1980s – surviving the departure of its eponymous hero halfway through, and culminating in the apparent demise of almost all its other characters in a final episode slow-motion shoot out. It was devised by Terry Nation – creator of Doctor Who’s Daleks – who pitched it to the BBC as “The Dirty Dozen in space”.The series will be redeveloped for 21st-century viewers by Motion Picture Capital, a London-based film and television company backed by Reliance, the Indian conglomerate controlled by Anil Ambani. Martin Campbell, the director of Casino Royale has been enlisted to direct the series. MPC declined to comment.Microsoft has already struck a deal with Steven Spielberg to produce a live-action series of its hit game series Halo, with the show to be distributed on the Xbox Live platform.In acquiring rights to premium content that would have appeared on TV, Microsoft is pursuing a similar strategy to Amazon and Netflix. Netflix won plaudits this year for its remake of the BBC series House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey, while Amazon has commissioned five original series, including Alpha House, a political comedy starring John Goodman. All of the programmes will be streamed to viewers over the internet.Microsoft is also making a push into Hollywood, hiring Nancy Tellem, the former president of CBS Television Studios, to launch Xbox Entertainment Studios in Los Angeles.Ms Tellem could not be reached for comment but she told the Fortune Brainstorm conference in Aspen recently that Microsoft wanted to create a “different kind of TV experience” for the Xbox which would be more interactive. “Instead of it being a passive experience you can choose to either passively watch or connect in real time with your friends or across the US or globally … with the content on our platform,” she said.Microsoft recently launched the Xbox One, a new version of its flagship games consol, with greater video capability. Users can use or stream a variety of services on the Xbox, including Netflix, the BBC iPlayer and SkyGo, the streaming service. 
644;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-07-31T22:24:51Z;‘The Croods’ drives DreamWorks earnings;;DreamWorks Animation beat expectations in the second quarter thanks to a better than expected box office performance from The Croods, its film about a prehistoric family.But profits for the rest of the year will be constrained by the disappointing release of Turbo, its recent movie about a racing snail, which had a weaker than expected opening weekend performance in the US.DWA said Turbo would eventually be profitable, with the film performing better in international territories where it had been released. Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive, blamed a crowded US marketplace – several big family films were released around the same time as the movie opened in the US – for the disappointing performance.The company’s films in 2014 would be “well positioned” and not released into “an overcrowded” marketplace, he said.Mr Katzenberg addressed the Chinese market on an investor call, following recent press reports that some studios were not being paid on time for films that had been released in the country. China is forecast to overtake the US as the world’s largest cinema market within the next six years.However, Mr Katzenberg said DWA, which has a joint venture – Oriental DreamWorks – with state-owned Chinese media companies, has not experienced any problems. “China continues to be a place of opportunity for us,” he said. “We have not had any operating issues.”DWA is diversifying beyond theatrical film releases and is pushing into online television, after striking a deal with Netflix in the quarter to provide 300 hours of programming. The company is also expanding its consumer products activities ahead of the launch next year of How to Train Your Dragon 2, through an agreement with Hasbro, the toy maker. Mr Katzenberg said the push was “one of the biggest consumer products programmes in our history”.“Three of the four TV shows that we are delivering to Netflix have meaningful opportunities for consumer products,” he added. The Netflix programming will feature characters from DWA’s library of movies, including Shrek, The Croods and Turbo.There will also be programmes based on Classic Media characters, such as Casper the Friendly Ghost. DWA bought Classic Media last year for $155m.The company has also made a bet on growth of YouTube, acquiring Awesomeness TV, one of the platforms most popular children’s networks. The $33m deal could rise to $117m if certain earn-out targets are met.Revenues for the three months to June 30 were $213.4m, compared with $162.8m in the comparable quarter last time, while net income rose from $12.8m to $22.4m. The shares were up close to 5 per cent in after-hours trading to $25.99.
645;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-07-22T23:41:52Z;Netflix shares hit by growth concerns;;Netflix shares fell sharply on Monday on investor concerns about the pace of subscriber growth at the film and TV streaming service.Netflix disappointed investors when it said it expected to add about 1m new subscribers in the third quarter, about the same as it added in the third quarter last year.The guidance came as the company reported that second-quarter revenues were up from $889m to $1.07bn, with net income rising from $6.1m to $29.5m. Netflix added 630,000 new US customers in the second quarter, in line with company guidance. However, that result disappointed some analysts.Although the shares fell 6.6 per cent in after-market trading to $244.60, they have surged more than 230 per cent in the past 12 months, propelled by investor enthusiasm for the company’s critically acclaimed original series, notably House of Cards, Arrested Development and Orange Is the New Black.The company this month scored 14 Emmy nominations, with nine for House of Cards. This was the first time an online service has gatecrashed television’s most prestigious awards ceremony.In his quarterly letter to shareholders, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said the company was “generating steady growth in members, revenue and contribution profit”.Netflix tends to add most of its subscribers in the second half of the year but scored a “small but noticeable bump in membership” with the launch of Arrested Development in the second quarter – a series that used to run on television until it was cancelled by the Fox network.“Other great shows don’t have that noticeable effect in their first season because they are less established,” Mr Hastings added.Netflix has grown to more than 36m paying subscribers, with 29.8m in the US and 7.7m internationally. The group’s international business has been boosted by its performance in the UK, where it is making inroads into territory traditionally dominated by pay-TV providers, such as British Sky Broadcasting, and rival online services, such as Amazon’s LoveFilm.Netflix’s rivals, such as Hulu and Amazon in the US, have recently started commissioning their own original series as they compete for viewers that are drifting away from traditional television. Technology groups, such as Microsoft and Yahoo, are also commissioning original programming.
646;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-07-10T19:25:17Z;Inside Business: Malone hitches up to broadband bandwagon;Malone is on the prowl for acquisitions;"Five years ago, reporters covering Allen & Co’s annual Sun Valley summit were scrambling around the floor of the lodge where the world’s media and technology leaders gather each July, helping Rupert Murdoch look for his wedding ring.The News Corp chairman filed for divorce last month and the press is now kept at a distance, but otherwise Sun Valley’s rituals are little changed as Herb Allen’s guests regroup near Idaho’s Sawtooth mountains this week.Each sighting of two “media moguls” or “tech titans” talking sparks speculation about what deal they might be discussing. This year, the 286 male and 17 female guests jetted in laden with expectations that they would, for example, sort out Apple’s television strategy; Vivendi’s plans for its Activision stake; and Hulu’s buyer.Sun Valley’s reputation as a hotbed of dealmaking is exaggerated but with dealmaking central to its legend, nobody is more in focus this week than Liberty Media’s John Malone.His companies have been involved in some of this year’s biggest deals, buying Virgin Media in the UK for $23.3bn, taking a stake in Dutch cable operator Ziggo, tussling with Vodafone over Kabel Deutschland and spending $2.6bn for 27 per cent of Charter Communications, the fourth-largest US cable operator.He is looking for the next target already. Last month, he touted Charter as “a horizontal acquisition machine”, saying that consolidation could balance out an industry he likened to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, where too many sub-scale groups trail behind Comcast.Mr Malone is not one to enjoy playing the dwarf, so Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chief executive, has begun pitching Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable, on a deal with Charter. TWC has three times Charter’s subscribers and more than double its enterprise value, and Mr Britt – another Sun Valley guest – seems unconvinced so far.The deal would test Mr Malone’s financial engineering talents, requiring some combination of a dilutive issue of new equity from the highly-rated Charter, an infusion of cash from elsewhere in Liberty’s portfolio, leverage of perhaps five times earnings on the combined company’s balance sheet and a creative use of Charter’s historic tax losses.Liberty may yet pick smaller targets instead, but scale counts in cable. Morgan Stanley estimates a combined Charter-TWC could yield annual savings of $400m-$600m, largely from greater negotiating power with programme suppliers.Consolidation in the fragmented US pay-TV market looks inevitable, and for it to be led by the man who built America’s largest cable company before selling TCI to AT&T in 1999 might seem poetic.Forget the nostalgia, though. Mr Malone’s plans have little to do with what cable was when he earned his “cable cowboy” nickname. “We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributor,” says Michael J Wolf, managing director at Activate, a strategy consultancy.We keep looking at these personalities, but just as important is the business logic [of] becoming the largest TV and broadband distributorBroadband is the key to Mr Malone’s renewed interest in cable. With profit margins under pressure in video, high-speed connectivity is cable’s growth story.Mr Malone said at his annual meeting last month he is betting that broadband will be “the controlling attribute that drives market share”, even in video, as more programming is delivered “over the top” via internet connections rather than cable or satellite boxes.He sees cable as uniquely positioned to deliver the bandwidth needed by services like Netflix and the cheaper video packages cable companies will offer if they can “unbundle” costly sports channels.But what kind of broadband cowboy would Mr Malone be? He says his vision includes more tiered pricing and charging bandwidth-hungry users of cable’s pipes (such as Netflix) for the capacity they use.Short-term opportunism is mixed in Mr Malone’s long-term vision. Consumer advocates already warn that tiered pricing and usage-based billing will hurt the “little guys”, and we should not assume he can simply replicate his buccaneering cable days. Cable companies now face cord-cutting consumers and competition from the Netflix, satellite and telecom groups, Mr Wolf notes.Even if Mr Malone is just defending his power base this time, however, he seems determined to play a central role in shaping the future of internet access in America and beyond. Unravelling the pay-TV bundle will not happen overnight, but his bet on broadband could affect Sun Valley’s ageing moguls and digital newcomers alike for years to come.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgeclife-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness"
647;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-07-09T16:12:40Z;Deals help drive US stocks higher;;US markets ticked up on Tuesday despite downbeat global economic sentiment from the IMF, while deal news drove Kroger and Netflix shares higher.Kroger rose on news that the supermarket chain was expanding with the acquisition of Harris Teeter for $2.5bn. The all-cash deal will extend Kroger’s reach in the southeast US.That sent Kroger shares to an all-time high, up 2.7 per cent to $37.15. Harris Teeter added 1.5 per cent to $49.25.Netflix shares gained 6.1 per cent to $247.38 after announcing the extension of its licensing agreement with CBS, which will also include some new popular television content including “CSI: NY”.CBS added 0.9 per cent to $51.29, taking it near an all-time high.The S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,652.34, led by gains in the materials and industrials sectors. The benchmark index is now fractionally above levels seen before a sell-off was triggered by comments from the Federal Reserve about tapering the quantitative easing programme.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent higher to 15,300.26, led by construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, up 2.6 per cent to $85.33, and Cisco, 2.2 per cent higher to $25.16.IBM was the worst performing blue-chip, down 1.9 per cent to $191.30 after Goldman Sachs downgraded it from “buy” to “neutral” on concerns over the company’s revenue, particularly in emerging markets.The IT group is now down 0.1 per cent on the year to date, while the Dow Jones has added 16.8 per cent in that same period.FedEx shares rallied 4.4 per cent to $103.15 after chief executive Fred Smith said sluggish global growth in the company’s fourth quarter overshadowed improving margins and ground volume.Robotic surgery system manufacturer Intuitive Surgical was among the day’s biggest fallers after it said second-quarter revenue would come in well below expectations. The announcement prompted downgrades from three analysts.Shares in the company were off 16.2 per cent to $419.30 in heavy trading.The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.6 per cent to 3,504.2, helped by a 1.8 per cent rise in Apple, the heaviest weighted stock in the tech index.Tesla Motors shares rose 2 per cent to $123.45 on news that the electric carmaker will join the Nasdaq 100 index.The Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks continued its recent strong run, up 0.7 per cent to 1,016.03. It continues to outperform the US indices and is up nearly 20 per cent on the year to date.US markets shook off news that the International Monetary Fund had cut its global economic forecast for the year. Shaky economic news from China and Europe has caused some sectors to pause, but strong US economic data has broadly trumped other concerns.And with investors coming to terms with the eventual end of quantitative easing, analysts are seeing stocks return to trading on classic indicators.“I think the fundamentals are driving the markets once again and it’s good news, and especially good news for equities,” said Doug Coté, chief market strategist for ING Investment Management. “We’re getting back to normal and normal says buy equities to get to the proper allocation.”Mr Coté said strong US economic news could continue to drive interest rates up, providing some urgency for investors to sell bonds and buy stocks.“I think the recent move in yields, although pronounced, is just a shot across the bow,” he said. “If people don’t get the message that we’re back to normal and that rates are likely to rise, we’re likely to get the bazooka blast message.”
648;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Apple makes $3m a day from TV and movies;;No wonder Tim Cook has escalated Apple’s position on the television market from “hobby” to “area of intense interest” in recent months. New figures from Apple suggest that it’s making at least $3m a day from TV and movie downloads.Apple on Wednesday announced that it sells more than 800,000 TV episodes and 350,000 movies every day on iTunes, bringing its combined total to 1.38bn downloads since video first arrived on iTunes, way back in 2005.Apple charges anywhere between 99c for movie rentals and $20 for new releases, while TV shows are typically $3 for HD episodes, suggesting a range of $3m to $4m in revenues (before the studios take their cut) everyday.The new data came alongside the launch of HBO Go, Sky News and WatchESPN on the Apple TV, a $99 set-top box that for now remains stubbornly closed to developers or the iPhone’s App Store.Sky and ESPN will bring live TV to Apple’s “puck” for the first time, while HBO Go will only be available to existing cable subscribers – another first for the device, which has so far been limited to “over the top” content such as Netflix, YouTube and Hulu, which could be watched by cord-cutters and cable refuseniks alike.Apple’s television ambitions continue to perplex and excite in equal measure.Mr Cook is even more cryptic than usual when asked about where Apple TV is headed and if a big shiny screen – as has been rumoured for years – will ever emerge from the Cupertino labs.He’s often talked about it as a project where Apple will “continue to pull the string and see where it leads us”. At Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference keynote last week, TV barely got a mention, but in an interview at AllThingsD’s recent conference, Mr Cook said:“When you look at the TV experience, it’s not an experience that I think very many people love. It’s not one that has been brought up to date for this decade. It’s still an experience much like 10 years ago or 20 years ago.”The existing Apple TV box has sold more than 13m units globally, including 2m in the holiday quarter ending December 2012 (that compares with around 5m Roku boxes in the US alone). Mr Cook said that it has been “good from a learning point of view for Apple”.It’s also become a decent business at a company that does not devote much attention to underperforming units.Horace Dediu, analyst at Asymco, calculates that including content and hardware, Apple TV generates $2.3bn in sales a year, with video making up around 10 per cent of iTunes’ total income, making it smaller than apps, music or Apple’s own software.As Mr Dediu wrote in a blogpost on Wednesday:“The overall picture of iTunes is becoming clearer every day. We have more information about number of users (575 million), what they spend on media and software and services ($20 billion/yr.) and, increasingly what they spend on each media type (about $9/yr on software, $2/yr on books, $16/yr on apps $12/yr on music and $4/yr on video.)”But although the TV business is growing, customers are still waiting for more content, says Dan Cryan, digital media analyst at IHS.“Account holders seem to be buying movies at broadly the same number of movies per account per quarter that they were a couple of years back,” Mr Cryan says.“However as the number of accounts has expanded internationally, the buy rate for TV shows seems to have declined appreciably which would probably be connected to the relatively limited availability of TV shows through iTunes.”The latest additions don’t provide much to distinguish Apple TV from rivals such as Roku: HBO and ESPN already offer similar apps on Microsoft’s Xbox, iOS and Android devices. More than any technological innovation, Apple needs to find its way through the complex world of TV licensing and land more original content.
649;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Video streaming company Roku raises further $60m;;Roku, the video streaming company whose customers streamed more than 1bn hours of television last year, has raised $60m to expand its efforts to supply software and services to manufacturers of internet-connected televisions.The new investment, which brings the sum Roku has raised to date to $140m, could accelerate the disruption to traditional cable, satellite and broadcast TV business models, even as Roku positions itself as a partner to content owners in their search for larger digital audiences.“TV streaming is becoming a standard feature in all TVs but only one company, Samsung, has a visible platform,” Anthony Wood, chief executive, said, predicting that most manufacturers would work with partners such as Roku to embed streaming technology in their sets because of the cost barriers to developing such technology and content partnerships in-house.The series F fundraising comes 10 months after Roku raised $45m from investors including News Corp and BSkyB. Roku would not disclose the valuation the new fundraising put on it, or the identity of the large institutional investor that led the round, although this is understood to be Fidelity.“Roku has a very good position in streaming video,” said Ken Bronfin, senior managing director at Hearst Ventures, part of the Hearst publishing and broadcasting group that invested in the latest round and has stakes in digital companies from BuzzFeed to Pandora.Hearst’s broadcast stations, cable channels and magazine brands all saw opportunities to gain insights from Roku and develop content for its platform, he said: “We want to be prepared, no matter what platforms emerge, and Roku in streaming will be one of them.”Content available over Roku’s devices has expanded to include big digital video brands such as Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video and HBO Go and a host of smaller channels. Mr Wood said Roku’s revenue reached about $140m last year, from three sources: selling devices, supplying manufacturers and sharing revenues generated over the platform such as subscriptions to the likes of Netflix.Roku has sold more than 5m devices in the US at $99 each, putting it on a par with the Apple TV box.Mr Wood said it was becoming easier to attract content. “What’s changed for us is the attitude of content partners. It used to be that we had Netflix and we had to go around begging for everything else. Now [content owners] want to pay us for better positioning and promotion,” he said.The News Corp and BSkyB investments helped send a message to other media companies that “we’re trying to be your friend,” Mr Wood said.Roku had launched in Canada, the UK and Ireland and was “committed to being a global company,” Mr Wood said. Roku was working with one US-based “virtual MSO”– an internet-delivered alternative to a cable operator, he added, predicting that the service would launch “this year or next”.The news comes as viewers grow increasingly agnostic as to whether video content is created for television or digital outlets.To evaluate consumers’ changing perceptions of digital video, the Starcom media buying agency owned by Publicis recently conducted an experiment where consumers were split into three groups, shown the same videos but told different stories about how the clips were created.The study found that while most consumers thought that made-for-television programmes were higher quality than online originals, they did not distinguish between the two if they did not know the origins. Consumers were also less likely to remember commercials in a video they thought was created for TV, possibly because they are used to tuning out television ads, the study found.
650;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
651;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-05-24T22:27:09Z;Hollywood insiders among Hulu suitors;;Hulu has attracted initial bids from strategic buyers, private equity groups and Hollywood insiders as owner News Corp, Walt Disney and Comcast look to exit the six-year-old online video service.Hulu, which streams broadcast networks content and movies to tech-savvy US consumers, some of whom pay a monthly fee for a premium version, competes with services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple’s iTunes.Bidding for Hulu got under way more than a month ago when Peter Chernin, former chief operating officer of News Corp, made a formal $500m offer.Since then, a series of new bidders has emerged. Private equity firms including Guggenheim Digital Media and Silver Lake Partners are pursuing Hulu, according to people familiar with the situation.Cable and satellite television providers have also joined the fray. Time Warner Cable and DirecTV have both made offers, these people said.Other reports have included buyout firm KKR as a bidder, as well as Yahoo, which this week bought social media site Tumblr for $1.1bn.Yet as bidding for Hulu heats up, it remains unclear exactly what the future of the company will look like.News Corp, Disney and Comcast power Hulu by streaming their content. As they look for an exit, however, they are likely to take their content with them, then look to license it back to Hulu for a fee.The details of these arrangements will impact the price for Hulu, people close to the process said. One person said Disney may also retain a stake in the company.Hulu was founded in 2007 by News Corp, Disney and Comcast, majority owner of NBCUniversal. Providence Equity Partners later paid $100m for a 10 per cent stake, but last year sold its interest back to the founders. Comcast, the cable operator, has a non-controlling stake in Hulu because the online video service is a competitor to its core business.Efforts to sell Hulu date as far back as 2011, when the owners tried to find buyers but could not field compelling bids despite preliminary interest from Amazon, Dish Network, Google and Yahoo.Hulu’s founding chief executive, Jason Kilar, quit earlier this year after clashing with the founders over the future direction of the company.Yet as Netflix has begun to produce more original content, including the acclaimed remake of the House of Cards series, Hulu has relied on recent broadcast content as its main selling point.Reporting by David Gelles, Matthew Garrahan, Emily Steel and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson
652;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-05-10T19:34:34Z;Tesla and Netflix: a letter to short sellers;What the bosses of Tesla and Netflix would say to those who bet against them;Elon Musk, boss of electric luxury car maker Tesla Motors, and Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, love to write quarterly updates to their shareholders. United in vindication, they have just filed a joint letter to short sellers who have bet against their companies.Dear greedy speculators,How are those short positions working out for you? Not so well, we suppose. We doubt you can bear to look but so far this year Tesla shares are up 105 per cent and Netflix is up even more. You all wagered that we did not have viable businesses. Well, you wagered wrong. At Tesla we have pledged that we could deliver 20,000 Model S sedans in 2013 and we are cruising past that target. We sold 4,900 cars in the first quarter and are planning to sell 21,000 for the year. Tesla delivered $15m in profits (OK, non-GAAP profits) and even positive cash flow. This is a really big deal – just ask Fisker Automotive (they seem to be nearing bankruptcy court).Meanwhile, Netflix has 36m people around the world who stream TV shows and movies. That’s more subscribers than HBO! And not just shows from other networks. Everybody’s talking about the cool content we produce ourselves like House of Cards and Arrested Development. Netflix even makes a horror show called Hemlock Grove, which to us sounds like the perfect resting place for a bunch of soulless short sellers.We hope you are not enjoying our gloating. We know that consumers want to drive our cars and stream our videos. Granted, both companies are working on doing that at a profitable scale. But that will come. At Tesla we need to sell about 35,000 cars a year to reach sustainability. We are also moving into Europe and Asia where there is probably demand for 15,000 more cars. That’s a total of 35,000 right there. (Surely there are 20,000 Americans every year who want to buy a $70,000 electric car.)At Netflix we admit to being jealous of those positive cash flows at Tesla. Nice work, Elon. Licensing and making shows are not cheap. We have $6bn in content liabilities, for goodness’ sake. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery (HBO Go, Hulu) but that makes it hard for us to jack up prices. That did not go so well last time anyway. And Amazon’s Jeff Bezos tells us profits are overrated. Time for an equity raise! Reformed short sellers get 10 per cent off.Later haters,Elon and ReedEmail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
653;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-05-01T22:22:01Z;US media groups bank on digital rights;Viacom and Time Warner look to online distribution;Media companies are banking on the prospect that tech firms will continue to pay up for digital rights to their programmes, despite recent warnings from Netflix that it would become choosier in its deals for traditional television content.“With people consuming more and more video all the time, the key to success is pretty simple. If you keep creating the best content, you will keep getting paid better and better as technology improves,” said Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS.Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, echoed that sentiment, saying his company is in an enviable position with its top-tier programming on networks such as HBO becoming more valuable as tech firms become more selective in striking content deals. “We think we’re in the catbird seat from that point of view with all of the [subscription video on demand] buyers,” he said.The comments came as a slew of media companies, including Comcast, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner, reported a mixed bag of quarterly earnings on Wednesday.Comcast reported a 17 per cent jump in net income, with more expensive rates offsetting a larger-than-expected drop in people paying for video subscriptions. Time Warner reported a 23 per cent increase in net profit, with growth in its television group making up for declines in its film and publishing divisions.Viacom’s net earnings plunged 18 per cent, but the company reported increases in both ad and affiliate revenues. CBS reported an 18 per cent increase in net income from continuing operations, fuelled by gains in ad revenues from tent pole events including the Super Bowl as well as a boost in streaming revenues.Media stocks have been lifted this year in large part by a resilient traditional television business that has showed little evidence of people abandoning their cable and satellite video subscriptions to watch programmes via the internet.At the same time, new revenues from syndicating or selling content via digital services have helped prop up the business. At Viacom, for instance, digital licensing revenues have been a consistent bright spot for the past several quarters amid a challenging advertising market. CBS said that its deals with Amazon and Netflix led to 19 per cent growth in streaming revenues during the quarter.But there is uncertainty on how long it can last. Just last week Netflix said it was increasingly focusing on original production rather than broad content deals with other media companies. The company also said that it would let its bulk content licensing deal with Viacom expire.“As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk content deals declines,” Reed Hasting, Netflix’s chief executive, said at the time. Netflix said its deal with Viacom would be allowed to expire.Viacom said that it is in discussions with several parties, including Netflix, regarding the digital distribution of its content both on an exclusive and non-exclusive basis. It said there is increased competition for its content from a range of companies. “We continue to see the digital distribution arena as a growing opportunity and one that will be complementary to what we do,” Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive said in a conference call on Wednesday. “It’s just growing the pie over time.”Licensing revenues will become all the more important for Time Warner as it proceeds with the planned spin-off of its Time Inc and IPC magazine businesses by the end of 2013. That will leave 90 per cent of its profits coming from TV networks such as CNN and HBO, or production such as Warner Bros’ TV studio, Mr Bewkes said.Falling subscriptions cut Time Inc revenues from $773m to $737m in the quarter, however, as the division fell to a $9m operating loss from a $39m operating profit a year earlier after $53m of restructuring costs.
654;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix: playing its cards right;Backlash from ill-fated price rise in 2011 has been shaken off;House of Cards. Arrested Development. Hemlock Grove. Mercifully, these only refer to the names of Netflix original shows and not the themes surrounding its share price. In fact, the stock is up 90 per cent this year and rocketed another 25 per cent to above $200 in late trading yesterday after the company released first-quarter results. Netflix showed a second straight quarter of strong subscriber growth for its streaming content: total subscribers were 36.3m, up nearly 40 per cent in a year. And impressively, total paid streaming subscriber growth of 13 per cent quarter on quarter means that it grew faster than overall streaming subscribers (accounting for free trials), which were up 9.2 per cent.Netflix can feel good that it has shaken the backlash from its ill-fated price increase in 2011. Streaming video is very much for real. A rush by heavyweights, such as Amazon and Time Warner’s HBO, to catch Netflix only confirms this.And investors are pleased about Netflix’s ability to get customers to sign up. But how will it earn money? The international business lost $77m and will continue to be in the red as it reaches scale. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $42m. Original programming has generated buzz, but is not cheap (House of Cards, for example, cost $100m for two seasons). Acquiring third-party content is tough, too, with heightened competition from other streaming outlets. Netflix’s prior streaming agreement with the pay-TV channel Starz in 2008 was for $30m per year. Netflix chose not to renew this year when the annual price tag was pegged at above $200m annually. And unlike cable providers, Netflix is constrained in raising its $8/month subscriber fee with the memories of the 2011 mess still fresh. But these are questions for another day. Perhaps more pressing: when will Netflix release a more upbeat title?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
655;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Netflix boosted by original programming;Film and TV subscription service beats expectations;Netflix shares rose almost 25 per cent in after-market trading as the film and TV subscription service beat forecasts for the first quarter and added 3m new subscribers.The company, which now rivals Time Warner’s HBO for the number of subscribers it has in the US, launched House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey – the first of several original series to be released by Netflix this year.This weekend it launched Hemlock Grove, a horror series from Eli Roth, which it said attracted more viewers in its first weekend than House of Cards. In May it will release Arrested Development, a cult comedy much coveted by fans since it was taken off the air by the Fox network in 2006.Netflix’s push into original programming has positioned it as a more viable competitor to US pay-TV channels, such as HBO and CBS’s Showtime network. In his quarterly letter to shareholders, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said the House of Cards release had created a “halo effect on our entire service”.The company did not reveal viewing numbers for House of Cards but said more than 4bn hours of programming were viewed on Netflix across its service in the first quarter by its 36m subscribers.Netflix now has 29.17m subscribers in the US, up from 27.15m in the final quarter of last year. Internationally, it has 7.14m, up from 6.12m. Netflix is available in the US, Latin America, Canada and the UK. About a third of its new subscribers came from international markets: the company said it would launch in a new European market in the second half of the year.“People are generally moving towards internet video and internet TV and that’s boosting Hulu, YouTube and Netflix,” Mr Hastings told the Financial Times.A range of film and TV programmes are available on Netflix, but its increasing focus on original production has implications for some of the company’s other content deals. “As we continue to focus on exclusive and curated content, our willingness to pay for non-exclusive, bulk content deals declines,” said Mr Hastings. Netflix’s deal with Viacom, which includes programming from MTV and Nickelodeon, will be allowed to expire, he added. “We are in discussions with them about licensing particular shows but have yet to conclude a deal.”It recently bolstered its children’s programming with an exclusive deal for new Walt Disney titles, which will start in 2015. It has also partnered with DreamWorks Animation, the studio behind the Shrek films, and will release a TV show tied to Turbo, the company’s new movie about a racing snail.Revenue for the quarter ending on March 31 rose to $1.02bn from $869.8m in the comparable period last year. Net income was $2.7m compared with a loss of $4.6m. Earnings per share were 5 cents, compared with a loss of 8 cents.Mr Hastings added that Netflix was still recovering from 2011, when a botched re-branding, price-hike and separation of the company’s DVD and streaming business caused the shares to tumble from $300 to $60. “We were hopeful that if we were steady and applied ourselves and continued to build a great service, that our reputation would be restored,” he said.“But you can never know. There was legitimate worry that is not completely over. I’m glad we have had a great quarter but we still have a way to go…we are taking it quarter by quarter.”The shares were trading at about $217 in after-hours trading.
656;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-04-02T21:19:59Z;Companies allowed to tweet #USearnings;;Companies can now tweet their earnings in 140 characters or less.The Securities and Exchange Commission gave its permission on Tuesday for companies to use social media websites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to distribute their news, provided shareholders are told in advance which sites they plan to use.The decision could prompt a sea change in how companies communicate with investors and comes as regulators more broadly grapple with adapting decades-old regulations to new and evolving technologies.“We do not wish to inhibit the content, form or forum of any such disclosure, and we are mindful of placing additional compliance burdens on issuers,” the SEC said. “In fact, we encourage companies to seek out new forms of communication to better connect with shareholders.”Such a broad shift would not be without risks. Small shareholders who are not actively searching those websites for information could be placed at a disadvantage, it is feared.The decision also resolves an investigation into Netflix and Reed Hastings, its chief executive, who in July posted on his personal Facebook page that Netflix monthly viewing surpassed more than 1bn hours for the first time in June.Netflix had not issued a press release announcing the milestone, according to the SEC, and the information dribbled into the market first through blogs and then mainstream media reports, causing Netflix stock price to rise nearly 16 per cent by the following day.The SEC launched an investigation into whether he had violated rules requiring widespread distribution of market-moving information, known as Regulation Fair Disclosure.The SEC issued a Wells notice to Mr Hastings and Netflix in December warning they might be sued. On Tuesday the SEC said it had dropped the case “recognising that there has been market uncertainty about the application of Regulation FD to social media”.The SEC last faced disclosure issues and technology in 2006, when the chief executive of Sun Microsystems engaged in a public discussion with the then-SEC chairman Christopher Cox to ask whether the company could use its website instead of paid distribution services to release earnings information.The following year, the SEC issued guidance stating a company could use its website if it is a “recognised channel of distribution”. On Tuesday, the agency said those same factors should be applied to social media.The decision comes as regulators deal with the desire of companies to communicate more directly with their customers. Bank regulators are weighing rules to guide how financial institutions market products to customers. The SEC is also set to write rules this year to govern how companies can use crowdsourcing to raise money, an area state regulators have flagged as ripe for fraud.
657;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;S&P 500 edges away from record;;First Cyprus, now Italy. Again. The US equity market bulls who want to push the S&P 500 into record territory just cannot seem to catch a break.More than a month after Italians went to the polls, the narrow victor, the Democratic party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, remains unable to form a government, and the prospect of fresh elections and another long period of uncertainty damped the spirits of traders, when they were already nervous that the bailout terms imposed on Cyprus will fracture the eurozone.With so much to worry about, the S&P 500 slipped away again from its all-time high of 1,565.15, a record that has held since October 2007.This wasn’t for lack of trying, however. There were positive voices, and the index staged a late rally from its nadir to close down less than 0.1 per cent at 1,562.85.“The underlying reality is that European policy makers will adopt whatever policies have the best chance of succeeding,” Eric Green of TD Securities told his clients. The idea of hitting depositors to fund future bailouts, as in Cyprus, is unlikely to become a template, he said. “Our presumption is that it erodes the very confidence that policy has attempted to nurture over the past several years. If it cannot succeed, it will not be pursued.”Trading had a decidedly defensive mood, with healthcare stocks and utilities doing best, and financials among those lagging behind. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.8 per cent to $47.77, closely followed by Bank of America, which was off 0.4 per cent at $12.23.The Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue-chip stocks ended down 0.2 per cent at 14,526.16, but the late-afternoon rally took the Nasdaq Composite to a close up 0.1 per cent at 3,256.52.SAIC, a defence contractor, was a standout star of the S&P 500, up 3.9 per cent at $13.32 thanks to the announcement of a special dividend of $1 per share. Netflix, which has parlayed the buzz over its original television series House of Cards into new sales of its streaming service, started strongly for a second day, but eventually profit-takers edged the stock down 0.2 per cent to $190.24.Amazon was also a strong bid, up 1.9 per cent at $265.30 on more rumours that it is about to launch a smartphone to complement its range of Kindle tablets. Apple, the iPhone and iPad maker, was 2 per cent lower at $452.08 amid analyst comment on a consumer trend in favour of smaller, cheaper – and less profitable – tablets.JC Penney shares slipped 0.7 per cent at $14.89. The retailer has completed its 180-degree reversal of the strategy of chief executive Ron Johnson, and has now restarted discounts on its merchandise. When the former Apple retail boss joined the department store chain, he tried to impose low prices with no promotions, but sales cratered. The stock had been flirting with a three-year low amid reports of concern among its landlords in US malls, which fear store closures to come.Another ailing retailer, Best Buy, was also cheaper. The electronic retailer’s shares were down 2.4 per cent at $22.15 after S&P Capital IQ slapped on a “sell” recommendation. DSW, the footwear chain, was up 0.6 per cent at $63.70 after Citi analysts raised the stock to “buy”. Mattress Firm, mattress manufacturer, jumped 12.1 per cent to $34.77 following a Raymond James upgrade on the back of its fourth quarter figures.Cliffs Natural Resources was weak out of the gate and ended down 13.9 per cent to $18.46. Two brokers downgraded the stock, citing the weak iron ore market and rising costs. Credit Suisse said the group’s Great Lakes projects were becoming structurally less profitable.
658;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-03-24T13:45:27Z;Blockbuster rescued by private equity group;;Blockbuster UK, the entertainment retailer that fell into administration in January, has been bought by Gordon Brothers Europe, a private equity group, for an undisclosed sum.Some 264 Blockbuster stores across the UK and Channel Islands will continue to operate on a “business as usual” basis, saving more than 2,000 British jobs, the group said.Blockbuster had 528 stores across the UK employing 4,190 staff at the start of the year. It is one of several high street chains that have gone into administration this year following a plunge in profits.Since January, Jessops, the camera retailer, entertainment chain HMV and value fashion retailer Republic have all gone into administration, with the loss of more than 10,000 jobs.Blockbuster has been suffering following the launch of rival services such as Netflix and Lovefilm, which enable users to stream films and TV shows on their televisions and other devices such as tablets and PCs.Frank Morton, chief executive of Gordon Brothers Europe, said: “We know that we have a challenge ahead but there is still a market to be served. Blockbuster has a strong brand affinity and we believe that with the right mix of new product offering, new technologies, strategic management and marketing, we can bring new life to this high street staple.”Gary Warren, former commercial director of HMV in the UK, has been appointed as managing director of Blockbuster, the company said.Blockbuster, which has operated in the UK since 1989, has 2.9m active store members.
659;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-03-20T19:27:24Z;US heartland offers visions of cable’s future;Two announcements from Kansas and Colorado provide important pointers for the cable industry;It is 600 miles from Olathe, Kansas, to Englewood, Colorado, and both towns can seem a million miles from the media hubs of New York and Hollywood. Yet two announcements from the US heartland this week provide important pointers to the future of the cable industry and the content companies that depend on it.In Olathe, Google unveiled plans to roll out the fibre optic network it is testing in nearby Kansas City, offering broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. That is roughly 100 times faster than the country’s typical download rate, for $70 a month or $120 with a video service.One day “the Google guys” might bring to mind installers in grey uniforms rather than Larry Page and Sergey Brin. But Google Fibre is for the time being a tiny experiment, much debated for what it might mean to rivals yet – so far – with no clear plan to jump to the wider market.Few people know that market better than John Malone, Liberty Media’s Englewood-based chairman, who started Tele-Communications Inc in 1973 and became the world’s largest cable systems owner before selling TCI to AT&T in 1999.Mr Malone kept overseas cable interests after that through Liberty Global, which last month agreed a $23.3bn bid for Virgin Media in the UK. This week, he returned to the US cable business with a $2.6bn investment that bought him 27 per cent of Charter Communications.Opportunism often drives Mr Malone’s investments, but when he returns to a game he has sat out for 14 years, it is worth asking what has changed.The answer, according to his chief executive, Greg Maffei, is that cable’s “pipes” are becoming more valuable. At first glance, this sounds counterintuitive. Much of the debate around the sector has been about pressure on margins after a decade of steep content cost inflation, and the possibility that Americans picking and choosing their viewing from cheaper digital providers, such as Netflix, will “cut the cord” that has attached them umbilically to cable companies for so long.SNL Kagan analysts estimate that the cable industry lost 1.66m video customers in 2012. You can quibble about whether the reasons are cyclical or secular, but this only tells half the story. First, US cable companies’ average revenues per video subscriber (video ARPUs) have shot up from about $35 to about $75 since 2000, according to IHS Screen Digest.Rising ARPUs are great for cable companies, showing that they can pass on escalating sports rights costs, but it has turned cable subscriptions into a significant expense in US household budgets. Price-sensitive consumers have every incentive to look at alternatives.Analysts think Mr Malone could make it more likely that Charter will drop weaker networks from its line-up. TV content companies collected more than $35bn from pay-TV distributors last year, according to Nomura, so much is at stake. If cable companies trim the numbers of channels they offer, they also risk accelerating the trend of consumers seeing less value in their video packages, upending the model Mr Malone helped define.The second and more important change since TCI’s day is that cable subscribers now see more value in their broadband connections than their TV offerings.Gerald Belson, head of Deloitte’s media and entertainment practice, says when it asked US consumers in previous years which services they most valued, 80 to 90 per cent put internet access and pay TV in the top three. This year, 93 per cent cent chose internet access but only 58 per cent named pay-TV. Among those aged 14 to 23, the pay-TV figure falls to 43 per cent.This question over cable’s core TV product looks worrying. Yet consumers’ attitudes towards broadband show why Mr Malone and Google may both be right.The same Deloitte survey reports that 59 per cent of consumers would pay more if they could have faster internet service, up from 49 per cent in 2009. The first thing they want to do with those faster connections is watch more video.That suggests cable operators have room to use high-margin broadband revenues to support a TV product that is under pressure. Their ability to bundle TV, broadband and phone services also gives them a growing advantage over satellite rivals without the broadband component.There are two cautionary notes, however. Competition, from established competitors such as AT&T’s U-verse and new entrants including Google Fibre, still poses a long-term risk to US cable’s pricing power. And now that US consumers have discovered an appetite for the fast broadband many other countries enjoy, their cable companies will have to invest to satisfy it.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’ media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
660;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-03-05T20:51:32Z;Tesco TV to target loyal customers;;Tesco will today launch Clubcard TV, an online service showing movies and TV shows, as it looks to mine the rich data from its loyalty scheme to enable brands to target their adverts based on individual spending habits.The new service will launch with hundreds of movies and TV shows, following content deals with companies such as Warner Brothers, Endemol and Aardman Animations. Unlike rival services such as Lovefilm or Netflix, Clubcard TV will be free to the supermarket chain’s 16m loyalty card customers.Matthew Horsman, managing director at media consultancy Mediatique, said the launch reflected wider advertising trends, whereby brands are looking for much deeper knowledge about the people consuming content.“Advertisers love the idea that they can know more about the eyeballs in question,” he said. “There is huge interest in developing more rich and granular data on user interaction with content. But whether advertisers are prepared to pay for it is another matter.”In order to use Tesco’s new online video service, customers will have to log in using their loyalty card account number. Through this, the supermarket chain will be able to offer brands sophisticated ad targeting by mining viewers’ spending history.This could, for example, allow a nappy brand not just to target households with families but also only those homes that purchase a rival product.Tesco said advertisers would also receive post-campaign analytics, allowing brands to track how their advertising had translated into actual sales. Advertisers that have signed up for the launch include Kellogg’s, Colgate and Danone.Advertising executives said Tesco’s move in part reflected the strong growth in on-demand video, on the back of the faster speeds and wider penetration of broadband.“We’ve seen the video-on-demand space grow exponentially over the last couple of years,” said one TV advertising executive. “The success of Netflix has clearly been a positive thing for the market.”Initially the service will only be available on laptops and PCs. But Tesco plans to roll it out to other devices as well as set-top boxes, smart TVs and games consoles.Tesco is targeting the family market and will give users access to films such The Shawshank Redemption and The Wind in the Willows or TV shows such as The only Way is Essex.The move comes as Tesco is re-emphasising its Clubcard in a push to revive its UK business after its profit warning in January 2012. It is seeking to increasingly personalise promotions rather than issuing offers such as newspaper vouchers.It also comes as Tesco is preparing to launch a new scheme that will compare prices at its tills and issue money-off vouchers if Asda, J Sainsbury or Wm Morrison are cheaper. This marks its biggest price initiative for 18 months.
661;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-02-21T12:20:39Z;Sony bets on new PlayStation for recovery;;Sony unveiled plans to launch its next-generation PlayStation 4 games and entertainment platform by Christmas 2013 but failed to show the console it had been expected to reveal.At an event in New York on Wednesday, Andy House, chief executive of Sony Consumer Entertainment, promised improved graphics, social gaming features, the ability to start playing while games are still loading and a new version of Sony’s DualShock handheld controller with a touch-sensitive pad.The PS4, with an advanced eight-core processor, will support Netflix and other unnamed cloud-based services and feature tighter integration with mobile devices including Sony’s own Vita handheld.A succession of developers including Ubisoft, Blizzard and Bungie showcased games in development for the PS4, some of which will be exclusive to the new console.However, Sony did not show off the device itself, despite intense interest in the prospects for console hardware at a time when many gamers are moving to online gamers and mobile devices.The launch marks the start of an attempt by the Japanese electronics group to wrest leadership in the video gaming market from Microsoft’s rival Xbox console and offset years of losses in its television business.Mr House described the PS4 as “more than just a games console”, saying it had been designed to meet the expectations of the most demanding games players.However, Sony is also positioning the PS4 as a digital home entertainment centre capable of delivering a wide range of content including movies and music to users in the living room. Sony is betting heavily on the device to help it recapture its leadership of the lucrative games market from Microsoft, which is expected to launch a successor to the Xbox 360 this year.James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research, said before the event: “Sony needs a big hit with this game console not just because it has lost its dominance in gaming to Microsoft’s Xbox 360 but because the company needs to make what might be its last attempt to be relevant not as a device maker but as a digital platform company: the kind of company that uses digital tools and devices to have an ongoing relationship with customers, not just a company that can make and sell devices and gadgets.”Yoshinori Ono from Capcom, developers of video game Resident Evil, said the first new PlayStation in seven years would enable “a new level of film-like realism” previously preserved for computer-generated films.Yoshihisa Hashimoto, chief technology officer of Square Enix, which announced plans for a new Final Fantasy game at the event, called the PlayStation 4 “a game developer’s dream”.“This platform will bring millions of new customers,” added Yves Guillemot of Ubisoft, describing the PS4 as “more connective, more immersive and more interactive”.Mr House described the console as being like a supercharged personal computer. “Today marks a moment of truth and a bold step forward for PlayStation,” he said.The PS4 represented a significant shift from thinking of the PlayStation as merely a box to thinking of it “as a leading authority on play”, he said.Sony shares closed down 1.8% or Y24 at Y1,331 on Thursday in Tokyo after the two-hour presentation.
662;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-02-20T17:34:02Z;New screens require new TV strategy;There is encouraging news for content owners in data on internet video use;When the season finale of Downton Abbey aired on PBS last Sunday, some of the 8.2m US viewers could be forgiven for feeling let down. Not only because a favourite character was killed off, but because many of them knew that fact on Christmas day, when British viewers saw the episode and tweeted their reaction or shared it on peer-to-peer torrent sites.Julian Fellowes, Downton’s creator, expressed his frustration in a New York Times interview.“The thinking behind different screenings belongs to a different era,” he said. Fellowes knows a thing or two about different eras. Content “windowing” strategies may not make great costume drama any time soon, but such venerable media customs are looking as threatened by change as his characters.American fans are relatively lucky. “Australia gets everything last,” notes Sean Knapp, chief technology officer of Ooyala, the online video platform, so the temptation to seek out shows on peer-to-peer torrent sites is higher. As Charlie Ergen, chairman of Dish Network, said last week: “People will steal it if you don’t make it easy.”Indeed Game of Thrones, last year’s most pirated programme, was downloaded particularly often in Australia, according to TorrentFreak, which tracks filesharing sites. Telstra, the Australian broadband provider, is now testing “throttling” of peer-to-peer traffic on its network.Traditional media companies, once again, have reason to feel nervous but in truth there is encouraging news for content owners in the latest data on rapidly growing internet video consumption.For a start, a market once defined by YouTube’s user-generated clips is starting to look more like TV. Ooyala sees long-form programming – TV shows and films – growing much faster than short videos.Hardware has played a role: it is easier to watch a half-hour show on a tablet, connected TV or games console plugged into the living room screen. Debates about whether Sony is right to bring out a fourth-generation PlayStation as gaming moves online often ignore such devices’ importance for accessing video content.Investments in original programming from digital distributors such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have also helped, and the Olympics proved there is an appetite for watching lengthy live events online.There is even a migration back to a form of linear viewing, in which you finish watching one video and a recommendation engine serves up the next, tempting you to stay glued to your screen, whatever size it may be.Russian meteor sightings are a reminder of the huge and growing audience for short clips, but the shift is clear. “We’re seeing the form of content change back towards TV, but with a very different engagement model,” Mr Knapp says.Content owners increasingly see a revenue model too. Informa predicts that the global online video market will be worth $37bn by 2017, and Morgan Stanley estimates Time Warner, News Corp, CBS and Viacom will each earn $200m-$350m from online video this year.YouTube is exploring cable-style subscriptions for some of its channels, which feature increasingly professional content from production companies such as Fullscreen, Machinima and Maker Studios. Its ad revenues are also becoming substantial, rising two-thirds to $1.3bn last year, according to Pivotal Research.“Bringing TV dollars to digital”, as ComScore put it last week, sounds threatening to people who depend on TV dollars, pounds or euros. But as online video ad rates improve, they can still collect that money if they make their content available at the right price online.The most sensible way to do so while protecting traditional revenues still looks like the “TV Everywhere” model of providing content to pay-TV subscribers on any device. Also making it available to non-subscribers willing to pay for it would be more sensible still.TV has immense staying power and will coexist with digital video for years, but if fans are going to illegal sites for episodes they cannot find legally, content owners are needlessly missing out on potential download, subscription and ad revenue.They are also annoying their customers. As James McQuivey of Forrester Research puts it in his book, Digital Disruption, “what has changed is consumers’ ability to get what they want. This has led them to expect that their needs and wants can and should be met”.When consumer expectations change, companies had better change with them.

663;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-02-15T20:05:43Z;Primetime arrives in saga of TV takeovers;;Life is imitating art in the cable industry. Two years ago, in an episode of 30 Rock, the NBC comedy about a thinly fictionalised NBC, the characters watched as a Kabletown logo replaced the GE sign atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza. “It’s happening,” Alec Baldwin’s character said dolefully to Liz Lemon, played by Tina Fey, as he mourned NBC’s takeover by a giant cable company.This week, naming rights to the GE building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza passed to Comcast, as the largest US cable operator paid GE $18.1bn to buy the 49 per cent of NBCUniversal it did not already own, along with NBC properties including the studios housed in the art deco tower.The deal was one of a wave of mergers fuelled by obliging credit markets. Warren Buffett’s $28bn bid for Heinz, the $11bn American Airlines-US Airways merger and the $24.4bn Dell buyout have led to predictions of a new surge in dealmaking. Across sixth Avenue from NBC, the Time Life building was shaken by news of a planned spin-off of most of Time Warner’s magazines.But cable is enjoying a particularly notable revival in animal spirits. Comcast’s deal, struck more than a year ahead of expectations, came a week after John Malone’s Liberty Globalmade a $23.3bn offer for Virgin Media, the UK cable operator.Meanwhile, Vodafone is looking at Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s largest cable company, and Charter Communications is spending $1.63bn on Optimum West, a US cable system once called Bresnan that rival Cablevision acquired only two years ago for $1.4bn.Analysts can point to company-specific reasons for each deal, such as Comcast’s fear that NBC’s improving performance would make a buyout costlier in the long run, but sector-wide factors are also playing a role.“It’s a subset of media that benefits from scale,” one media banker says, noting the savings larger cable companies can glean when buying set-top boxes or network technology. “Couple that with the debt markets and an economic backdrop with more clarity and it’s a recipe for transactions with a bit more boldness,” he adds.Low interest rates should allow Liberty Global to price almost $8bn of debt to help finance the Virgin Media deal at yields of less than 6 per cent. “Credit markets have never been stronger for companies like ours,” one US cable executive says.Large telecoms groups are hoping to reverse the long-term decline in traditional voice revenues across Europe with innovative bundled packages of television, high speed internet access and home and mobile phone connectivity, writes Daniel Thomas.The importance placed on these “quad plays” underpins Vodafone’s interest in Kabel Deutschland. That was not a great surprise to many analysts, given clear statements in the past by management that Vodafone would develop its “converged” fixed and mobile network by borrowing, building or buying lines.If it were to buy Kabel Deutschland, Vodafone could also extract cost savings as it would own more of the fixed network that supplies its mobile masts. The emphasis by Vittorio Colao, chief executive, on convergence has increased markedly over the past year, with recent complaints that some European incumbents have refused to open up their networks to Vodafone.It has instead built or co-invested in fibre in Portugal and Italy, while its largest acquisition for several years was the purchase of Cable & Wireless Worldwide in the UK in 2012. Vodafone has also been linked with cable operators such as Ono in Spain and Ziggo in the Netherlands.Vodafone is still regarded by many investors as a purely mobile operator – the part of the telecoms market that has suffered the worst from the economic downturn and regulatory revenue cuts – even though it owns fixed line networks across Europe.Vodafone made fixed line revenues of £1.3bn in the last quarter, almost a third of which was generated in Germany.The UK-listed company could combine its 3.2m broadband and 150,000 TV customers in Germany with Kabel Deutschland’s 8.5m households should any offer succeed.A Berenberg Bank study of 1,000 households in the UK, France and Germany found that demand for bundling services was robust.The German bank’s survey found that “bundling begets more bundling” and that there was a correlation between increased levels of bundling and higher levels of customer satisfaction. That could result in lower potential churn rates.Indeed, customers are also less likely to cancel triple- or quad-play contracts because of the nuisance of replacing all three or four services.Cable companies are also finding it easier to attract capital because investors are more confident that they have a competitive advantage over satellite, telecom and online video rivals. Where cable companies once pitched their own selection of TV channels, now they market themselves increasingly on fast broadband speeds. “Superfast broadband is something most consumers really get in an intuitive way,” one US cable executive says.The Federal Communications Commission says that the average speed US subscribers sign up for has risen about 20 per cent in the last year to 15.6 Mbps, showing consumers’ appetite for faster connections.Analysts say that in Europe the high quality of cable assets in comparison to the digital subscriber line technology that telecoms incumbents typically use will prove a particular advantage as bandwidth-hungry services such as high definition video on demand becomes more popular.“We’ve always been fans of cable,” says Nick Brown, analyst at Espirito Santo. “The cable assets in Europe are of a very high quality and they now have a competitive advantage over the incumbents. Really the only thing the incumbents could do in the long term to defend themselves is invest more heavily in fibre.”In Europe, where cable evolved as a more regulated utility than in the US, average prices for cable video packages are also typically lower – about €30 per month as opposed to the $80-$100 US cable operators charge. The saving in switching to a €6-€7 monthly Lovefilm or Netflix subscription therefore looks less compelling.Fears remain that customers are “cord-cutting” and finding their video by other means. Online video viewing is soaring, with ComScore this week estimating that each month 182m Americans consume 19.2 hours of video on sites such as YouTube, Hulu, Vevo and Yahoo.Yet industry executives argue that cable can coexist with “over the top” alternatives such as Netflix, LoveFilm, Apple’s iTunes, Amazon Prime or Aereo. A new generation of set top boxes is offering on-demand video streaming and other providers’ apps, sometimes harnessing the very internet video services that threaten to take viewers away from traditional cable channels.“We already have the programming relationships, unlike Netflix and Lovefilm, who begin life subscale and have to pay up to create a catalogue of compelling content,” one cable executive says.Comcast’s takeover of NBC is a marriage of distribution and content that contrasts with Time Warner’s decision to spin off its cable business from its TV networks and film studios in 2009. Distributors’ resurgence since then has not come at content owners’ cost. Shares in Comcast have tracked content stocks such as CBS, Time Warner and Walt Disney remarkably closely over the past year.The distributors still face real threats, from the rising cost of programming and weak housing and employment figures to the risk that their lead in broadband speeds will be threatened as the likes of Verizon and BT invest in faster “fibre to the home” technology.But with a market capitalisation of $109bn, Comcast is now America’s largest media company, $10bn bigger than Disney. NBC’s satirists may not approve, but cable now has the tallest tower on the corporate media skyline.
664;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-02-06T19:46:46Z;Time Warner: barriers to love;Three problems to overcome to ensure investors’ embrace;Time Warner deserves some love. Its fourth-quarter earnings, announced on Wednesday, were plenty attractive. Operating earnings grew 16 per cent. An outlook for double-digit bottom-line growth in 2013 was given. As always, the company generated oodles of free cash flow – a billion dollars’ worth, or 12 per cent of revenues. The balance sheet remains solid. The company’s strong franchises, from HBO to the Batman movies, should protect its strong returns for years to come.Yet the shares – even after a 5 per cent pop on Wednesday – trade at an unromantic 14 times this year’s earnings. If they traded at Disney’s 16 times, the stock would be at $60, not $52. What does Time Warner need to do to be embraced by investors?There are three problems. First, and least importantly, the publishing division: while it now produces less than a 10th of operating profits, it is shrinking fast enough to dent overall growth. It is hard to say where the magazine industry will stabilise, making spinning off or selling the division tricky. Second, content costs: Time Warner’s cable networks have to pay for much of the programming they show, and prices – especially for sports programming – are heading up. This will hurt less if it can raise the prices it charges pay TV companies for the content it produces and packages. That leads to the third (and most hyped) barrier to a love affair with investors: that it will be hard to raise prices because there are lots of new, cheap ways to watch video – Netflix, for example.This last problem seems overblown. The multimillion dollar content deal Time Warner signed with Netflix last month – and Netflix’s falling margins – shows that new outlets for video are, for now, a fresh revenue stream, not a threat to Time Warner. The haters who think this is going to change still have to prove their case.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
665;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-02-05T19:44:38Z;Liberty eyes fresh transatlantic conquest;;"It has taken him more than a decade, but John Malone may at last be about to shake up UK television and communications in a bigger way than anyone imagined when the most successful dealmaker in the US cable industry first set his sights on the British market.The latest bid for Virgin Media by Mr Malone’s international cable group, Liberty Global, bears many of the hallmarks of his past deals. It is opportunistic in its timing – coming as Virgin Media was looking for a new chief executive to succeed Neil Berkett – fuelled by debt and crucially underpinned by historic tax losses in Virgin Media that could ensure that little or no cash leaks out of the business to tax authorities.It is also one of his boldest moves in years, threatening to reshape both the UK market and the cable and telecoms sector in Europe and beyond.In 2002, armed with a 24 per cent stake in Telewest, he sought to disrupt the UK cable TV market with two ultimately unsuccessful approaches to rival NTL. Now he has a second chance.A successfully completed deal “could signal a change atop the global pay-TV hierarchy,” says Ted Hall, senior analyst at Informa Telecoms & Media.Any deal could have big implications for the most famous man in UK pay-TV: Rupert Murdoch.Mr Malone has been both an ally and a rival to Mr Murdoch over many years, but he is entering the UK market at a time when analysts and rivals are asking whether the once unthinkable idea of Mr Murdoch selling out of the UK pay-TV market might be possible.Chase Carey, Mr Murdoch’s chief operating officer, has spoken about the group’s desire to clean up investments where it does not have full control by either buying 100 per cent or selling out entirely.News Corp’s attempt to take over BSkyB in 2011 failed, of course, following an outcry over phone hacking at some of his UK newspapers.News Corp has directed more of its capital to content acquisitions in recent years instead of expanding distribution platforms such as its Sky brands and Star TV in Asia. An exit from BSkyB – perhaps accompanied by sales of Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland – could allow it to pivot from distribution to content at a time when pay-TV platforms face growing digital competition from the likes of Netflix, iTunes and YouTube.The UK is Europe’s largest pay TV market and Virgin Media, with about 5m customers and a cable footprint covering 13m homes, is the second largest pay-TV operator. Most important, with pay-TV penetration running at about 50 per cent in the UK, trailing established markets such as the US, there is still further room to grow.Having a powerful new backer could enable Virgin to compete more aggressively. This would allow it to invest heavily in infrastructure in a bid to extend its broadband lead or even join in bidding wars for sports or film content, analysts said.“Virgin sits between two well-heeled triple play competitors – Sky and BT,” says Matthew Horsman, analyst at Mediatique, a media consultancy.“Probably having access to investment is going to be important going forward.”Some analysts speculated that a stronger rival in the UK could heighten competition for content rights. Not only is BT investing heavily in sports content as it seeks to attract news users to its TV offering – but new online video providers such as Lovefilm are also bidding aggressively for film and TV content.Given that Virgin Media’s policy has been not to own sports and film content but to wholesale it from rivals such as Sky, any change in stance at the cable operator could have a significant impact on prices paid for key media content.Following the recent overturning of the UK Competition Commission ruling that forced Sky to wholesale its sports rights to rival operators, a change in ownership at Virgin Media could also encourage Sky to review these crucial wholesale arrangements with its cable rival, some analysts said.Sky insiders suggested there would be no change, insisting that the company already wholesales content to Liberty’s operations in Ireland. But Mr Malone would have to weigh up raising borrowing levels at the UK cable operator in a bid to increase future investment returns while also leaving headroom to invest heavily in the UK business.With consensus expectations of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £1.75bn in the year to the end of December this year, its net debt of £5.5bn could be increased to as high as six times ebitda, analysts said.Still, Liberty’s precise motives for acquiring Virgin Media remain unclear.One may be valuation. Analysts at Bernstein Research said Virgin Media was trading at a near 15 per cent discount to its peers on enterprise value to ebitda multiple.Another could be Virgin Media’s substantial tax losses – estimated to run to about £5bn – following writedowns of the company’s huge investment in its cable infrastructure.These losses would have significant value if they could be offset against the profits of another UK business. That led some analysts to speculate that stage two of Liberty’s plan could be to use Virgin Media to acquire ITV, the broadcaster, echoing the move made in 2009 when Comcast bought NBCUniversal from General Electric.This would have two benefits: it would change – Virgin Media’s standing in the content wars; and would allow ITV’s profits to be non-taxable for as long as 30 years, according to some analyst estimates.*The chart associated with this article has been updated since original publication to clarify the fact that the figure for BSkyB subscribers includes Ireland"
666;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Wall Street rises after payrolls data;;US equity markets rose sharply on payrolls data and a strong ISM reading, both pointing to the US economy being on a better footing than previously thought.Non-farm payrolls figures showed the US economy added 157,000 jobs in January, while the numbers for November and December were also revised higher, suggesting the labour market was improving at the end of 2012.The increase in the ISM manufacturing index also indicates that the improvement in global factory conditions, evident in the rebound in various global PMIs, has spread to the US.The S&P 500 index rose 1 per cent on Friday and added 0.7 per cent over the week to 1,513.16 recording the fifth consecutive weekly gain this year. All major sectors rose with telecoms and financial stocks leading the gains.“US equity markets have the power of the freight train in the form of the quantitative easing by the Fed and we would not be surprised if the rally continued for a while,” said Martin Leclerc, chief investment officer at Barrack Yard Advisors.“We are not negative on stocks as an asset class, but we favour careful investment selection rather than asset allocation, as we consider current valuations as too high,” he added.The CBOE Vix index, which measures implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, fell 9.5 per cent to below 13, irking some analysts who find the markets unusually complacent.“A moderate level of volatility is something to be welcomed in our opinion, not feared,” wrote Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.Netflix shares gave up earlier gains to close slightly lower at $164.80 and shedding 2.8 per cent over the week. The stock rose as high as 4 per cent earlier after news that a survey conducted by Frank N. Magid Associates revealed 25 per cent of US households now use the video streaming service, up from 20 per cent a year ago.The stock was also upgraded by an analyst at Albert Fried, who said the company might buy AMC networks.Netflix surprised investors last month by reporting a fourth-quarter net income when the consensus estimates were for a quarterly loss. Shares stand 78 per cent higher since the start of the year.BlackBerry shares lost more than a quarter of their value during the past week, in spite of the launch of its new generation of smartphones on Wednesday.BlackBerry, formerly called Research In Motion, unveiled Z10 and Q10 devices globally. However, the company is not able to start selling them in the US until some time in March, due to delays in carriers testing the phones on their networks. Shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $13.02 on Friday.Facebook shares lost 5.7 per cent to $30.26 over the past week, after falling 4 per cent on Friday. The social networking site reported late on Wednesday that fourth-quarter net profits topped analysts’ estimates. But investors tempered their views on the company’s performance for 2013, citing increased research and development spending.Verizon shares rose 2.2 per cent to $44.56 after analysts at Piper Jaffray upgraded the stock to “overweight”, citing its wireless network as best-in-class and its ability to increase dividends in 2013. Shares gained 4.4 per cent over the week.Rival AT&T also attracted buyers, with shares adding 2.1 per cent to $35.51 and rising 4.4 per cent on the week.In IPO news, Zoetis, which raised $2.24bn in its initial public offering on Thursday, began its first trading day with a jump. The company sold 86.1m shares at $26 each, above its initially planned range of between $22 and $25 per share.Shares in the animal-health business, spun off from Pfizer, soared 18.4 per cent to $30.79 on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, rose 1.1 per cent to 14,009.79, breaching the 14,000 level for the first time since 2007. The oldest benchmark gained 0.8 per cent over the week.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2 per cent to 3,179.10 – up 0.9 per cent on the week.Dell shares gave up some of its steep gains to finish the week 3.6 per cent higher at $13.63 on reports that a buyout deal could come early next week. Dell shares have gained more than 34 per cent since it emerged last month that private equity firms were in talks to take the PC maker private.In earnings news, Merck reported fourth-quarter results that were better than analysts’ forecast. However, the drugmaker’s shares dropped after the company said its 2013 earnings would decline. The stock fell 3.3 per cent to $41.83 and shed 3.7 per cent over the week.
667;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-31T18:47:56Z;House of Cards helps Netflix cut the cord;;The Washington preview screening this week of House of Cards had the air of a typical Hollywood premiere.An audience of political journalists, pundits – even the British ambassador – was shown the first two episodes of the new, $100m series. Guests mingled afterwards with Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright and other House of Cards stars, sipping champagne and nibbling canapés.There is one crucial difference between the series and other expensively produced TV shows featuring A-list film talent more familiar to audiences from their appearances on the big screen. House of Cards, a US political drama, will be aired only on Netflix, the subscription video service, and all 13 episodes will be made available simultaneously around the world Friday.“It’s the first time anyone has done something like this, taking a big-scale production that costs millions of dollars per episode and released it all at once,” Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times. Last week in his quarterly letter to shareholders, he hailed the House of Cards launch as “a defining moment in the development of internet TV”.“Two years ago [when Netflix acquired the series] it may have been a big gamble,” he said. “But now that gamble is looking very good because of the growth of internet TV and the quality of the show.”The series is the most expensive original web series ever produced. Directed by David Fincher, who made hits that include The Social Network, Fight Club and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it is based on the 1990 BBC series of the same name. Netflix outbid established premium cable channels – including Time Warner’s HBO – when it acquired the series and, with five other original programmes in production, intends to use new “originals” to retain subscribers – and attract new ones.Netflix and rival online video providers such as Amazon, which also has a subscription service, and Hulu, which is owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast, hope to capture viewers who are “cutting the cord” with cable and satellite television. Put off by the rising cost of cable subscriptions, which are being inflated by the rising costs of sports media rights, many viewers are seeking cheaper alternatives online.Original production is more cost effective for Netflix and its rivals, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG, in a research note. “With the cost of exclusive syndicated content escalating as competition builds, success in original programming . . . should help Netflix better manage its spending.” This will allow it to “give up on less important content that it originally paid for to build scale”.The House of Cards launch coincides with a resurgence in Netflix shares, which rose sharply last week when the company said it had attracted more subscribers in the pre-Christmas period than it had expected, taking its global customer base to 33m.Investors have endured a turbulent two years. In the summer of 2011 Netflix shares touched a high of $300, but after a series of missteps, including a botched price increase and rebranding, went into a downward spiral, falling as low as $53. They roared back to life last week, rising 70 per cent, and are now hovering at $165.Mr Hastings said the company was used to the rollercoaster ride. “We went public 11 years ago at $7.50 and promptly traded down to $2.50 so our stock has always been volatile and that takes a strong stomach. But throughout the ups and downs our north star has always been to build the best internet TV network.”When the stock tumbled last year the company was mentioned as a takeover target. Carl Icahn, the activist investor, built a 10 per cent stake and criticised the board. The value of his stake has since increased by more than $600m.Mr Hastings said shifting consumer habits were moving in Netflix’s favour. “As the internet grows, we grow.” He added: “A reason piracy is so big is because people are frustrated . . . they might be able to get the first two or three seasons of a show like Mad Men but not all five. We’re trying to change that.”With Netflix’s biggest bet on original content about to air, relations have even improved with Time Warner, HBO’s parent. The two companies have clashed over the years but Netflix recently struck new content deals for programming made by Turner Broadcasting and Warner Brothers, two Time Warner subsidiaries. “We wrote big cheques,” said Mr Hastings. “It has a habit of improving things.”
668;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-29T18:51:22Z;YouTube to switch on paid-for video;;YouTube plans to start selling subscriptions to some channels on its video platform, throwing the Google-owned site into direct competition with cable television and streaming services such as Netflix.The company has invited a small number of content producers to submit proposals for channels that would charge $1-$5 per month, according to a person familiar with the matter.The paid-for channels would be launched as soon as the second quarter this year, the person said. YouTube, which has until now relied entirely on advertising, plans to take about 45 per cent of subscription revenues for itself and give the rest to the channel producer.“We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models,” said a YouTube spokesperson. “There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we’re looking at that.”YouTube has in recent years pushed to make the content on its platform more professional and therefore more attractive to advertisers.To do so, YouTube allowed companies to create dedicated channels and split the advertising revenues, working with the likes of All3Media, Endemol and BBC Worldwide. MondoMedia, a group that produces off-beat adult cartoons, was the most popular channel on YouTube last week with 6m views and has been seen 1.4bn times since inception.YouTube’s shift into premium paid-for channels raises the stakes in the fast-evolving online video sector, which is beginning to resemble the early days of cable television before it grew into a multibillion-dollar business. The YouTube plans were first reported by Advertising Age.The site will face competition from a plethora of subscription services that already exist online. Hulu, which is jointly owned by Walt Disney, News Corporation and Comcast, has 3m subscribers and offers a range of TV programming from US TV networks such as ABC and Fox.Netflix, the world’s biggest online video service, has more than 30m subscribers and will this week premiere its $100m adaptation of the BBC series “House of Cards”.Directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey, the series represents the biggest bet yet on original content made by Netflix or any of its competitors: Hulu and Amazon, which also has a subscription video service, are also producing original content to lure subscribers and differentiate themselves from TV networks and rival online operators.Google started to make a $100m investment in original content commissions for YouTube in late 2011. The funds are provided to film makers in the form of an advance against future advertising revenues.According to eMarketer, a research firm, advertising spending on digital video in the US grew by 47 per cent to $2.9bn last year but is still dwarfed by the $65bn spent on TV ads.Television made up about 40 per cent of total media spending in the US in 2012, according to eMarketer, compared with less than 2 per cent from online video.
669;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-25T22:01:02Z;Wall Street rises on positive earnings;;US stocks climbed for a fourth consecutive week despite weakness in shares of Apple, which lost its position as the world’s largest company by market value as technology sector results came into focus.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,502.96 on Friday as stocks moved higher for an eight straight session – the first time that has happened since 2004.The benchmark finished the shortened trading week above the 1,500 threshold, gaining 1.1 per cent to close at a fresh five-year high.The advances came as policy makers in Washington took steps to delay a showdown over the nation’s borrowing limit until May.Investment strategists said the move removed some of the macro-level uncertainty that had been holding back stocks.“We are encouraged by recent legislation to sever the issue of spending cuts from the debt ceiling,” said David Bianco, US equity strategist at Deutsche Bank. “A higher debt ceiling sidelines the tail risk of default on debt or entitlement payments and puts the focus on a new spending cut agreement.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8 per cent for the week to 13,895.98. The Nasdaq Composite index lagged behind and rose just 0.5 per cent to 3,149.71 as the tech-heavy measure was held back by the sharp losses in Apple.Shares in the iPhone maker slid 12 per cent to $439.88 on the week, suffering a steep decline on Thursday after investors reacted negatively to its latest quarterly results.On Friday, Apple lost the distinction of being the world’s largest company by market value as its capitalisation slipped to $413bn and below that of oil major ExxonMobil. Exxon, which rose 1 per cent to $91.68 for the week, finished with a market value of $418.2bn.As Apple fell to its lowest level in a year, analysts attributed the declines to questions about the company’s ability to sustain its robust growth rates and margins.Colin Gillis, tech analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Competitors are using price as a lever to get traction in the market. Apple may also run into difficulty posting both the volumes and maintaining its prices over the next several quarters.”Shares in Apple have fallen 37.3 per cent from their September peak.The losses dragged on the S&P 500 information technology index, which was 0.5 per cent lower for the week.That drop came despite better performances from other heavyweights in the sector, including Google and Microsoft.Google climbed 6.9 per cent to $753.67 for the week as the online search company said it had stemmed the slide in its advertising prices caused by the shift to mobile internet use.Meanwhile, Microsoft shares gained 2.3 per cent to $27.88 even as the world’s biggest software company said its latest quarterly figures were depressed by weak demand for its latest operating system.Netflix was among the week’s biggest risers as its shares enjoyed a two-day surge that began on Thursday after it reported a surprise profit and said subscribers grew by 2.5m in its latest quarter.Shares in the company recorded a 71 per cent gain for the week to $169.90 and were trading at their highest level in a year.Procter & Gamble rose 4.7 per cent for the week to $73.25 as the world’s biggest consumer group by sales reported a rise in profits for the three months to the end of December, narrowly beating analysts’ forecasts.Honeywell moved 0.8 per cent higher for the week to $68.33 as the diversified industrial group said its latest quarterly figures were lifted by growing demand for commercial aerospace products.Starbucks climbed 3.6 per cent for the week to $56.81 after the coffee retailer said sales rose almost 11 per cent in 2012 to $3.8bn.Fresh housing data released this week continued to show signs that the sector’s recovery was gaining traction. The reports helped lift the S&P 500 homebuilders index by 3.2 per cent this week.One of last year’s top returning industry groups has gained 13.73 per cent so far this month.
670;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-25T13:25:05Z;Letter from Lex - tech support;A week of US tech giants and a rush back to Japan;The week began with a two-term US president taking the oath of inauguration for the fourth time (don’t ask), but most investors were focused on American giants of another kind. The biggest of them all, Apple, saw its shares plunge 10 per cent as falling margins resulted in zero growth in net income.There was better news from two huge swaths of the digital market – internet advertising and corporate IT – as Google and IBM reported fourth-quarter results. Two other household names also did well – Facebook has seen its shares rise 50 per cent since mid-November due to excitement about new revenue-driving features while Netflix shares soared more than 30 per cent after it reported a sharp increase in subscribers. The largest US telecoms company, Verizon, is also doing nicely thanks to the smartphone.In Europe results from Nokia were nowhere near as strong as those from the US, but the Finnish phonemaker is definitely making progress. Elsewhere on the continent, industrial goods companies are also busy putting their houses in order. Siemens is cutting costs and attempting to manage its portfolio of assets more aggressively while Alstom’s transport unit is propping up its weaker thermal power side.Meanwhile the top men at two other large European companies grabbed the headlines. The chairman of the biggest pharma group, Novatis, stepped down after 17 years while Unilever’s chief executive chose to present solid full-year results dressed in a spacesuit (don’t ask).Finally in Asia, investors are turning bullish on Japan once again as the yen weakens, but it may not depreciate as much as many think. In corporate news, Samsung warned of intensifying price competition from a slew of new products and a sales slowdown in developed markets that is bound to hurt.

671;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-23T23:42:54Z;Netflix soars as 2m subscribers added;;Netflix shares soared more than 30 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported a sharp increase in subscribers and beat forecasts with an unexpected profit in the fourth quarter.The TV and movie streaming service company has endured a roller-coaster two years marred by a botched rebranding and a price rise.But its shares have stabilised in recent months, thanks in part to an exclusive output deal agreed with Walt Disney, which will give Netflix access to the company’s new movies from 2016.Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said in a letter to shareholders that the Christmas period was “particularly strong, driven by consumers buying new electronic devices, including tablets and smart TVs”.“We’re at the beginning of the expansion of internet TV,” Mr Hastings told the Financial Times. “We’re helped by consumer electronics – smart TVs and tablets – which are getting better and better. We’re not beholden to growth [in consumer electronics] but we help each other…people buy smart TVs so they can watch Netflix.”The company added 2m new subscribers in the US in the fourth quarter, almost double the third quarter, and 1.8m internationally in the final three months of 2012, giving it 33m subscribers worldwide.“The killer app for tablets remains streaming,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “Netflix probably benefited from that [over Christmas] so they were not required to spend as much for marketing, which drove the earnings upside.”Net income in the fourth quarter was $7.9m, down from $35.2m in the same quarter in 2011. Net income for the year fell to $17.2m, down from $226m, as the company invested heavily in international expansion, launching in key new markets such as the UK. Revenues rose from $3.2bn to $3.6bn.Netflix has moved into original content production, hoping to grab viewers “cutting the cord” and moving away from expensive cable TV subscriptions. Next week it will begin showing its most expensive series to date – House of Cards, directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey. Mr Hastings said the series launch, when all 13 episodes would be made available at once, would be “a defining moment in the development of internet TV”.Online viewing was a “better experience” for viewers, he added, “because of the freedom and flexibility it provides, and in the case of Netflix, the lack of commercials”.Mr Hastings acknowledged the competitors snapping at Netflix’s heels: Amazon is investing heavily in original content, as is Hulu, the online video service owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast. Redbox, a DVD kiosk operator, has also launched a streaming service.But he sounded a bullish note about Netflix’s prospects, compared with its competitors. “When it comes to competition, we not only have a superior content offering due to our larger budget, but we are further along the experience curve when it comes to improving our user interface and delivering great-quality streaming,” he wrote.Mr Pachter said Netflix was being “disingenuous” about the threats posed by its competition. “They are paying up for serialised dramas which have very little potential for replay value. That’s a problem which puts them on a hamster wheel which means they have to consistently replace high-quality content.”Earnings per share for the 12 months to December 31 were $0.29 compared with $4.16 last time. The shares closed at $103.26 but rose $33 in after market trading to $136.26.
672;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Blockbuster to close 129 outlets;;Blockbuster, the entertainment retailer that plunged into administration on Wednesday, is to shut 129 of its abut 500 stores, with the loss of 760 jobs, in the latest blow to Britain’s battered high street.Deloitte, appointed administrator to the UK arm of Blockbuster on Wednesday, said on Saturday that the stores would close in the coming weeks. They are in addition to 31 stores already shut.Lee Manning, joint administrator and partner at Deloitte, said the closures were an “inevitable consequence of having to restructure the company to a profitable core which is capable of being sold”.Deloitte said stores would remain open for business as usual and customers would be notified in advance of closure so that they could return their outstanding rental items beforehand.However, it said it continued to review the profitability of the store portfolio, and could not rule out further closures.Blockbuster, which has 528 stores across the UK employing 4,190 staff fell into administration after the failure to secure a sale of the UK business following a plunge in profits.It was part of a grim week on the high street, which also saw Jessops, the camera retailer and music chain HMV fall into administration, with threatening about 10,000 jobs and potentially leaving a fifth of all UK shops empty.Mr Manning said on Wednesday that the business would trade as normal, and he was hopeful a buyer could be found for a core of the chain.He acknowledged that an “appreciable proportion” of stores would close, although he estimated that 50-70 per cent could remain open.Blockbuster has been suffering following the launch of rival services such as Netflix and Lovefilm, which enable users to stream films and TV shows on their televisions and other devices such as tablets and PCs.Netflix says it has more than 1m customers in the UK and Ireland. Lovefilm, which also offers a service that posts DVD rentals to customers, has more than 2m customers in the UK, Germany and the Nordic countries, with the majority of those in the UK.
673;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-16T19:47:15Z;Blockbuster arm joins high street casualties;;The UK arm of Blockbuster, Britain’s leading DVD rental chain, has gone into administration, adding to the gloom on the high street. Deloitte, the business advisory firm, has been appointed as administrator.The move follows the failure to secure a sale of the UK business after a plunge in profits. Deloitte will over the coming days evaluate the company with a view to finding a buyer for all or part of the struggling business.The announcement on Wednesday adds to the grim toll that has seen HMV, Comet and Jessops collapse in the space of just over two months, with the likely loss of about 15,000 UK retail jobs, and the prospect of empty shops accounting for almost a fifth of all British stores.Blockbuster, which has its headquarters in Uxbridge, has 528 stores across the UK employing 4,190 staff. Its US parent company was itself brought out of bankruptcy protection in April 2011.“It’s the tail end of a long story,” said Benedict Evans, analyst at Enders Analysis. “The DVD business in western markets is in long-term decline and the rental business has been replaced partly by Lovefilm and streaming and also partly by Amazon and supermarkets as DVDs have become so cheap.”Blockbuster has been suffering following the launch of rival services such as Netflix and Lovefilm, which enable users to stream films and TV shows on their televisions and other devices such as tablets and PCs. Netflix says it has more than 1m customers in the UK and Ireland.Lovefilm, which also offers a service that posts DVD rentals to customers, has more than 2m customers in the UK, Germany and the Nordic countries, with the majority of those in the UK.Lee Manning, joint adminstrator and partner in Deloitte’s restructuring services practice, said the the business would trade as normal and he was hopeful a buyer could be found for a core part of the chain.He acknowledged that an “appreciable proportion” of stores would close, although he estimated that between 50 and 70 per cent of stores could remain open.“It’s that sort of ballpark,” he said.The decision to appoint administrators came after losses increased at Blockbuster UK from £8.5m in 2011 to an £11.2m deficit in 2012. Last quarter’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation had been expected to be about 4.5m profit. However, the company made a £30,000 loss.It’s the tail end of a long story. The DVD business in western markets is in long-term declineUnlike the recently collapsed HMV, Blockbuster said it would continue to honour gift cards and credit acquired through its trade-in scheme.Mr Manning said it had made this decision because it regarded the “relationship between the customer and individual store as being sacrosanct”.Blockbuster UK’s online business is small, with just 35,000 customers and an annual loss of about £1m.Separately, Deloitte said HMV Ireland, which employs 300 people, had entered receivership, with the closure of 16 stores. The firm has received about 10 expressions of interest for HMV’s UK business.Gio Goi, the young fashion brand popular with celebrities, also fell into administration on Wednesday, appointing KPMG.
674;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Hollywood stems home viewing decline;;Hollywood studios have stemmed a six-year decline in home entertainment sales, a key industry revenue stream, by selling films online several weeks before their release on discs.Sales of DVDs have fallen precipitously since 2006, but figures show total home entertainment sales were flat in 2012, due in part to strong growth in download sales.The studios say younger consumers with tablet devices are more inclined to buy electronic versions of films, particularly if they are made available before being a DVD or Blu-ray release.US sales of films and TV programmes to download or stream rose more than 35 per cent in 2012 to $812m, according to the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents studios and retailers.“This is like the early days of the DVD, when we would beat our forecasts by doubles and triples,” said Mike Dunn, worldwide president of home entertainment at 20th century Fox, which did well with the early digital release of Taken 2 on Christmas day, weeks before its US release on DVD.The studio ran an ad campaign that aired during televised Christmas day basketball games to draw attention to the initiative. It was aimed at the new owners of tablet computers and other connected devices, said Mr Dunn. “We estimate there were 18m new connected devices opened on Christmas day.”Digital sales are still just a small part of the $18bn-a-year US home entertainment market – a business that finances much of the film production in Hollywood. But growth is also coming from video-on-demand and subscription services, such as Netflix.Dan Cryan, a senior analyst at IHS, a media research company, said the early release, or creation of a “digital window”, of digital downloads had affected consumer behaviour.“The challenge for studios has been establishing the value of the retail product in a digital era. Creating a digital window is a key tool for studios in persuading consumers to buy and own movies.”Several studios plan to make their films available earlier to buy in digital formats. Walt Disney will soon release its latest animated hit, Wreck-it-Ralph, to download before it comes out on DVD.Sony Pictures has released its science fiction films Looper and the remake of Total Recall early.David Bishop, president of Sony Pictures home entertainment, said the studio was being “selective” in the films it was choosing for earlier release. “It needs to fit the demographic [of the digital consumer],” he said.
675;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2013-01-04T23:08:47Z;Kilar quits as Hulu chief executive;;Hulu, owned by News Corp, Walt Disney and Comcast, is looking for a new chief executive after Jason Kilar announced he was leaving the online video service, one of the biggest in the US.Mr Kilar leaves with about $40m, his share of a $134m “employee equity-based compensation” plan which was triggered by the recent sale of Providence Equity Partners’ 10 per cent stake in the company.The stake, initially purchased in 2007 by Providence for $100m, was redeemed by News Corp and Disney last year following a disagreement between the media companies and the private equity firm over Hulu’s future direction.Those disagreements ultimately led to Mr Kilar’s departure, according to people familiar with the situation. Providence and Mr Kilar were keen to build a standalone business backed by exclusive content but the other shareholders rejected the idea, fearing that giving Hulu exclusive rights to their hit shows would erode revenues from their traditional television businesses.Hulu receives most of its TV content from its shareholders, News Corp and Disney: Comcast also provides content from its NBCUniversal division, but is a silent partner.The differences between Mr Kilar and the shareholders came to a head in recent months, with Mr Kilar pushing for more funds to expand Hulu internationally, according to those close to the situation.Mr Kilar, a former executive with Amazon, wrote in a blog post that he was working with the Hulu board to “ensure there is ample runway” to manage the transition to a new chief executive. Rich Tom, chief technology officer, has also resigned.During his five years in charge, Hulu has evolved into one of the market leaders with more than 3m subscribers. However, despite generating revenues of $700m in 2012, thanks to its mix of subscriber and advertising revenue, the company has never made a profit and has trailed the pace of growth at Netflix, its larger rival.Mr Kilar’s tenure was also marred by disagreements with shareholders. In a 2011 blog post he infuriated News Corp and Disney – which both own US TV networks – when he wrote that “traditional TV has too many ads”. Disney said at the time that Mr Kilar’s views were “personal and clearly not shared by anyone at Walt Disney”.His departure comes at a pivotal point for the nascent online video sector. The US online video advertising market grew more than 46 per cent to $2.93bn last year, according to eMarketer, a research firm. More than 30 per cent of the US population watched TV online in 2012, up from 26.6 per cent a year earlier.Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of News Corp, said in a statement on Friday that Mr Kilar “and his team have done a great job building Hulu into one of the leading online video services available today”. Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said Disney was “proud of his achievements”.
676;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
677;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Wall St upbeat on signs of potential deal;S&P 500 has declined in last five trading sessions;Wall Street stocks climbed higher in the year’s final trading day as investors reacted positively to signs of a potential deal in Washington to avert the looming fiscal cliff.The S&P 500 rose 1.7 per cent to 1,426.20 in New York, closing near a session high and recording its best single day gain since mid-November. The strong gains came as reports said policy makers were inching closer to a possible deal to avoid $600bn of automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to start in the new year.Terms of a possible deal between leading Democrats and Republicans emerged just after midday, while President Barack Obama said a budget deal was “within sight”.The benchmark finished the year with a 13.4 per cent gain, a significant improvement compared with a year ago when it finished flat.But heading into Monday’s trade, the S&P 500 had declined in five consecutive trading sessions as fears that politicians might fail to resolve the fiscal cliff before a midnight deadline intensified of late.Signs of renewed hopes over a potential deal before the deadline helped lower a key indicator often referred to as Wall Street’s unofficial “fear gauge”. The CBOE’s Vix Index, which measures implied volatility on S&P 500 options contracts, fell 20.7 per cent to the 18 level - its biggest drop in 16 months amid record trading.Still, as reports of progress in last minute talks emerged out of Washington early on Monday, investors warned that other outstanding policy matters await.“Obviously the week will be dominated by talk of the fiscal-cliff and could begin shifting to the debt ceiling, which according to Treasury Secretary [Tim] Geithner could be breached on Monday,” said Oliver Pursche, portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.Elsewhere, the Nasdaq Composite index gained 2 per cent to 2,995.31 as the tech-heavy index was bolstered by a strong rally in shares of Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the benchmark. The Nasdaq finished the year up 15.9 per cent, compared with a drop of 1.8 per cent in 2011.Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalisation, rose 4.4 per cent to $532.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 13,104.14.All 10 industry groups on the S&P 500 finished with gains of more than 1 per cent each on the day. Information technology stocks were the top performing sector on the S&P 500 and rose 2.1 per cent.Netflix, the internet streaming and home DVD delivery company, moved 3.7 per cent higher to $92.59. In a filing late Friday, the company said it would double the pay of its chief executive Reed Hastings to $4m next year.Materials stocks rose 2 per cent. Earlier in the day, a key gauge of China’s manufacturing sector rose to a 19-month high. The gains were led by Cliffs Natural Resources, the international coal mining company, which rose 8.4 per cent to $38.57.
678;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-12-31T19:48:28Z;Netflix doubles chief’s pay to $4m;;Netflix has doubled the notional pay of chief executive Reed Hastings to $4m for 2013 lifting his remuneration back above the level it stood at before he was penalised for a disastrous 2011 attempt to carve the US video subscription company into separate digital and analogue businesses.In practical terms, however, Mr Hastings’ actual pay for the year will be determined by the value of his monthly options allowance at the time he receives it – a figure that, based on recent experience, could end up being far higher than the formal figure laid out by the company.In 2011, for instance, the value of the Netflix chief’s pay soared to $9.3m, up 69 per cent from the year before. Before 2011 began, Netflix had announced that it would raise his pay by 40 per cent to $3.5m.The difference between notional and actual pay levels represents the accounting method used to assess the full value of the stock options handed to Mr Hastings, taking into account factors such as the high volatility in Netflix’s share price.Mr Hastings’ projected compensation for 2012 was cut to $2m, from $3.5m in 2011, though the actual value of his pay will not be reported until Netflix publishes its annual proxy statement in February. The reduction followed his attempt to separate the company’s streaming video operations into a separate business from its traditional DVD subscription service, provoking a backlash from customers.The debacle wiped more than 80 per cent off Netflix’s share price, leaving it vulnerable to attack from an activist shareholder earlier this year when corporate raider Carl Icahn took a stake in the company and suggested it would make a good target for a takeover.The changing mix of Mr Hastings’ pay may make his actual earnings in 2013 less volatile than in recent years, according to details disclosed in a Netflix filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.His base salary for 2013 has been raised from $500,000 to $2m, while the number of options he will receive have been valued by the company at a notional $2m. While up from $1.5m the year before, that is still less than the $3m of 2011, leaving less scope for the actual value of the options handed to him to send his eventual pay package soaring far above the company’s stated intention.
679;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;Demand for ‘nostalgia’ TV shows rises;;Old comedies and dramas such as Rising Damp and Midsomer Murders are becoming significant revenue earners for their content owners once again as new platforms such as Netflix and Lovefilm expand from films into TV programmes.Content owners have been reporting a surge in demand in recent months from these new services for “nostalgia” TV programming as they seek to differentiate their offerings with consumers.The increased interest in part reflects dwindling DVD sales of TV box sets. But the demand from the new platforms is also part of their desire to bulk up their library of TV content amid growing demand for TV programming from users.Netflix, which says it has over 1m customers in the UK and Ireland, has stated that over half of all the streams on its service tends to be for TV shows.The bigger push into TV is providing a welcome boost for English language owners of TV content such as ITV and Endemol.ITV’s revenue from its online, pay and interactive segment, which includes internet ads as well as revenue from content deals with video-on-demand services, reached £47m in the six months to the end of June. This represented a rise of 24 per cent year on year even before the latest surge in demand for TV content.“The long tail of content is proving more valuable for broadcasters,” said one senior TV executive. “Content owners are developing more sophisticated strategies for their content and taking advantage of the proliferation of competition from new types of services such as Netflix and Lovefilm to give them a new lease of life.”By purchasing older TV programmes from the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, the new platform providers are able to promote niche programmes shunned by the mainstream broadcasters.Content owners are tending to do deals with multiple video-on-demand providers on a non-exclusive basis. And they expect these opportunities to only get bigger as new services such as Netflix and Lovefilm expand into more homes.But this rosy picture for older content may not last forever, analysts warn. Some predict consolidation in the video-on-demand market which would reduce competition for content deals.There are broader challenges for broadcasters too. Over the past decade, despite the proliferation of video content on the web, TV consumption in the UK has remained steady with the average person watching about four hours a day. Almost 80 per cent of this viewing is on the top five channels, virtually unchanged from 10 years ago.But with new services and digital platforms, the way consumers are finding video content is changing. While many remain loyal to a particular channel, others are searching for particular programmes or simply browsing for content, posing risks for the big channel brands.
680;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix draws SEC scrutiny over Facebook post;;Netflix and its chief executive Reed Hastings could face a civil action for a Facebook post that US Securities and Exchange Commission staff allege violated disclosure rules that require companies to release important information to all investors at the same time.On July 3, Mr Hastings put up a public Facebook post to more than 200,000 Facebook followers, announcing that Netflix members had watched more than 1bn hours for the first time in June. The message has since received more than 250 likes and was shared more than 30 times, but the company did not issue a press release or file a document with the SEC about the news.Netflix disclosed in a SEC filing on Thursday that the company and Mr Hastings had received a Wells notice from SEC staff, warning of the agency’s intentions to file civil charges for violating Regulation Fair Disclosure. The rule bans the selective release of material information.SEC staff will present the case to commissioners, who will vote on whether or not to sue the company. The case is likely to be watched by corporations that increasingly tap social media to disseminate information.“SEC staff questions a Facebook post. Fascinating social media story,” Mr Hastings said in a regulatory filing that he also posted to his Facebook page.He argued that the company considered a post to more than 200,000 people as “very public”, particularly because several of the executive’s Facebook subscribers were reporters and bloggers. He added that while the company believed that the post was public, the 1bn viewing hours fact was not “material” to investors because it previously had signalled in a blog post that it was approaching the milestone. He said the company typically released important information via investor letters, press releases and SEC filings.Mr Hastings noted that while Netflix stock rose on the day of the post, the climb started before the posting occurred and likely was sparked by a positive Citigroup research report.The news comes amid an 18 month rollercoaster ride at the video rental company, initially spurred by the loss of a licensing deal with Starz followed by a botched rebranding and separation of its DVD business, which the company eventually abandoned.
681;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-12-05T19:58:26Z;Netflix targets the bigger picture;;Hollywood has long had a fruitful relationship with the pay-TV industry, with blockbuster movies produced by the biggest studios enjoying a lucrative afterlife on channels such as HBO, part of Time Warner, CBS’s Showtime and Starz, part of Liberty Media.The relationship, which has endured for more than 20 years, meant pay-TV operators and the channels they carried could use exclusive film content to attract subscribers.For the studios, deals with pay-TV became one of their most reliable revenue streams.That relationship was upended this week when Netflix, an online subscription service, netted the industry’s biggest fish, signing an exclusive distribution deal with Walt Disney. The deal sent reverberations around Hollywood and beyond: for the first time a big studio had chosen to abandon premium TV in favour of an internet TV operator.Netflix has already moved into territory occupied by pay TV channels by producing its own programming: its biggest bet, House of Cards, a $100m adaptation of the BBC series, airs next year.However, the Disney deal raises the stakes yet higher: Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told a conference in New York on Wednesday that the agreement was a “game-changer” for the company.Disney had for several years been supplying its movies to Starz, which would air them in the pay TV “window” shortly after their release on DVD. Starz’s deal expires in 2016 and Disney opted to sign a new three-year deal with Netflix rather than renew the agreement with its TV partner.Netflix is paying a high price for Disney content. Pay TV output deals are valued using a complex formula that links the licence fee per movie to its performance at the US boxoffice. That fee is usually about 10 per cent of the box office performance.Netflix was willing to go higher than that ratio, according to people familiar with the situation, and could pay as much as $400m a year, depending on the performance of Disney’s movies.This is considerably more than comparable studio-pay TV deal. 20th Century Fox has renewed its output deal with HBO in a deal worth around $200m.While it is paying a premium, Disney’s family-centric movies are a good fit for Netflix, which is popular with parents looking for on-demand viewing that is suitable for their children.“It’s a bold bet,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. Netflix, he said, had “locked up the most important brands in the film industry”. Disney’s stable of brands includes Marvel, Pixar, and now Lucasfilm – which gives it the right to make a new series of Star Wars films. “It’s the highest quality content you can buy,” said Mr Greenfield.The Disney tie-up “differentiates” Netflix from its competitors, such as Amazon, which has its own online video service, and Hulu Plus, wrote Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente in a research note.But as Netflix shares soared on Tuesday in the aftermath of the deal, he urged caution, saying the benefit would come over the “longer-term” with the tie-up not starting in earnest until 2016.The irony is that Netflix used to have lots of Disney movies on its service thanks to an earlier deal it had with Starz.The agreement allowed Netflix to screen whichever Disney movies Starz was screening – as well as other content carried by the channel, which included original TV shows, and films released by Sony Pictures.In the summer of 2011, Starz and Netflix were negotiating a new deal worth an estimated $300m a year but Netflix walked away, triggering a sharp decline in its shares and the start of 18 months of turbulence marred by a price rise and a botched rebranding – which it later abandoned.Netflix shares, which had touched $300, fell by two-thirds and recently attracted the attention of activist investor Carl Icahn, who has built a 10 per cent stake.Netflix shares rose 10 per cent on Tuesday in the aftermath of the Disney deal announcement and were at $83 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.Yet the company will pay more for Disney content with its new deal than it did in the previous Starz deal – which also provided it with access to Disney movies.A Netflix spokesman said the new Disney deal was broader in scope and included Disney’s direct-to-DVD titles, such as a series based on Tinkerbell.In dealing directly with Disney, Netflix had “cut out the middleman”, he said. “We have focused on Disney films and kids content that we believe will get extraordinarily high viewing hours.”Despite its rocky share price, the company has added 10m subscribers in the past 22 months.

The value of the “multiyear” deal, which starts in 2016, was undisclosed, although Netflix is probably be paying $200m-$300m a year, based on other output deals agreed between studios and pay-TV channels.The deal caused a spike in Netflix shares, which rose more than 14 per cent to $86.70.The agreement gives Netflix the right to stream new Disney films from 2016, including movies made by Disney’s Pixar and Marvel divisions, which have enjoyed great success in recent years with Toy Story 3 and The Avengers. Netflix will start streaming older library titles, such as Dumbo and Alice in Wonderland, immediately, with more to be added over the coming months.Disney’s switch from Starz to Netflix highlights a fundamental change in audience habits, with viewers increasingly likely to stream movies on demand rather than watch sporadically on cable TV.But it also highlights a shift in the priorities of pay-TV channels such as Starz, with operators keen to investing in original programming rather than pay for first-run Hollywood films.Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, said the deal represented a “bold leap forward for internet TV”.Download the FT’s latest ebook and join the authors for a live chat on Thursday 6 December 1500-1600 GMTIt comes as Netflix finds itself under siege from Carl Icahn, the activist investor, who has built a stake of almost 10 per cent.Mr Icahn, who has criticised the company for not putting more of its board of directors up for re-election at annual shareholder meetings, disclosed his stake after a sharp decline in Netflix shares. The slump was triggered by the company’s admission that it had missed subscriber targets.Netflix responded to Mr Icahn’s stakebuilding within days when its board approved a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan that would issue a swag of new shares if the activist investor lifted his holding above 10 per cent.Netflix has endured a rocky 18 months, triggered by the loss of its licensing deal with Starz– which included the right to screen some Disney movies. The share price slump was exacerbated by a subsequent botched rebranding and a separation of its DVD business, which the company eventually abandoned.
683;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-12-04T20:40:49Z;Icahn drops attempt to acquire Oshkosh;;Carl Icahn has failed in his second bid to gain control of armoured truckmaker Oshkosh.The veteran corporate raider on Tuesday said he was withdrawing his $32.50r per share tender offer, after only 22 per cent of shares were tendered. He had said he would only proceed with his bid if he gained 25 per cent of outstanding shares.“Therefore, we are returning all tendered shares and we will not extend the offer,” Mr Icahn said. None of the tendered shares had been purchased.This is the second time Mr Icahn has attempted to wrest control of Oshkosh from management. He recently waged an unsuccessful proxy fight in an attempt to elect a slate of his preferred candidates to the board of directors, but was defeated in January.Mr Icahn remains the company’s largest shareholder, with a 9.5 per cent stake.Shares in Oshkosh have not traded above $32.50 for nearly a year and a half. Other shareholders, however, are unswayed by Mr Icahn’s plans to break up the company.On Tuesday, shares in Oshkosh were down another 5 per cent in midday trading, to $28.63.Mr Icahn has had other successes with auto companies this year. In October, he gained a seat on the board of Navistar, a truckmaker he had said could be merged with Oshkosh. He later backed off the notion of a tie-up between the two companies, instead saying Oshkosh should sell or spin off its mobile lifting equipment unit.Oshkosh is among the Pentagon’s largest suppliers, making blast-resistant vehicles for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Profitability has waned in recent years as the wars wind down, however, and the company faces further hurdles with the threat of sequestration looming over all military spending.The defeat caps a mixed year for Mr Icahn, who has gone after lesser known companies such as CVR Energy as well as brand names including Netflix.The billionaire took over CVR earlier this year in a hostile transaction without the opportunity to do due diligence. He then scrapped his plan to take the company private in August, after acquiring 82 per cent of the refiner.Mr Icahn then disclosed a 10 per cent stake in Netflix, proposing that the DVD rental and online media distribution company would be worth far more to one of the larger media companies than its current share price. In response, Netflix threw up corporate defences, a “poison pill” that prevents unauthorised stakebuilding in its shares.Mr Icahn this year also sold his stake in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for close to $600m. It was unclear if he made a profit. That followed the sale of his stake in Lions Gate Entertainment, another entertainment company.

Talks between Republican and Democratic leaders soured on Thursday, adding to pessimism among investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent higher for the week to 13,025.58. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 3,010.24.Meanwhile, US corporates continued to issue a record number of special dividends to escape higher taxes on equity income payments.Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, said: “Investors are rewarding tax-prudent action by US corporates, which are using their coffers to issue special dividends ahead of the tax rises next year.” Dividend taxes, which stand at 15 per cent, could rise to more than 40 per cent unless politicians can avoid the fiscal cliff.Costco, which runs warehouse-style discount stores, said on Wednesday it would pay out a special $7 dividend in December. Shares in the company rose 6.42 per cent to $103.99 for the week. Dillards, the department store retailer, said earlier in the week it would issue a one-time cash dividend of $5 a share. Its shares notched up a 2.9 per cent gain to $88.91 for the week.However, Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain, was an exception among stocks that issued special dividends this week. The company’s shares fell 1.8 per cent to $93.36 as it said it would pay a $2 special dividend before the end of the year.A week after holiday shopping season began, retailers remained among the most-discussed stocks as data showed the effects of superstorm Sandy, which battered the US northeast seaboard last month, affected businesses. Economic data published this week showed US consumer spending declined in October. US department store data showed falling sales for the month of November despite a post-Thanksgiving shopping surge.The reports limited gains for consumer discretionary sector stocks and companies on the S&P 500 retailing index, which rose 0.7 per cent and 0.8 per cent for the week.Macy’s, the department store chain, extended its decline from Thursday when it reported its first monthly fall in same-store sales in three years. The company’s shares fell 7.3 per cent for the week to $38.70. Kohl’s, the department store retailer, dropped 14.6 per cent to $44.65.Shares in Groupon, the daily deals group, saw heavy losses on Friday after the troubled company’s chief executive Andrew Mason survived a board meeting at which his leadership role was said to be at stake. Still, the company recorded a 5 per cent gain for the week to $4.19. Since its public float last year at $20 a share, Groupon has shed 79 per cent.Yum Brands, which runs Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other fast food restaurant chains, fell 9.4 per cent to $67.08.Shares in Netflix, the internet streaming and home DVD delivery company, fell 1.5 per cent to $81.71 as a competitor emerged for the company’s Mexico business. América Móvil, the company run by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said it would launch a Netflix-style service known as Clarovideo at a cheaper monthly price for consumers.Knight Capital Group, the electronic trading and market-making company, rose 35.3 per cent to $3.37 as it received takeover offers from two competitors this week.
685;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-11-21T19:52:44Z;Real-life dramas reveal start-up myths;‘Netflixed’ goes beyond the official mythology;"Netflixed: The Epic Battle for America’s Eyeballs
By Gina Keating
Portfolio Penguin, $26.95/£19.99Every successful start-up has a well-rehearsed story about its origins. In the case of Netflix it is the story of how founder and chief executive Reed Hastings had an epiphany about DVDs-by-mail after being charged for the overdue return of a movie – Apollo 13 – to his local video store in 1997. This, the story goes, led to the creation of a film-streaming and DVD-by-mail service worth $4.5bn today.But these simple stories are rarely the whole truth, which is why investors, business analysts and would-be founders might benefit from reading Gina Keating’s account, which attempts to go beyond the official mythology.The genesis of a start-up is always messier, more accidental and more brutal than many companies admit. Netflix did not start in a single moment of inspiration but after months of Hastings and co-founder Marc Randolph, both Silicon Valley serial ent­repreneurs, batting business ideas at each other. Growth was slow. The company has more than 25m subscribers and revenues above $3bn today, but from the original idea in 1997 it took until 2001 to reach 500,000 customers. Those who expect the in­stant, uncomplicated success of such relative upstarts as Groupon (launched in 2008) and Twitter (founded in 2006) should take note.Keating, who followed Netflix for years as a media reporter at Reuters, also reveals that growth was accompanied by heartache. While Randolph was central to setting up the original business, he was edged out by Hastings in 1999. Ahead of its 2002 listing on Nasdaq, Netflix abruptly axed 40 per cent of its staff to make the business numbers more palatable to investors.Luck also plays a bigger role than founders might want to believe. Net­flix eventually emerged victorious from a gruelling market-share war with Blockbuster, the dominant video store company, but this was at least partly because of internal difficulties at Blockbuster, including an exhausting conflict between John Antioco, chief executive, and Carl Icahn, the corporate raider who was a big investor in the chain at the time. With Icahn now building a stake in Netflix, the book gives a flavour of the rough ride the company might now expect.Luck aside, business founders might note some of the clever tactics used by Net­flix. At the height of the battle with Blockbus­ter, it kept close tabs on its rival’s subscriber growth and ran det­ailed financial models of just how much money Blockbuster would have to pour into trying to gain market share. This helped Netflix avoid panic and stick to its own growth plan even as the pressure grew.In its launch stage, Netflix recruited influential early adopters through a subtle internet groups campaign, and later developed beneficial relationships with film-industry bloggers. A $1m contest aimed at improving the workings of the Netflix movie recommendation soft­ware in 2006 created a great deal of positive publicity and some signifcant technological improvements.Keating’s story ends in 2011, just after the botched attempt to split Netflix’s video-streaming and DVD-by-mail services into two businesses, which wiped 80 per cent off the company’s share price and shook customer faith in the brand. Netflix’s latest dramas, including challenging Amazon-owned Lovefilm in the UK and the recent stakebuilding by Icahn are not covered, but Keating’s book provides hints at how they might play out, with a visionary but increasingly autocratic Hastings at the helm.There is a little too much detail on minor initiatives to make this a pacey story for a general reader. Do we really need to know so much about short-lived features such as Profiles and Friends in 2005?And despite attempts at cinematic colour, the main characters struggle to emerge. Randolph is sket­ched as warm and like­able, Hastings colder and more cerebral. The overall impression is that people in the Valley wear sandals and board shorts a lot.But for students of business and founders of technology start-ups, it is a story with enough tension and plot twists to merit inclusion on the Netflix recommendation list. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, at least, ought to read it."
686;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-11-07T19:38:16Z;Netflix story shows need for defences;Icahn’s stake grab could influence how tech groups are run;The soap opera that has engulfed Netflix represents a new and unappetising reality for Silicon Valley. Depending on the outcome, it could have a lasting influence over the way other tech start-ups are governed and run – and accentuate a growing divide in corporate philosophy between the Valley and Wall Street.Seen from one angle, last week’s news that Carl Icahn has taken a 10 per cent stake in the video subscription service does not look that unusual. Corporate raiders are becoming a fact of life in Silicon Valley. From Hewlett-Packard to Motorola and Yahoo, opportunistic agitators have moved in on struggling former tech icons.This encroachment has let some of the air out of Silicon Valley’s sense of its own exceptionalism – a belief that it somehow exists on a different plane from the normal constraints of corporate existence. It turns out that mature, low-growth companies with under-exploited assets look the same in any industry.The Netflix case, though, is different. This is a growth company in investment mode, as well as a leader in a new market – subscription streaming video. That is not the usual profile of a company that grabs the attention of raiders.It is not unusual for tech concerns to fall out of favour as they hit a transitional phase, moving from a high-growth period into one in which a tension arises between growth and margins. At Netflix, that has been compounded by slumping management credibility and extreme share price volatility.Netflix hit a bump last year when it badly mishandled an attempted split between its DVD and streaming video businesses – but over the past four years, its revenue growth accelerated from 13 per cent to 48 per cent as it rode a wave of interest in online video. Reed Hastings, chief executive, employs the classic expansive rhetoric of a tech company founder. He predicts, for instance, that Netflix will reach 60m-90m subscribers in the US, or two to three times as many as HBO, the leading premium cable channel.He brushes off a recent failure to hit his own target for new subscribers, and asks investors to focus instead on the proliferation of tablets and other new devices for watching video. And he asks for patience as he embarks on an ambitious global expansion, plunging Netflix into negative free cash flow territory for the next few quarters.This is the sort of stance that often comes off as arrogance on Wall Street, where investors grow irritable with such big and ill-defined plans. And that touches on an issue close to the heart of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs: how much leeway should a company be given at such times?Depending on where you stand, Netflix either has too much protection from the unwanted attention of raiders like Mr Icahn, or too little. The “too much” argument comes from the groups that measure compliance with traditional corporate governance standards: GMI, one such group, gives the company a D for the impediments it has in the way of an unwanted takeover, such as a staggered board that does not put every director up for re-election each year. And that was before Netflix introduced a poison pill defence this week in response to Mr Icahn’s arrival on the scene.The “too little” argument, on the other hand, holds that Mr Hastings has been left unfairly exposed at a critical time in his company’s development. Poison pills do little to prevent takeovers: in fact, many shareholders welcome them, given that they often force bidders to pay more to complete a takeover.Netflix may be vulnerable, but Silicon Valley has already come up with an answer to this predicament: the dual-class share structure that was pioneered by Google, and which has been used with increasing frequency by high-growth internet companies to leave voting control in the hands of founders.As a member of Facebook’s board, Mr Hastings himself has seen this kind of arrangement up close. He might also take note of the similar insulation from outside pressure enjoyed by the founders of Zynga and Groupon, two others that are low on management credibility as they struggle to address severe growing pains that threaten to crimp their potential.As it enters a new investment phase, Netflix is facing the sort of chasm that many tech companies fail to cross. But however self-inflicted it might be, Mr Hastings’ plight will only serve to reinforce a growing belief in Silicon Valley that growth companies need stronger defences, and that their founders deserve the protection from outside influence, if they are to hit their long-term potential.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast Managing Editorrichard.waters@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
687;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix – question of genre;Script for video-streaming group’s film has veered wildly;What kind of movie is this, anyway? At first The Netflix Story was an excellent thriller (for viewers able to suspend disbelief in such things as valuation). The stock rose inexorably until mid-2011. The plot turned to horror after an ill-timed price increase, an insane rebranding effort and a pricey foray into new markets. The stock crashed in 2011’s second half. One last shock came in 2012, when the company missed its subscriber growth target.Now the screwball comedy phase has begun. It came out last week that activist investor/lovable goofball Carl Icahn had bought about 10 per cent of Netflix stock. He argues that Netflix is undervalued and could be of interest to a bigger acquirer. Mr Icahn is probably wrong if he thinks the shares are too cheap. But, given low entry barriers and the economic interest content makers have in keeping first-rate programming off Netflix, he may be right that the business is worth more to a company using video streaming as a customer retention tool (as Amazon does) than on its own.Netflix’s response to Mr Icahn was to institute a poison pill defence designed to dilute anyone acquiring more than 10 per cent of the shares. This is silly. Netflix, with its shares down 75 per cent from their peak, is in no position to discourage activists and if Mr Icahn thinks he can find a buyer willing to pay over the odds, terrific.So, one hopes, in the next reel the movie becomes a romantic comedy. Netflix may not be interested in love but, hopefully, that will not stop a rich, bumbling suitor (Microsoft?) from declaring that it cannot live without video content to augment its other offerings, prompting an irresistible offer. The alternative is that the defensiveness of Netflix’s management and board leaves it with nothing to offer investors but a snazzy song-and-dance number before the lights, at last, come up.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
688;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-11-05T22:00:23Z;US stocks edge higher ahead of election;;Time Warner Cable declined after third-quarter profits disappointed Wall Street.The group lost more video subscribers than the markets had expected. The shares dropped 6.4 per cent to $91.93 on Monday, however the stock is still nearly 45 per cent higher since January.Rivals Cablevision and Comcast also fell, losing 1.5 per cent to $16.53 and 0.5 per cent to $37.43 respectively. Traditional cable service providers have been losing custom to internet streaming companies such as Netflix and Hulu.US equities closed higher after a volatile session a day ahead of the presidential election. In the 2008 election, in which Barack Obama defeated John McCain, the S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent on the eve of the election.As stocks see-sawed, traders weighed different outcomes from the presidential and congressional elections on “fiscal cliff” negotiations which, if unresolved, would have significant economic consequences.“The markets are in a cautious and indecisive mode,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial.“Investors will not want to make any asset allocation decisions until after the elections. They will wait to see the composition of the Congress and what is the future of the monetary policy,” she added.Randy Frederick, managing director of Active Trading & Derivatives at Charles Schwab, agreed that markets would trade sideways amid light volume until the results of the presidential and congressional elections are known.“Markets are more concerned about uncertainty than anything else. But once we have the results and regardless of who wins, we believe markets will rise in the last two months of the year,” Mr Frederick said.On Monday the ISM services index in October came in at 54.2 – indicating growth, albeit slightly slower than in September.The CBOE Vix index of implied volatility rose 3.8 per cent to 18.2, highlighting nervousness among traders. The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,417.26, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged higher, by 0.1 per cent to 13,112.44.The utilities sector was the worst performer, falling 1.7 per cent.Shares in FirstEnergy, whose 1m customers in New Jersey still do not have power, after Hurricane Sandy, fell 3 per cent to $42.60. Consolidated Edison, which provides electricity and natural gas in the New York metropolitan area, also fell 2 per cent to $58.The Nasdaq Composite Index traded in and out of positive territory and closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,999.66.Nasdaq’s biggest component, Apple, opened with strong gains, but pared that early advance to trade 1.4 per cent higher at $584.80 on news that it sold 3m iPad mini tablets over the device’s debut weekend.Among the best performers on the S&P 500 was E-Trade, which rose 4.3 per cent to $8.76 after it said it planned to sell $1.3bn worth of 5- and 7-year senior notes in order to retire previously issued debt with higher interest rates.Dover rose 4 per cent to $61.91 after the manufacturer announced a $1bn share buyback programme as well as plans to sell some non-core units.Media company CBS rose 2.4 per cent to $34.01 after being upgraded by analysts at Barclays and Evercore.Anthony DiClemente at Barclays wrote that a pullback in the CBS share price over the past two months presented a buying opportunity.“Given its increasing exposure to recurring affiliate fees, growing demand for syndicated content, and digital distribution opportunities, CBS fundamentals are less exposed to cyclical advertising revenue than many investors assume.”“As such, we are willing to pay a higher multiple than we would have paid for CBS a few years ago when the business was more cyclical,” Mr DiClemente wrote.Among losers, McGraw-Hill, owner of the rating agency Standard & Poor’s, saw its shares drop sharply after its rating unit was found to have misled investors by the Federal Court of Australia. The ruling could pave the way for legal action in Europe. The stock dropped 4 per cent to $52.24 on Monday amid high volume.Shares in rival rating agency Moody’s also fell sharply, by 3 per cent to $46.60.Research In Motion, maker of BlackBerry smartphones, rose 2.2 per cent to $8.90 and has gained 18.7 per cent since the start of October.After the market closed, Express Scripts said analysts’ forecasts for its 2013 results were “overly aggressive”, citing a weak business climate. The stock slid 14 per cent to $53.90 in after-hours trading.
689;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-11-05T19:42:25Z;Netflix moves to block Icahn;;Netflix has moved to thwart Carl Icahn’s efforts to build a stake in the DVD and video streaming service after its board approved a “poison pill” shareholder rights plan that would flood the market with shares if the activist investor increases his holding above 10 per cent.The company said the plan was designed to protect it from “efforts to obtain control of Netflix that the board determines are not in the best interests of Netflix and its stockholders”.Mr Icahn revealed last week that he had accumulated a stake of about 10 per cent in the company, which has endured a turbulent 18 months. A botched rebranding and price hike have been followed by several sharp declines in the shares.He responded to the Netflix rights plan in a regulatory filing, saying “any poison pill without a shareholder vote is an example of poor corporate governance”. The Netflix poison pill was “particularly troubling due to its remarkably low and discriminatory 10 per cent threshold,” the filing added.Mr Icahn took another swipe at Netflix, which has a “staggered” board, with three directors up for re-election at its annual shareholder meeting. Mr Icahn said Netflix continued “to ignore the fact that the shareholders have strongly expressed their wishes through a majority vote to de-stagger its board.”Mr Icahn, who has previously expressed admiration for Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, has experience of the DVD and home entertainment industry, having bought a stake in Blockbuster in 2005.He agitated for changes on the Blockbuster board but was unable to prevent it filing for bankruptcy in 2008, as customers abandoned the chain for subscription services such as Netflix.Netflix shares have risen sharply since Mr Icahn revealed he had built a stake in the group. Shares in the group rose 0.9 per cent on Monday afternoon to $77.84, but they remain far off the peak of $300, which they touched last year before the group’s botched rebranding.The company has sought to rebuild investor confidence since the rebranding but has not fared well, missing a target for US subscribers to its streaming service at its most recent quarterly earnings.
690;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Icahn interest sparks Netflix rally;;Netflix shares jumped 13.9 per cent after veteran corporate raider Carl Icahn disclosed he controlled a tenth of the underperforming DVD subscription and online streaming business.The billionaire’s involvement could trigger a contest for the future of a company that has radically reshaped how the film and television industry distributes its content, but whose share price has been hit by a series of management missteps.The billionaire said Netflix was “undervalued” and its streaming service could hold “significant strategic value for a variety of significantly larger companies”, according to a regulatory filing that disclosed his 10 per cent stake.Mr Icahn is an opportunistic investor whose recent tactic has been to take a large stake in companies, including Clorox, Navistar and Oshkosh, and then agitate for a sale. In some cases, when rebuffed, he has then attempted to buy the company outright.He said that he is considering ways to maximise shareholder value and may seek to discuss these with the company, which has a market value of $4.4bn. Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.Mr Icahn’s move on Netflix comes as its shares have languished at less than a fifth of their $295 high last year. This month they slumped below $57 after the company cut its expectations for full year subscriber growth. The shares rose $9.66 to close at $79.24 on Wednesday.Netflix ran into trouble last summer due to a botched rebranding, a price hike and separation of its DVD subscription and streaming businesses. It later abandoned the separation but the damage was done, with the shares tumbling.Since then it has continued to struggle, disappointing investors with the pace of its growth and missing subscriber targets in its core US market.The company has revolutionised home entertainment in the US with a subscription DVD and video service that grew as DVD sales – a key Hollywood revenue stream – went into decline.Studios have eagerly done content deals with Netflix, which has built a commanding lead over competitors, such as Amazon and Hulu.However investors have taken fright at the possibility of competition from established media companies and the cost of acquiring and producing content.Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, warned in a letter to investors that he expected HBO to launch a streaming-only service in the US: currently HBO’s streaming package is only available to subscribers to its pay-TV service.The group is also investing extensively in original content. Netflix will soon premiere House of Cards, a new version of the BBC series, from Kevin Spacey and David Fincher, and has plans for a slate of original programming.Mr Icahn has the best part of two years for any plans to pay off, as the bulk of his stake is in the form of call options that give him the right to buy Netflix shares at a set price on September 4 2014.
691;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-10-23T23:08:28Z;Facebook / Netflix – friend management;Media groups’ results head in opposite directions;"Facebook wants to be friends with investors again. That is asking a lot, after it made a mockery of their trust with a badly overpriced initial public offering and then released a set of second-quarter results seemingly designed to dispirit the remaining optimists. How do yesterday’s results, considered as a reconciliatory bouquet, stack up?The numbers are not going to make anyone forgive and forget but they leave open the possibility of warmer feelings in the future. Specifically, nothing was worse and one key metric was a little better. Revenue growth did not decelerate (and would have grown a bit but for currency headwinds). Monthly and daily user growth hung in there, too.Revenue per user in North America grew 21 per cent, accelerating for the first time in over a year. That figure is important because North America is the company’s oldest market, so it (one hopes) gives some sense of what revenues could look like in less developed markets, given time. Yes, costs expanded a little faster than revenue but an unblemished report would have been too much to hope for. Shares rose nearly 10 per cent in late trading.Netflix, on the other hand, has not finished hurting feelings. The company previously said it expected to add as many as 7m new members to its US streaming service in 2012; as of its third-quarter results, also released yesterday, it expects about 5m. As the diminished subscriber expectations highlight, the question for Netflix investors remains simple to pose and hard to answer: what are the barriers to entry in the streaming video business? Can anyone with access to capital (Amazon, say) create a pretty good Netflix replica?Unless answers to these questions are forthcoming, no one can hope that yesterday’s disappointment – shares fell 16 per cent after-hours – to be the last.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
692;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-10-23T22:56:49Z;Subscriber slowdown hits Netflix;;Netflix shares slumped more than 16 per cent in after-hours trading when the DVD subscription and online streaming service cut its guidance for full-year subscriber growth.Netflix, which has endured a rocky two years marred by precipitous share price falls, had set a full-year target of 7m new subscribers to its US streaming service.It added 1.1m new US streaming subscribers in the third quarter, taking it to 3.3m for the year but cut the high-end of the range for the full year from 7m to 5.4m.“They’ve been hoisted by their own petard,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “They’ve been saying that incremental streaming subscription additions are pure profit but if there’s a shortfall in streaming additions that [will hit] the bottom line.”The company continues to add subscribers faster than its competitors– such as HBO, the pay-TV channel owned by Time Warner – but its guidance change spooked investors, with the shares falling more than $11 to $56.84. At their peak last summer the shares touched $300.Netflix is pushing ahead with international expansion, adding 690,000 subscribers: it recently launched its streaming service in Scandinavia, where it will go head to head with a streaming-only service from HBO. The UK has been the source of most of its international growth, with Netflix overtaking Lovefilm, the Amazon-owned streaming service in subscriber numbers.Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, warned in a letter to investors that he expected HBO to launch a streaming-only service in the US: currently HBO’s streaming package is only available to subscribers of its pay-TV service. “We think it will make strategic sense eventually for HBO to go direct to consumer in the US, and become more of a competitor to Netflix,” he said.Netflix is making a big bet on original content and will soon premiere House of Cards, a new version of the BBC series, from Kevin Spacey and David Fincher. Mr Hastings revealed a slate of new “originals” programming exclusive to Netflix for the coming year. “If we are as successful with originals as we think we will be [in the first quarter] then . . . we’ll have more people joining Netflix than we would otherwise,” he wrote.Revenues for the three months to September 30 were within the company’s guidance, rising from $821.8m to $905.1m. Net income fell sharply from $62.5m to $7.7m, reflecting rising technology and marketing costs associated with its international push.
693;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-10-09T21:41:36Z;Tech stocks lead Wall Street sell-offs;;Technology stocks, including Apple, led a Wall Street sell-off, with most of the sector’s heavyweight names dragging the rest of the market lower in a volatile trading session.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 3,065.02.“We may be seeing a psychological sell-off in the broader market based on what’s been going on with Apple,” said JJ Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.“It’s a pattern we’ve seen before, when the company’s stock tends to sell off after a product release. The momentum on Apple has been so negative over the past week, it will be important to see how investors react going into the holiday season.”Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, dropped as much as 1.8 per cent but recovered somewhat to close 0.4 per cent lower at $635.85.The stock is now 9.4 per cent lower from its peak of $702, reached on the day its iPhone 5 was released internationally.Microsoft shares fell 1.7 per cent to $29.28 and Google lost 1.8 per cent to $744.09. In an effort to avoid an antitrust war with Brussels, the search group offered to label information from its in-house services that are included in its search results pages.Amazon shares fell 3.1 per cent to $250.96 after news reports that Walmart began testing same-day delivery from its own stores, directly challenging the world’s largest online retailer.Oracle, the software group, was also hit badly, down 1.7 per cent to $30.65.Shares in Netflix, the subscription video service, were down 10.85 per cent to $65.54 after analysts at Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “buy”.Analysts said that with the 31 per cent rally in the past two weeks, “the risks outweigh the reward heading into the third quarter”.The stock gained more than 10 per cent during the previous session after analysts at Morgan Stanley said it was undervalued.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, was another big loser, down 5.3 per cent to $7.80. The stock rebounded off its record lows recently after the company said it added 2m new subscribers during the third quarter.Intel shares fell 2.7 per cent to $21.90 after analysts at Nomura downgraded the chipmaker’s stock, saying: “Shares have tracked the direction of gross margin over the past decade. And thus far in 2012 that trend has continued.”In broader markets, US equities fell sharply ahead of results from aluminium producer Alcoa and from Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut – both seen by investors as setting the tone for the third-quarter earnings season.Most analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies to have declined during the quarter as the global slowdown took its toll.The S&P 500 index fell 1 per cent to 1,441.48, retreating from its multiyear highs reached last week. Nine of 10 major sectors were in negative territory, with only energy registering modest gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 per cent to 13,473.91.Alcoa shares closed 0.1 higher to $9.13 but rose 0.5 per cent in after-hours trading after the aluminium producer beat analysts’ expectations. The company reported improved productivity and the $143m net income loss was less than expected.The company also said it would pay $85m to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by Bahrain’s state-controlled aluminium company, Aluminium Bahrain, over alleged corruption.Yum! Brands closed the day 1.3 per cent lower at $66.04. But its shares rallied 3 per cent in after-hours trading as the company’s earnings per share beat estimates.The restaurant chain, with extensive operations in China and India, saw margins improve in the third quarter, although revenue of $3.57bn missed estimates.Workday, a business software company, raised the price of its initial public offering, set to take place later this week.In an updated filing, the loss-making company said it now expected to price its shares at $24-$26, up from the $21-$24 range set last week. Valued at the midpoint of its expected price range, Workday’s IPO is set to raise $569m and give it a valuation of about $4bn.Oil group Newfield Exploration was among the highest risers on the S&P 500 index, climbing 6.1 per cent to $32.63 after it said the sale of its assets in the Gulf of Mexico to W&T Offshore had been finalised.Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, also rose 5.7 per cent to $23.93Among materials, Cliffs Natural Resources rose 2.1 per cent to $41.68 while United States Steel rose 3.5 per cent to $21.1.Ford shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $10.09 in volatile trading after Morgan Stanley reiterated its “overweight” rating with the price target of $17.Edwards Lifesciences tumbled 21.2 per cent to $84.6, making it the worst-hit stock on the S&P 500, after the cardiovascular equipment maker warned that third-quarter revenues would be lower than expected.
694;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-10-07T18:35:18Z;Studio surfs rising wave of online TV;;It has been dismissed as television’s poor relation but original online video programming is starting its move into the mainstream after FremantleMedia Enterprises, the company behind American Idol and The Price is Right, struck a deal to sell web shows to international broadcasters.FME will on Monday reveal plans to distribute online series made by Vuguru – a studio that focuses on digital platforms and was founded by Michael Eisner, the former chief executive of Walt Disney – to broadcasters and online distributors round the world.Vuguru, backed by Rogers Media, the Canadian media group, specialises in short-form web series, such as Prom Queen and Little Women in Big Cars, with its programming seen on online platforms operated by AOL and Yahoo.FME will distribute its new comedy series, Greetings from Home, and a sequel to Prom Queen.Larry Tanz, Vuguru’s chief executive, said the rise in online viewing was prompting a big change in viewing habits and compared the production of original digital series with the early days of cable TV.“Broadcast TV came first, then cable – and it took a while for cable to mean anything,” he said. “Now we are in the third wave . . . original production is coming from digital.”The group’s programming is tailored for the web, where shows tend to be watched in four or five-minute instalments. But Vuguru has also adapted and sold its series for broadcast on TV, where 30-minute episodes have been shown.FME, which is part of RTL, the European media group controlled by Bertelsmann, has already made a big bet on original digital series. The company this year struck a deal with Hulu, the online video site, to sell its original programming to international broadcasters.“New media studios such as Vuguru are home to some of the best and most exciting content and ideas anywhere in the industry,” said David Ellender, chief executive of FME.Online streaming services are increasing their production budgets in a bid to win viewers and advertising dollars. “This is not the collapse of TV . . . it’s an evolution,” said Mr Tanz. “There are new buyers out there for original content, like Netflix, Yahoo and AOL. And anyone who wants to drive a subscription video service needs [original content] to stand out.”Netflix, the largest subscription video service, has bet big on top talent such as actor and producer Kevin Spacey and the director David Fincher, buying their adaptation of the BBC series House of Cards. The company has made production of original series a central part of its strategy.YouTube has also moved into original content production, investing $100m in several new channels, mainly for unscripted programming.
695;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-09-19T00:12:44Z;Microsoft in digital programming push;;Microsoft has hired a senior television executive to head a new production studio in Los Angeles, marking the most direct intrusion by a technology company on to Hollywood’s turf.Nancy Tellem, who was head of the CBS entertainment division at the time it boasted hit shows including CSI and Survivor, has been handed a remit to turn Microsoft’s Xbox games console into the platform for a global digital video network, the company said on Tuesday.“Drama series, comedy series, reality shows – you name it, we’re looking, short-form and long-form,” Ms Tellem said in an interview with the Financial Times, laying out a far more expansive vision for Microsoft’s digital video than those of rivals Google and Amazon.Besides traditional “linear” shows, the new studio would also experiment with new forms of interactive video entertainment, taking advantage of the Kinect motion- and voice-activated controller that was developed for Xbox games, Microsoft executives said.“Not everyone wants to watch TV with a game controller in their hand,” said Phil Spencer, vice-president with responsibility for Microsoft’s games and video studios.The Microsoft move into programming comes at a time when other distributors of digital video, including Netflix, have started to dabble with producing original content to try to set their services apart.“This is the first time we’ve seen this kind of commitment, with the hiring of an industry vet with broadcasting experience,” said Mike McGuire, a digital media analyst at Gartner.Microsoft’s impact on the video business would depend on “how much [money] they’re prepared to throw at it”, he said.Google has put money behind small-scale producers to create specialised channels for its YouTube service, while Amazon has started to fund original video programming for customers of its Prime service.Mr Spencer outlined far more ambitious goals for the Microsoft move.With 44m users of its Xbox Live service, more than half of whom pay a subscription, Microsoft already boasts a global audience comparable to those of cable and satellite TV companies, he said.Mr Spencer compared the move into original programming to Microsoft’s use of exclusive games, principally Halo, to support initial sales of the Xbox console. Programming would be aimed at women and children as well as the core audience of young males who play games on the console, Ms Tellem said.The move caps a rush by internet companies into digital video, said Mr McGuire.“These are now media companies, not just tech companies,” he said.The multiple businesses built into the Xbox, which generates money for Microsoft through hardware sales as well as subscriptions and transaction revenues, has left the software company in a stronger position to attack the video business than a company such as Netflix, which is mainly a reseller of video produced by others, he added.
696;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-09-17T22:40:24Z;Investors start to tune out from Netflix;;"Netflix came under fresh pressure Monday as analysts raised concerns over the television and film streaming group’s rising costs.Shares in the company, which also delivers DVDs to households, dropped 5.8 per cent to $57.02.Analysts at Macquarie questioned whether Netflix could continue to rely on expanding its subscription base to subsidise the costs associated with adding content to its site as the company seeks to expand internationally.Tim Nollen, at Macquarie, said: “We worry its mostly older television content and thin streaming film library won’t be attractive enough for consumers that have
not yet cut their cords, and are being retained by incumbent television networks with a wealth of current content and growing live/on-demand viewing.”Elsewhere, a report from a media trade publication said Netflix was engaged in a battle to retain content from A+E Networks, which owns A&E and the History Channel. If a deal is not reached by Friday, the report in Variety said,
A+E Networks’ content would be removed from Netflix’s content.Netflix shares have fallen 62.7 per cent over the past year. Monday marked the anniversary of the company’s decision, which was eventually scrapped, to split its home delivery business, then planned to be renamed Qwikster, and its internet streaming business.“Not too long ago Netflix was the leading source for rentals of physical discs, and had a 35 per cent share of the market before the Qwikster announcement,” said a release from NPD Group, a market research company. “Its current market share is 27 per cent, and Netflix has ceded the lead in the physical disc-rental market to Redbox.”Overall, US equities slipped from multiyear highs as investors weighed the likelihood that the recent run-up in stocks would last after the Federal Reserve’s latest market intervention.The benchmark S&P 500, which rose 1.9 per cent last week to its highest point since late 2007, was 0.3 per cent lower at 1,461.19.Cyclical materials stocks, among last week’s best performing sectors, finished 1.5 per cent lower as investors appeared to be moving out of riskier equities yesterday. Cliffs Natural Resources dropped 7 per cent to $42.36 as some investors ditched shares in the coal mining company after its impressive run last week.The index is looking to maintain last week’s gains, made when the Federal Reserve launched another round of “quantitative easing” to try to stimulate the sluggish US economy.The decision followed actions a week earlier by the European Central Bank, which have helped markets in both the US and Europe move higher.Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said: “To the consternation of many bears, the S&P 500 continues to advance as central bankers in Europe and the US aggressively add liquidity.” He attributed part of the gains for stocks to the decline in the value of the dollar in recent weeks.The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.2 per cent to 3,178.67 as shares in Amazon dropped 1.3 per cent to $258.00.Shares in Apple, the consumer electronics company that released its latest iPhone last week, rose 1.2 per cent to $699.80, and in after-market hours moved above $700 a share. The iPhone appears to be on pace to beat sales records as Apple said more than 2m people had pre-ordered the smart phone, which is double the amount from its most recent release.Facebook declined 2.2 per cent to $21.52 after the social networking company enjoyed its biggest gains as a public company last week.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 3.1 per cent to $346.82 after the fast food restaurant chain received a boost from a research firm that said same store sales for the third quarter appeared to be growing ahead of expectations.Financial sector stocks, also among last week’s best performing sectors, were 1.1 per cent lower. Bank of America shares declined 2.6 per cent to $9.30. JPMorgan Chase shares fell 0.9 per cent to $41.21.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 per cent to 13,553.10. Shares in Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, lost 1.9 per cent to $69.92.The day’s best performing sector group on the S&P 500 was the telecommunications index, which rose 0.5 per cent. AT&T shares gained 0.9 per cent to $37.58, while Sprint Nextel climbed 0.2 per cent to $5.27."
697;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
698;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-09-12T19:54:26Z;BT turns defence into attack;;If there were any doubts about BT’s ambitions in the TV space, they should have been laid to rest on Wednesday.Its latest acquisition – of Premiership rugby rights– highlights the importance it attaches to having premium content to attract and retain viewers in the fiercely competitive pay TV market.But the move is more than just an offensive one, say analysts. It is also about the telecoms operator defending its turf in the broadband market, where rivals such as Virgin Media and Sky are eating into its market share.Mark Oliver, chief executive of media strategy consultants Oliver & Ohlbaum, says that Sky has converted approaching 40 per cent of its TV customers to its broadband service, with a further half of these switched to its telephony offering as well.“Most of the rest will convert as some point and that is a huge chunk of BT’s market,” Mr Oliver says. “Sky will then come after the rest of the 15m homes it does not have . . . That is a big threat to the biggest incumbent in the market and is what is driving BT’s strategy of moving into TV”.With 10.5m customers in the UK – and ambitions to expand deeper into homes through its recent launch of internet movie service Now TV – Sky is a serious threat to BT’s dominance in telephony and broadband. The telecoms incumbent sees “triple play” – the offering of TV, telephony and broadband – as a way to fight back.So far, BT Vision has gained more than 700,000 customers, and hopes that a sports channel would attract hundreds of thousands more.But many analysts also see the purchase of the rugby rights as a way of gaining an extra bargaining chip in future negotiations over Sky’s own sports channels.Last month, a competition tribunal reversed a mandatory wholesale deal that had forced Sky to offer its Sky Sports 1 and 2 channels to rivals at a lower price.Ian Livingston, chief executive of BT, has previously stated that the company wants the same access to Sky’s content as Sky has to BT’s telecoms network. BT may also have its eyes on additional Sky content – from Sky Atlantic, which airs popular US dramas, to a wider range of Sky Sports – which could prove a significant draw for customers, if BT could wholesale them from Sky.However, analysts at Bernstein also highlight a more unlikely and extreme scenario in which BT “could subscribe to Sky’s theory that it is irrelevant to be ‘number two’ in content and decide – over time – to spend ‘whatever it takes’ to secure a leadership position in premium content”.Such a strategy, the analysts warn, could “only ignite a price war for content that will pressure margins for BSkyB beyond what most investors assume”.The gamble is clearly a significant one for BT, which has already paid £738m for certain Premier League football rights. Tom Singlehurst, media analyst at Citigroup, says this is “an investment [equivalent to] a quarter of ITV’s annual programming costs”.Pricing in the pay TV market is expected to come under further pressure following TalkTalk’s decision to launch a low-cost pay TV business based around the YouView internet TV service. TalkTalk began a trial of YouView set-top boxes this week, although customers will not receive them until later this autumn. TalkTalk’s pricing is seen by some analysts as aggressively low-priced – fuelling worries that a price war could intensify.Dido Harding, TalkTalk’s chief executive, says the reason large telecoms groups are so keen to offer TV services is quite simply that “a TV customer is more profitable than a non-TV customer”.She rules out buying any exclusive content such as sports, describing it as a “big boy’s game”. Instead, she says, TalkTalk will bring together the content bought by other groups.However, with the rise of internet-connected TVs and competition from online services such as Netflix and Lovefilm, the battle for control of the nation’s remote controls looks set to run and run.
699;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-09-04T19:12:50Z;Weak manufacturing data hit US stocks;;Netflix came under heavy pressure on Tuesday as e-retailer Amazon signed a new content licensing agreement and increased its pressure on the internet streaming provider.Shares in Netflix, which also provides home DVD delivery for customers, declined as much as 11 per cent before recouping some of its early losses. The company’s shares finished 6.4 per cent lower to $55.93 as analysts questioned its ability to fend off competitors.Earlier in the morning, Amazon announced its new deal with Epix – a TV channel owned by Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn Mayer and Lionsgate – to show its content on the e-retailer’s “Prime” subscription service.Epix programming includes movies such as The Hunger Games, the first of what is expected to be a highly profitable film series based on the novels aimed at young adults.Netflix stock has fallen 19.3 per cent in the year to date, while Amazon shares have gained 43.2 per cent since the start of 2012.“This news is another example of the competition that is mounting in the streaming business – specifically subsidised streaming – and one of the reasons that we believe Netflix’s business model is broken,” said George Askew, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.“We note that Amazon now has over 25,000 titles, perhaps 60 per cent the number of Netflix in the United States,” he added.Amazon shares touched an intraday all-time high early on Tuesday but closed in negative territory, down 0.2 per cent to $247.88. The announcement of the new content deal came as analysts expect that the company will unveil its latest Kindle tablets this week.Anthony DiClemente, analyst at Barclays, cautioned investors about the new release.“While a lot of focus remains on the tablet devices themselves, we do not believe Amazon turns a profit on device sales, and we believe the true long-term opportunity is the higher margin content market, including digital books, movies, music, games, apps, and magazines,” he said.Overall, US equities on the benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,404.94 as trading began in the abbreviated four-day week with disappointing manufacturing data.Closed for a public holiday on Monday, US stocks were looking to bounce back after giving up some of their summer rally last week, which culminated with no new firm signs of monetary stimulus from a key policy maker conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.But a closely watched survey of manufacturing activity revealed a contraction for the third straight month in August and came in below market consensus.Wall Street’s bullishness on equities ticked up slightly for the first time in six months according to a measure of optimism from Bank of America Merril Lynch. But analysts at the bank warned that it remained at the lowest level since 1985.The Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 0.3 per cent to 3,048.02. Shares in Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, gained 0.5 per cent to $674.45 and finished at a record high.Facebook shares fell to their lowest level since their May debut as analysts at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase cut their forecasts for the company’s performance.. Shares in the social networking site declined 1.8 per cent to $17.73 and have fallen more than 53 per cent since going public.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,035.94.Shares in Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 14.7 per cent to $58.78 a day after it announced plans to acquire Medicis Pharmaceutical for $2.6bn. Medicis stock rose 38.3 per cent to $43.65, coming close to the $44 a share price Canadian-based Valeant said it would pay. Valeant has planned to use the acquisition to bolster its skincare business and increase its offerings to an ageing American population.Ford, the automaker, added 0.8 per cent to $9.41 as it said US sales in August rose 13 per cent compared with a year ago. However, General Motors dropped 0.2 per cent to $21.31 even as the maker of the Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick brands said its August sales had beaten market forecasts.Telecom stocks were the best performing sector on the S&P 500 as investors shunned risk assets on Tuesday. Verizon Communications gained 1.8 per cent to $43.70 to put it among the top gaining telecom stocks.Meanwhile, implied volatility on the benchmark index rose 2.9 per cent as Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge”, the Vix, moved up to the 18 level.Materials stocks were the worst off on the day, losing 1.5 per cent. Close behind were industrials, which declined 0.9 per cent, as Halliburton shed 1.9 per cent to $32.15. The oilfield services company said third-quarter revenues will fall short of the previous quarter due to a slowdown in its North America business.Shares in Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment company, declined 3.3 per cent to $82.66.
700;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Commission confirms Sky pay-TV ruling;;Regulators investigating British Sky Broadcasting’s dominant position in the UK pay-TV movies market have confirmed a previous ruling that the broadcaster was not stifling competition, in spite of protests from rival providers.The Competition Commission on Thursday reiterated its provisional decision in May that the rise of online pay-TV providers such as Netflix and Lovefilm had cut BSkyB’s dominance in the area.But the watchdog said that competition in the wider pay TV market did not appear to be working.‘In our view, competition in the pay-TV retail market overall remains ineffective,” said Laura Carstensen, chairman of the Inquiry Group. “But we were asked by Ofcom to look specifically at the role of first pay movie content and Sky’s position with regard to these rights. We have concluded that this content does not provide Sky with such an advantage when competing for pay-TV subscribers as to harm competition and, given this finding, we are not proposing any remedies.Rival Virgin Media rejected the commission’s ruling, and said: “Given its finding that the overall pay TV market isn’t working, it’s extremely disappointing the Competition Commission has chosen not to take any action.”“Until an effective intervention injects real competition into the acquisition of key content rights, British consumers will continue to pay more than they should.”The commission concluded that Sky Movies, which broadcasts movies from all six of Hollywood’s leading studios, was “not a sufficient driver of subscribers’ choice of pay-TV provider to give Sky such an advantage over its rivals …as to harm competition”.“The launch of new and improved movie services by Netflix and Lovefilm reflects an increasing trend of audio-visual content being delivered over the internet, and has increased competition and consumer choice.”Furthermore, the broadcaster’s move to offer Sky Movies on Now TV, the broadcaster’s new internet TV offering, gave consumers an alternative to subscribing to Sky’s pay-TV channel.Sky welcomed the ruling, and said it considered there to be “overwhelming evidence that UK consumers are well served by strong competition between a growing number of TV providers, including those offering movies”.
701;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-08-01T04:00:28Z;Nexus Q launch postponed by Google;;Google has postponed the launch of its poorly reviewed Nexus Q player – an orb-shaped device that streams video and music to home entertainment systems.Google unveiled the Q at its Google I/O developer event in June and was due to ship it in July. But it sent out a message on the last day of the month to those who had pre-ordered it, saying the consumer launch had been delayed.I tried out one of the Nexus Qs that were given away at the developer conference and, like my colleagues and many others, admired the design but was baffled by its limited features.The $300 device will only play content available on Google Play. It cannot stream the Netflix or Hulu movie and TV services onto a TV for example, nor allow a photo slideshow to accompany any music.Google seems to have been sensitive to user feedback and poor reviews, judging by its email to those who pre-ordered the Q. It reads:“The industrial design and hardware were met with great enthusiasm. We also heard initial feedback from users that they want Nexus Q to do even more than it does today. In response, we have decided to postpone the consumer launch of Nexus Q while we work on making it even better.”There is a bonus for those who pre-ordered. They will receive a Q for free shortly, just like Google I/O attendees.For everyone else, the Nexus Q order page has reverted to asking those interested to sign up with their email address to receive further news when available.
702;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix tumbles after subscriber shortfall;Shares down 14 per cent after misses targets;Netflix shares tumbled more than 16 per cent in after-hours trading after the online video and DVD subscription service missed its target for new subscriber numbers in the second quarter.The group had projected 7m new subscribers in the US by the end of the fiscal year, a target that some analysts say is unrealistic. Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, acknowledged in his letter to shareholders that if the group failed to finish the third quarter “in the high end” of its range, meeting its 7m target “would be challenging to achieve”.The group added 530,000 streaming customers in the US in the quarter – 70,000 fewer than forecast – after 1.7m were added in the previous quarter. This leaves Netflix facing an uphill battle to meet its target, which Mr Hastings said would be complicated by the Olympics. “This quarter the Olympics are likely to have a negative impact on Netflix viewing and sign-ups,” he wrote.He also warned of the competitive threat posed by US cable companies, which are slowly improving their own online video services. Hulu and Amazon, which both offer online video have yet to gain “meaningful traction”, he said. Redbox, a DVD kiosk operator, has formed a joint venture with Verizon, the US telecoms group, although the new service will “face a big challenge to break into the top three of subscription streaming services”.The slump in Netflix shares – which fell $13.14, or 16.4 per cent, in after-hours trading on Tuesday – came even though the group hit its earnings targets: revenues for the three months to June 30 were $889m, compared with $788.6m in the same period last year.But net income slipped to $6.2m from $68.2m, and earnings per share were 11 cents compared with $1.30.Netflix continues to grow internationally after a successful launch in the UK, where it has outstripped Amazon’s LoveFilm service. But it faces tougher competition in the UK from British Sky Broadcasting’s Sky channel, which is launching a premium online video service. “Going forward, competing effectively with Sky is our core and substantial challenge,” said Mr Hastings.The group returned to profitability in the quarter but Mr Hastings warned on an earnings call that profits would not be sustained as international expansion plans were resumed.The group added 530,000 new subscribers internationally in the quarter and said it would launch in a new market, believed to be Spain. “As long as there are good markets to enter around the world, we will take the US profits and put them into faster [international] expansion,” said Mr Hastings.
703;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-07-13T18:27:30Z;Disney still has star potential;Film scheme projections leave Dina Iordanova in the dark;Tax avoidance schemes of the rich and famous – recently exposed in this newspaper and others – have led to me to take a closer look at film investment. Not to avoid any tax, I should stress, but to understand how anyone makes money out of movies.Back in April, for example, the FT reported on Eclipse, a scheme that allowed members to claim tax relief on loans they took out to acquire distribution rights to two Disney films: Enchanted and Underdog. These rights were then leased back to the film producer for a payment spread over a 20-year period.I wonder about the scheme because film has a limited shelf life: depreciation happens fast and, with few exceptions, leaves little residual value.Take Underdog, released on March 8 2007. According to online database Box Office Mojo, its lifetime gross so far is about $65m. While not a bomb, critics have described the film’s performance as “a far cry from a box-office hit”.Enchanted launched on November 21 2007. It currently boasts a box office take of about $340m.So, together, the two films have earned about $405m. After offsetting production costs of $118m, that means they have made £287m so far.In film industry terms, however, they are already “second run” and mainly rely on auxiliary revenues. As Disney material, they could probably squeeze another $100m from the marketplace. But to get to the $754m (£503m) that Eclipse paid in 2007 for their exploitation over 20 years, they still need to earn another $467m – an average of about £19m for each of the remaining 15 years of the deal.I wish I knew more about the revenue and depreciation assumptions used for the Eclipse Film Partners deal. My common sense – and understanding of the film industry – suggest they used projections that are out of line with industry averages. No wonder the deal has attracted scrutiny.But all the coverage of the story prompted me to look at shares in Disney itself.Counting cash is a key exercise in assessing companies’ balance sheets, and Disney clearly understands how to generate it. Pocketing $754m in upfront cash for the perishable merchandise package of Underdog and Enchanted is a great achievement. As a result, I am considering buying into Disney on a dip, either by purchasing stock on the open market or via The Walt Disney Company Investment Plan – a share purchase and dividend reinvestment scheme for private investors.Everything seems to be in favour of such a move. Disney’s share price chart looks better than most companies’: the uptrend since October 2011 has been unaffected by recent jitters. With the share price up by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months, and recently hitting new highs, there is a momentum investing case for buying. With the annual dividend up by 50 per cent, there is a value case, too.Besides, Disney is as diversified as an income investment trust. It spans the world, with operations in Brazil, India, China and Europe. It spans the sectors too, from publishing and digital media, to TV networks (ABC), consumer products, retail, and entertainment. It has done deals with digital companies such as Netflix, Comcast, and Hulu. It benefits from the popularity of computer animation, through Pixar. It owns the Marvel franchises . . . and so much more. I am enchanted by it!Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments. She may have a financial interest in any of the companies, securities and trading strategies mentioned.
704;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-07-08T16:48:10Z;Call for more regulation of pay TV market;;Virgin Media has demanded stronger regulation of the pay TV market, saying it is “deeply concerned” about BSkyB’s continued stranglehold on the market.In a letter to Vince Cable, business secretary, the pay TV provider said Ofcom should have greater powers to prevent dominance in the market for content, similar to those the regulator has over the telecommunications market.Neil Berkett, Virgin Media’s chief executive, criticised the competition commission’s recent ruling on the pay TV film market, calling it “irrational, unsound and highly speculative”.In May, regulators probing BSkyB’s position in the UK pay-TV marke t backtracked on a previous decision that the broadcaster was choking competition. The ruling, which was provisional until a final decision in August, said that the rise of online pay-TV providers such as Netflix and Lovefilm, owned by Amazon, had cut British Sky Broadcasting’s dominance in the area.But the commission did admit that “competition in the pay-TV retail market overall is ineffective”. Sky Movies holds the first-window rights to films from Hollywood’s top six studios.A Virgin Media spokesperson said: “Sky’s continued and recognised control restricts competition and the Commission’s unfounded U-turn risks cementing the unnecessarily high prices viewers have been forced to pay for reduced choice and less innovation.” BSkyB declined to comment.The department for culture, media and sport, which is overseeing the introduction of a new communications act, said it would welcome submissions to its review.
705;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-07-08T15:54:50Z;Start-ups jostle for Sun Valley spotlight;;The guest list features Jordan’s king and queen, Italy’s prime minister, three mayors, two governors and the director of the CIA. But technology and media superpowers will be the focus of attention this week as Allen & Co hosts its annual moguls’ retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho.For three decades, private jets have deposited executives at the exclusive resort to attend panels organised by the media investment bank, relax in the Sawtooth Mountains and hatch industry-changing deals.This year’s 37-page guest list is the usual media and technology who’s who, according to a copy seen by the Financial Times. Walt Disney’s Bob Iger, News Corp’s Rupert Murdoch and Time Warner’s Jeff Bewkes are representing the media establishment as usual.Technology peers such as Eric Schmidt and Sergey Brin of Google, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook have not been coming to Idaho for as many years, but increasingly dictate media companies’ fate.The most eagerly awaited guest will be Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, as media groups adjust to the changes wrought by the iPad and brace for the long-rumoured introduction of an Apple TV set. Mr Cook’s predecessor, the late Steve Jobs, rarely accepted his Sun Valley invitation.On the agenda will be economic, geopolitical and technology topics, with the guest list suggesting security themes will also feature prominently.Some of last year’s tech stars have lost their lustre since they last met at the ski lodge. Facebook, Groupon and Zynga all went public in the last year, only for their shares to fizzle. Shares in Netflix, which still splits opinion at Sun Valley, have fallen 70 per cent since last July.Older internet companies know the feeling. Yahoo’s board is in the final stages of picking a new chief executive for the struggling group, and its likely pick, interim CEO Ross Levinsohn, is on the Sun Valley guest list.That will not stop a new crop of tech start-ups from drawing attention. Among this year’s invitees is Joe Einhorn, founder of TheFancy.com, a competitor to Pinterest and Fab.com that lets users post pictures of products they “fancy”, browse and buy. More than 1m registered users are spending a combined $10,000 a day on the site.TheFancy has drawn interest from other Sun Valley attendees including Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter and Square, and Mr Zuckerberg, who recently opened an account. Mr Einhorn is heading to Idaho seeking money to expand the site or a potential buyer, one person with knowledge of his plans said.Other buzzy start-ups expected in Idaho include Airbnb, Dropbox, Uber, Cloudera and Nextdoor. More established digital companies in dealmaking mode include Vevo, the music video site that has hired Allen & Co to find funds for its international expansion and must renegotiate a distribution deal with Google’s YouTube this year.Bigger deals negotiated in Sun Valley’s discreet cabins, including Disney’s 1995 acquisition of Cap Cities/ABC and Comcast’s NBCUniversal investment, have burnished the event’s reputation and generated publicity and business for its host, Herb Allen.This year, Vivendi chairman Jean-René Fourtou is the centre of deal speculation. The French group is reviewing restructuring options including a possible split of its telecoms and media assets or a disposal of its stake in Activision Blizzard, whose CEO, Bobby Kotick, is also due at the event.The most talked-about media deal, however, was agreed last week when Mr Murdoch announced plans to split News Corp in two.Mr Murdoch will be joined in Sun Valley by his sons Lachlan and James and perhaps his daughter, Elisabeth. Another guest predicted that News Corp’s break-up and chatter about other media conglomerates following suit will be high on the agenda.It was in Sun Valley 12 months ago, as phone hacking headlines rocked his London newspaper arm, that Mr Murdoch agreed to close the disgraced News of the World tabloid. The biggest media story of the year was forged in Sun Valley, it turned out, but it was not a deal.
706;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Global economic gloom weighs on Wall St;;JPMorgan Chase shares fell 4.2 per cent to $34.38 as the banking sector continued to suffer amid broader economic and regulatory uncertainty.The S&P financials index fell 1.5 per cent, making it the worst performing sector on Thursday.“The short-term future for banks – the next nine-12 months – holds a lot of uncertainty, as capital requirements and the regulatory environment are getting tougher and large retail banks still hold a lot of bad debt,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“We think that they will underperform in the near future until they figure out how to be more profitable on a much larger scale again.”JPMorgan was also downgraded by Meredith Whitney’s group to “hold” from “outperform” on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley lost 3.9 per cent to $14.51. Citigroup dropped 2.9 per cent to $26.84, while Goldman Sachs fell 2.7 per cent to $95.92. Bank of America shares declined 2.9 per cent to $7.82.In the wider markets, equities ended Thursday’s session lower. Eight out of 10 S&P sectors were in negative territory, led by financials, energy and telecommunications.The S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,367.58 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.4 per cent lower at 12,896.67, while the Nasdaq Composite recouped earlier losses to close virtually unchanged at 2,976.12.US employment data, while positive, failed to lift equities in the wake of central bank moves in Europe, the UK and China. US private sector employers added more jobs in June than forecast while the drop in jobless claims in the week ending June 30 was also larger than expected. Analysts said that such an improvement, however slight, could mean that the Federal Reserve abstains from further monetary stimulus.Stock markets also reacted negatively to the gloomy view of the world economy by central banks, after the European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China cut interest rates while the Bank of England announced another round of its bond purchasing programme.“We are in a period when bad economic news is good for markets, because it increases the probability that the Fed will supply cheap money with quantitative easing. Today’s data were better than expected and many investors took it as an impediment to QE3, while the ECB’s quarter percentage point cut was negligible,” Mr Wren said.Netflix shares rallied 13.4 per cent to $81.72, making it the best performing stock for the second consecutive day. Investors reacted to the announcement on Facebook by its chief executive that the video streaming service’s customers watched more than 1bn hours of movies and TV shows online in June, a record for the company.Retail stocks were in focus after top retail chains reported their same-store sales. The S&P 500 retail index shrugged off the fact the average figure for same-store sales growth was less than analysts had estimated and rose 1 per cent.Sales at discount and luxury chains were strong and shares in TJX, Limited Brands and Nordstrom were among the best performers on Wall Street, while sales at mid-scale stores such as Target, Macy’s and Costco were below analysts’ estimates.The “retail sector is bifurcated – on one side discount and luxury stores continue to do well, while mid-scale stores remain weak, which is a function of the struggling labour market”, said Phil Orlando, chief equities strategist at Federated Investors.Sales at TJX, which owns the discount stores TJ Maxx and Marshalls, rose 7 per cent, beating analysts’ average estimates. The shares rose 3.7 per cent to $44.09.Sales at Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, also beat analyst estimates and the shares rose 4.5 per cent to $46.12. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, reported higher same-store sales and its shares added 1.9 per cent to reach $51.53.Target, the second-largest discount store and Macy’s, the department store chain, reported declines in sales and highlighted the continued pressure of high unemployment on consumer confidence and spending. Target shares fell 1.1 per cent to $57.15. Macy’s rose 2.7 per cent to $34.27.Among technology stocks, Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, climbed 1.8 per cent to $609.94, underpinning gains on the index.Google also rose, adding 1.4 per cent to $595.92.
707;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-07-04T16:51:59Z;YouView internet TV meets Olympic deadline;Boxes will not be widely available until the autumn;"YouView, the internet TV service backed by important UK broadcasters and broadband providers, has finally launched with an ambitious promise to change the viewing habits of the country.The long-delayed platform, which combines on-demand TV content with a Freeview service that can rewind to programmes up to a week old, has entered the market slightly in advance of the Olympics as hoped, although boxes will not be widely available until the autumn.YouView was originally planned for 2010 but was delayed by technical obstacles and debate among its many shareholders, which include the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, TalkTalk and BT. The appointment of Sir Alan Sugar as chairman a year ago accelerated progress, but analysts warned yesterday that it had already missed a first-mover advantage given the success of film-streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon’s Lovefilm.Richard Halton, YouView chief executive, said that it had not missed its opportunity, however. “We struggle to see that argument,” he said. “It is only us that brings together the content and makes it easy to discover.”There will be three YouView boxes on the market this year, with the first being sold by South Korean electrical goods maker Humax for £299 – almost a third more than its typical recordable digital boxes – a price that analysts have said could deter widespread take-up.Channel hopping could be eradicated for good by the YouView platform.The initial impression of the platform is a little underwhelming, but familiarity is no curse for a mass-market product. It is centred around a simple programme guide, similar to the BBC’s iPlayer.There are two key services: the “backward EPG” that means you can scroll through and watch the previous week’s programmes or move forward to record; and a search engine with which you can pull up on-demand programmes and films. Such functions are commonplace now, but YouView scores highly by bringing it all together.Potential customers would be advised to wait, however, for the heavily subsidised boxes due out from BT and TalkTalk this autumn, rather than paying £299 for a Humax set-top box, the only one currently available. Indeed, the real value of the platform will only become apparent over time. Although this is a step up from the existing digital Freeview service, it is hardly a revolution in how TV is watched today.BT and TalkTalk will launch their own boxes in the autumn, and are likely to subsidise the cost of the device by bundling it with paid-for packages that combine broadband with premium content. Mr Halton said it was also in talks with TV manufacturers about pre-installing YouView.The platform is seen by analysts as important for TalkTalk, which does not have its own TV service unlike rivals such as Virgin Media.Nick Delfas, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said it should have a positive impact for BT – which can build a business by offering TV content that will help push its broadband packages – but a more negative impact on rival Virgin Media. BT will use the platform to help sell the 114 Premier League football games it acquired for £740m last month.A person familiar with BT’s thinking said pricing would be broadly in line with the existing offering from BT Vision, which charges £4 a month with a £40 one-off joining fee, or £12 a month for all premium content with no joining fee.YouView has an open operating model, which means that any content provider can use the platform. Yesterday, Sky confirmed that it would offer its NowTV package of films and sport, and Mr Halton said that it was in talks with a wide range of other providers such as Lovefilm."
708;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-06-18T19:00:12Z;Mobile data prices;Transparent price plans might start cut-throat discounting;"Fiddling with pricing is a game telecoms and cable companies can never stop playing. They plough fixed investment into infrastructure and programming, then charge for services with vanishingly small incremental costs of delivery. Consumers, for their part, are always looking to pay the incremental cost (roughly nothing) for the services, rather than the total cost. And finally competitors want to price below total cost to take share.Last week Verizon made a significant move, introducing wireless plans that in essence eliminate the longstanding practice of charging separately for voice minutes and data. Customers will pay a fixed fee per device, and for however many gigabytes they use. So it will not be possible for consumers to arbitrage cheap data against expensive minutes by, say, using an unlimited data plan and a Skype account to talk on the cheap. Other telcos are expected to follow Verizon’s lead.In cable (TV and data), meanwhile, Comcast’s announcement last month that it would charge overage fees to customers who use masses of data, rather than simply throttling back their data connections, has been widely seen as a step towards tiered pricing based on volumes. This would be a legitimate way for the distributors to defuse another consumer arbitrage: using a video-streaming service, such as Netflix, rather than their TV packages.Verizon and Comcast both earn single-digit returns on invested capital. Companies that depend on their networks, from Netflix to Apple, make returns many times higher. Surely rational pricing, based on volume, can help close this gap? Perhaps; but rational price plans are transparent. Consumers paying as they go may see little difference between providers. The problem of consumer price arbitrage may end up being replaced by the problem of cut-throat pricing.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
709;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-05-31T18:39:40Z;Hopes for Hollywood cloud darken;;"Hollywood studios banking on a cloud-based locker system to revive home entertainment sales face an uphill battle after a new report showed a slowdown in purchases of film content from Apple’s iTunes store.While revenues from subscription rental services such as Netflix are increasing, sales of feature films on iTunes – the largest US online movie retailer by sales – have slowed, according to the report from IHS Screen Digest, a media research firm.Online film revenues in the US more than doubled in 2011 to reach $992m and are on course to double again in 2012 to $1.9bn, said Dan Cryan, the author of the report. But subscription rental services such as Netflix drove this growth, with total digital rental revenues rising 355 per cent to $727m. Revenues from online film purchases increased by less than $6m, or 2.4 per cent, to $236m in 2011.With consumers turning away from buying films online in favour of renting them digitally, the outlook is bleak for UltraViolet, a new industry-wide, cloud-based locker system that Hollywood hopes will stimulate purchases of film content. “When consumers go digital, they go to rental,” said Mr Cryan. “There’s just no interest in owning anything.”UltraViolet has the support of most big Hollywood studios, including Warner Brothers and Sony Pictures and several consumer electronics groups and retailers, including Walmart and Best Buy. They hope UltraViolet will replace lost income from sales of physical discs; DVD sales slumped 20 per cent in 2011 to $6.8bn, according to the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents studios, retailers and consumer electronics groups.UltraViolet allows consumers to buy a film, whether on a physical disc or digitally, and then watch it on the device of their choosing. But it has been slow to take off and consumer reviews have been mixed. Bob Iger, chief executive of Walt Disney, which is not participating in UltraViolet, recently said it was “not as robust as we expected or as consumer-friendly as we hoped”.Walmart, the biggest US retailer of physical discs, recently launched a “disc to digital” initiative to speed take-up of UltraViolet. Customers can pay $2 per disc to convert their existing DVDs to cloud-based files that can be streamed or downloaded to any device."
710;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-05-30T16:38:40Z;Lovefilm and Universal end rights dispute;;Lovefilm, the Amazon-owned movie rental service, has struck a multi-year deal allowing it to show Universal Pictures’ content, marking the end of a two-and-a-half-year dispute between the two companies.It gives Lovefilm exclusive rights to films such as Kick-Ass, Battleship and Bridesmaids for online streaming, granting subscribers’ access to Universal’s films. It also allows Lovefilm to rent out Universal movies on DVD – over a which disagreement first erupted in 2009.Universal is the third large movie distributor, after Sony Pictures and Warner Bros, to carve out a so-called “second pay-TV window” with Lovefilm amid intensifying competition between the subscription rental services and British Sky Broadcasting, Netflix and a host of other services operated by the likes of Tesco, Dixons and HMV.In light of this growing rivalry, the Competition Commission last week concluded that Sky Movies’ “first window” deals with studios were not restricting competition, reversing the regulator’s earlier decision.The online pay-TV windows typically begin showing films six months after they have been shown on Sky Movies.BSkyB has announced plans to launch Now TV, a new “over the top” online video service, to compete more directly with its digital rivals.Now TV will offer shorter-term contracts and more flexible bundles of content in an attempt to reach subscribers who are unwilling or cannot afford to install a satellite dish.As well as striking new content deals to take on Netflix and Sky Movies, Lovefilm’s sales force has been taking its online service on to the streets, making door-to-door calls and approaching people in person in town centres.
711;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-05-23T11:31:19Z;Regulator reverses BSkyB pay-TV ruling;;Regulators probing British Sky Broadcasting’s position in the UK pay-TV movies market have backtracked on a previous decision that the broadcaster was choking competition.The Competition Commission on Wednesday provisionally ruled that the rise of online pay-TV providers such as Netflix and Lovefilm had cut BSkyB’s dominance in the area.The Sky Movies channels “no longer provide BSkyB with a material advantage over its rivals in the pay-TV retail market”, the commission said.“Whereas in the past consumers wanting to watch recent movies on a pay-TV movie service had to subscribe to Sky Movies through a traditional platform, the launch of new and improved movie services in the market by Netflix and Lovefilm means that they now have other alternatives.”However, the commission admitted that “competition in the pay-TV retail market overall is ineffective”.The decree reverses the commission’s findings last August that BSkyB’s control over film rights was restricting competition between pay-TV providers, leading to “higher prices and reduced choice for subscribers”.At the time, the commission decreed that “first-window” deals with Hollywood’s six leading studios were anti-competitive and estimated that BSkyB’s domination cost UK consumers an extra £50m-£60m a year.However, the commission’s definition of the market at the time included rivals such as BT and Virgin Media but not online video services, and the new investigation was broadened to include them.BSkyB, the UK’s largest pay-TV provider with more than 10m subscribers, welcomed Wednesday’s revised findings. “We have long argued that UK consumers are well served by strong competition between a variety of movies providers,” it said.However, rival Virgin Media lashed out at the about-face, and said that BSkyB’s control of movie rights was restricting competition and innovation in the UK.“The recent emergence of providers such as Lovefilm and Netflix has done nothing to impact Sky’s advantage,” it said.BT said it also disagreed with the findings, but said it was pleased that the commission acknowledged that competition in the pay-TV market was ineffective.Late last year, BSkyB criticised the first ruling’s methodology for failing to take into account potential competition from Lovefilm, owned by Amazon.com, and Netflix, which launched in the UK in January.However, the commission said in March that the arrival of Netflix in the UK and BSkyB’s plans to launch its own online service made it necessary to extend the probe.Although Sky Movies still holds first-window rights to movies from Hollywood’s top six studios, both Lovefilm and Netflix have made inroads by forging exclusive deals with Sony, Warner and Lions Gate.The commission took over the probe into the pay-TV market in August 2010 after Ofcom, the UK media watchdog, referred it for investigation.The commission is scheduled to hand down a final ruling in early August.BSkyB shares rose 3.5p to 694p.
712;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-05-03T19:50:54Z;Viacom pins hopes on turtle power;;Viacom is hoping that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will swing to the rescue of flagging ratings at its Nickelodeon network, even as the media group denied that digital platforms such as Netflix and other on-demand channels were cannibalising traditional viewing.An improvement in the US advertising market and greater “affiliate” fees from cable operators and digital distributors helped the owner of Paramount, MTV and Comedy Central to overshoot analysts’ forecasts with 56 per cent growth in net income to $588m for the second quarter.Analysts have been puzzled by a dramatic decline in viewing figures at Nickelodeon, where as many as a quarter of viewers have deserted long-running shows such as Spongebob Squarepants.Tom Dooley, chief operating officer, said that a “strengthening in the overall tone of the ad marketplace” was helping to offset “rating deficiencies” and dismissed some analysts’ suggestions that on-demand viewing was to blame for the network’s decline.“Netflix is present in less than a quarter of TV households,” he said. “I can tell you that the time spent on Nick content on Netflix is approximately 2 per cent of the time spend on our Nickelodeon [cable] channel… We are getting nice revenues through these [subscription video on demand] deals.”This data, based on streaming data from Netflix itself, suggested on-demand had “minimal impact” on ratings weakness, which had more to do with “measurement issues” and the strength of competitive channels.Figures released yesterday by Nielsen, which tracks US TV-watching habits, supported that view, showing that 98 per cent of American viewing occurs on the traditional TV set, with only modest increases in “timeshifted” or recorded TV, internet or mobile video.To tackle the ratings problem, Nickelodeon is investing in developing more original content for the important autumn season, including a revival of the 1980s franchise Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, about which Mr Dooley said the company was “particularly excited”.Philippe Dauman, Viacom chief executive, added: “In this age of time shifting and on-demand viewing across platforms, the value of fresh and original content is greater than ever.”He said Viacom was upping investments in social networking applied to TV content and tablet viewing, which a Viacom study suggested had surpassed laptops as the “preferred second screen”.Revenue growth from affiliates of 17 per cent was ahead of many analysts’ expectations, thanks to digital revenues, with the phasing of unnamed “product availability” likely to mean a dip in the current quarter compared to last year, with a return to double-digit growth in the September quarter.At Paramount, the re-release of Titanic in 3D has generated more than $300m in box office takings, with new Katy Perry and GI Joe movies set for release later this year. Shares in Viacom were 3.2 per cent higher at $48.93 in late afternoon trading in New York.
713;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-04-24T20:30:38Z;Apple shares soar in after-hours trading;;Apple reported earnings more than $2 better than expected at $12.30 per share for the second quarter, sending shares in the world’s largest company by market value up as much as 7 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Netflix shares tumbled as its overseas business and slowing subscriber rate dragged on future profits, while telecoms leapt ahead of all major sector groups in the S&P 500, gaining 2.8 per cent as AT&T beat forecast earnings and jumped more than 3 per cent.Overall, the S&P 500 moved 0.4 per cent higher to finish at 1,371.97.Apple shares finished 2 per cent lower to $560.28 in regular trading, but soared in after market activity as it reported second-quarter results that significantly beat expectations. The company said revenues were $39.2bn in the period, beating the $36.8bn forecast by analysts.However, the company revised lower its revenue expectations for the next quarter to $34bn versus $37.4bn forecast by analysts.Shares in the iPad and iPhone maker have risen 38 per cent in the year to date and are responsible for a hefty portion of the S&P 500’s growth in 2012.Through to Tuesday’s session, 78 per cent of the 154 companies on the benchmark US index that have reported earnings thus far have beaten analyst expectations, according to Christine Short at S&P Capital IQ.Still, the main US market has fallen about 2.6 per cent in April as investors have looked beyond Wall Street analysts lowering expectations before the earnings season began.Shares in Netflix, the home DVD delivery and internet streaming company, declined almost 14 per cent to $87.68. After Monday’s close, the company reported losses of 8 cents a share, 18 cents better than expected. Revenues grew 28 per cent to $870m compared with its first-quarter results from a year ago.Domestic subscriptions increased by 1.7m in the quarter but the company said it forecast just 600,000 adds in the next three months, below market expectations. Net new subscribers for the year, it said, were on pace for about 7m.Jeff Rath, analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said he was troubled by the fact that subscriptions were on target to reach 2010 levels.“We remain concerned about the long-term economic model of the streaming business as competition increases,” he said of his “sell” rating.The company said international subscriptions rose 1.2m to 3.1m, but that the business lost $103m in the period. Analysts, while encouraged overall by the results for the quarter, were wary of a slackening in the pace of new subscribers.“Although Netflix’s first-quarter domestic subscriber growth, contribution margins and international subscriber growth were all better than expected, second-quarter subscriber guidance came in below Street expectations,” said Anthony DiClemente, analyst at Barclays.Mr DiClemente trimmed his price target in shares of the company from $115 to $95, but maintained his “hold” rating.The S&P 500 telecoms sector index rose as AT&T, the largest US phone company by revenues, saw its shares rise more than 3.5 per cent to $31.72.The company reported earnings of 60 cents a share in the first quarter, 3 cents better than the same period a year ago and analysts’ consensus for the period.Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at Credit Suisse, gave the company a “neutral” rating, saying that its shares traded at a premium of 12.7 times forecast 2012 earnings.Shares in Verizon Communications and Sprint Nextel both rose after AT&T’s results. Verizon gained 2.4 per cent to $39.50 and Sprint was 5.6 per cent higher at $2.47.The fallout from allegations of bribery in its Mexico operation continued to affect shares in Walmart. Reports on Tuesday said that the company, which allegedly sought to cover up $24m worth of bribes paid to get key licences to open new stores in the important emerging market country, had become the focus of a probe by the US Department of Justice.Walmart’s shares declined nearly 3 per cent to $57.77, having fallen 7.5 per cent since allegations came out over the weekend.Shares in confectioner Hershey Co jumped 6 per cent to $66 after the company said earnings came in 15 cents better than expected at 98 cents a share on revenues of $1.73bn and raised their earnings forecast for the year.Fresh housing data released on Tuesday helped homebuilders make gains that put them among the day’s best performers. US home prices in February showed their first monthly gain in nearly a year and new home sales in March beat market expectations.The three largest listed companies on the S&P 500, PulteGroup, DR Horton and Lennar Corp, all moved more than 2 per cent higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.6 per cent higher to 13,001.56, while the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.3 per cent lower to 2,961.60.
714;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-04-23T23:08:33Z;Netflix shares fall 15% on growth worries;;Netflix shares fell more than 15 per cent in after-hours trading amid fears about the pace of subscriber growth at the video streaming and DVD subscription group.The company, which recently launched in the UK, hit earnings estimates for the quarter and promised to add 7m subscribers in its core US market by the end of its fiscal year.With 1.7m US subscribers added in the first quarter and about 600,000 forecast for the second, analysts expressed concerns that the company could deliver 4.5m more in the second half of the year. “They’re being unrealistic about the second half,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said in his letter to shareholders that there would be more “quarterly seasonality [in 2012]” because the company was starting with a larger number of subscribers. “Our gross additions are consistent with historic patterns,” he told an investor call. “We feel very good about the year.”But investors did not share his confidence and embarked on a sell-off that had echoes of last year when a botched rebranding and separation of Netflix’s DVD and streaming business hit shares.Netflix has steadied the ship since then and hit its targets in the first quarter. Revenue for the three months to March 31 was $870m compared with $718.6m in the same period in 2011. Losses were $4.6m, compared with a profit last time of $60.2m.The group expects to return to profitability in 2012 and said it would resume international expansion plans. Its next market is expected to be Spain, joining Latin America, Canada and the UK.While the UK launch has gone well Netflix conceded it needed to do more work in Latin America to drive “consumer understanding” of its service. Mr Hastings said there were “unique infrastructure challenges” in the region. “The odds of us building a large, profitable business in Latin America are very good, but it will take longer than we initially thought,” he wrote in his investor letter.Netflix has bet heavily on the UK, which has led its international growth. “From the start, we achieved the highest net additions we’ve ever seen in the first 90 days of an international market launch,” wrote Mr Hastings.The company plans to bulk up the content available to UK subscribers by bidding for more exclusive film and television rights. The UK pay television rights to the six Hollywood studios are currently owned by British Sky Broadcasting’s Sky movies channel although the company plans to bid for one of these studio deals if one becomes available.The shares fell 4 per cent to $101.84 at the close and were off an additional 15 per cent after hours.
715;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-04-23T22:45:19Z;Netflix: questionable assumptions;Executives say we are not to worry;Netflix’s March quarter report, released after the close on Monday, contained exactly one number that mattered: 22.6m. That is the midpoint of the management’s guidance for US streaming video subscribers at the end of the June quarter. It implies that about 600,000 net new subscribers will be added in this quarter. Sounds good. Trouble is, almost 2m were added in the last one. Growth, which had looked as if it was picking up after the badly handled price change last year, seems to be falling off again. The shares sold off by as much as 17 per cent after hours, having already lost 4 per cent during the day’s trading.Netflix expects net subscriber additions in 2012 be roughly the same as 2010, at about 7m. But that guidance suggests that only 2.5m will have been added by mid-year. Experienced investors know to be wary of back-end loaded projections.Predictably, the Netflix executives say we are not to worry. There was a similar seasonal pattern in 2010, which will just be a bit more pronounced this year – a mathematical inevitability, given a higher subscriber base and higher churn.Even if management’s assumptions about the mathematics of churn and seasonality are right, you still have to get to 7m. In a business that is changing as fast as streaming video, who could possibly have visibility into what demand will be beyond six months? Investors have responded as if growth is slowing next quarter, and after that it is anyone’s guess. They are perfectly rational to do so.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
716;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-04-06T21:36:30Z;Picture remains fuzzy on YouView;;It is the project that its backers promised would “change the way you watch TV for ever”, offering viewers a choice of live broadcasts or catch-up video from the likes of BBC iPlayer.But more than three years since its inception, YouView, the ambitious internet-television service supported by a raft of large broadcasters and telecoms groups led by TalkTalk, the BBC and BT, is still being tested.Delays to YouView, which was initially expected to be available by Christmas 2010, could fail to launch fully before this summer’s London Olympic Games this July, analysts warn, and therefore unable to benefit from the year’s biggest sporting event that is expected to draw millions of TV viewers.“It has missed the whole point – to have it up and running for the Olympics,” says Ian Maude, an analyst at Enders. “It has been stuck in bureaucratic treacle. They have a lot of shareholders of differing interests to please, and the net result is that everything has taken a lot longer than anyone originally predicted.”The raison d’être of YouView was simple: bringing free-to-air TV such as Freeview into the digital age.The project specifies technology standards in video quality and interface design, with a central payment system to allow pay-per-view TV or shopping. Manufacturers of set-top boxes will then incorporate the software platform, co-branded with YouView. It has been described as somewhere between Google TV, with its emphasis on searching the entire web for video, and the “closed” set-top boxes offered by Virgin Media and British Sky Broadcasting.It is not only missing the Olympics that could hinder the success of the project, which has, according to BBC Trust figures, a budget of £115m for its development and the first four years after launch.As YouView’s scale and complexity has delayed its launch, Netflix has started offering films online in the UK, adding to the already highly competitive and crowded market, and leaving some analysts and industry insiders questioning whether the venture really has a future.“The original logic behind YouView was pretty good: to future proof free-to-air television against pay-TV and ensure that it remained strong in the UK,” says Mr Maude. “But it is facing an increasingly competitive market. The justification for YouView is looking weaker by the day.”In spite of its heavyweight backers – broadcasters Channel 4, Channel 5, the BBC and ITV, and communication companies Arqiva, BT and TalkTalk – a long regulatory process involving reviews by the BBC Trust, the Office of Fair Trading and Ofcom, has put back YouView’s launch until mid-2012.Originally known as Project Canvas, the service was initiated in December 2008 following the collapse of Project Kangaroo, the video-on-demand platform that was blocked on competition grounds. A year ago Lord Sugar was installed as its chairman in an effort to speed up the process.The project has also started losing some of its backers. The seven set-top-box hardware manufacturing partners which initially signed up to the project have been whittled down to three – Humax, Huawei and Pace – with Cisco and Technicolor among the dropouts.“The indifference of the way that the set-top-box makers have treated YouView is pretty indicative of its situation,” notes Ian Robertson, an analyst at Seymour Pierce.Although relatively quiet of late on the issue, YouView has also expressed confidence in its scheduled launch date of “spring to summer” this year. It declined to be more precise.“We are engaged in final user testing with YouView already live in a small number of homes,” says Richard Halton, YouView chief executive. “We are pleased with progress and will be extending these trials to hundreds and then thousands of homes in the coming months.”Like Freeview, YouView will have no monthly subscription fee, requiring users to only have a box and broadband internet access.However, YouView is yet to confirm how much each boxes will cost, with industry observers putting the figure in the £200-£300 range – a pricetag that may deter potential buyers.“The bottom line is: when is the box going to be available to the public and at what price level?” says Mr Maude.After initially joining Virgin Media in criticising the project, BSkyB last year warmed to the idea of YouView, after it emerged that its target market was the 10.6m UK households with Freeview, rather than the more than 14m that take pay-TV services.YouView will be ultimately judged by the quality of its product and content. But while it remains in testing, it is far from changing the way people watch TV, forever or otherwise.

The benchmark US index recovered some of its losses in late trading to close down 0.4 per cent to 1,413.31.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.5 per cent to 13,199.55, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was off 0.2 per cent at 3,113.57.Technology stocks were among the day’s most talked about equities on Tuesday.Shares in Groupon fell to an all-time low as a report in the Wall Street Journal said the Securities and Exchange Commission was examining the company’s revision to its financial results. The daily deal company, which debuted its shares to the public at an initial offer price of $20 last November, revised lower its revenues and earnings figures for its fourth quarter late last week.The company’s shares finished down a further 1.7 per cent to $15.02 after losing nearly 17 per cent during Monday’s trading session. Groupon equity is now worth about 25 per cent less than at the time of its initial offer.Netflix, the home DVD and internet streaming company, dropped 0.9 per cent to $112.96 as analysts at Barclays reduced their rating of the company’s shares from “buy” to “hold” due to increased market competition.Anthony DiClemente, analyst at Barclays, said: “Recently new competitive threats have emerged in the subscription video on demand market, which we believe present a greater risk to Netflix’s future sub growth at a time when digital content costs are increasing dramatically.”Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, reached another record high as its shares broke the $630 mark for the first time. Shares in the popular technology product maker settled slightly to finish up 1.7 per cent to $629.32 as industry analysts continued to raise their price targets for the company.“The key drivers of our estimate changes are better than expected unit sales activity of the iPhone and iPad,” said Mark Moskowitz, analyst at JPMorgan, who raised his price target for the company’s shares from $625 to $715.Research In Motion, the BlackBerry maker, fell 9.5 per cent to $13.01 as a report said that investors were speculating that potential acquirers for the Canadian company were dropping away.The S&P 500 total return index, which includes price changes on the main market and reinvested dividends of its constituents, reached its highest recorded level. The total return index reached 2,449.08 on Monday.Urban Outfitters, the youth fashion retailer, gained 2.3 per cent to $30.22, placing it among the leading risers on the day as it reported first quarter “comparable retail segment net sales are low single-digit positive” in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The shares had tumbled 18 per cent after the sudden resignation of the company’s chief executive on January 11 but have recovered nearly 25 per cent since then. Analysts were cautious as they assessed the impact of discounting on the company’s sales and margins.“Although our checks suggest improvement to general inventory levels …we remain cautious as select markdown categories remain a key driver to modest improvements to traffic and conversion,” said Betty Chen, analyst at Wedbush.“There are still a number of issues to be resolved at [Urban Outfitters] as the company seeks to rein in markdown rates and adjust its mix at Anthropologie,” said Jeff Black, retail analyst at Citigroup, and raised his rating of the company’s shares from “sell” to “hold”. “Yet the 10-K filed yesterday after the close revealed that [its first quarter] rests on solid footing thus far.”Sirius XM, the satellite radio company, moved down 3.1 per cent to $2.33 after having risen 7 per cent in the past two trading sessions. One analyst speculated that the gains had been due to speculation that the company was a buyout target for Liberty Media, which already has a 40 per cent stake in Sirius. Shares in Liberty Media were down 1.1 per cent to $89.22.Thomas Eagan, analyst at Canaccord, doubted the likelihood of Liberty increasing its stake in Sirius. “Liberty Media can monetise its stake without increasing it,” he said, while maintaining his “buy” rating and price target of $101 for Liberty’s shares.Annie’s, the organic and natural food distributor, rose by nearly 12 per cent to $38.75 as the recently debuted company continued its impressive gains.The S&P 500 energy and materials indices were the day’s worst performing sectors, falling nearly 1 per cent each.Key commodity prices moved lower as only two of the 10 voting members of the FOMC were described as saying “it could become necessary” to engage in another round of quantitative easing down from a “few” in January, according to the minutes of their meeting in March.
718;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-25T18:45:54Z;Future of set-top boxes;Internet content poses biggest threat;"Behind the array of new technology and optimism on show at last week’s Internet Protocol TV world forum in London, an underlying air of apprehension was perceptible.The potential concern for the TV set-top box makers at the convention was all around them, albeit in a wireless form: the internet.As the variety of TV content available over the internet expands, the future market for makers of TV set-top boxes – such as Virgin Media’s TiVo and Sky’s Plus – has been called into question.Why would a consumer pay for a subscription to use a set-top box when “smart TVs” allow direct access to internet content, known as over the top (OTT), for free?The market is being squeezed as consumers shift to downloading TV programmes and videos over the internet from companies such as LoveFilm, Google and Netflix, whilst free content is available from services including the BBC’s iPlayer, Channel Four’s OnDemand and the ITV Player.Furthermore, BBC’s iPlayer on-demand TV service recently became available on all the UK’s major gaming platforms, including Microsoft’s Xbox360.The internet TV trend has been touted as a potential killer of set-top box makers, which include Yorkshire-based Pace, the world’s biggest maker of TV set-top boxes by shipments, and Aim-traded Amino Technologies.Such concerns took concrete form in January when IP Vision, maker of the Fetch box for viewing internet video on a TV, went into administration.Although much smaller than Pace, Cambridge-based Amino has the advantage of being backed by chip maker Intel, and the group used the IPTV forum for the UK launch of its latest box, the Freedom Live Media Gateway.“Set-top boxes are still the best way to improve functionality and ensure security,” says Donald McGarva, the new chief executive of Amino.“It’s still quite a youthful environment for these boxes and OTT – it’s not going to be a binary outcome where one wins and the other loses.”Such confidence is echoed by Mike Pulli, chief executive of Pace: “OTT is just another mechanism to deliver content. We see [internet TV] as a complementary service rather than a replacement service.”According to Andrew Darley, a technology analyst at Finncap: “The key to understanding TV consumption is to differentiate between TV as a service and a TV as a product.“As a product, you buy the TV of the moment; but for content you still choose the service provider – in the UK, public service (BBC) or a private service provider (Sky or Virgin).”The other challenge facing set-top box manufacturers is the use of “the cloud” – where content is accessed over the internet.“The OTT services might lack content but they have shown up pay-TV in terms of the user interface and experience,” says Giles Cottle, principal analyst at Informa.“Moving to the cloud can enable operators to compete more effectively in these areas.”With the forthcoming launch of the YouView box – the long awaited internet-television service that is in effect an upgraded Freeview box with on-demand and iPlayer-like services – competition for TV services is getting hotter.Consumers are demanding higher-quality content in various formats (TV, mobile, PC and tablet), and the latest set-top boxes such as those from Amino combine broadcast, on-demand and open internet services.“I don’t have a crystal ball, I don’t know what will happen in 20 years’ time,” says Amino’s Mr McGarva. “But set-top boxes have been predicted to die many times now. So far, they’re still going strong.”"
719;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;US stocks set for worst week of 2012;;Homebuilders slumped on signs of a weakening housing recovery and Apple shares were hit by a flash crash as US stocks were poised for their worst week of the year.KB Home, one of the largest homebuilders in the US, reported a slowdown in new home orders heading into the spring season, which raised concerns over the speed of the US housing market recovery.Shares in the company fell by as much as 15 per cent during Friday’s morning session before regaining some of its losses to finish down 8.5 per cent to $10.78.The reaction to KB Home’s announcement reverberated across the sector. PulteGroup, another homebuilder, dropped 2.6 per cent to $8.88 while rival Lennar fell 1 per cent to $25.86.The S&P 500 homebuilders index, which had risen 80 per cent since last October, has lost more than 3.5 per cent this week.Key housing data released throughout the week showed signs that, while the housing market was stabilising, the pace of recovery was slowing.“After the run-up we have had this year, you want to see the markets take a pause and consolidate,” said Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “They were not any new, fresh drivers to take us higher this week with the data being mixed.”“For the week overall, I’d probably give the US housing data a grade of B- or C+. There are some details to suggest we are bumping along the bottom rather than falling off the wagon. The story for the US is not great but it’s still improving and nothing this week changed our view.”Shares in Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, were halted after they plunged to $542 a share.A single mistaken trade on one of BATS’s exchanges was identified as the cause and corrected, according to a statement by BATS. Trading in Apple shares, which had retreated from highs earlier in the week, resumed soon after and fell 0.6 per cent to $596.05.But the troubles continued for BATS as the exchange was forced to withdraw its initial public offering on Friday, citing “technical issues” that caused its share price to plunge in the first moments of trading on its own exchange.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,397.11 on Friday, edging back towards the 1,400 mark after retreating from it earlier in the week.But the US benchmark has had its worst week since mid-December, falling 0.5 per cent and retreating from the post-financial crisis highs reached on Monday. However, the S&P 500 is still up 11 per cent on the year to date.Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company, reported that revenues rose 15 per cent like-for-like to $5.8bn, driven by strong demand in North America, but its shares fell 3.2 per cent to $107.42 in trading on Friday as analysts considered the pressure on the company’s forward profit margins and valuation.Camilo Lyon, analyst at Canaccord, said of his “hold” rating: “Taking it altogether …we believe the stock should trade down, especially considering the peak 21 times price to earnings multiple at which it currently trades.“Given the strength in North America futures, we would rather play the strength of the footwear cycle via the retailers, in particular buy-rated Foot Locker and Dick’s Sporting Goods.”Citi analysts removed Nike from their top-picks list but reiterated their buy rating on confidence that sales growth would be driven by momentum in North America and China.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.1 per cent to to 3,067.92. The technology-heavy index fared the best among the three major US indices, up 0.4 per cent for the week.Netflix, the home DVD delivery and internet movie streaming provider, was among the week’s top gainers. Shares in the company rose by more than 9 per cent on the week and were trading at $120.19.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.2 per cent over the five trading days at 13,080.73 as equities on the blue-chip index were rattled by weak manufacturing data out of Europe and China released on Thursday.Earthmoving equipment manufacturer Caterpillar rose 1.3 per cent to $107.83 on Friday but remained one of the weakest stocks among blue-chips for the week.Shares in the company, which have risen by 19 per cent in the year to date, fell by more than 5 per cent this week.Sears Holdings, parent company of the Sears and Kmart department store chains, fell by more than 12 per cent over the five days to make it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500.Last week, the company reported that it would shut down as many as 62 stores in the first half of the year to reduce its expenses but the move was little comfort to investors as the stock fell another 1.8 per cent to $72.36 on Friday.
720;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-23T17:10:46Z;Amazon’s cloud goes to Mars;;"Amazon’s cloud computing service is being used to operate Nasa robots on the surface of Mars, Netflix’s video streaming service and the Guardian’s dating website, as the retailer’s little-known IT business rapidly expands.The six-year old cloud business remains overshadowed by Amazon’s vast online store, but clients and analysts say the company’s various cloud-computing services are replacing a growing number of in-house IT functions and dominate the sector.“We continue to see equally rapid growth across all of our [cloud] services as we have in the past,” Adam Selipsky, vice-president of Amazon Web Services, told the Financial Times. The number of files in the Amazon cloud nearly tripled to 762bn last year.Its investment in cloud computing underscores how far Amazon has diversified beyond its origins selling books, but AWS says it has replicated the business model of Amazon’s retail store by selling services in high volumes at lower prices and lower profit margins than traditional technology groups.Amazon charges clients a pay-as-you-go fee for access to a flexible portion of cloud space where they can manage data and run their websites, making it easier to cope with demand spikes and reducing the need for in-house servers and technicians.Nasa uses the service to operate two “robot geologists” prowling opposite sides of the red planet as part of its Mars Rover Exploration mission.Netflix runs its entire video streaming operations from the Amazon cloud even as it competes against Amazon’s Instant Video service. Netflix said AWS does not have access to detailed information on how it operates and does not share information on cloud users with competing businesses at Amazon.The Seattle-based retailer does not disclose financial information on its cloud business. But David Smith, analyst at Gartner, estimates that it has annual revenues of about $1bn and is far larger than the equivalent business of rivals, led by Rackspace.This month Amazon cut its cloud prices for the 19th time, bringing the cost of running a small website on its services to $250 a year versus $876 in 2006.However, in a move that highlights the limitations of the public cloud for some, Zynga, the social gaming group, last year shifted the bulk of its operations from the Amazon cloud to its own private cloud, which it said was better tailored to its needs.The UK’s Guardian newspaper runs several services in the Amazon cloud, including its Soulmates dating website and its iPad app, but not its main online news pages.Describing AWS as “stable, scaleable, secure and cost-effective”, the Guardian said: “They are our back office for those services.”Airbnb, the private home rentals website, runs its entire service in the Amazon cloud and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb’s co-founder, praised its low prices and provision of useful new software tools.Last April AWS crashed in part of the US, knocking out scores of websites including Airbnb, which was down for a total of 30 minutes and had its search function disabled for three hours.Mr Blecharczyk said: “This happens to all companies, but I think if we’d [run Airbnb’s IT functions] alone, or done it with someone else, we would have had more downtime.”AWS’s Mr Selipsky said the company had taken several steps since then to ensure its systems were more robust and more reliable.Rackspace estimates that only 15 per cent of IT functions have been outsourced to cloud services. Mr Selipsky said: “By far our biggest competitor remains the disc drive and the server; people not understanding yet what the cloud can do for their business; people being in some cases fearful.”"
721;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-22T16:27:07Z;What the Board Needs to Know About IT Risks;;It’s probably happened to most boards: there’s a newsworthy IT failure at a competitor and someone on the board asks, “could that happen here?”In 2010, a cyber attack on NASDAQ’s Directors Desk service which was used by thousands of corporate directors brought IT risks literally into the boardroom. The National Security Agency investigated, and the full impact is still not publicly known. In fact it took five months to report it to the public – how many directors’ communications were compromised in the meantime, and to whom?In 2011, two more highly public incidents raised the profile of IT risks. The first in March 2011 was at RSA, the IT security company. in which hackers obtained information about RSA SecurID tokens which are used by RSA’s customers’ employees to log in to their computers. The full impact of this hack became apparent when Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, reported that a cyber attack on its information systems was linked to the RSA hack.The second was a hack of the Sony Playstation Network in which the attackers made off with customer information, including credit card data. In response, Sony shutdown the network for a month until it had put in place better security. The outage cost an estimated $10m a day.These three attacks underscore a key principle for boards: IT risks are business risks. Poorly managed, they can and will exceed corporate risk tolerances.Okay, if IT risks are business risks, then the board needs to be more engaged in IT risk oversight. In most companies, the person to answer the board’s questions about IT risks would be the chief information officer. So what’s the CIO’s name? If you’re stumped, it’s time to find out.The CIO should be speaking to the audit committee, typically quarterly, and to the full board at least annually on risk management initiatives. That way when an incident does occur, and it will, the CIO and the board already have a foundation for communicating about it.While it helps to have someone on the board who understands IT, for effective IT risk oversight, most corporate directors don’t need to know geek-speak. Rather the CIO should speak of IT risks in terms of their business impact. “My people are working overtime to patch security vulnerabilities” is not, at face value, a board-level issue. But the same problem phrased in a different way: “Our competitors are beating us to market because it takes too long to fix security in our new products” clearly is a board-level issue.IT risks are also regulatory risks. Within the last year, the US federal Trade Commission has mandated that both Google and Facebook have biennial privacy audits for the next 20 years. In March 2011, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the first fine under HIPAA, a $4.3m levy against a Maryland health care provider.In Europe, the European Commission is finalising a proposal that could impose huge fines of up to 5 per cent of global sales revenue on a company that mishandles supplier, customer, or employee data. Now it may be that such an egregiously punitive penalty is not likely to become law, but is it any comfort that regulators in Brussels see it as a reasonable proposal? With greater regulatory scrutiny, data breaches are no longer an embarrassment, they are potentially deadly to a company’s business strategy.Besides privacy and data protection, which tend to fall directly in the IT organisation’s purview, new business regulations also have a big impact on IT systems. Dodd-Frank, Solvency II, Basel III, and the UK Bribery Act all have big IT compliance implications – changes to how data is managed, systems configured, reporting, and policies. Regulatory change management is a consultants and lawyers bonanza! To deal with it, companies need a “weather bureau” that tracks regulatory developments. That may be a formal function in large, highly regulated multi-nationals, or an informal function within the legal or public affairs department in other companies.Keeping up with compliance is not the same as having good risk management practices though. Most regulations that have an IT impact are targeted at specific types of data or systems – for instance health records, credit card data, employee records, financial systems, or IT systems that operate critical infrastructure like the electrical grid. Audits to ensure compliance will be tightly focused on the information and IT system assets affected by specific regulations, and many IT vulnerabilities will be outside the scope of the audits.These audits also tend to be a snapshot of compliance at the time of the audit, and IT systems undergo frequent change. Effective IT risk management therefore requires a program of continuous monitoring, and corporate directors who are most directly involved in IT risk oversight should focus on the effectiveness of risk management program, not just audit results.IT risk exposure extends to business partners too. Your company has some level of exposure to the risks to which each of your partners are exposed. Now take partner risk exposure into the cloud, and suddenly it’s a lot harder to assess reliability, continuity and compliance than it is to evaluate those criteria with traditional IT services. Furthermore, as each of your business units engages cloud based services on its own, the number of cloud vendors multiplies rapidly. And each cloud vendor in turn has dependencies with other business partners.When a cloud service is disrupted, the disruption has ripple effects that propagate out to other companies that may even just be loosely, not even directly, dependent upon it. For instance, the Sony Playstation hack affected not just Sony, but also partners like Hulu and Netflix. To ensure that business dependencies are well understood and that the impact of vendor IT risks on overall enterprise risks are well understood, board-level risk oversight should extend to the vendor management program.Besides the cloud, social technologies are another source of IT risks – which, remember, are business risks. The growing use of social media and social collaboration make geographic and corporate boundaries amorphous, and increases the influence of nonfinancial stakeholders on corporate strategic goals and objectives. Consider the case of Petland. On July 28, 2009, a Petland employee at an Akron, Ohio store posted a photo on her Facebook pages showing grinning and holding two sopping wet dead rabbits. The photo went viral, PETA got involved and used social media in its call for action. To stem the crisis, only a week after the photo was posted on Facebook, Petland closed the store.A professional risk analyst would have calculated the loss of two rabbits as well within the corporate risk tolerance, but social media amplified those risks many times over. With wide adoption of social media, any enterprise risk can be a social risk if there are public expectations for how you will manage it. In this environment, it’s important to ensure that social risk assessments are incorporated into strategic planning and enterprise risk management, and that the company is proactively monitoring its reputation – and guess what, there are IT solutions to help with that.In fact, there are IT solutions to manage many business risks, and not just IT risks. A whole new category of software called GRC, for governance, risk and compliance, helps to automate risk management and compliance programs and enable continuous risk monitoring. It’s worth noting though that ten years after Sarbanes-Oxley, boards are getting weary of investing in solutions that may make auditors and regulators happier, but don’t seem to impact the bottom line. Therefore, it’s important for CIOs to identify to the board the business outcomes of GRC investments — for example, “reduce threats to reputation caused by loss of personal data” or “reduce chances of a restatement by automating controls in the close process.”Finally, boards should consider IT risk management as a value contributor, not just a cost of doing business. Risk value management is a term coined by Gartner to describe a discipline for treating key risk indicators as leading indicators of business performance. By linking key risk indicators to key performance indicators, businesses can use their risk monitoring to avoid disruptions to business objectives. And “Could that happen here?” becomes “How’s it help our business strategy?”

The benchmark US index lost further ground from its highest close since May 2008 achieved on Monday.Economists expressed concerns about the housing market recovery with the latest data showing existing home sales fell by 0.9 per cent to 4.59m, just below analysts’ expectations .“As with the report for new home sales earlier in the week, the report for existing home sales, which makes up 93.5 per cent of the overall market, held close to the strongest level since May 2010,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economist at Miller Tabak.“However, the level of activity fails to change our view that any recovery is shallow, rising from a low base with conventional monetary policy failing to overcome the significant restraints hampering the housing market.”But the news did not damp momentum on the S&P 500 homebuilders index, which climbed 0.8 per cent on the day and has gained 34 per cent in the year to date.PulteGroup, one of three homebuilders measured by the index, led its rivals and rose 2 per cent to $9.39.Watson Pharmaceuticals, the maker of generic and brand name drugs, was the leading gainer on the main market.A Reuters report said the company was in talks to buy Actavis Group, a Switzerland-based generic drugmaker, for up to €5.5bn. Shares in Watson gained 8.8 per cent to $63.69.Hartford Financial Services was one of the day’s best performing stocks before settling, as it updated first-quarter projected earnings above analysts’ expectations. Shares in the insurance company rose as much as 7.3 per cent, but finished up just 1.2 per cent to $22.02.The S&P 500 financial service index led all major sectors in the morning session before falling 0.4 per cent to be second worst on the day, ahead of the energy index, which was down 1 per cent.Bank of America was near the top of bank stocks and was flirting with the $10 threshold for much of Wednesday. Shares in the bank climbed 0.1 per cent to $9.82. Morgan Stanley was the worst of the major banks, down 1.7 per cent to $20.06.Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, was the biggest loser among the energy stocks and fell 5.8 per cent to $45.04 as it warned first-quarter profits would disappoint.The Nasdaq Composite Index was the only major index on the positive side, rising fractionally to 3,075.32.LinkedIn, the online professional networking site, was among the top gainers on the technology-heavy index.Shares in the company 6.5 per cent to $97.89 after receiving an upgrade from “hold” to “buy” by analysts at Goldman Sachs.“Our checks show increasing traction for LinkedIn’s hiring solutions and improving user engagement that, along with emerging products, suggest a steeper slope to the company’s long-term growth,” Goldman Sachs said in a note.“On a more macro level, we believe LinkedIn is one of the companies best positioned to benefit from growth in mobile usage, given its reliance on subscriptions over advertising.”Oracle, the software company, fell 2.3 per cent to $29.41 despite giving the tech sector a boost as it reported a “very solid” third-quarter in the three months to February 29.Analyst reactions to the company’s results were mixed, however.“The fact is that Oracle is not growing particularly rapidly and, despite an extended discussion to the contrary, the firm is facing a tougher group of competitors,” said Richard David, tech analyst at Canaccord. He reiterated his “hold” rating.Meanwhile, Citigroup analysts described the software company as “back on track” and maintained their “buy” rating on its shares.Micron Technologies, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 2 per cent to $8.74 as reports said the company had made a $1.5bn bid to acquire Elpida Memory, a Japanese chipmaker.Netflix, the online and home delivery video provider, rose 4.4 per cent to $120.10 as it revealed plans to stream a new original series on its site, beginning in 2013.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 13,124.62. Hewlett-Packard, the computer and printer maker, was the biggest loser on the blue-chip heavy index.Shares in the company, which said it would combine its PC and printer divisions, fell by 2.2 per cent to $23.46.Walt Disney, the entertainment group that said on Tuesday that it would suffer a $200m loss on its latest film John Carter, rose 0.1 per cent to $43.27.Analysts at Nomura added its shares to their conviction buy list, saying: “We believe the focus will now shift to Disney’s core assets, which we believe are poised for above-peer growth.”
723;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
724;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Apple TV’s sharper image;;The new iPad isn’t the only Apple product getting a high-definition makeover on Friday, with a new version of Apple TV also going on sale.The $99 box (#99 in the UK) has been upgraded from 720p to 1080p “Full HD”, making its movies and photos look better on a big-screen TV.I upgraded the software (go to Settings/General/Update Software) on my existing Apple TV last week in order to enjoy the new interface, which is compatible with both old and new versions of the box – this does not make the old box 1080p-capable though.Large icons for different “channels” of content now make them more visible and accessible, rather than being hidden in the old pull-down menu structure. Movie posters are larger and easier to navigate.Users can now sign up for other companies’ services offered, such as Netflix movie streaming, from within their Apple TV apps – before this had to be done in concert with a computer. In the US, movies can now be bought, not just rented, and stored in iCloud – there is still very little storage on the device and the only major internal change is the A4 processor being updated to a more powerful single-core A5.My case for buying a second Apple TV would be to move my existing one to a 32in 720p television in the bedroom and plug the new one instead into my 1080p large-screen living room TV.At the same $99 price, it still seems very good value and if you have an iPhone 4s, now capable of 1080p video, you can play your videos in Full HD on the bigger TV screen using the wireless AirPlay feature (AirPlay also works with the iPad and will come to Macs later this year with the Mountain Lion operating system update).Apple TV’s main rival is the Roku set-top box. For a similar size and the same price, its top model offers 1080p and, while it lacks AirPlay, has more than 400 channels of content, compared to fewer than a dozen third-party content partners on Apple’s device.Apple could compete more in this area and it has so far failed to open up Apple TV to apps from its App Store. But perhaps it has bigger plans in mind, with rumours persisting of a large-screen Apple “smart TV” appearing later this year.

The mining company estimates that the shortfall from the production halt would reduce sales by about 10 per cent of estimated first-quarter copper production.Joy Global, the mining equipment maker, fell 0.1 per cent to $78.57 after being downgraded from “buy” to “neutral” by UBS.MGM, the gaming and hospitality company, rose 4.2 per cent to $14.71 on news that it would repay a portion of the $965m owed to creditors.
726;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-14T20:56:29Z;US stocks steady after bank stress tests;;The leading US banks dominated market attention for a second straight day as investors digested the results of the Federal Reserve stress tests.Citigroup and MetLife – two of the four banks that failed the stress tests – were among the main losers on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs finished down 3.4 per cent to $35.21 after being thrust back into the spotlight as a derivatives trader resigned on Wednesday and published an opinion piece in The New York Times that criticised the bank’s culture as “toxic and destructive”.Overall, the financial sector index on the S&P 500 edged up fractionally after leading the benchmark US index to its best day since November 30.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, said: “Typically, after a big run like we had yesterday, it’s natural to see some profit-taking the next day.“You are starting to see investors discriminate between large banks and between regional banks,” she added.Large banks soared in late trading on Tuesday as JPMorgan announced that it would return $15bn to shareholders and increased its dividend after passing the Fed’s tests.JPMorgan, one of 15 institutions that met the Fed’s capital requirements, added 0.5 per cent to $43.58 and is up 7.5 per cent in the past two days of trading.Citigroup, the biggest of the four banks to fail the tests, dropped 3.4 per cent to $35.21 and has lost more than half of its gains from Tuesday’s surge.Vivek Juneja, analyst at JPMorgan, downgraded shares in Citigroup from “buy” to “hold” on news that the bank would be unable to return money to shareholders under the Fed’s restrictions for banks that fail the stress tests.“Increased capital return in 2012 has been one of the key tenets to our ‘buy’ rating on Citigroup …Valuation remains attractive but we see limited upside in the near term until Citigroup can begin to return capital,” he said.MetLife, another of the banks to fall foul of the Fed’s tests, was the leading loser on the financial sector index, down 5.83 per cent to $37.16.Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays, said: “This outcome [of the stress tests] was not expected, particularly after we met with MetLife last week and is challenging for the company.”SunTrust, which also failed the tests, climbed 4.6 per cent to $23.61. The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15. The world’s third-largest payment networks company said it would boost dividends by 11 per cent to 20 cents and buy back up to $5bn of shares.The Walt Disney Company was leading the fallers, down 1.2 per cent to $43.48. Earthmover Caterpillar dropped 0.9 per cent to $112.27.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was down 1.4 per cent to 5,180.39 as gas prices hit a record for 2012.

David Evanston, analyst at Canaccord, raised the 12-month price target for Apple to $710.“Since we attended the iPad launch last week, our checks have indicated record pre-orders with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching 2-3 weeks …Apple remains a top pick,” he said.Netflix, the streaming and home DVD delivery provider, fell 2.3 per cent to $103.90. Its shares were hit by news that Walmart would let customers buy online access to movies they have already purchased.
727;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-14T20:18:09Z;Pay-TV probe to include Netflix;;UK regulators examining British Sky Broadcasting’s position in the pay-TV movies market have expanded the scope of their investigation to include online providers such as Netflix and Lovefilm.The Competition Commission said in provisional findings last August that BSkyB’s “control” over film rights was “restricting competition between pay-TV providers, leading to higher prices and reduced choice for subscribers”. At that time, its definition of the market included rivals such as BT and Virgin Media but not online video services.In December, BSkyB hit out at the methodology behind the ruling and its remedies as “manifestly flawed” for failing to take into account potential competition from Lovefilm, owned by Amazon.com, and Netflix, which launched in the UK in January.Documents published by the Competition Commission on Wednesday stated that “a number of potentially relevant market developments”, including the arrival of Netflix and BSkyB’s plans to launch its own online service, made it necessary to extend its investigation.The Commission indicated that it would publish its report by July 2012, later than it had intended and almost two years since its original referral. The development means the regulator could change its initial conclusions that BSkyB had an “adverse effect on competition”, or its remedies.Both Lovefilm and Netflix have made inroads into Sky Movies’ ownership of first-run film rights from all six major studios, with these “over the top” services carving out exclusive deals with Sony, Warner and Lionsgate. Analysts were divided on how the investigation’s expansion would impact BSkyB.“The new working paper gives a strong impression that the CC is intending to row back from its provisional view,” said Enders Analysis in a note to clients. “The CC voices the possibility that its early conclusion that Sky’s dominance in movies was anticompetitive will be reversed, or that it will recommend relatively minor restrictions on Sky’s behaviour.”But Claudio Aspesi of Bernstein Research said that the expansion would make it harder for BSkyB to appeal any ruling on the basis of an “incorrect definition of the market”.“A lot depends on how the Competition Commission looks at the actual content and contracts that the [over the top] services have,” he said. “As a consumer wanting to see a movie which was released theatrically a year ago, you still have to wait a long time on an OTT service in the current set-up. I think that what this [extension] may very well do is emphasise a couple of things that may not be so positive for Sky.”BSkyB, Netflix and Lovefilm declined to comment.Shares in BSkyB closed 6p lower at 695½p.
728;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-13T20:44:25Z;Intel and TV: internet turn-off;It costs money to make a TV show. Using the internet to deliver it doesn’t change that;There may be places where the internet fairy waves her wand and makes life better, for free. But she won’t be sprinkling her glittering dust on the TV business. A “virtual” TV network – one that delivers channels over the internet – will leave the industry’s economics unchanged. One can only hope that Intel, which is reportedly in talks aimed at developing such a network, understands this.The reasoning is simple: it costs money to make a TV show and to deliver it. Neither of those costs is reduced by replacing the traditional cable, satellite, or telco delivery with the internet. Bernstein Research points out that 95 per cent of US TV viewing hours are devoted to programming from seven big companies (Disney, Time Warner, News Corp, NBCUniversal, Viacom, CBS and Discovery). They have no reason to give their content to an internet TV network for less than they charge incumbent distributors such as Comcast, DirectTV, and Verizon.Any internet infrastructure that would deliver the new service is owned by those same distributors, which would lose revenue if customers drop their old-fashioned TV subscriptions. The distributors are, thus, unlikely to be enthusiastic about the idea. Faced with the reality, they will increase broadband prices to protect their massive infrastructure investments. The argument (offered by Netflix, among others) that broadband prices should reflect incremental rather than total costs is naive. Return on assets at these infrastructure businesses is already in the low to mid-single digits.So Intel, Google, Apple or anyone else will struggle to deliver TV at a cost lower than the current options. Of course, internet TV may include so many added bells and whistles that millions of set-top boxes loaded with Intel chips, or Apple TV’s, or some still-to-be imagined gizmo, will be sold. Now that would be magical.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
729;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-09T20:52:27Z;Limbaugh carries on with limited advertising;;Advertisers abandoned Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio show en masse this week, reacting to the conservative radio host’s attacks on Sandra Fluke, a law student who argued that health insurance should cover birth control.Mr Limbaugh’s remarks about Ms Fluke sparked outrage and led to a social media campaign calling on advertisers to stop supporting the show, an effort that quickly went viral, shining a harsh spotlight on those companies still airing ads.A week on, at least 50 companies have stopped airing ads during the show, including big brands such as Home Depot, Netflix, JC Penney and AOL. At least two radio stations, in Massachusetts and Hawaii, have also stopped airing Mr Limbaugh’s talk show.Mr Limbaugh initially dismissed the impact of the advertiser defections. On Monday’s show, he said: “So be it.”But by Thursday, the online broadcast of Mr Limbaugh’s show carried just nine advertisements over three hours. In place of the ads were public service announcements from groups such as the United Negro College Fund and the New York Office of Emergency Management.Mr Limbaugh’s show is distributed by Premiere Networks, a division of Clear Channel. Clear Channel is owned by Thomas H Lee Partners and Bain Capital, the private equity firm where Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney made his fortune. Clear Channel was acquired by Bain after Mr Romney stepped down from the private equity firm, but Mr Romney still profits from the firm’s activities.Clear Channel signed a $400m contract with Mr Limbaugh in 2008 that will keep him on air through 2016.Mr Limbaugh suggested that those companies that stopped advertising with him were suffering from their abandonment of his show. “You can look at the stock price of some of these companies,” he said. “I’m not going to say any more.” Home Depot and AOL were slightly up this week, but Netflix and JC Penney were down in a flat market.And while it may not be related to their pulling ads from the show, some research suggests that there may indeed be a correlation between companies targeted by boycotts and share prices.“The evidence is that boycotts that generate a lot of media attention and are targeted against a specific company tend to hurt the market value of the company,” said Brayden King, professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “There is a negative affect on their image and reputation.”Late in the week, Mr Limbaugh remained defiant, denying reports that he would suspend his show. “They thought I would be off the air by now,” he said of his critics. “They can’t understand why I still am on the air.”
730;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-08T19:23:15Z;Film don set to break windows at the studios;;"The meeting rooms in Netflix’s Los Angeles office are named after famous movies, and on the day Ted Sarandos meets the Financial Times, the location is The Godfather room.Mr Sarandos is not nearly as intimidating as Marlon Brando’s mafia don. But in a town filled with film studios and producers that have been recipients of Netflix’s largesse, he is certainly respected.With a DVD-by-mail and an online streaming service that has close to 25m subscribers, Netflix has upended the way Americans watch and consume film and television programming in their homes. As the company’s chief content officer, Mr Sarandos is responsible for striking the deals that make that content available.Yet he has found himself curtailed by Hollywood “release windows” – the restrictive periods enforced by the studios to ensure movies generate the most revenue possible on the release in cinemas, on DVD and on television.“The windows system in movies is pretty archaic in the internet age,” he says. “When we entered the market in 1999 every studio had a pay-TV deal and you could only get access to movies 10 years after their theatrical release.”Yet with online streaming soaring in popularity and consumers now expecting to watch films when and however they want, those release windows are under pressure, he says.In the last few years Netflix has struck deals with a range of producers and independent studios while its deal with the Epix pay TV channel gives it access to new films from Paramount, Lions Gate Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Mr Sarandos points out that Netflix will be the first outlet to screen the films that won this year’s Oscars for best feature, documentary and animated feature. “Five years ago it was zero.”He has a warning for those keen to protect Hollywood’s status quo. “The longer the studios hold on to windows, the more at risk they are of consumers developing new habits.” Not delaying the release of a film after its theatrical release “makes complete sense, given the efficiency of the marketing spend”, he adds.This means taking advantage of the advertising blitz that surrounds the release of a high-profile movie, when studios spend tends of millions of dollars to ensure a film scores a big opening weekend at the box-office. “People would have better recall when it is released on DVD if they didn’t have to wait so long.”Netflix has bumped heads along the way to its 25m subscribers, notably with Time Warner, which owns the HBO channel and the Warner Brothers film studio. Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, has compared Netflix to the Albanian army. In December he told the FT, Netflix could “do certain things and not other things. It can fly, it’s not a submarine”.Mr Sarandos says HBO and Netflix have different attractions. “I think we appeal to a larger group of people, whereas HBO programs for the coasts, for New York and Los Angeles … we’re much broader.”He is enthusiastic about the UK, where Netflix users can share details of their viewing habits with friends on Facebook: such automated sharing is illegal in the US, a hangover from 1980s privacy legislation, although the company is supporting efforts to change the law.The group recently moved into original programming, airing Lilyhammer, a gangster series set in Norway and starring The Sopranos’ Steven Van Zandt; by 2013 it hopes to have five original series on its service. Television is generating more views on Netflix – about 60 per cent of all views are for TV shows, rather than movies, says Mr Sarandos.The company also has a small army of new competitors to contend with; in the last two years rival services from Amazon – which owns Lovefilm in the UK – and Hulu have begun vying with Netflix for content.“We knew people would come after us,” he says. “But we’re spending billions of dollars on the content. If they want to compete against us, they will have to write cheques.”"
731;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-08T18:48:19Z;Netflix aims to secure TV movie rights;;Netflix is negotiating with several Hollywood studios to carve out films from long-term contracts they have with pay-TV operators such as Time Warner’s HBO, as competition heats between established channels and new “over-the-top” content providers.The negotiations by Netflix over the rights to movies, which it would have once had to wait 10 years to screen, is shaking up long-term relationships that have underpinned the financial performance of Hollywood studios for close to two decades.The video streaming and DVD delivery service, which recently launched its service in the UK, has already licensed some titles, including the 2011 Oscar contender The Kids Are Alright and The American from Universal Studios, which is locked into a long-term deal with HBO.Netflix is keen to add more, said Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, in a Financial Times interview. The company recently licensed films from DreamWorks Animation, which has a long-term deal with HBO, and documentaries and foreign films including The Artist from The Weinstein Company, which has a long term deal with Showtime, part of CBS.The agreements studios have with pay-TV channels are typically worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year to each studio. The channels get the films exclusively for the first two to three years: after that the studios are free to license the titles to free TV channels, before the films revert back to the pay-TV operators.But with free TV channels buying fewer movies and pay-TV operators increasingly concentrating on producing their own original programming, an opportunity has arisen for Netflix.The company is slowly recovering from a troubled 2011, when its shares fell by 70 per cent following an unpopular price hike and a botched separation of its DVD and streaming business.Netflix is also targeting British Sky Broadcasting’s Sky Movies channel in the UK, with the aim of outbidding it for the right to screen movies in the so-called “pay-TV window”.“Sky has the six major Hollywood studios locked up,” said Mr Sarandos. “It’s a market we’re moving into and we hope to be able to outbid them for those output deals, over time.”Netflix will be one of Apple’s partners in its upgraded TV device: users of the company’s iTunes store will be able to buy Netflix subscriptions and stream films and TV shows to their TV sets using the device.
732;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-07T22:19:58Z;US stocks recover on jobs news;;US stocks rose on Wednesday as signs of a labour market recovery helped shake off jitters that had sent shares to their worst performance in almost three months.The S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 1,352.64 after ADP, the payroll processor, reported the private sector added 216,000 jobs in February, slightly ahead of expectations. That comes ahead of the official monthly non-farm payroll report on Friday, which will be closely watched by markets.“The fundamentals in the market continue to surprise on the upside and beat expectations. Today’s ADP numbers add to that. There are two drivers in the market, primary are the fundamentals and global risk is a secondary consideration in our forecasts. Clearly, the attention is getting back on the fundamentals where it should be,” said Doug Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management.He added: “We think this market continues to run. Friday’s non-farm payrolls are forecast at 210,000 but are we projecting 280,000.”The S&P 500 index had dropped 1.9 per cent on Monday and Tuesday as global economic growth concerns and Greek debt worries crept back into the markets, taking away investors’ appetite for risk.The US Treasury department late on Wednesday said it would sell $6bn in shares of AIG. Shares of the insurer that was rescued during the financial crisis in 2008 were down 1.2 per cent to $29.45 in after-hours trading.The financial sector led the S&P 500 during the day, closing up 1.3 per cent as Greece inched nearer to a successful debt restructuring agreement with private sector bondholders as a deadline approached. Morgan Stanley, the worst hit among the major banks earlier this week, rose 3.2 per cent to $17.88. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $33.24, Bank of America went up 4 per cent to $8.02 and Goldman Sachs rose 2.4 per cent to $116.40.After having spiked on Tuesday, investor expectations of volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, which is also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, dropped back below 20. The Vix was down 7.8 per cent to 19.25 points, but still has risen 13 per cent for the week.The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.9 per cent at 2,935.69. Apple – now the most owned stock by US mutual funds according to Citigroup – see-sawed throughout the day as Tim Cook, chief executive, unveiled the latest iterations of its popular products, including the iPad. Apple closed up 0.1 per cent at $530.69.Netflix, the video streaming and DVD delivery service, rose by up to 4 per cent after announcing it would enter into partnerships to stream content for cable companies. But the volatile shares in the company were sent down by as much as 4.3 per cent after Apple debuted the latest version of Apple TV in the afternoon. Netflix shares recovered a bit to close down 1.8 per cent at $105.19, as it assured customers that it services would be available on Apple TV.Pandora, the internet radio company, slumped 23.9 per cent to $10.86, erasing nearly all of its gains for the year. The company reported widening fourth-quarter losses compared to the same period a year ago and lowered future earnings guidance to below analyst consensus. Mark Mahaney, an internet analyst at Citi, downgraded the shares to “neutral”.“We initiated [Pandora] with a ‘buy’ last July with the stock at $18. That call clearly hasn’t worked. As a speculative ‘buy’ – with no profitability track record and no near-term profitable outlook – [Pandora] always carried very little margin for error. And now there’s error,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 12,837.78. The earthmover Caterpillar gained 2.2 per cent to $108.28, the third highest riser on the blue-chip index.The consumer goods maker Kraft was the biggest loser on the Dow, falling 1.2 per cent to $37.83 as the company was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by Scott Mushkin, analyst at Jefferies.“2012, however, appears to be a year of investment and we expect limited upside for the next two to three quarters until the focus shifts to the post-separation outlook,” he said, adding that he still believed in the company’s longer-term prospects.Cyclical materials stocks recovered slightly, up 0.4 per cent, but have been the hardest hit sector on the S&P 500 this week, having dropped 3.4 per cent. The fertiliser maker CF Industries was up 4.1 per cent at $175.84. Eastman Chemical and Dow Chemical were up 2.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent to $51.17 and $33.12, respectively.Energy stocks were up 0.6 per cent led by a 7.3 per cent jump in shares of Valero Energy at $27. First Solar continued its losses, falling another 6.6 per cent to $25.80 as a report said the renewable energy company was cutting production at its operations in Germany and Malaysia.The Philadelphia Gold and Silver index was down 0.1 per cent, having fallen 8.3 per cent since Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, last week disappointed markets with a downbeat statement on the likelihood of a third round of quantitative easing.
733;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-07T21:02:50Z;Media delivery: stream becomes torrent;The leviathans in streaming media face a challenge from a shoal of minnows;Three’s a crowd. And there are lots more than three. Apple was first to the idea that delivering media over the internet might be good way to sell something else – in its case, gadgets. Years after the iTunes store made the iPod indispensable, other companies are still intent on turning a similar trick. Google thinks buying or streaming media will sell ads. This week it rebranded the Android store, to be known as Google Play, with greater emphasis on music, movies and books. Meanwhile, Amazon thinks that doing this will help it dominate all internet retail.But these leviathans will not be able to split the business between them. In music, there is Pandora Media and Spotify to contend with, among others. Video is tougher still. Netflix has 24m US subscribers, Hulu is popular, and Walmart is taking a stab with Vudu. Nor are the pay TV players standing idly by: Comcast, Verizon and Dish are all offering new streaming services. Results from the publicly traded streaming companies do not make the business look terribly appealing in its own right. Netflix boosted its revenues by close to 50 per cent last quarter, but its content costs are growing faster still and its expansion plans are expected to produce a bottom line loss in 2012. Pandora announced on Tuesday that, surprisingly, it will also make no profits in the upcoming year, despite doubling listener hours in 2011, and the stock then lost nearly a quarter of its value.The big internet companies must, in this crowded field, use their media services to distinguish and support their core businesses. It will not be easy. Superior selection makes a difference, as do lower prices. But both of these can be matched by a competitor willing to spend money. And why should consumers commit to one provider? One can, with increasing ease, flick back and forth between Amazon, Apple and Google. And it will only get easier.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
734;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-06T17:19:49Z;Pace gains 11% on recovery hopes;;Mike Pulli, the new chief executive of Pace, insisted that the troubled set-top box maker was recovering from a tough 2011.The positive sentiment drove up shares in Pace by 11 per cent, as Mr Pulli shrugged off the threat from increased competition by the popularity of downloading television programmes and videos from online providers such as Google and Netflix.Over the past year Pace has weathered three profit warnings, an axing of its senior executive team and supply-chain problems.Trading on a lowly forward price/earnings ratio of six, the shares are not as cheap as they were before Tuesday’s revival, but could still see more upside should Mr Pulli’s sales-focused strategy take off.
735;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-03-04T20:52:37Z;Pace tries to shake off year of troubles;;When Pace, the television set-top box maker, appointed Allan Leighton as chairman last May, the veteran turnround specialist promised better communication with the City and a strategic review.Eight months later, that overhaul has claimed the heads of three of its senior management team, including Neil Gaydon as chief executive. Pace, however, has yet to prove to investors that it has turned a corner.On Tuesday, the Yorkshire-based group has the opportunity to provide evidence of improvement when it presents its results for the 12 months to December 31, a period that was arguably the most tumultuous in its 30-year history.“Communication with the City is something we have to redress,” Mr Leighton said in May. “I am trying to get the markets to understand UK technology stocks in a different way.”The group, which issued three profit warnings in 2011, is hoping to convince investors that its products, sold to global pay-TV operators and telecoms groups, have a future as internet-based entertainment expands.“We look forward to the results as an opportunity for management to provide evidence to us that they have steadied the ship and are pointing in the right direction,” said Ian Robertson at Seymour Pierce.Mr Leighton previously headed supermarket chain Asda and served as chairman of the Royal Mail and his appointment of Mike Pulli as Pace chief executive was one of the first acts stemming from his three-month strategic review.The company, which overtook Motorola and France’s Technicolor in 2010 to become the world’s biggest maker of television set-top boxes by shipments, is expanding the “smart-box” side of its business – the more complex, higher-margin products that combine broadband and broadcast content.Pace is also focusing on software and services, where margins can be up to five times those on basic boxes.But it has come under intense pricing pressure from rivals such as Samsung, especially in its core North American market. While some cost improvements may be achieved in 2012, it is expected that these will be concentrated in the second half.Concerns linger that Pace’s customers in the pay-TV market will be squeezed as consumers migrate to downloading TV programmes and videos over the internet from companies such as Google and Netflix.“Pace’s underlying earnings are volatile, in our view,” said Bob Liao at Canaccord Genuity.The group has faced problems in securing the supply of hard disc drives for its set-top boxes. The problem will knock $9.5m from full year operating profit.After experiencing supply-chain difficulties following last March’s tsunami in Japan, Pace in October blamed severe flooding in Thailand for a further cut in its full-year forecast. This has slipped back from $190m-$200m early in 2011 to $141m by the end of the year.“With a multitude of uncertainties – financial, competitive and strategic – facing the business both in the short and particularly long term, we believe a material re-rating is unlikely in the absence of a meaningful change in outlook,” said Jonathan Imlah at Collins Stewart.“That looks improbable any time soon.”
736;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-29T19:02:33Z;ITV warns of weak advertising outlook;;Income from in-house content such as the popular costume drama Downton Abbey helped to lift annual pre-tax profits at ITV by 14 per cent, even as the broadcaster warned of a slowdown in advertising.The UK’s largest free-to-air commercial broadcaster by turnover said it expected a 2 per cent fall in advertising revenues in the current quarter due to tighter marketing budgets, following a 1 per cent increase in advertising revenues in 2011.The success of Downton Abbey and recently signed content deals with the likes of Sky, Netflix and Lovefilm helped boost revenues from the studio and online businesses. Shares in ITV closed up by 5.45p, or nearly 7 per cent, at 85.95p.“The increase in non-advertising revenues of £93m (up 11 per cent year-on-year), driven by our studios and online businesses, is clear evidence of progress in rebalancing the company and our ability to grow new revenue streams,” said Adam Crozier, ITV chief executive.Mr Crozier, who joined ITV in 2010 after a long and chaotic search for a successor to Michael Grade, last year committed to invest £25m to develop ITV’s online content and digital channels. The move is part of the broadcaster’s effort to reduce its reliance on advertising in the face of competition from areas such as online news and internet-based television.He said advertising revenues towards the end of 2011 were hindered by a poor Champions League football draw for English clubs and the warmer winter weather.“We had a slightly disappointing last quarter – X-Factor was a bit down …Coronation Street was slightly down compared with the 50th anniversary last year, and there wasn’t enough snow,” he said, adding: “Not surprisingly in bad weather people watch a lot more television.”Overall, annual revenues rose by 4 per cent year-on-year to £2.1bn and pre-tax profits rose from £286m to £327m.“ITV’s full-year figures look good overall and the outlook is better than we feared, which should provide some fuel for the bulls,” said Steve Liechti at Investec. “However, all is not good news – new multi-platform initiatives sound late, and online growth is still relatively modest.”The results came as Mr Crozier unveiled Mr Selfridge, its next big drama project, which is billed as a tale of sex, class and retailing in Edwardian London and is based on the life of Harry Gordon Selfridge, and his endeavours to build the UK’s first department store, which still bears his name.ITV hopes that the 10-part series, which is due to be released next year, will repeat Downton Abbey’s global success and underpin the group’s strategy of boosting in-house programming power.Diluted earnings per share fell from 6.6p to 6.2p, and the broadcaster restored its final dividend for the first time since 2008, proposing to pay 1.2p and bringing the total for the year to 1.6p.
737;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-27T21:46:04Z;Wall St defies Europe as rally continues;Micron shares gain almost 8 per cent;Micron Technology surged 7.7 per cent to close at an eight-month high of $8.56 after a rival computer memory maker filed for bankruptcy.Elpida Memory of Japan will continue operations under court supervision but is set to lose some of its 14 per cent share in the global market for dynamic random access memory (D-Ram).That could pave the way for Micron to increase its 12 per cent market share.D-Ram makers have had prices fall in recent years as the shift from personal computers to tablets and smartphones has resulted in oversupply.Analysts said the possible closure of Elpida could trigger a price reversal.“[Computer makers] have benefited from the D-Ram industry selling below costs for several years, but they are going to have to allow smaller manufacturers like Micron to turn a profit or risk being totally dependent on Samsung for supply,” said Kevin Cassidy, a semiconductor analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.Meanwhile, during morning trading, the S&P 500 finally hit a post-financial crisis intraday high of 1,370.89, beating the level set in May last year.The benchmark US index closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,367.59, a fresh post-financial crisis closing high.US equities had opened sharply lower on global economic concerns but reversed course on positive domestic economic data as pending home sales figures came in better than expected.But despite the stellar start to 2012, which has seen the S&P 500 climb almost 9 per cent, many analysts remained cautious.“While our positioning was too conservative and did not capitalise sufficiently on [the] cyclical bounce over the past two months, our judgment is that cyclically exposed investors should [now] buy defensives,” Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s chief US equity strategist wrote in a note.The Dow Jones Industrial Average once again failed to close above 13,000 despite breaching the level intraday. The blue-chip heavy index fell a single point to 12,981.51.Shares in Walt Disney climbed 0.8 per cent to $41.64, as Goldman Sachs analysts made the diversified entertainment group a “conviction buy,” suggesting, “new distribution deals will sustain high affiliate fee growth and drive margins for years to come”.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.1 per cent to 2,966.16.Financials led the gainers in the S&P 500, with Bank of America up 2 per cent to $39.06. 0.5 per cent to $7.84. JPMorgan up 2 per cent to $39.06, ahead of a company presentation to analysts this week.Mike Mayo at Crédit Agricole Securities said JPMorgan shares were undervalued and that the bank could consider selling off parts of its asset management arm and redeploying the proceeds to share buy-backs.Citigroup climbed 1.8 per cent to $32.93 after Credit Suisse analysts strongly recommended the stock, citing materially reduced risk and a strengthened balance sheet.Moshe Orenbuch at Credit Suisse also said US financial institutions could double the proportion of earnings returned to shareholders through dividends and buy-backs this year to 47 per cent, compared with 23 per cent in 2011 because of stronger capital positions.Coal miners continued to sell off after Alpha Natural Resources unexpectedly posted a fourth-quarter loss last week because of downward pressure on prices amid weak demand for coal.Alpha shares fell 3.6 per cent to $19.73 as Citigroup analysts slashed their earnings per share forecast for 2012 to $0.37 from $1.00. Peabody Energy fell 2.2 per cent to $35.52.Shares in department store chain Sears Holdings rallied 0.7 per cent to $68.79. The stock had surged last week after Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and a big shareholder, announced a plan to boost cash by selling assets.Gary Balter at Credit Suisse said the company had almost no chance of returning to profitability, but said that investors who had shorted Sears shares might come unstuck if Mr Lampert could keep the company afloat long enough to achieve high prices for store locations.“It would be unfair to compare [Sears] to a house about to go into foreclosure being stripped of everything down to the copper wiring but that is what comes to mind,” Mr Balter said in a note.Netflix shares fell 2 per cent to $109.41 with its content streaming deal with subscription television channel Starz set to expire this week. That will mean that some movies are removed from the Netflix website.Medco shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $66.52 as investors piled into options positions with a Federal Trade Commission decision on the company’s proposed acquisition by Express Scripts expected soon. Express Scripts shares were up 1.2 per cent to $53.05, apparently also on hopes the deal might be given the go-ahead.Shares in Baker Hughes, the oilfield services company, fell 2.7 per cent to $50.57 after analysts at several investment banks downgraded the shares.
738;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-26T06:17:32Z;Governance lessons lost on Facebook;Facebook’s two-tier share structure is just of one of many governance worries;Not so long ago, a debate raged about whether there was any real evidence that good governance contributed to strong corporate performance. It seemed to me pretty academic, given the palpable damage bad governance had inflicted on shareholders at such disaster zones as Enron and the Robert Maxwell empire.But no matter, for investors do now appear to be hearing the message. Witness the governance discount in the share price of Bumi, the mining company, where the inept recent efforts of financier Nat Rothschild to improve governance appear to have failed. Then there is the example of ENRC, the Kazakhstan mining company, whose controlling shareholders forced two independent directors to resign last year.These two cases demonstrated that share prices now signal a clear and immediate response to perceptions of increased governance risk. Note, too, that a governance taint can linger, as the share rating of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp amply shows.Yet mainstream institutional investors still show governance blind spots, nowhere more so than in relation to the initial public offerings of search engines and social networks. Back in 2004, Google set a poor precedent with a two-tier voting structure that was emulated in the LinkedIn IPO last year. And now the forthcoming flotation of Facebook puts a whole new complexion on the social networks’ challenge to governance best practice.Like Google, Facebook has a two-tier voting structure that will make it invulnerable to hostile takeover. Under this arrangement, Facebook’s founder, chairman and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, controls 57 per cent of the votes through direct ownership and voting power over other shareholders’ stock by way of an irrevocable proxy.At least Google offered some protection against excessive executive power by having a gaggle of outside directors who outnumbered insiders on the board.Not so at Facebook, where the board is a very different kettle of fish. The company has been attacked by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (Calstrs), America’s second-largest pension fund, for having a board devoid of women members.A more fundamental criticism is that there are no independent directors worthy of the name. All the outside directors of Facebook have either been nominated by Mr Zuckerberg or are investor directors, representatives of venture capitalist backers who have entered into irrevocable proxy agreements with the founder. If any of them ever concludes the CEO is going off the rails, there is nothing they can do.Worse, formal documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show two of the outside directors are also involved in related party transactions. Reed Hastings is CEO of Netflix, which paid Facebook $7.3m for advertisements on Facebook’s website over the past three financial years. Then there is Donald Graham, CEO of the Washington Post. Not only did the media group pay $9.6m for advertisements over the same period, Mr Graham’s daughter Molly is employed by Facebook at a salary of $189,168 last year. Small potatoes, maybe, but it still looks like third world governance.This is all, believe it or not, compliant with listing authority and SEC rules. The formal documents state the problem bluntly enough, declaring that Mr Zuckerberg will be able to control all matters submitted to stockholders for a vote, as well as the overall management and direction of the company, for the foreseeable future.The protection for investors against that age-old governance problem, the over-dominant CEO, is non-existent. If there is a novelty here, it is that the potentially over-dominant executive is just 27 years old and has created a company that will be valued in tens of billions on flotation. And, indeed, none of this is to denigrate the achievement of Mr Zuckerberg. It would, after all, be unusual for someone of his age to have grasped the advantages for himself, as well as for shareholders, of a strong governance framework. And in today’s heady market the IPO will, I suspect, be a big success.Bullish investors could reasonably argue that when conditions are propitious and young entrepreneurial companies are in a strong growth phase, rapid growth will more than compensate for shortcomings in corporate governance.With an extraordinarily fast-growing social network like Facebook, this strikes me as a rational calculation. But it is important to recall that when the going gets tough, as it always does in the end, poorly structured boards are invariably exposed. News Corp provides a case in point.There is a long-standing tendency for investors to forget about governance when share prices are rising. They then live to regret it when the bad times return. It may take time, but Facebook will probably teach us that lesson again.john.plender@ft.com
739;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-24T22:07:46Z;S&P 500 climbs to post-crisis peak;;The S&P 500 closed at a post-financial crisis high, as the 2012 rally in US equities moved up another leg.The benchmark US index gained 0.3 per cent over the week to close at 1,365.74, two points higher than its previous post-crisis peak last April. That was the best close for the index since June 2008.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly topped 13,000 for the first time since 2008, but ended the week at 12,982.95, for a weekly gain of 0.3 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,963.75, as Apple, which accounts for more than a tenth of the index, climbed 4 per cent to $522.41, just five dollars short of an all-time high. The world’s largest public company bowed to pressure from investors to give shareholders greater influence over the election of directors.Although all three major US indices are now at multi-year highs, investors were far from exuberant.Fund flow data continued to trend negative. Domestic equity funds suffered a second successive week of outflows, according to data from Lipper. Equity funds have seen net redemptions year to date, despite a rally that has now seen the S&P 500 climb 8.6 per cent.Investors of a statistical bent are focused on the transport sector of the Dow Jones, which has fallen 3.8 per cent in February, even as the broad index has climbed 2.2 per cent. Higher oil prices are weighing on the sector, but “Dow theory” suggests transport stocks are a leading indicator for the rest of the index, because they are the first to feel the effects of economic slowdown.“Sentiment is becoming more worrisome,” noted Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, who has advised clients to take profit.Tech stocks have been the driving force behind the rally in the S&P 500, significantly outperforming the broad index since last April. That trend continued this week, despite a poor performance by computer-markers.Dell shares fell 4 per cent to $17.43 over the week, and its larger rival Hewlett-Packard tumbled 10 per cent to $26.64. Both companies saw earnings fall for the quarter ended January 31, while HP also saw a 7 per cent decline in revenue compared to the same period in 2010.“In general, the easy margin expansion related to PC supply chain re-engineering is behind the company, suggesting more volatility in operating margins and earnings going forward,” Richard Gardner at Citigroup said in a note.Shares in Salesforce.com surged on Friday after the company, which provides cloud-based software to businesses, reported a jump in revenue in the quarter ended January 31.Shares climbed 11.2 per cent over the week to a nine-month high of $143.64. Shares had sold off in the final quarter of 2011, after the company’s previous quarterly results showed revenue momentum slowing. But the stock has now rebounded 40 per cent this year.“These…results undeniably refute the concerns in Q3 that momentum in the business is slowing,” Walter Pritchard at Citigroup said in a note.Walmart fell 5.9 per cent to $58.79 as a second consecutive quarter of US sales growth was not enough to drive profit growth. Fourth-quarter earnings fell steeply, as the world’s largest retailer by revenue discounted heavily to attract customers.Margin compression resulting from promotions and raw material costs was a feature across the consumer staples sector.Shares in Safeway fell 8.8 per cent to $20.93 over the week as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins, although investors were braced for poor figures and shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $55.22.First Solar share slumped 16.5 per cent to $35.58, approaching their lowest price since the solar panel manufacturer’s 2006 debut, after the German government announced plans to cut solar energy subsidies by 30 per cent.Sears Holdings rallied 25.3 per cent to $68.31, even as the department store chain reported a fourth-quarter loss of more than $2bn. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and a significant shareholder, which is set to begin with the $270m sale of 11 stores in April.Netflix shares suffered their third consecutive weekly decline, having rallied almost 75 per cent in January. It fell 8.4 per cent over the week to $111.67, after Comcast announced plans for a rival video-streaming service. Netflix shares remain up 61 per cent for the year, however.MetroPCS climbed 16.2 per cent to $12.01 after reporting a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged larger rivals by offering customers attractive rates, but it also showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs.

After the market closed, HP announced its own results and shares fell almost $1 more in after-hours trading as revenue missed estimates.Hard disc-drive manufacturers, whose main customers are personal computer makers, also fell.Seagate Technology was off 1 per cent to $26.45, and Western Digital fell 1.7 per cent to $39.56.Elsewhere, US stocks lost ground, with the S&P 500 index closing down 0.3 per cent to 1,357.66, as investors continued to pick over the Greek bail-out package.However, the benchmark US index remains 6 points off its post-financial crisis closing high, despite a soft turn in global manufacturing data.“Just three months ago, had such reports of a patchy outlook for growth emerged, the euro and stocks globally would have taken a spanking,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.Banks bore the brunt of the selling, with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 1.3 per cent, significantly more than any other.Morgan Stanley was down 2.8 per cent to $18.73, and Citigroup fell 3 per cent to $32.36.Bank of America fell 2 per cent to $7.95, with shares set to lose ground again this week, having suffered their first weekly loss of 2012 last week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 12,914.83.The transportation sector of the Dow fell 0.7 per cent and is now down almost 4 per cent for the month.“Dow theory” suggests the transportation sector is a leading indicator for the rest of the index, as transport stocks tend to feel the effect of rising energy prices first. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.5 per cent to 2,933.17, as Apple, which accounts for more than a 10th of the tech-heavy index’s market capitalisation, slipped 0.4 per cent to $513.04.Newfield Exploration fell 12.7 per cent to $36.88 after the oil and gas explorer missed fourth-quarter earnings expectations, and wrote down reserves.Its rival, Chesapeake Energy, fell 2.4 per cent to $24.03 despite fourth-quarter earnings almost doubling from the same period in 2010. Analysts focused on revenue, which did not climb as much as expected.Exploration and production companies are grappling with decade-low prices for natural gas, and Michael Hall at RW Baird warned on Wednesday that prices could fall to as low as $2 per million British thermal units after the mild winter.But Range Resources climbed 2.9 per cent to $66.10 as the natural gas producer saw fourth-quarter production increase 16 per cent compared to the same period in 2010.Homebuilder stocks fell despite a Bureau of Labour Statistics report that showed an increase in employment in construction in December, compared to a year earlier. Investors appeared to focus instead on sales data of existing homes, which climbed less than expected in January.PulteGroup fell 3 per cent to $8.33, and DR Horton 0.1 per cent to $13.93.

Shares have tested, but not broken through their 100 day moving average, which would be a bearish indicator for chartist investors.Mosaic gained 3.3 per cent to $58.80 after the fertiliser producer settled a dispute with the Sierra Club, an environmental campaigning group, allowing Mosaic to resume production at a Florida phosphate mine.Shares in Intuit, which provides business accounting software to businesses, hit an all-time high of $62.33, before closing at $60.92, for a gain of 5.9 per cent, after strong second fiscal-quarter results.Shares in Vivus surged 90 per cent to as much as $20.12 in after-hours trading, after an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted overwhelmingly in favour of approving the company’s weight-loss pill Qnexa, which would be the first new obesity drug in 13 years. The FDA is not required to follow the panel’s recommendation.
741;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-21T20:55:23Z;Comcast adds Netflix-style streaming service;;"Comcast has launched a new product for its 22m US pay-television subscribers that will give them access to a similar library of shows and movies to that offered by services such as Netflix.The move is an attempt by Comcast to use its scale to thwart potentially disruptive digital video distributors including Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.Called Xfinity Streampix, it will make a vast library of shows and movies available through customers’ existing cable television interface, as well as computers, mobile devices and gaming consoles. The service will be free for some existing Comcast television subscribers and cost others $5 per month. Netflix’s streaming only service costs $8 per month.Netflix last year passed Comcast as the largest subscription video service in the world, with more than 23m customers. But Comcast has been slowing its pay-TV subscriber losses, and analysts now expect it to begin growing its video customer base later this year.Streampix will supplement Comcast’s existing on-demand offerings, which include 75,000 shows and movies. Content from Disney, Sony Pictures, Warner Bros and NBCUniversal will be available through the service. Comcast last year became the majority owner of NBCU in a bid to find synergies between content and distribution.The service is another move to advance TV Everywhere, the industry-wide initiative to make more television content available online. “Streampix is another step moving TV Everywhere forward by giving customers access to an even greater library of popular choices to watch,” said Marcien Jenckes, general manager of video services at Comcast.The news came as Comcast announced plans to distribute four new minority-owned cable channels, fulfilling a pledge made to regulators as it was seeking approval for its takeover of NBCUniversal in 2010.They include Aspire, a channel launched by basketball star Earvin “Magic” Johnson that promises “enlightening, entertaining and positive programming” for African-American family audiences; Revolt, a music-themed channel from Sean “Diddy” Combs, the hip hop entrepreneur; and BabyFirst Americas, aimed at Hispanic families’ young children, from Constantino “Said” Schwarz, a veteran of Spanish language television.“They want to get behind these growing audiences,” said John Fogelman of FactoryMade Ventures, which is working with Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez on a general entertainment network for second- and third-generation English-speaking Latino audiences called El Rey.He would not disclose the terms on which Comcast was offering distribution, but said: “They’ve made them so competitive that they’re setting us up [to succeed].”"
742;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-16T00:06:38Z;CBS eyes strong ad sales in 2012;;CBS has said it sees clear signs the US economy has been improving, citing strong sales of political, automotive and local advertising.Les Moonves, chief executive, said last minute advertising buys were up and that local advertising was strong even before accounting for an expected surge of political advertising. Speaking of a US election year in which $2bn is expected to be spent by candidates – of which CBS hopes to get 9-10 per cent – Mr Moonves said, “We’re looking forward to a lot of nastiness on both sides.”CBS, which operates the CBS broadcast network and the Showtime premium channel, said quarterly revenues were down because of tough annual comparisons, but earnings per share were up 24 per cent for the past three months. Quarterly revenues fell slightly from $3.9bn to $3.78bn in the quarter because results during the same period a year earlier benefited from syndication deals and political advertising.But he was bullish on results so far this year, driven by strong advertising on the group’s broadcast network, which remains number one in the ratings. “We are poised to break records in financial metrics across the board [in 2012],” Mr Moonves said.CBS, which will air the Super Bowl next year, said it expects the average 30-second ad to sell for $4m. Mr Moonves said that the new nine-year deal CBS struck with the National Football League will be profitable from day one and said that the past season’s NFL games drew the best ratings in decades.The fees CBS gets from selling its shows overseas broke $1bn last year and have room to grow. Mr Moonves also said CBS may develop a new original series for Netflix, the digital distributor that once appeared to be an arch rival.The Grammy Awards, which aired on the CBS broadcast network on Sunday, drew 40m viewers and benefited from strong ad rates. Mr Moonves called it “another tentpole event locked up on good terms for the next decade”.Social media mentions of the music awards show jumped from 1m last year to 13m this year, demonstrating the increase of so-called “second screen” viewing, when TV watchers simultaneously use mobile phones, tablets and computers.Revenues at the cable networks group, dominated by Showtime, were up 7 per cent in the quarter, driven by rate increases and subscriber growth as well as higher fees for licensing Showtime programming.
743;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-14T22:34:49Z;Masco losses pull US homebuilders lower;;hares in Masco Corp plunged 12.1 per cent to $11.63 after the home improvement retailer reported a larger fourth-quarter loss than expected.Masco shares have rallied strongly in recent months amid increasing optimism about the construction sector, which tends to drive traffic to Masco stores, and the stock remains up 10 per cent for the year.But analysts were concerned by weak plumbing sales and the sell-off spread to homebuilders, whose share prices have been tightly correlated with Masco in 2012.Lennar Corp fell 0.7 per cent to $23.80 and DR Horton was off 1.2 per cent to $14.56.“Certain … projections suggest that [Masco] is not expecting a material US demand recovery in 2012,” Peter Lisnic at RW Baird told clients.Elsewhere, stocks retreated in stages as the trading day was punctuated by soft January retail sales data and the postponement of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers.The S&P 500 fell more than 10 points, or almost 1 per cent, over the course of the day, but rebounded strongly in the final 30 minutes of trading to end off just 0.1 per cent at 1,350.5.“Any and all sell-offs continue to find aggressive buying late in the day, which is a positive sign for US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research. “US investors do not seem to be reacting as strongly to eurozone news as before.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite index both reversed losses fully, to end the day fractionally in positive territory at 12,878.28 and 2,931.93 respectively.Apple shares hit record highs after breaching $500 for the first time on Monday. Shares climbed 1.4 per cent to $509.46 yesterday as investors brushed off attempts by a Taiwanese company to prevent the export of iPads from China as a trademark tussle rumbled on.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was hit hard as investors absorbed banks’ submissions on the proposed Volcker rule on proprietary trading.Bank of America fell 3.3 per cent to $7.98 after Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that “earnings headwinds” would check a rally, which has seen BofA shares climb more than 40 per cent this year.Morgan Stanley fell 2.5 per cent to $19.05 and Citigroup was off 2.4 per cent to $32.08.However, not all analysts expect Volcker concerns to weigh on bank stocks.Insurer Fidelity National bucked the trend of falling financials, climbing 7 per cent to $31.04, for the best performance in the S&P 500.The company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings but also raised its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to $0.14 per share.First Solar fell 6 per cent to $39.21 on reports that solar panel installations in Germany, a big global market, will be far lower than previously expected in the first four months of the year.Goodyear Tire fell 5.2 per cent to $13.25 after fourth-quarter revenues missed analyst expectations.Shares in Hospira climbed 6.1 per cent to $36.30 with investors apparently relieved that fourth-quarter profit only fell 15 per cent year-on-year.Shares in Gap rose 2.9 per cent to $22.34 as Citigroup analysts recommended clients buy the stock, pointing out the company had substantial cash on hand for stock buy-backs if it wanted to support its share price.Netflix shares climbed 4 per cent to $123.07 as filings showed that Jana Partners, a hedge fund, took a $45m stake in the video streaming and DVD delivery company in the final quarter of 2011.Shares in Zynga, the developer of online games such as FarmVille, climbed 7 per cent to $14.35, a new high, ahead of its first quarterly earnings report, which came after the close of trading.The company reported more than $300m in fourth-quarter revenue, a jump of almost 60 per cent from the previous year, although stock distributions to employee meant the company was lossmaking.Shares retreated by a few cents after hours, but are still up around 50 per cent so far this year.Shares in Michael Kors jumped 27.5 per cent to $42.85 after the luxury-goods maker reported same store sales in North American and European stores climbed by more than a third in its fiscal third quarter. Shares have now more than doubled in price since an initial public offering just two months ago.
744;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Groupon debuts results with surprise loss;;"Groupon‘s first financial results since it became a public company disappointed investors as the deals group confounded analyst expectations of a profit with a loss that sent its share price down about 15 per cent.Andrew Mason, who built a reputation as Groupon’s chief executive of being outspoken before its IPO, stumbled on his first call with the Wall Street investor community, but insisted his company retained its promise.“We continue to become more operationally excellent,” he said. “We’re very excited about what we’re building.”The company reported quarterly revenues of $506.5m, above the $475m analysts were expecting, but reported a net loss of $42.7m. That translated to a pro forma loss of 2 cents per share, rather than the 3 cents per share profit Wall Street had forecast.The loss was attributed to investments associated with Groupon’s new international operations, specifically taxes associated with the establishment of a base in Switzerland, said Jason Child, chief financial officer.The company emphasised improvements in marketing efficiency, an area in which analysts had been critical in the lead-up to the IPO. Marketing spend went from 100 per cent of revenues in the last quarter of 2010 to 31 per cent of revenues in the last quarter of 2011.Mr Child said the reduction was due to marketing encouraging existing customers to make more purchases rather than spending on acquiring new customers. He said Groupon would not move to the 5-10 per cent marketing costs of ecommerce companies such as Amazon and Netflix any time soon, but vowed that the percentage would not increase.Mr Mason indicated that growth would come from the company’s more recent products, including Groupon Now, its instant mobile deal feature; Groupon Goods, for deals with national retailers; and Groupon Getaways’ high-end travel deals. It is also working on a rewards programme that encourages customers to revisit Groupon deal sites, a response to claims the company’s discount model sends only deal seekers to merchants rather than generating repeat customers.“It’s pretty remarkable, magical stuff that we think is going to create a more comprehensive marketing sweep for our merchant partners and more value for our consumers,” Mr Mason said. “But it obviously takes a deeper investment.”The company said it increased its technology staff by four times last year, a difficult and costly move in the highly competitive engineering talent market, and plans to hire more employees in its tech headquarters in Silicon Valley to work on new products, a move that could add to last year’s hiring costs because of the region’s highly competitive engineering talent marketThe company is refining its personalisation features, so people will receive deal offerings more closely tailored to their interests.“We’re rolling out … a thumbs up, thumbs down mechanism,” Mr Mason said, “So people can say, ‘Stop sending me pole dancing deals’.”"
745;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-08T23:31:19Z;Mothercare names Lovefilm boss as chief;;Mothercare has made the surprise appointment of Simon Calver, chief executive of Lovefilm, to turn round the babycare retailer.Mr Calver, whose seven-year stint at Lovefilm has included the £200m sale of the subscription movie service to Amazon last January, will join Mothercare as chief executive at the end of April.Alan Parker, who will resume his position as non-executive chairman at that time, began a strategic review in November after Mothercare reported pre-tax losses of £81.4m at its interim results.A strong performance in Mothercare’s international business has been offset by its weak UK arm, which has struggled against online competitors. Mothercare’s former chief executive, Ben Gordon, quit last autumn after a profit warning wiped 40 per cent from the retailer’s share price in a single day. The rout sparked bidding interest from private equity house Cinven, which has since waned.Describing the appointment as a “radical, decisive and extremely positive choice,” Mr Parker said that Mr Calver’s main task would be to expand Mothercare’s highly profitable international business in China and India, giving the retailer exposure to the baby boom in emerging markets.Mr Calver said he was “delighted” to be joining what he described as an “iconic company”. “While there are near-term challenges ahead, I am committed to the recovery of the UK business and the accelerated growth of these aspirational brands around the world,” he said.Simon Calver learnt how to make a brand sparkle as a graduate trainee at Lever Brothers, where he was responsible for product innovation in liquid detergents and dishwashing, writes Tim Bradshaw.Ten years later, after a stint as a Deloitte consultant, he found himself running PepsiCo UK, before going on to take charge of its international sales. But just as the first dotcom bubble burst in August 2000, the Hull computational science graduate took a job at Dell, where he managed 1,500 people in a business that generated $1.3bn in annual revenues.After nearly two years as operations chief at Riverdeep, an interactive learning company, in 2005 he took the chief executive post at Lovefilm, the DVDs-by-post business that was conceived by venture capitalists as a British version of Netflix.Lovefilm was eventually sold to Amazon for a reported £200m, an exit smaller than some investors might have hoped for due to the ecommerce company’s large stake in the business preventing rival bids.Joining Mothercare in April, he leaves Lovefilm with 2m subscribers as the online video company fights off strong competitive challenges from BSkyB and Netflix itself, which launched in the UK last month.Mothercare’s shares rose 7.7 per cent on the news to close at 217p.“Simon is a really good leader and he is great at building teams,” said Dharmash Mistry, partner at Balderton Capital and a longtime Lovefilm board member. “He has fantastic e-commerce experience. The future of these models is going to be blended physical and digital.”Mr Mistry also highlighted Mr Calver’s strong experience in brand-building while at Unilever and PepsiCo, as well as Lovefilm.Another former Lovefilm investor said that Mr Calver might have been drawn to Mothercare by the opportunity to run a large public company, which he was denied when Lovefilm sold itself to Amazon instead of floating, adding that Mr Calver’s strong communications skills would play well with institutional investors.Certain financial incentives to stay at the large online retailer probably expired on the year’s anniversary of the deal last month, this person said, while the deal itself was unlikely to have made Mr Calver enough money to retire at an early age.“I think he’s still hungry,” the investor said, noting the tendency for entrepreneurs to leave large, bureaucratic companies soon after an acquisition. “He’s a smart guy and very ambitious …Running a fast-growth start-up is not entirely dissimilar to a turnround.”But Matt Piner, lead consultant at Conlumino, the retail consultancy said Mothercare’s choice was “unusual”, given Mr Calver’s lack of experience in working with high-street stores, “which is probably the company’s biggest challenge”.
746;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-06T18:04:06Z;Verizon and Coinstar to challenge Netflix;;Verizon and Coinstar, owner of the Redbox DVD rental service, are teaming up to take on Netflix.The companies announced a joint venture on Monday that was thin on details but telegraphed the companies’ ambition to compete in the booming market for subscription video services.Verizon is already a player in the video market with its growing FiOS pay television service. That gives the company, best known as the largest wireless provider in the US, critical relationships with the networks and studios it will need to secure content.Redbox operates a network of 35,000 DVD rental kiosks that offer new releases for $1 a night. Yet it has clashed with some film studios including Warner Brothers, which worry that the service undermines their home entertainment sales, which are declining rapidly.“Today’s announcement emphasises the development of digital ecosystems, integrating the consumer experience across all devices, as a key theme for 2012,” said Macquarie Capital analyst Kevin Smithen.Mr Smithen said the joint venture would help Verizon attract new subscribers and add scope to its business. It also helped put to rest speculation that Verizon might attempt to acquire Netflix.It will also give media companies yet another buyer for the digital rights to their content. In addition to Netflix, buyers now include Blockbuster, Amazon and Hulu.“Netflix, once seen as the bogeyman of traditional media owners, actually turned into everyone’s friend due to a steady stream of cashable cheques,” said Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson.The new company will see Verizon hold a 65 per cent stake, with Redbox holding 35 per cent worth $14m.“It’s about bringing two great brands together and being able to address what our consumers are looking for,” said Scott Di Valerio, chief financial officer of Coinstar.Though specifics were lacking, the outlines of the new service might include features such as unlimited streaming video and a set number of Redbox DVD rentals. Such an offering would mimic Netflix’s streaming and DVD delivery bundle, which starts at $16 a month.Blockbuster, now owed by Dish, also offers a similar service that includes streaming, delivery and in store rentals for $10 a month. Mr Smithen said the joint venture announcement helped to reaffirm the logic behind Dish’s acquisition of Blockbuster.Mr Di Valerio acknowledged that there were “a lot of different offerings in the marketplace” but said Verizon and Redbox would distinguish their service, which will be launched in the second half of the year.Explaining the lack of details, he said: “For competitive reasons you don’t want to be coming and providing the road map.”Netflix has been seen as more vulnerable since last year, in which a series of marketing gaffes caused the company to lose subscribers, and sent its share price plummeting. However, Netflix recovered some ground last week as it reported it was adding subscribers again.
747;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-02T17:22:06Z;Weak advertising hits Viacom profit;;Viacom suffered a drop in fourth-quarter profit as higher fees from distributors failed to offset weak advertising sales at the media group behind MTV and Paramount Pictures.Net income fell 65 per cent from $610m to $212m in the three months ended December, though revenues for the quarter rose 3 per cent to $3.95bn. Results were impacted by a $379m charge awarded to Harmonix, the creators of the Rock Band video game. Viacom is fighting the judgment.Philippe Dauman, Viacom chief executive, blamed the weak advertising on soft last-minute, or “scatter” sales, which meant the company could not command the advertising prices they were anticipating and a decline in ratings at some of Viacom’s networks.The 3 per cent drop in advertising sales was a disappointment for Credit Suisse analyst, Spencer Wang, who had forecast growth of 2.6 per cent growth. Shares rose 2.07 per cent to $47.94 in early trading.Mr Dauman retained an optimistic tone in the face of the weakness in advertising. “Despite headwinds in ad sales, Viacom ended the first quarter of our fiscal year with significant strength,” he said. “We are seeing ad sales improvement in this second quarter.”Viacom was able to charge cable operators and digital distributors more to carry its networks, which include Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, driving so-called “affiliate fees” up 16 per cent.“We expect our affiliate growth to remain in high single to low double digits for the foreseeable future,” said Mr Dauman.Viacom also benefited from digital distribution, including the launch of Netflix in the UK, and said a new distribution deal would be announced next week. It was also able to get higher fees from current distributors by offering high-definition and on-demand services.US ratings at several of Viacom’s networks were strong. MTV was the number one network for its target demographic, thanks to shows such as ‘Jersey Shore’ and ‘Teen Mom’.Mr Dauman said Viacom would invest $3bn in programming for its cable networks this year and continue to work closely with its creative talent and advertisers. “This investment and those relationships will drive our success quarter after quarter and year after year,” he said.Paramount Pictures, Viacom’s film studio, won the US box office battle last year with nearly $2bn in ticket sales thanks to films such as ‘Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon’ and ‘Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol’, the highest-grossing film in the Tom Cruise franchise. Paramount also had hits with smaller films such as ‘Hugo’, which is nominated for several academy awards.Viacom said it planned to expand internationally through new distribution deals for its films and cable networks, and new local market programming. “International is a key priority for Viacom,” Mr Dauman said.
748;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-02-01T22:00:01Z;Amazon results spotlight digital books;;A slowdown in Amazon’s content sales in North America cast a spotlight on how digital books are altering the online retailer’s revenue model as weak quarterly sales figures soured sentiment on its stock.Amazon said on Tuesday that its North America media sales – which include books, music, movies and video games – grew by just 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, signalling a slowdown the causes for which the company did little to illuminate.Analysts said the explanation most probably lay in digital books. The Seattle-based retailer has stimulated the spread of ebooks via its Kindle devices but the shift from print is altering the fundamentals of its business as well as the publishing industry.Digital books made up 19 per cent of the US publishing market in the first 11 months of 2011, up from 8 per cent for the same period of 2010, according to the Association of American Publishers.But some publishers said growth in ebook sales slowed in October and November as consumers waited to buy or be given new Amazon devices – including the Kindle Fire tablet released in November – before loading new titles.Digital books also generate less recorded revenue for Amazon per unit sold than physical books, according to Consumer Edge Research, although they are generally more profitable because Amazon does not have to pay shipping or warehouse storage costs for them.Before the 8 per cent growth in the fourth quarter, Amazon’s media content sales in North America had expanded by between 18 and 21 per cent from a year ago in the previous three quarters. Content was 30 per cent of its $26bn sales in North America last year.Amazon is renowned for being opaque and on a call with analysts, Tom Szkutak, its chief financial officer, offered no explanation for the slowdown beyond the disclosure that sales of video games and video game consoles had declined in the quarter.Brian Nowak, analyst at Nomura, said in a client note that lower video game sales accounted for only 2 percentage points of the slowdown. That left an unexplained gap of 6 percentage points between the latest sales figures and recent growth trends.Amazon shares fell 7.7 per cent to $179.46 on Wednesday, a drop 1 percentage point short of that presaged in after market trading on Tuesday.The company did not say how many ebooks it had sold in the quarter but data from the Association of American Publishers showed ebook sales growth decelerated to 66 per cent in November, roughly half the 123 per cent growth rate for the year until the end of that month.Ebooks are often sold at a lower price than physical books but Faye Landes, of Consumer Edge Research, said a key reason why they generated less revenue was that while Amazon reported the full price of every physical book it sold, it reported only its 30 per cent cut of the price of an ebook.That was a result of the so-called “agency” model, which since 2010 has allowed publishers – rather than Amazon – to set the price of their ebook titles in the Kindle store.“As the sales of ebooks have continued to ramp sharply, this has begun to compress reported North American media revenues,” Ms Landes wrote in a report.Another factor is third-party sales by retailers that use Amazon’s website to sell their own inventory. They are becoming increasingly important to Amazon but for those sales it records only the fees it earns rather than the full price paid.Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, said third-party sellers now represented 36 per cent of total units sold, after the company recorded year-on-year unit growth of 65 per cent in the fourth quarter.In spite of the broader drift towards ebooks, Amazon said its physical book sales grew by double digits in the quarter. Analysts attributed that to consumers’ preference for giving physical books rather than digital books as Christmas gifts and to the liquidation of the Borders chain in July, which has enabled Amazon to capture some of its former customers.Amazon provided no information on its sales of digital music and digital video – categories where it lags behind Apple and Netflix respectively – and Ms Landes said she took that to mean that growth was not accelerating.
749;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-31T22:22:48Z;House price fall triggers Wall St reversal;S&P 500 briefly re-enters bull market territory;US stocks defied European trends for a second consecutive day, falling on poor US economic data after global indices had rallied on enthusiasm for a eurozone fiscal discipline pact brokered by Germany.Shares had opened higher on the eurozone deal, climbing as much as 0.6 per cent to 1,320.55, putting the index back into bull market territory. Technicians enthused about a so-called “golden cross”, as the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average broke above its 200-day moving average.According to Schaeffers Investment Research, the S&P 500 has delivered positive returns in the calendar year following all but one of the 17 golden crosses since 1975, with a median gain of 13 per cent.“Although it is usually well-hyped when it happens, you do have to respect the fact that a golden cross really is a strong intermediate-term signal,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers.At 10am stocks reversed course as data showing an unexpected decline in consumer confidence added to earlier gloom around a further fall in US house prices.Homebuilders suffered with PulteGroup off 2.4 per cent at $7.45, Lennar down 2.9 per cent to $21.49 and DR Horton falling 1.1 per cent to $13.92. All three stocks remain up at least 9 per cent for the year and have rallied more than 50 per cent from October lows.Some analysts pointed out that weak housing data may encourage continued Federal Reserve stimulus. “Recent housing data has once again disappointed to the downside,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.Stocks pared losses through the rest of the session, but the S&P 500 ended off 0.1 per cent at 1,312.4, up 4.4 per cent for the month for its best January since 1997.Earnings were responsible for most of the big movers. Shares in RadioShack plunged 29.8 per cent to $7.18 after the company suspended share repurchases and warned that fourth-quarter earnings would come in below expectations. Heavy discounting over the holiday sales period took its toll on margins at the electronics retailer, and the company’s market capitalisation has now fallen by more than 60 per cent since the start of 2011.RadioShack rival Best Buy fell 5.6 per cent to $23.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.2 per cent at 12,632.91, as ExxonMobil, one of the most influential stocks in the price-weighted index, fell 2.1 per cent to $83.74.Exxon’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 2 per cent, but margins at its US refining business slumped. Profit at its US “downstream” business, which includes marketing as well as refining, slid from $226m to just $30m.Exxon’s fall left Apple once again as the largest US company by market capitalisation, after its shares hit a new high of $458.24, before finishing the day at $456.48, a gain of 0.8 per cent.That helped the Nasdaq to a gain of 0.1 per cent for the day, the only one of the three big US indices to record gains on Tuesday, as it closed at 2,813.84.However shares in Amazon, one of the other heavily weighted stocks in the Nasdaq, fell almost 10 per cent in after-hours trading as fourth-quarter earnings data missed expectations.Eli Lilly climbed 1.3 per cent to $39.74 despite seeing fourth-quarter profit fall by about 25 per cent, as sales of its Zyprexa antipsychotic drug were hit by new generic competition. The company also said clinical trials of its experimental Alzheimer’s treatment were not yet complete.US Steel climbed 5.1 per cent to $30.19, more than rebounding from Monday’s sell-off, which had followed the announcement of a lossmaking sale of its Serbian unit.Although US Steel declared a fourth-quarter loss, it was smaller than in 2010, and it forecast “significantly improved” results for the current quarter on firmer steel prices.Netflix fell 4.2 per cent to $120.20, as the rally, which has seen shares in the video streaming website climb 80 per cent this year, paused for breath.Sears Holdings was once again hit by reports that CIT, a key provider of finance in the retail sector, would stop extending credit to Sears suppliers to fund deliveries to the department store chain. Its shares fell 4.3 per cent to $42.15.Banks bucked the falling market, helped by improving eurozone sentiment. Bank of America climbed 0.9 per cent to $7.13 and Morgan Stanley was up 2.5 per cent to $18.65.
750;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-31T16:54:49Z;BSkyB joins battle for internet TV subscribers;;British Sky Broadcasting has stepped up its battle against the Lovefilm and Netflix online movie providers with the launch of a new internet TV service, as subscriber growth among the pay-TV group’s traditional viewer base slows.On Tuesday, the satellite broadcaster controlled by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp said it would offer its content, including Sky Movies, to the 12.5m UK households that do not subscribe to its services.Sky’s new offering would compete with YouView, the ambitious internet-television service backed by the BBC, ITV, BT and others, that is due to be launched this year.Subscribers to Sky’s new service will have a choice of pricing options that include unlimited monthly access or pay-as-you-go, marking the first time that the company has sold TV content without a contract, said Jeremy Darroch, BSkyB chief executive.“When you are trying to sell to people who have already taken a view on pay-TV and have said ‘No thanks’, you can’t keep going back to them with the same proposition,” Mr Darroch said. “You have to offer them what they want.”Mr Darroch said he did not think that the sales of satellite subscriptions had plateaued, but added: “Each subscriber that you get now is going to be harder than the last one.”When asked about the chairmanship of BSkyB, Mr Darroch said that James Murdoch would continue in the role, but might move to the US.Sky’s internet service, due to be launched later this year, follows Monday’s move to bolster Sky’s Anytime+ online video service with content from BBC’s iPlayer and ITV’s catch-up provider.The online service is the latest shot in a turf war among online movie providers in the UK, following a move by Netflix of the US to invest “a couple of billion” dollars in new content deals to challenge Sky and Amazon’s Lovefilm.The UK’s digital-movie rental market grew by 9 per cent in 2011, including pay-TV, according to estimates by IHS Screen Digest. Digital accounts for almost half of the £400m UK video rental market.The new service comes as the number of people signing up to Sky’s traditional pay TV services slowed. It added 40,000 TV customers in the second quarter to December 31 – missing analysts’ consensus forecasts of 58,000 and down on the 140,000 net additions in the same quarter the previous year.Sky’s pre-tax profit rose by more than a quarter to £597m in the six months to December 31, swollen by £30.5m that was netted from the break fee paid by News Corp following last year’s aborted bid for the pay-TV provider.First-half revenues rose by 6 per cent year-on-year to a record £3.4bn and diluted earnings per share helping shares rise 2.8 per cent to 684p.

Bill Carcache at Nomura noted they were “trading near the low end of their historical trading ranges”, although all three reported year-on-year growth of at least 13 per cent in the fourth quarter.Daniel Furtado at Jefferies dismissed concerns a recovery in the US economy would hit demand for pawn loans, noting that an estimated $55bn of credit had been withdrawn from non-prime borrowers since 2009.“As credit card companies and traditional banks continue to rein in lending we continue to see [pawn lenders] as a direct beneficiary,” Mr Furtado told clients.Both analysts warned of lingering regulatory risks: pawn companies endured their biggest one day sell-off this year on January 4, when President Barack Obama appointed Richard Cordray as a director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is leading a review of payday lending.Share price reaction was mixed, with EZCORP off 2.7 per cent to $26.69, Cash America International flat at $43.52 and First Cash off 1.5 per cent to $40.08.Elsewhere, US stocks opened sharply lower, as the latest eurozone summit exposed ongoing disagreements over Greece’s austerity programme and a planned fiscal discipline pact, while in the US analysts cautioned against new year exuberance.At midday in New York the S&P 500 was off 0.7 per cent at 1,307.10, having earlier touched 1,300 for the first time in a fortnight. But the benchmark US index remains almost 50 points above its 200-day moving average, an indicator of bullish sentiment, and is up 4 per cent for the year.“We suspect stocks are due for a near-term correction, driven by economic data and worsening seasonal supports,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior markets analyst at Wells Fargo, summing up the caution of most analysts.Jan Loeys at JPMorgan was a rare voice arguing the rally had further to run: “We are getting fundamental support, with improved economic data and central banks signalling even further easing. We … thus feel comfortable retaining a significant long in risk assets,” he told clients.With Monday signalling a relative breather in the S&P 500’s fourth-quarter earnings season, stocks shifted on analyst notes.Goldman Sachs updated its large bank recommendations, with analysts downgrading Bank of America shares to “hold”, citing “execution risks” as the bank seeks to reduce costs without reducing earning power. BofA shares were off 3.4 per cent to $7.04, the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The blue-chip heavy index was off 0.6 per cent to 12,581.94, while the Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.4 per cent to 2,605.77, as Apple continued to rally after the stellar results it announced last week. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $452.08, a dollar off last week’s all-time high.Morgan Stanley fell 1.5 per cent to $18.29 as Goldman’s bank analysts added their investment banking rival to a “conviction buy” list, arguing Morgan Stanley had successfully addressed “legacy issues from the financial crisis”.Motorola Solutions opened sharply higher after the company increased its stock buy-back programme to $3bn from $2bn. But shares pared gains and were off 0.2 per cent at $45.72. Among the few companies that did report results on Monday, shares in Gannett slumped 7 per cent to $14.15, as earnings at the media group fell by a third on lower advertising sales.US Steel fell 2.9 per cent to $29.02 after announcing it would sell US Steel Serbia to the Republic of Serbia for what it called a “nominal” price. The company expects to record a loss on the deal in results for the current quarter.Netflix continued to glide upwards, with shares climbing 1.2 per cent to $125.33. The stock has now rallied almost 80 per cent this year as positive fourth-quarter earnings added momentum to share price gains last week, forcing short-sellers to close out positions.As of mid-January, Netflix had been among the top five most-shorted shares in the S&P 500, but Data Explorers estimates the percentage of Netflix shares on loan to short sellers fell from 12.5 to 10.7 last week.Several analysts urged investors into US pawn lenders on Monday, a group of stocks that have sat out the recent market rally, but continue to exhibit strong loan growth.
752;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-30T19:34:04Z;BSkyB in climbdown on iPlayer;Pay-TV operator puts aside differences with the BBC;British Sky Broadcasting has put aside its longstanding differences with the BBC over the iPlayer, as it seeks to expand and bolster its own online video service, Anytime+, against new competition from the likes of Netflix.The BBC iPlayer and ITV’s catch-up service will both be made available on TV sets through the Sky platform for the first time later this year, as BSkyB pushes Anytime+ to a larger proportion of its subscribers.Viewing TV shows over the internet using Anytime+ had previously been restricted to the 1.2m homes that subscribed to both Sky Broadband and its pay-TV service.By Easter, more than 5m households that have the latest Sky+HD boxes, and a broadband connection from any provider, will be able to use Anytime+ to catch up on recent Sky, BBC and ITV shows through their TV sets.The partnership with the BBC comes just a year after BSkyB railed against the corporation’s “rigid” approach to tying its video on demand content to the iPlayer, after long calling for it to “unbundle” its programming.Last January, BSkyB hit out at the BBC Trust when it decided against syndicating BBC online video, other than through the iPlayer.“We think the public would be better served if the BBC adopted a less rigid approach and unbundled its content for the benefit of the tens of millions of people who choose to watch TV on other platforms,” BSkyB said then.For the BBC, overcoming that hurdle “completes” the iPlayer’s objective – enshrined in its licence-fee agreement – of “universal” availability on all the UK’s main TV platforms. An integration with Virgin Media’s pay-TV service has brought the iPlayer a substantial portion of its total usage in recent years.ITV will benefit from another source of revenue for its online content, at a time when chief executive Adam Crozier is focused on reducing the broadcaster’s dependence on advertising.“A key part of our transformation plan is creating new revenue streams, and we see increasing consumer adoption of on demand TV as a terrific opportunity to help achieve that goal,” said Mr Crozier. “Getting great ITV content – both catch up and archive – distributed across a wide range of platforms will allow us to increase viewing levels and help build pay revenues.”Analysts have seen the recent UK launch of Netflix, the US online video service, as a potential challenger to Anytime+, which is available to Sky customers as part of their regular subscription.“Today’s news . . . is not without irony, given the steady stream of anti-BBC spin we’ve heard from the pay-TV operator over the years,” said Nick Thomas, principal analyst for TV and digital media at Informa Telecoms & Media.“But Sky has always been a deeply pragmatic company, and the nominal threats from new OTT providers such as Netflix have caused it to put aside its ideological differences with its old enemy, and ensure that its customers don’t desert their pay TV service.”ITV Player and BBC iPlayer will become available on Anytime+ before the end of the year.
753;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-27T21:39:58Z;Wall Street retreats from bull market;;"Fourth-quarter earnings season gathered momentum this week but macroeconomic news moved the market; the S&P 500 closed in bull market territory on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve forecast prolonged low interest rates, but the index retreated on Friday as US growth figures came in beneath expectations.The S&P 500 ended the week up just 0.1 per cent to 1,316.32. It had climbed as high as 1,333.47, a gain of more than 21 per cent from the close on October 3, as equity analysts said the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep interest rates low until the end of 2014 was bullish for equities.“The Fed intervention should turn savers into investors, bringing money back into the market,” said Douglas Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “For the next three years at least, bank deposits will make no money, and even the most conservative savers can’t be happy with zero returns.”Utility and material stocks appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move, with both sectors gaining in a falling market. Analysts said material stocks offer a hedge against the inflationary effect of low interest rates – as commodity prices rise with inflation – while low interest rates would make it easier for utility companies to fund infrastructure investments.Apple, meanwhile, briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as its shares surged 6.4 per cent to $447.28 following blockbuster results on Tuesday. That helped the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a handy 1.1 per cent gain over the week, closing at 2,816.55.It also triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.For example, Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $6.82, even though the company cuts its forecast for full-year earnings.But the news was less good for companies supplying other smartphone manufacturers. SanDisk shares tumbled 11 per cent to $46.70 over the week, as the semiconductor manufacturer said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt 2012 revenue, and announced it had put a new production facility on hold.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.5 per cent to 12,660.46, lagging other indices, as poor fourth-quarter results weighed on several companies.Mobile phone network Verizon fell 4.5 per cent to $37.21 and rival AT&T was off 4.4 per cent to $29.16, as both reported unexpectedly large payments to their pension funds. Pension contributions also sapped margins at 3M, although shares in the technology supplier still climbed 2.1 per cent to $87.46 on strong earnings.Caterpillar was another bright spot in the Dow, climbing 5.3 per cent to $111.28 as the earth-moving company gave a bullish forecast for spending on construction in the US.But that was not enough to sustain a rally in homebuilders, which sold off on Thursday as December new home sales came in lower than expected. Lennar ended the week up just 1 per cent at $22.28, although the stock remains up 13.4 per cent for the year.With the quarterly earnings of 196 S&P 500 constituents reported, companies have beaten analysts’ forecasts at the lowest rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Revenue growth is also set to outpace earnings growth, suggesting US corporate margins are being squeezed.The financial sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent over the week, although data from Lipper showed funds investing in US banks had attracted inflows for eight successive weeks, the longest such run since March 2000.Brokers Charles Schwab and E Trade Financial fell 9 per cent to $11.67 and 15.2 per cent to $8.19 respectively, as fourth-quarter earnings were hit by low trading volumes.Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell 10.4 per cent to $16.89, as mark-to-market losses on collateralised debt obligation securities hit earnings by $12.1m, or four cents a share. Brian Zabora at Stifel Nicolaus said Zions was the only regional bank he covers that still had exposure to CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.Netflix jumped 23.5 per cent to $123.79 over the week as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [domestic earnings] and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix is now up almost 80 per cent for the year, although part appears to be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset."
754;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix climbs on global prospects;;Netflix surged 22.1 per cent to $115.84 as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [earnings] for its domestic business and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix shares are now up 68 per cent for the year, although part of that may be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset.“This stock has been highly volatile. Our calls have been highly volatile,” conceded Mr Mahaney.The S&P 500 started higher, up 0.6 per cent to 1,333.47, almost 15 points into bull market territory. But data on December new home sales, which came in below the November number and expectations, sparked a reversal. The benchmark index closed at 1,318.145, outside bull territory, with a loss of 0.6 per cent for the day.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.4 per cent to $7.80 on the home sales data, with DR Horton off 2.6 per cent to $14.12 and Lennar down 2.9 per cent to $22.13.Caterpillar provided some cheer for the sector, predicting real terms spending on US construction will increase in 2012 for the first time since 2004, but analysts warned against excessive optimism.“Sellers of new single-family homes face a similar challenge as one might have selling ice to Eskimos. The market is awash with plenty of existing homes and the supply is likely to increase as banks proceed with more foreclosures,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not have any homebuilders constituents, dropped just 0.2 per cent to 12,734.63, as Caterpillar shares climbed 2.1 per cent to $111.31 on the earthmover’s strong results.AT&T fell 2.5 per cent to $29.45, as the mobile phone network posted a fourth-quarter loss despite surging smartphone sales, as a hefty charge relating to its failed bid for T-Mobile weighed heavily.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,805.28, as poor results from SanDisk weighed on semiconductor stocks.SanDisk shares closed 11.4 per cent lower at $46.39, as the afterglow from Apple’s blockbuster results earlier in the week faded for smartphone suppliers. SanDisk said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt revenue in the first half of the year, and put a new production facility on hold.Electronic broker E Trade Financial slumped 14.6 per cent to $7.99, as it reported weak fourth-quarter results on low trading volumes.Keith Murray at Nomura retained his buy recommendation, arguing “several noisy items related to credit and expenses” contributed 10 cents a share of the miss.JC Penney shares surged 18.8 per cent to $40.72 as the company forecast strong 2012 earnings, and said it would stop relying on heavy discounting and promotions to attract customers.Time Warner climbed 7.8 per cent to $74.51 after the company used a strong earnings report to announce a $4bn share buy-back scheme and raise its dividend.Investor choices continued to be guided by the Federal Open Market Committee’s forecast of low interest rates until the end of 2014. As was the case on Wednesday, utility and material stocks were among the best performers in the S&P 500.Utilities, which are considered a carry-trade by some investors, because low interest rates reduce the cost of infrastructure investments, were up 0.5 per cent.Materials climbed 0.6 per cent, suggesting some investors are nervous of the inflationary impact of a prolonged low-interest rate environment: commodity prices tend to rise with inflation, offering some protection to materials stocks.Financials sold off led by insurers and regional banks, with lower long-term interest rates expected to put pressure on lending margins, and investment returns.Insurer Lincoln National fell 5.7 per cent to $20.69, while SunTrust Banks was off 5.2 per cent to $20.50.Greenhill & Co bucked the trend as shares surged 12.3 per cent to $49.36. The boutique investment firm posted better than expected revenue. It also followed the lead of large investment banks by cutting compensation – only 50 per cent of revenues were paid out in salaries, down from 73 per cent a year ago.“We are at a juncture where there is opportunity for advisory boutique firms like Greenhill to take away business from big companies,” Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities is reported to have said.
755;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-26T19:33:48Z;Time Warner / Netflix;Investors should take a hard look at Netflix and Time Warner Cable models;"The amount of time humans spend watching TV is a tragedy, but one that investors may as well profit from. Time Warner Cable and Netflix, both of which just reported earnings, represent distinct ways of doing so.Both primarily distribute video, rather than producing it (video is only slightly more than half of Time Warner Cable’s revenues; the rest is internet and voice). Netflix provides a library of mostly older content that customers can watch whenever they like. Time Warner offers network programming and live broadcasts. Netflix’s streaming service and DVD delivery services are less than $10 a month; cable can easily run to 10 times that. The companies reported better than expected results. Time Warner shares rose 7 per cent on sound subscriber trends and margins. Netflix, returning to subscriber growth after last year’s pricing fiasco, rose by a fifth.But look beyond the quarter. Time Warner owns the costly “pipes” that get digital signals into homes. Netflix’s content is sent over someone else’s pipes, or through the post as a DVD. It would be monstrously hard to reproduce a cable company’s hard assets. Netflix is light on hard assets, and must depends on service quality and its ties to TV and film studios to protect it from competitors.In 2010 Netflix’s model produced a free cash return on assets of 12 per cent, a fat enough profit to quiet worries about competition. Time Warner Cable had a 5 per cent return on assets that year. In 2011, though, Netflix spent heavily to build its content library, and return on assets was cut in half. Time Warner’s returns ticked up by 70 basis points. Those paying 35 times forward earnings for Netflix, rather than 11 times for Time Warner Cable, should first ask themselves why these trends will reverse.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
756;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-26T01:35:38Z;Netflix’s UK launch ‘greatly exceeded expectations’;;Netflix’s recent launch in the UK “greatly exceeded expectations”, the DVD and online streaming group said as it reported fourth-quarter profits that beat analyst estimates and lifted its shares by almost 16 per cent.Subscribers are returning to the DVD subscription and online streaming group less than six months after the company lost close to 1m customers when a botched rebranding and a price increase caused its shares to tumble.In his quarterly letter to shareholders, Reed Hastings, chief executive, said the company was back on track, with total Netflix subscribers to its streaming and DVD services rising to 24.4m, a 25 per cent increase over the prior year and a rise of 600,000 over the previous quarter.Revenues rose to $876m, compared with $596m in the same quarter the previous year. Net income slipped from $47.1m to $40.7m, while earnings per share of 73 cents exceeded analyst expectations of 55 cents.Netflix launched its video streaming service this month in the UK, where it is competing head-on with Amazon’s Lovefilm subsidiary. “The UK has greatly exceeded expectations,” Mr Hastings told the Financial Times. “We’re very excited by the initial response and we are continuing to improve the service.”Netflix is facing increasing competition from an array of providers in the US and the UK. Amazon has bolstered its online streaming service in the US and has invested heavily in Lovefilm, while Hulu, the online streaming service owned by NBCUniversal, Walt Disney and News Corp, is also adding to its library in a bid to win more subscribers.In the UK, Netflix is competing directly for new release movies and original programming with Sky Atlantic, a premium channel offered by British Sky Broadcasting.Mr Hastings sounded a bullish note about Netflix’s prospects against Amazon and Hulu Plus, Hulu’s paid subscription service. “Both Amazon and Hulu Plus’s content is a fraction of our content, and we believe their respective total viewing hours are each less than 10 per cent of ours,” he wrote in the shareholder letter.Netflix has spent aggressively on content in the last two years to build a compelling programming library for its customers to stream over the internet. “We’re rapidly increasing the amount of money we spend on content [in the US] as well as internationally.”The group is increasingly competing against HBO, Time Warner’s premium cable channel for original programming and Hollywood movies. “HBO spends about one-third of its budget on original programming and the rest on already-produced content,” said Mr Hastings. “We’re starting much more modestly.”Netflix shares had risen to $110.12 in after-hours trading. The shares had ended the trading day at $95.04, up 2.6 per cent.
757;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-25T22:14:34Z;Fed boost puts S&P 500 in bull market;FOMC meetings leads to afternoon rally;The S&P 500 closed Wednesday in bull market territory after climbing 0.9 per cent to 1,326.06, a gain of 20.6 per cent since the close on October 3.The market had opened lower as Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, added to pressure on the European Central Bank to take a hit on its Greek bond holdings. But it pared losses later when the Federal Open Market Committee said interest rates would stay low until late 2014, longer than previously stated.That triggered a 15 point afternoon rally for the benchmark index, but analysts were cautious about both the FOMC meeting and prospects for the bull market.“It’s clear the make-up of the Fed board has become more dovish and it will do what it can to inoculate the US economy from global problems,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial. “On the other hand, the Fed is acknowledging that US growth will be substandard, which can’t be good for equities.”Apple had earlier briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as shares surged following Tuesday’s blockbuster results.Shares closed up 6.2 per cent at $446.66, having hit an all-time high of $454.45 at the open.That helped the Nasdaq Composite index to gain 1.1 per cent to 2,818.31, and triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.Qualcomm, which manufactures microchips used in the iPhone 4S, climbed 0.6 per cent to $59.00, as analysts at JPMorgan said: “Apple’s very strong numbers give us more confidence that Qualcomm should report strong numbers and guide well in its earnings report next Wednesday.”Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, climbed 3.1 per cent to $6.73, despite opening sharply lower after cutting full-year guidance. But Nvidia, which hopes to supply the next generation of Macs, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.85 after reducing fourth-quarter sales projections.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,758.85, lagging other indicesGoldman Sachs fell 0.5 per cent to $108.31, and Morgan Stanley was off 0.1 per cent to $18.12, as JPMorgan analysts said a new method for calculating risk requirements, without reference to rating agencies, could reduce Goldman’s 2012 tier one capital ratio by 1.2 percentage points and Morgan Stanley’s by 0.8 percentage points.“Yet another US investment bank disadvantage,” JPMorgan said and removed “buy” recommendations on both banks.Illumina climbed 46.3 per cent to $55.15 as Roche, the Swiss drugmaker, launched a hostile bid for the diagnostics company. Roche has offered $44.50 a share in cash, but investors appear to believe Illumina will hold out for a higher price.Airlines advanced after Delta Air Lines and US Airways Group both beat projections by analysts. Delta was up 6.2 per cent to $9.96, and US Airways added 17.3 per cent to $7.52.Yahoo slipped 0.8 per cent to $15.56 despite reporting results in line with expectations. Scott Thompson, the internet portal’s chief executive, laid out new strategic plans but remained tight-lipped over plans for a sale.Boeing opened sharply lower after disappointing analysts with its 2012 forecast. But the stock closed up 0.6 per cent to $75.82.Quarterly earnings reports propelled several large moves in the S&P 500. Textron surged 14.5 per cent to $24.76 for the best performance in the index after forecasting higher 2012 profit than analysts expected, amid growing demand for its Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters.CA Inc climbed 9.6 per cent to $25.02 as the software developer easily beat analyst expectations.Xerox fell 9.9 per cent to $7.81 as it said fourth-quarter and full-year earnings could be well below analyst expectations, with slow global growth expected to hit demand for printers.Corning shed 10.7 per cent to $13.05 as the world’s largest maker of glass for flat-panel televisions saw quarterly earnings halve as LCD display prices sank.With almost a third of the S&P 500’s market capitalisation reported, companies have so far produced the lowest earnings beat-rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, with revenue gains outpacing profit increases, as margins are squeezed.“The V-shaped recovery in corporate profits seems to be at an end,” warned Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.In after-hours trading, shares in Netflix surged 10 per cent to as much as $108.00, after the DVD delivery and web streaming company reported earnings that beat expectations.

The revolution under way in television could cause unexpected interference this year.Let us accept for a moment the contention of cable and satellite television companies that cord-cutting, the spectre of consumers unplugging cables and disconnecting dishes, has not (yet) led to the exodus of subscribers that some analysts feared.A digitally-savvy minority is certainly working round monthly subscriptions by using internet-connected sets, the 2.8m Apple TV boxes sold last year, Netflix streaming, iTunes and Amazon downloads, Family Guy episodes on Hulu, shared YouTube clips and shows on broadcasters’ websites. But they are still far outnumbered by traditional couch potatoes.Media buyers have been struck by the enduring power of television, which is growing more quickly than any advertising medium except digital. MagnaGlobal this week predicted that US TV ad spending would be up 6.8 per cent this year.Television bulls have their annual moment of vindication coming with the Super Bowl on February 5, which this year could draw a record audience, there in part to watch advertisements sold for 17 per cent more than last year’s average price.The last two Super Bowls were the most watched programmes in US TV history, with the audience hitting 111m in 2011, and spending on national TV sports advertising jumped from $10.3bn to $10.9bn in the year to September, Nielsen reports. Whatever happened to audience fragmentation?The answer is that, beyond sports, live events such as the Oscars and reality TV shows, fragmentation is starting to upset TV economics, and the likes of Apple, Netflix and YouTube are absolutely to blame.Digital video services may not be eating into most consumers’ spending on traditional pay-TV services – enough seem willing to pay extra for on-demand video or libraries of old hits – but the surge in new video options is eating into the time they have to watch TV.In mid 2011, Nielsen reported that the average American had found another 22 minutes in his or her month for television over the previous year. But it also found that the heaviest internet video users were suddenly watching less traditional television than average. These early adopters are likely to be advertisers’ most sought-after viewers.The digital distractions will increase this year. Connected TVs presented at the Consumer Electronics Show this month will make online video easier to access, and Google this week boasted that YouTube now gets 4bn views a day, up 25 per cent in just eight months, even before its strategy to showcase more professional video bears fruit.Netflix, Richard Greenfield of BTIG wrote recently, serves up 2bn hours of video to all its users every three months, enough to rival the 15th most watched US network. “It simply cannot be all incremental,” he said.In the fourth quarter of 2011, Michael Nathanson of Nomura has noted, live primetime viewing fell almost 5 per cent, the 13th quarter in a row of decline.Most of that was made up when looking at media buyers’ currency of “C+3”ratings, which measure people catching up with shows on digital video recorders during the three days after the broadcast. But C+3 does not catch ardent viewers watching last week’s missed episode, or streaming older seasons stripped of ads.John Rose, head of Boston Consulting Group’s media practice, says “No one is capturing it. There’s no systematic measurement vehicle for non-linear television”.Viewing averages conceal large behavioural shifts among some groups – again, usually advertisers’ prime targets. He adds: “People in the US who own a tablet watch 50 hours of long-form video on their tablet a month. It’s a staggering number.”Advertisers and media companies are reaching for alternative ways of measuring audiences. NM Incite, a company formed by Nielsen and McKinsey, scours social media to find correlations between online buzz and TV ratings.This week, Time Warner invested $12m in Bluefin Labs, a “social TV analytics” company that gives clients detailed demographic portraits of the audience commenting online as well as telling them how shows and ads are being received.Mr Rose says:“The thing I worry about is that the video value chain is a very complex and inherently frail set of economic relationships”.Relationships that had changed little in decades “are about to be disrupted, and that will shift massive amounts of value to different players”.Producers of premium “must see” television – especially live sports – are thriving, as is niche content that once struggled to find an audience, Mr Rose says, but “the stuff in the middle dies.” As more video is watched outside traditional advertising windows, marketers will need to become more creative.It would be rash to write off the couch potato, often willing to stick with one network’s evening line-up rather than change channel.But the viewing behaviour of advertisers’ most coveted audiences has changed and that change is accelerating.Brands will need new means of reaching them, and new ways of measuring their viewing. Stay tuned.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com

The Nasdaq Composite index also fell 0.1 per cent to 2,784.17.Bank stocks continued to rally strongly, with Bank of America up 2.6 per cent to $7.25, while Citigroup climbed 0.7 per cent to $29.85.Oil and gas field services company Halliburton fell 2.1 per cent to $35.44, despite topping analyst estimates with fourth-quarter earnings of a dollar a share.The company’s North American margins declined more than 200 basis points to 27.2 per cent in the fourth quarter and could fall a further 100bp in the current quarter.“There was already a sense that the company was facing cost inflation issues at certain “fracking” sites, where there is high demand for equipment, but the extent that impacted on margins took people by surprise,” said Stephen Gengaro, an oil services analyst at Sterne Agee.Shares in Halliburton’s rival Baker Hughes fell 3.2 per cent to $47.73.Netflix dipped back below $100, falling 6.3 per cent to $93.96 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. Wedbush Securities analysts said the video streaming and DVD delivery company would probably forecast first-quarter earnings “well below” consensus estimates. The stock remains up almost 40 per cent for the year.BlackBerry manufacturer Research In Motion fell 8.5 per cent to $15.89 as the company’s joint chairmen and chief executives stepped aside, but new management dismissed suggestions the company would be sold.Sears Holdings shareholders endured another rollercoaster day. Shares climbed as high as $54.76, a gain of more than 10 per cent, on weekend reports that a key retail sector financing company, which had stopped providing credit to Sears suppliers, had begun to extend credit to the department store’s clients again.But the stock closed down 3.3 per cent at $47.39, as Credit Suisse analysts said the rally, which had seen the company’s market capitalisation increase by as much as two-thirds this year, was “a classic short squeeze,” rather than a result of improved sentiment toward the company.The Sears share price plunged in the last two months of 2011 after the retailer announced store closures after poor sales.Apple climbed 1.7 per cent amid heavy trading ahead of fourth-quarter results on Tuesday.Birinyi Associates told clients traders usually react positively to Apple’s reports with the stock tending to record strong gains in after-hours trading but, at $427.41, shares were already just short of an all-time high touched last week.
760;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-22T15:56:37Z;Alliance zooms in on production potential;;Harry Potter fans patiently waiting for Daniel Radcliffe’s film, The Woman in Black, are in for a shock. The creepy ghost story, which premieres in London this week, is a far cry from JK Rowling’s tale of a young wizard, yet the mere presence of Radcliffe should appeal to the many global fans of the young star.At least, that is what Alliance Films hopes. The company is well-established in theatrical distribution, having released films produced by other companies in Canada, Spain and the UK, where it owns Momentum Pictures, for almost 20 years. But when it comes to producing and financing its own films, Alliance is a relative newcomer.The Woman in Black is only the fifth film produced by Alliance in its current incarnation. It already has much to live up to: Alliance Films was an investor in last year’s big Oscar winner The King’s Speech and also backed Insidious, a low-budget horror film that grossed more than $100m worldwide.“We got into production a year and a half ago,” says Charles Layton, president of the Canada-domiciled group, in an interview. The independent companies that produced most of the titles Alliance released through its distribution network had scaled back production or been absorbed into bigger groups. “We had been looking for additional supply for our distribution system. We didn’t want to continue to depend on third parties and the opportunity presented itself with Jason Blum [the producer of Insidious].”The release of Alliance’s latest film comes amid uncertainty for the company. It was recently put up for sale by its largest shareholder, GS Capital Partners, the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, which owns about two-thirds of the group.“We’re not worrying about it,” says Mr Layton a former Miramax executive – Harvey Weinstein, that company’s founder, first introduced him to Victor Loewy, Alliance’s founder, in 1989. “People who understand the movie business understand the financial and strategic virtues of being in production and distribution.”Alliance is headquartered in Montreal but Mr Layton, based in New York, is rarely in the same city as the other three executives who run the group. Xavier Marchand, president of worldwide distribution, is based in the UK, as is Alison Cornwell, the former Disney executive who is Alliance’s chief financial officer, while Mr Loewy lives in Canada.Alliance was a listed company before it was taken private in 2007 by Goldman and CanWest Global Communications, the Canadian media group, following the $2.3bn takeover of Alliance Atlantis. Becoming private allowed for more flexibility, says Mr Marchand. “When the finance department says you can’t release a film at a particular time, it can have a big impact on a film’s performance.”At the time of Goldman’s acquisition, Alliance Atlantis had multiple divisions, including cable channels and the film company. CanWest would later seek bankruptcy protection and Goldman would sell the cable channels, leaving Alliance Films as a standalone entity.Mr Loewy, who continues to chair the company he founded, says Goldman was “hands off, operationally. We never went to them with cash demands …Alliance is completely self-funded.”Film production can be risky – and expensive – but Ms Cornwell says Alliance has been “risk averse”. It has produced five movies so far “and they have all been financed out of cash flow”. It has also tapped a revenue stream with Netflix, the online video group, which struck a deal to screen films released by Momentum Pictures in the UK on its online streaming service.It is unclear how much bidders will be willing to pay for Alliance, but the company’s distribution activities have generated annual profits of about $40m. Earnings should also rise following the commercial success of the films it has backed: The King’s Speech grossed $400m worldwide and sold 2m DVDs in the UK alone. It invested in The King’s Speech after agreeing a co-production deal with See-Saw Films, which made the movie: that deal also yielded Shame, which was released in the UK recently to critical acclaim.Alliance hopes to continue its winning streak with The Woman in Black. Potential buyers of the company are sure to be watching closely to see how the film fares.
761;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-17T20:42:16Z;Online piracy: sinking the thieves;Keeping a lid on piracy is likely to become an endless effort;The online piracy debate supplies central casting villains for all sides. On the one hand, Rupert Murdoch. When the Obama administration objected to granting the authorities power to make offending websites disappear (“domain name system blocking”), Murdoch tweeted this grotesque exaggeration: “Obama has thrown in his lot with Silicon Valley paymasters.” Then you have the operators of The Pirate Bay file-sharing website. They offer the childish brag that because they don’t actually store stolen content, it is “not possible to hold the people behind The Pirate Bay responsible” for stealing. Someone, please lock these people in a room together.There is agreement on one point. Content producers need to make it easier for consumers to be legitimate customers. How well this will work depends on the type of content.A solution is already at hand for older, or “tail”, video content: Netflix makes money and writes big cheques to movie and TV studios. The revenues of the music industry have shrunk by half during the past decade, but a recent resurgence in sales volumes shows that services such as iTunes and Spotify are helping. Software is a harder case. Apple makes its software harder to steal by bundling it up with fancy hardware, but even it has to spend loads of time and money suing suspected infringers. High-cost, high-end content, like first-run movies and live sporting events, may be the hardest case of all.There is no economic law promising that a valuable and productive business, however clever and forward-thinking, will be able to protect itself when thieves provide free or cheap access to its products. Keeping a lid on piracy is likely to become a lot like garbage pick-up, or stopping drink-driving: an endless effort against a perennial problem, where some degree of government involvement is inevitable.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
762;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-16T23:20:57Z;Intuitive Surgical: cutting the mustard;It is very profitable but it is crucial the company steps up international sales;Intuitive Surgical has the key ingredients of a go-go growth stock: torrid revenue growth, a profitable business model, and robots. The company, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, makes systems that allow doctors to perform minimally invasive surgery while sitting at a video-game like console, using hand controls to manipulate a scope and tools within the patient’s body, by way of four mechanical arms.Revenue growth has averaged 40 per cent over the past five years. The business runs on a razors and blades model, with more than half of the revenue from recurring sales of accessories and from service contracts. It is very profitable, due in part to a near monopoly in robotic surgery, and has $2bn in net cash.All the excitement has left Intuitive shares selling at north of 20 times this year’s estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It has little company at this heady altitude, now that some of the biggest momentum stocks, such as Netflix and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, have cracked. A Capital IQ screen finds only eight other US companies (outside of real estate) valued at more than $10bn trading at 20 times ebitda or higher, including Amazon, Groupon and Salesforce.com.If Intuitive can maintain growth near recent levels, it merits the price tag. But despite being in a defensive sector, a sharp sales slowdown in 2008-2009 shows that the company is sensitive to hospitals’ capital budgets and, therefore, the economy. JPMorgan notes that many of the largest US hospital groups now own Intuitive systems, which, at $1m-$2m apiece, are harder for smaller hospitals to afford. So it is crucial that the company steps up international sales, now just a fifth of the total. If growth slows, the market will perform a very invasive procedure on Intuitive’s stock.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
763;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;BT adds social media element to pay-TV;Personalised recommendations tailor content to taste;"BT is to launch a redesigned internet TV service that will offer a more personalised experience and social media elements as competition in the pay TV market has intensified with the launch of Netflix in the UK last week.BT will introduce the next generation of its BT Vision service within the next few weeks, according to sources with knowledge of the launch, which will introduce greater interactivity with its large library of on-demand content. BT Vision is a pay-TV service that includes sports and films over the internet, and has been an important part of the group’s attempts to generate revenues outside its traditional phone market.Plans for the next generation of the service include the use of a system of personalised recommendations to tailor content to the tastes of the watcher to improve the experience.There is also expected to be a layer of social networking introduced by BT Vision, which will be revamped in advance of the YouView internet TV launch that has been supported by BT alongside the main TV channels. It will be available on YouView, which is in effect the next generation Freeview platform expected to be launched in May.The revamp of BT Vision, which has yet to meet its launch ambitions, takes place as the market becomes increasingly crowded with the launch of Netflix in the UK this month. It has led to questions about how many video and pay-TV services can be supported in the UK given rival products also by Sky, Amazon’s Lovefilm and Virgin Media.BT confirmed the plans but had no comment about details of the launch. However, in an interview with the FT last week, chief executive Ian Livingston said BT was focused on bringing “true interactivity to the TV set, which is the most watched screen in the house”.He added: “That means on-demand services; it means the availability of buying things as you do it; to have personalised services; to know what your friends like and what they think of it. I think that will change viewing habits quite considerably. It won’t happen overnight but I think it’s the start of something quite big.”In the second quarter of its financial year up to September 2011, BT said it had added 41,000 customers – the highest number for more than two years – to take the total subscriber base to 639,000. Even so, BT had once hoped to achieve 2m-3m subscribers by 2011.Analysts at Enders said last week that the impact of Netflix on the UK pay-TV industry was likely to be smaller than the effect it had had in the US given the availability of low priced pay-TV with strong on-demand components included free."
764;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Hulu to spend $500m on programming in 2012;;Hulu, the online video site owned by Walt Disney, News Corporation and NBC Universal, plans to spend about $500m on programming this year to bolster its library as cable television operators beef up their own competing online services.The company’s 2012 budget is a $200m increase on the $300m Hulu spent on programming in 2011.Jason Kilar, Hulu chief executive, wrote in a blog post that the company’s dual revenue model of advertising and subscription fees meant it could pay more for content than other online subscription services. “We believe our approach will enable us to secure more valuable content for our users and to secure content in more attractive windows than would otherwise be possible,” he wrote.Hulu generated about $420m in revenues in 2011, an increase of 60 per cent on the previous year, while the company’s Hulu Plus subscription service “materially exceeded our plan”, Mr Kilar wrote.Hulu is attracting more than twice the number of new subscribers each day when compared with last year, Mr Kilar added. Hulu Plus now has 1.5m subscribers, which compares with more than 20m subscribers at Netflix, a rival service which offers a subscription DVD service, as well as online video streaming.Hulu’s owners put the site up for sale last year but despite receiving several offers that valued the company at more than $1bn, they decided not to sell. “We were moving too fast to say we did not need to own an asset like this,” Jon Miller, chief digital officer at News Corp, told a panel at this week’s Consumer Electronics Show.Hulu’s dual revenue model differentiated it from Netflix, he added. “Dual revenue streams work in the media business.”Netflix and Hulu dominate online video viewing in the US but, after years of delay, services launched by cable and satellite operators finally look capable of eating into their lead.FT tech writers upload their viewsComcast, the largest cable operator in the US, recently struck a 10-year extension to its carriage agreement with Walt Disney, a deal that gives new online rights for programming from Disney’s cable networks, including its ESPN sports network and The Disney Channel. This programming is free to watch for authenticated Comcast subscribers on devices such as the iPad.HBO Go, the online service launched by Time Warner’s HBO channel, has also attracted viewers, with its app downloaded more than 3m times. Showtime, a HBO competitor, has launched its own online streaming service, which is available to authenticated subscribers of the premium cable channel.HBO last week stopped selling discounted discs of its programming to Netflix, in the latest sign of an intensifying rivalry between the two companies. Netflix will be free to buy the discs of shows such as Boardwalk Empire from retailers.
765;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-12T18:46:23Z;Showtime’s investment in quality TV pays off;;In the new Showtime series House of Lies that premiered this week, Don Cheadle plays a hedonistic management consultant with questionable business ethics. It is just the type of character that has been winning the CBS-owned premium cable channel high ratings and new subscribers in recent years.“All our characters are subversive,” Matthew Blank, Showtime chief executive, said in an interview with the Financial Times. “Whether they are a mom who is selling pot to the neighbours or a serial killer who’s a cop, these are characters we are able to define in a way that they are embraced by fans,” he said, referring to two of the networks’ other hit shows, Weeds and Dexter.Showtime itself could be described the same way. Since 2009, the once-maligned channel, which costs US television viewers about $10 per month, has added 4.2m new subscribers to reach 21m, while its chief rival, Time Warner’s HBO, has seen subscriptions fall by 876,000 to 28m, according to SNL Kagan.Over the last two full years, revenue at CBS’s cable networks division, which consists mostly of Showtime, rose from $1.26bn in 2008 to $1.475 in 2010. The network is on track to post record revenues when CBS reports full-year earnings on February 15.The robust numbers represent a dramatic turn for Showtime and have helped CBS’s share price jump more than threefold in the past three years. Until a few years ago, the network was best known for carrying sub-par studio films and light adult entertainment. But nearly a decade of investment in original content is now paying off, as Showtime is now famous for Dexter, Weeds and other home-grown series.“Changing a television network is like turning an oil tanker,” said Mr Blank. “It takes a long time, and we had to be generating the revenues to do it.”The first part of Mr Blank’s strategy was to reduce the amount spent on expensive deals with film studios. It ended its deal with Paramount Pictures in 2008, saving tens of millions of dollars a year.“We just don’t get the bang for the buck in the big studio deals,” Mr Blank said. “There are so many places you can access a movie after it hits the theatre, it’s very hard to claim any sort of exclusivity.”With those revenues freed, Mr Blank invested in new original shows that proved better value despite the initial cost. Following on from the success of Weeds, which stars Mary Louise Parker as a drug-dealing suburban mother, Showtime launched Dexter in 2007. Starring Michael C. Hall as a vigilante serial killer who is also a cop, Dexter is now the network’s most popular show.In addition to attracting new subscribers, Showtime’s original series provide lasting value through syndication to digital distributors, such as Netflix, and international networks, and home entertainment sales, which Mr Blank said have remained robust.David Joyce, Miller Tabak analyst, says: “You have to invest upfront, which hinders the margins early on but it turns into a larger lifetime value. The success of the original programming drives higher subscriptions.”Showtime has not continued to produce original films, once a staple of its programming, even as HBO still invests heavily in the genre. Mr Blank said original films did not have the same value as series when it came time to syndicate them and sell DVDs, nor did they have the potential for multiple seasons.While other shows have been successful, with House of Lies and the second-season premiers of Californication and Shameless setting ratings records for Showtime this week, it may be hard pressed to match the average 5m viewers of Dexter. It also remains reliant on outside production studios, such as Lions Gate, for some hit shows, limiting its ability to resell some valuable content.However, Showtime is working to make more of its content available online. This week it launched its own app, Showtime Anytime, which allows paying subscribers to view content online and on tablets, matching a successful product from HBO.Mr Blank said that online viewing would become a standard part of the television landscape. “We’re still in the nascent phase of how people use all sorts of digital content,” he said. “Ultimately, these things will become taken for granted.”
766;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-11T18:17:16Z;Threats on horizon for pay-TV in Europe;;The historic resilience of pay-TV in parts of Europe is likely to come under scrutiny by investors this year, analysts warn.Twin threats on the horizon to the $36bn-a-year industry include alternative sources of programmes for viewers on the internet and increased competition for TV shows that have historically been key to retaining subscribers’ loyalty. These principally comprise exclusive rights to show sport, especially football, and films.Pay-television is regarded by analysts as a defensive investment. BSkyB, in the UK, is the largest pay-TV business in Europe by subscribers and revenue and did well through the period between 2007-09 when recessionary pressures pulverised advertising-dependent free-to-air broadcasters.Then, its revenues grew at a compound rate of 8.5 per cent to £5.36bn with the core pay-TV business playing a large role.By June 2010, BSkyB’s operating margin had returned to the 18.5 per cent of 2007 and by the end of June 2011, its free cash flow had grown from a post-recessionary £515m to £869m, adjusted to ignore exceptional events.Canal+ provided a lesser performance for Vivendi, its 80 per cent shareholder, but still managed a 2.9 per cent year-on-year increase in revenues to €3.56bn.In Italy, competition between Mediaset and News Corp’s Sky Italia has caused both companies to struggle for growth, while in Germany, pay-TV companies such as Sky Deutschland have been pitted against a system of incumbent cable-TV businesses whose services are usually included in the rent or service charges of ubiquitous apartment blocks.Into this market are coming powerful competitors such as Google and Apple, with their own offering of internet-based television, as well as Amazon with its Lovefilm streamed-movie subsidiary, Netflix, and the Qatari-financed Al Jazeera, which has already made moves into the French football rights market that some analysts see as ominous for listed pay-TV groups.Claudio Aspesi, analyst at Bernstein Research, says that he had previously thought concerns were overdone that OTT [over-the-top or internet-based TV] could cut out pay-TV companies as the intermediaries between content owners and viewers, but Apple could change that.Mr Aspesi says: “Its popularity and potential attractiveness as a distribution channel could drive the owners of rights towards it.“Moreover, European regulators are increasingly hostile to exclusive contracts and pay-TV companies may find it impossible to keep their most valuable content out of Apple’s hands.”Nick Bertolotti at Credit Suisse adds experts say that in the coming decade most TVs will be able to connect to the internet by WiFi, a tipping point for the use of internet-based services.An additional factor is social mobility, says Mark Hollinger, president of Discovery Networks International, which uses an advertising-reliant free-to-air strategy in Europe as Pay-TV has not penetrated the region deeply enough to generate the subscriber numbers that appeal to advertisers. This compares with its Latin American plans where large numbers are moving from poverty into the middle class, and so sees strong pay-TV growth, he says.Al Jazeera is also important, analysts say. With the surprise award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, the oil and gas-rich Gulf state is seeking ways to show its commitment to football.Al Jazeera is technically independent of the emirate’s government but analysts in the region have observed that it would only be logical for all businesses based in Qatar to support the Emir’s World Cup project.Al Jazeera has in the past year spent more than €280m on rights to football in France, including a majority of the rights to broadcast Champions League inside the country. It is rumoured to have outbid the joint approach by RTL’s M6 and Bouygue’s TF1 for rights to show the Euro 2012 tournament in France.Mr Aspesi says this activity should give BSkyB and others “pause for thought” as it prepares for a new round of bidding for crucial Premier League rights in the first months of 2012. He expected the broadcaster to spend 15 to 25 per cent more than in 2009.BSkyB declined to comment, but a person familiar with the company’s thinking said it welcomed new distribution platforms such as Apple’s yet-to-be-launched internet-TV service, as a means of distributing the content on which it spends £2bn a year. The broadcaster also benefits from its own Sky Go mobile television service.Toby Syfret of Enders Analysis added that it would take several years for internet companies to challenge established pay-TV players.With additional reporting by David Gelles in New York
767;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-11T16:41:24Z;Netflix – one to watch for investors?;Media streaming group launches in UK;"Netflix, the American film and TV streaming service giant, has finally gone live in the UK and Ireland, and plans a price war against British rivals BSkyB, and the UK-based streaming and rental service LoveFilm.As part of its highly publicised UK debut, Netflix is offering a one-off free trial period providing unlimited access to its streaming catalogue; including Hollywood films, hit US TV series and British shows such as The Only Way is Essex.Netflix fees are expected to range from £5.99 to £6.99 a month and the service will be available on multiple platforms including laptops, smartphones and tablets. It works on Apple TV and Nintendo’s Wiii, unlike LoveFilm.But the real deal here is seeing how British rivals will respond. Netflix has already extended streaming services to Canada, Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The European market for on-demand online streaming is a hot spot for investors, as experts believe it could be worth around $77bn.Soon after the launch announcement was made, the Amazon-owned LoveFilm service, which also provides on-demand video content as well as DVD-by-post rentals, unveiled a streaming-only package at an “introductory” price of £4.99 . LoveFilm has almost two million subscribers in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and has been one of the major players in the internet-based film retail industry since it launched in 2002.Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, quickly dismissed the move and described LoveFilm as “not the enemy” to beat in the UK, suggesting that Sky has a much better catalogue, such as Golden Globe-winning TV series Boardwalk Empire and Mad Men, for which Sky has exclusive screening rights in the UK.While LoveFilm has been embroiled in a legal battle with Universal pictures which stops it from renting its titles, members can choose from a selection of over 70,000 titles available across Blu-ray, DVDs, video games and instant streaming.Most notably, Netflix also missed the opportunity to secure rights to ITV’s latest episodes of the hit television series Downton Abbey, one of Britain’s most popular shows. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, told the FT they plan to spend “a couple of billion [dollars] on content in the next year” to boost its catalogue.Netflix hopes its UK venture will serve to put behind a difficult year after a controversial 60 per cent price increase resulted in subscription cancellations from angry US viewers, who took to Twitter describing the move as a “slap in the face” and created Facebook pages such as “1,000,000 people will not stand for Netflix’s new prices” in protest. Netflix was eventually forced to abandon its plans to separate its $9.99 DVD and online services offer; in order to create two $7,99 each DVD-by-mail and online streaming entities, last October.Investors in Netflix may perhaps be more interested in watching the company’s share price than viewing the latest films.Following its UK launch, shares in Netflix rose 14 per cent to $98.18, the largest one-day jump recorded in the Nasdaq stock market since 2007, on prospects of buoyant growth in the US and Europe. However, its stock lost 61 per cent in 2011, as one million subscribers abandoned Netflix services."
768;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-10T23:17:10Z;US consumers buy fewer home movies;;US consumers are turning away from owning movies to watch in their homes, buying far fewer releases in 2011 than in previous years, in a further blow to film studios already reeling from a decline in ticket sales at cinemas.Total revenues from the sale of films on DVDs, Blu-rays and via digital distribution fell more than 12 per cent to $9.5bn, according to a report released at the Consumer Electronics Show by the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents film studios and device manufacturers.“It’s growing evidence of a disenchantment with owning movies,” said Dan Cryan, analyst with IHS Screen Digest, a media research group. “Consumers are shifting to rental and subscription services which allow them to watch a wide range of content for a lower price.”There was encouraging growth of digital film distribution, which grew more than 50 per cent to $3.4bn thanks to the emergence of online streaming services, such as Netflix.Revenues from video-on-demand services increased almost 7 per cent to $1.9bn, boosted by kiosk operators such as Redbox, which have risen in popularity as established retail outlets, such as Blockbuster, suffered. The DEG said the market for filmed entertainment, which includes all sale and rental revenues, had “clearly stabilised” and pointed to growth of 5 per cent in the third quarter, the first such increase since 2008.The world’s largest consumer electronics show this year sees 2,700 exhibitors displaying their wares in Las Vegas between January 10 and 13However, the outlook remains bleak because profit margins on the sale of movies are much higher than film rentals.The decline in home movie sales comes after a fallow year at the box-office. Despite the success of the latest Transformers, Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean movies – which each grossed more than $1bn worldwide – total ticket sales fell by 4.5 per cent, although the decline was slightly offset by higher ticket prices. Revenues from ticket sales fell $390m to $10.2bn, a fall of 3.7 per cent on 2010, according to BoxOffice.com, which tracks box office performance.Film studios and media groups have gathered in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show to explore new distribution technologies and platforms. The industry is pinning its hopes on Ultra Violet, a new cloud-based system that allows consumers to watch the movies they buy on the platform of their choosing.
769;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US investors get route into LatAm entertainment;;Evolution Media Capital, a boutique bank created by former Merrill Lynch bankers and Creative Artists Agency, has formed a joint venture deal with the family behind the Televisa media group to identify film, television and sport investments in the US and Latin America.The deal between EMC and NALA Investments pairs the boutique US bank with Emilio Diez Barroso, great-grandson of the Televisa founder. The aim is to create a pipeline of Latin American film, television and sport deals for US investors.Mr Diez Barroso said NALA EMC would become a “gateway” for the region creating opportunities for institutional US investors that had previously been limited to wealthy individuals or families from Latin America. “We want to provide an access point for these deals,” he told the Financial Times.“There are big opportunities in Latin America,” he added. “But a lot of the [US] companies I talk to have resources committed to Asia – and not Latin America.”The joint venture aims to make it easier for US institutions and other groups to invest in sports and entertainment companies in Latin America, which is becoming increasingly attractive thanks to sharp growth in the region’s media sector. This has been fuelled by growing broadband penetration, particularly in Mexico, which recently became one of the first non-US markets chosen by Netflix, the online video group, to launch its film-streaming service.EMC was created by Robert Stanley and his colleagues from Merrill Lynch’s media and sports structured finance group, and CAA, Hollywood’s largest talent agency, which represents stars such as George Clooney and Brad Pitt.EMC has advised on more than $15bn of deals in its home market, ranging from the sale of the Texas Rangers baseball franchise to the purchase of CKX, owner of the American Idol show, by Apollo Global Management, the private equity group.EMC worked on the recent sale of Paris Saint-Germain football club and advises sports leagues on media rights negotiations: it also structured Sony ATV’s $300m of debt financing for its 50 per cent stake in The Beatles library.NALA-EMC also anticipates deals flowing both ways and wants to introduce Latin American investors to opportunities in the US.“A lot of the deals we’re looking at in film, TV and sports will now be available to investors from Latin America,” Mr Stanley said. NALA EMC would “look at everything in the media spectrum,” he added. “We will look to acquire distribution rights and content for Latin America.”Mr Diez Barroso has been involved in several big deals in Mexico, including NALA’s acquisition of a stake in Volaris, the airline founded by Carlos Slim, and an investment in Transportes Lipu, the largest school bus company in Mexico.But he has also been active in the US and was an early-stage investor in Summit Entertainment, the film group behind the hit Twilight vampire movies.Summit is currently in merger talks with Lions Gate Entertainment, producer of the Mad Men and Weeds TV shows. It has also been linked with a possible tie-up with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood movie studio which has been restructured and slimmed down following a period in bankruptcy protection.This article has been corrected since original publication

Many analysts had predicted a loss and shares held steady at $9.43 in after-hours trading.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,277.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,392.69.Although Google’s woes weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, the tech-heavy index eked out a 0.1 per cent gain to close at 2,676.56. Its other heavily weighted stock, Apple, hit a high of $427.75 in the morning session, before closing at $421.73, off 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 has recorded gains on all but one trading day in 2012 but much of the legwork has been done by a concentration of industrial, material and financial stocks, making some analysts wary.“While the S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent last week, the percentage of industry groups in up trends actually contracted [from 56 per cent to 52 per cent],” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird. “Absent of a significant broadening in rally participation, the ability of the major indexes to move significantly higher is likely to be limited.”Netflix climbed 13.8 per cent to $98.18 as it launched its UK and Ireland video web streaming service.The stock, which bombed last year as its US service lost subscribers, is enjoying a mini-renaissance, now up almost $30 since the start of 2012, when the company said customers had streamed more than 2bn hours of content in the quarter to the end of December.Shares in Inhibitex climbed 141.1 per cent to $23.70 after Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to buy the pharmaceutical group for its hepatitis C medicines. That drove up shares in other treatment developers as Idenix Pharmaceuticals surged 37 per cent to $9.66.Bristol-Myers Squibb was off 0.9 per cent to $33.91.CareFusion fell 8.6 per cent to $23.28 after the medical device manufacturer lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings forecast to $1.75 from $1.80.Rival St Jude Medical rose 3.2 per cent to $35.70 after it said it still expected to meet fourth-quarter and full-year guidance.Regions Financial rose 2.7 per cent to $4.53 on reports that the regional bank, which is yet to repay all Tarp funds borrowed from the Treasury, may offload its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, which could fetch up to $1bn.Financials were generally stronger with Bank of America climbing 1.5 per cent to $6.27, despite reports it would sack a fifth of its Asia managing directors.Health insurer AFLAC fell 2.3 per cent to $43.23 as UBS analysts warned “its outsized exposure to debt issued by European financials” makes it particularly vulnerable to a European slowdown.Exchanges continued to show weakness after JPMorgan analysts warned on Friday that earnings estimates may be over optimistic. The CME Group fell 2.5 per cent to $228.24 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 2.1 per cent to $112.58.Ralph Lauren climbed 4 per cent to $146.36 as Goldman Sachs analysts tipped the luxury brand to be one of the “secular winners with strong tailwinds of sales and margin expansion” in 2012.Video game retailer Gamestop fell 3.5 per cent to $23.99 as same store sales in the holiday period came in 0.3 per cent lower than in 2010.Tech stock Zynga fell 9.2 per cent to $8.00, $2 below its December IPO price. That might be bad news for investors in Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds as filings revealed that the investment bank owns 16 per cent of the group’s publicly available stock.
771;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-09T19:00:43Z;Netflix and Lovefilm begin price war;;"Netflix said it plans to invest “a couple of billion” dollars in new content deals as it challenges Amazon’s Lovefilm and British Sky Broadcasting in the UK, starting the year on a bullish note following a difficult 2011.The hefty outlay comes as it enters a much more competitive market than its native US, as it also faces competition from pay TV providers British Sky Broadcasting, BT and Virgin Media as well as retailers such as HMV and Tesco, analysts say. The company has said the cost of entering the UK will push it into a loss in the first quarter of 2012.Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said that he was focusing on the company’s long-term success and would rely predominantly on word-of-mouth recommendations to drive uptake in the new market.“We are focused on getting to multiple millions of members in the UK over the next few years,” he told the Financial Times. “It doesn’t really matter how much in the short term. Our first focus is on member satisfaction not on quantity.”Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said licensing costs in the UK were “high relative to the size of the market” but that more shows would come online over the course of the year.“I don’t mind that it’s not easy to get content because it creates some barrier to entry for others,” he said. “We will spend a couple of billion [dollars] on content in the next year, from hundreds of suppliers all over the world.”However, after launching in Canada and Latin America since 2010, Netflix plans to ensure existing markets are nearing profitability before expanding further. “We have got quite a bit of work to do to get the business back to global profitability,” Mr Sarandos said.Netflix’s UK and Ireland launch was undercut by an immediate price war with Lovefilm, as the Amazon-owned DVD and web video service undercut its new US rival’s £5.99 monthly price for unlimited online streaming by a pound. Lovefilm, which now has 2m subscribers in the UK, also plans to counter Netflix’s arrival with a new TV advertising campaign.The two companies have been competing fiercely for content deals in recent months, although analysts at IHS Screen Digest say both rely heavily on older TV and films.

Netflix has secured “tens of thousands of hours” of content from movie studios. However, it has no plans to launch its DVD rental service in the UK, which thanks to the success of the BBC iPlayer is seen as fertile ground for Netflix’s “over the top” video streaming.Netflix’s service is available on a wide range of smartphones, smart TV sets and games consoles, including some platforms from which Lovefilm is currently absent, such as Apple TV and Nintendo’s Wii. It also offers integration with Facebook to share what users are watching with friends and receive personalised recommendations, based on their own viewing habits and what their Facebook friends have seen.Netflix will be hoping to put a torrid 2011 behind it after a 60 per cent price increase prompted a customer exodus and an aborted attempt to rebrand its DVD rental service as “Qwikster”."
772;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-06T22:00:11Z;US stocks start year on front foot;Strong US data buoy markets;US stocks started the year on an upbeat note as economic data continued to surprise on the upside.By the close yesterday, the S&P 500 was 1.8 per cent higher over the week at 1,280.68, breaking above its 200-day moving average, an indication some investors think the rally has further to run.After opening lower on Wednesday and Thursday, the benchmark index turned positive each day as stocks gathered momentum, almost repeating the trick on Friday but closing down slightly.“At open, the market is still dominated by European fears,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers Investment Research. “But it’s a positive sign that bulls are tending to take charge on the realisation that the US economy appears to be improving faster than expected.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average produced a weekly gain of 1.2 per cent at 12,359.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.7 per cent to 2,674.22.Stocks along the hard disk drive supply chain rallied on higher than expected fourth-quarter shipments. Seagate Technology said it had dispatched 47m hard disk drives in the three months to January in a sign that flooding in Thailand affected production less than expected. Seagate climbed 11.6 per cent to $18.30, while rival manufacturer Western Digital rose 8.2 per cent to $33.49.Semiconductor manufacturers LSI Corp, up 12.9 per cent to $6.72, and Micron Technology, up 14.5 per cent to $7.21, rallied in anticipation of stronger demand for computer memory chips.Bank of America climbed 11.2 per cent to $6.18, topping $6 for the first time since November, on the back of its strongest one day gain since October on Thursday. Analysts struggled to explain the stellar performance, which came as Citigroup analysts slashed earnings estimates for BofA, citing costs to settle mortgage-related lawsuits. Some suggested arbitrageurs might be buying BofA shares after the cost of protecting against a default by the bank fell in December without a corresponding rally in the stock price.Talk of a possible government plan to boost the housing market sent shares in homebuilder PulteGroup up 12.5 per cent to $7.10.It might also have helped large mortgage lenders outperform – SunTrust was up 11.6 per cent to $19.75 and Hudson City Bank, a New Jersey-based mortgage lender, rose 9.3 per cent to $6.83. But investment banks, which do not originate mortgage loans, lagged behind the pack.Goldman Sachs was up just 3.3 per cent to $93.42 while Jefferies climbed only 0.7 per cent to $13.85. Douglas Sipkin, of Ticonderoga Securities, slashed his quarterly earnings forecast for Goldman to 97 cents a share from $4.12 and tipped Morgan Stanley for a 59 cents a share loss, citing the weak trading environment.But Mr Sipkin said US investment banks could benefit from “widening bid- ask spreads, driven by the major retrenchment of European competitors”.CME Group, the largest US exchange by market capitalisation, fell 4 per cent to $234.00 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 4.6 per cent to $115.01 as JPMorgan analysts downgraded both exchanges to neutral, arguing that the companies’ estimates appeared optimistic and might have to be revised down.MasterCard fell 8 per cent to $342.92 as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its “buy” recommendation on the stock as well as Visa.Chesapeake Energy climbed 7.6 per cent to $23.98 after concluding a $2.3bn joint venture with French oil giant Total and EnerVest for shale gas and oil exploration in Ohio.Investor reaction was initially muted but the stock rallied late in the week, when the company said it had used JV revenues to reduce debt by $1.4bn to $10.3bn in the fourth quarter.Devon Energy was up 4.4 per cent to $64.75 after concluding its own $2.5bn shale joint venture with China’s Sinopec. But refiners sold off sharply after Tesoro said it could post a fourth-quarter loss of up to 80 cents a share because of collapsing margins. Tesoro fell 1.8 per cent to $22.95 followed by rivals Marathon Petroleum, off 4.9 per cent to $31.66, and Valero Energy, down 3.2 per cent to $20.37.Tesoro cited the narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread from $26 a barrel to $8 a barrel over the quarter, which cut margins at its mid-continent refineries, which account for 17 per cent of capacity and have benefited from access to cheaper WTI.Holiday sales reporting from US retailers drove stocks in different directions were mixed. Gap fell 3 per cent to $18 after December sales came in 4 per cent lower than the previous year. Ross Stores, the discount clothing chain, rose 6.8 per cent to $50.74 on a 9 per cent increase in same-store sales that easily beat the consensus analyst forecast of 4.2 per cent.Barnes & Noble slumped 19.9 per cent to $11.61 after the company said it was considering a sale of its Nook e-reader business.Netflix climbed 22.3 per cent to $84.70 after the company said subscribers streamed 2bn hours of video on its website in the fourth quarter, although it did not provide data from previous quarters for comparison.Alcoa climbed 6 per cent to $9.17 over the week, before it kicks off fourth quarter reporting season on Monday.But the stock slipped 2 per cent on Friday after the aluminium producer said it was cutting global capacity by 12 per cent and idling smelters in response to falling aluminium prices. Several analysts are predicting a quarterly loss for the company on Monday.

774;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2012-01-06T19:15:30Z;Lovefilm ties in with ITV and BBC;;Lovefilm has struck its biggest television content deals to date with ITV and the BBC, as it races to sign up customers before the imminent UK launch of US rival Netflix.The new partnership with BBC Worldwide will see episodes of Doctor Who, Life on Mars and Spooks available to view “on demand” through Lovefilm’s website and iPad app, as well as games consoles and connected TVs which carry its app for big-screen viewing.ITV, which is working to find new sources of pay-TV revenue to reduce its dependence on advertising, has expanded an existing agreement with Lovefilm to bring additional shows including Cold Feet, Marchlands and Prime Suspect.The two broadcasters will together add hundreds of title’s to Lovefilm’s on-demand library. Simon Calver, chief executive of the Amazon-owned company, said the deals were the “icing on the cake of our Lovefilm Instant service”, complementing its movie rental service.“Partnering with Lovefilm’s Instant service is a great example of how ITV is starting to drive new revenue streams by distributing its content across multiple platforms,” said Martin Goswami, ITV’s director of pay and distribution.Lovefilm now has nearly 2m monthly subscribers to its DVD-delivery and internet service, which it hopes will provide a buffer to see off the challenge from Netflix, with which it is fighting for content deals and customers.Netflix has already secured shows from BBC Worldwide for its UK service, as well as film studios such as Lionsgate, Miramax and MGM, and the site is expected to go live later this month.But analysts say it will find the UK market much more competitive than its native US, with Tesco also entering the online video market recently with its acquisition of Blinkbox. Tesco has begun to combine digital copies with in-store sales of physical discs that can be watched on Blinkbox apps on Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console and Apple’s iPad tablet.Both Lovefilm and Netflix are also competing with British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media, the pay-TV companies who increasingly offer on-demand content through apps such as Sky Go.The UK’s digital movie rental market grew by 9 per cent last year, including pay-TV, according to estimates by IHS Screen Digest. Digital now accounts for almost half of the £400m video rental market.This week, the government launched an independent feasibility study led by Richard Hooper, former deputy chairman of media regulator Ofcom, on the creation of a new “digital copyright exchange” which could make it simpler for services such as Lovefilm and Netflix to secure content. The consultation follows the Hargreaves review, which suggested that the UK’s copyright regime was “not fit for purpose for the digital age”.

The S&P 500 closed at 1,277.3, less than a quarter of a point up for the day, with financials bearing the brunt of selling, off 0.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 0.9 per cent to $15.94, while the afterglow from Citigroup’s $2.5bn bond offering on Tuesday, its largest such debt issue since 2009, did not last long. Its shares fell 0.6 per cent to $28.17.The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.2 per cent to 12,418,42 and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat at 2,648.36, although the Nasdaq had opened sharply lower as technology stocks suffered.Ebay, the auction website, fell 3.8 per cent to $30.16 after Yahoopoached Scott Thompson from Ebay-owned PayPal as its new chief executive. Yahoo investors were unimpressed however, sending shares down 3.1 per cent to $15.78.Data storage company Netapp fell 3.1 per cent to $35.64 after a downgrade from Credit Suisse analysts, who tipped the company’s rate of market share growth to slow in 2012.Shares in Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, slumped 3.7 per cent to $97.48. The stock was a darling of internet investors in 2009 and 2010 as it saw rapid customer growth but Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein said the company may be unable to prize more market share from smaller rivals. “Looking forward, we believe it will become more difficult for Salesforce.com to grow,” Mr Moerdler wrote to clients.Netflix shares surged 11.4 per cent to $80.45, after the company said users had streamed 2bn hours of video from its website in the fourth quarter. However Netflix did not provide comparative figures for previous quarters.Cabot Oil & Gas climbed 7.2 per cent to $82.32 after the company raised its dividend 33 per cent to 16 cents a share and announced that it had doubled production in the Marcellus Shale during 2011. Separately, Cabot announced a two-for-one stock split.Shares of car vendor AutoNation fell 6.8 per cent to $33.26 after Edward Lampert’s ESL fund cut its stake in the company to 52.5 per cent from 56.4 per cent. Mr Lampert also reduced ESL’s stake in car parts retailer AutoZone to 12.6 per cent from 21.7 per cent, but after falling sharply at the open, shares recovered to close 2.2 per cent higher at $326.96.Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed 2.2 per cent to $348.75 after Goldman Sachs analysts added the fast food restaurant to its “conviction buy” list, tipping the company for earnings growth of 35-0 per cent this year as food costs fall, boosting margins.Shares in Chipotle rose almost 60 per cent in 2011 after more than doubling in value in 2010.Ford Motors rose 1.5 per cent to $11.30 as December sales rose 10 per cent, beating most analyst estimates. General Motors saw December sales growth of 5 per cent, which gave shares a 0.5 per cent fillip to $21.15. Both companies were left in the dust by Chrysler, which saw December sales leap 37 per cent compared with the previous year.Discount website Groupon fell 2.5 per cent to $18.79, significantly below the $20 offer price for its November IPO.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 3.1 per cent to $34.70 as the Commerce Department said a decision on additional tariffs for Chinese solar-equipment would be delayed by a month to mid-February.CF Industries was up 2.7 per cent to $157.99, after Citigroup analysts recommended the nitrogen fertiliser producer.""Given the recent slowdown in fertiliser sales, we now prefer nitrogen as our top nutrient – nitrogen cannot be stored in the ground so its application tends to be steady,” Citi analysts told clients. MasterCard, off 3.3 per cent to $356.25, and Visa, off 1.8 per cent to $101.15, both fell as Janney analysts said the “secular shift from paper [money] to card [spending]” may be complete, and removed its buy recommendations from both stocks.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare slid 5.4 per cent to $4.69, as investors continued to fret about long-term government funding for Medicare after Citigroup downgraded the sector on Tuesday."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year up 5.5 per cent to 12,217.56, although a few big stocks skew the price-weighted index. Only the Nasdaq Composite index fell over the year, 1.8 per cent to 2,605.15.The worst performing stocks tell the macro stories that preoccupied investors this year.First Solar, down 74 per cent for the year to $33.76, has seen a lucrative market for solar panels disrupted first by a glut of supply from China and second by a threatened collapse in demand from the eurozone, as governments cut back on subsidies.Computer Sciences Corp, the IT services company that fell 52.2 per cent to $23.70, has been hit by reduced government spending on outsourcing, most recently the cancellation of a contract by the UK’s National Health Service.Alpha Natural Resources, down 66 per cent to to $20.43, and US Steel Corp, off 54.7 per cent to $26.46, have been two of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, moving 2 per cent for every percentage point move in the benchmark index.Their share prices have waxed and waned with sentiment about Chinese growth and demand for steel, which US Steel Corp makes and Alpha’s metallurgical coal is needed to manufacture, from the country’s construction industry.Homebuilder stocks rallied on resilient US economic data. Lennar Corp and DR Horton, which had seen their market capitalisations more than halve by October, ended the year up 4.9 per cent to $19.66 and 5.7 per cent to $12.61 respectively, as US construction starts and pending home sales data turned positive in November.Among the big fallers only Netflix, down 60.5 per cent to $69.29 from a peak above $200, seemed little affected by macro events. The web-streaming company, the darling of internet investors in 2010, was undone by a decision to raise prices for users who wanted to continue using its physical DVD delivery service, and an aborted attempt to spin off the DVD business altogether.Moving from individual stocks to sectors, one theme dominated the year: the collapse of financials. Down 18.4 per cent for the year, 7 percentage points more than any other sector, their weighting in the S&P 500 has slipped to just 13 per cent, barely above consumer staples, energy or healthcare stocks.The four companies which have weighed most heavily on the index – Bank of America, down 58.3 per cent to $5.56, Citigroup, 44.4 per cent to $26.31, Goldman Sachs, 46.2 per cent to $90.43 and JPMorgan Chase, 21.6 per cent to $33.25 – were all banks. Between them they wiped more than 23 points off the S&P 500, equivalent to 2 per cent of the index at the start of the year.“Looking ahead banks are not necessarily key to a rally in US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research, “but they could certainly be the cause of a bear market, if they were to fall fast again.”At the other end of the spectrum investors cheered the boom in shale oil, and the prospects it offers for US energy independence.Cabot Oil & Gas saw its market capitalisation double as its share closed the year at $75.90, as the company increased revenues from oil by 50 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, compared with the same period in 2010.But it was solid performances by mega-caps which had the most market impact. Apple drove the S&P 500 significantly more than any other stock, giving the index an eight point boost, as its share price climbed 25.6 per cent over the year to $405.00. ExxonMobil’s 15.9 per cent move to $84.76 gave the S&P 500 another six points, while IBM boosted the index five points, as it rose 25.3 per cent to $183.88.
777;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Old media champions turn on and tune in;;The third most-shared news article on Facebook this year was a CNN story titled “No, your zodiac sign hasn’t changed.” It barely bested another CNN piece, “Parents, don’t dress your girls like tramps.”That such inconsequential articles are the most popular content on Facebook might seem to confirm stereotypes – idle users are simply looking for entertainment to pass the time.But while the content of these viral stories may be frivolous, 2011 was the year that music, film and print media companies became serious about using Facebook.Previous inhibitions about engaging with unpredictable, user-generated content were set aside and media companies today are looking for ways to use social networks to find new audiences, increase time spent with their products and make money.The Washington Post Company was among the most experimental of the old media companies on Facebook this year, launching its Social Reader application. A news aggregator that features Washington Post content, as well as stories from other sites, it suggests stories based on what your friends have read.“News today is editor-centric, what we’ve built is a friends-centric reader experience,” says Vijay Ravindran, chief digital officer at the Washington Post. “It starts with the simple premise that if you could see what your friends are reading, the news would be more interesting.”Social Reader already has 5m users, with 83 per cent of readers under the age of 35. “It is very different than the audience that comes to WashingtonPost.com,” adds Mr Ravindran.Other social news applications were developed by The Independent, Yahoo News, and the Guardian. Many of the most popular stories viewed via The Independent’s application turned out to be from the 1990s, so it has helped to breathe new life into older content.“Our vision is that every industry has the possibility to be transformed by social,” says Dan Rose, Facebook’s vice-president of platform marketing. “We started with photos and then games, and now we’re starting to see disruption around music and news.”Perhaps the biggest social success story for the media this year came with Spotify, the music streaming service that now requires a Facebook subscription to sign up. With billionaire Sean Parker an investor in both companies, Spotify rose to prominence since it launched in the US earlier this year.“We believe that music is the most powerful social object and now we believe that there are going to be more serendipitous moments where you discover things about people, like, for example, that I have really crappy 1980s music tastes,” Daniel Ek, Spotify chief executive said earlier this year.Austin Haugen, a product manager at Facebook who works with media companies, says: “They’ve shifted the mindset of discovering music from this editorial, curated thing of ‘here are the top 40 songs right now’, to ‘here’s what your friends are listening to right now’.”Movie and television producers have been slower to embrace Facebook and social media, beyond letting users share links to their products. But some studios began letting Facebook users stream films on the site this year, with blockbusters such as Inception and The Dark Knight available to view for about $3.This year Netflix allowed users around the world to publish their rental habits on Facebook, except in the US where an arcane law prohibits the sharing of video rental profiles. User-generated content video sites such as YouTube and Vimeo allow their content to be embedded in Facebook users’ news feeds.Facebook is so far unperturbed when it comes to making money from media companies. “Everything outside of games is experimentation when it comes to monetisation,” says Mr Rose.And while Spotify is already making significant money from advertisers, publishers are taking the long view. “There will be a time to think about monetisation, but we made a commitment early on to let this experiment run,” says Mr Ravindran.Yet as companies such as The Washington Post and Spotify show real results by embracing social media, it may not be long before more music, film and news companies begin to embrace Facebook.“Media is the category we’re excited about right now,” says Mr Rose. “We’re seeing a lot experimentation.”
778;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-27T18:52:15Z;Tech sector: prize blunders;Picking top performers has been a challenge but three finalists stand out;"Soulless technology marches relentlessly forward; decidedly human corporate management staggers about, often in the wrong direction. Plenty of tech companies proved this true in 2011. Picking the worst blunderers is a challenge but three finalists stand out.Start with Reed Hastings, founder and chief executive of Netflix. A huge price increase presented as “great value”, the announcement and withdrawal of an inane brand break-up and an expensive international push just as higher spending crimps profits at home. Busy year! But none of it fully explains the drop in Netflix’s market capitalisation from $9bn to $4bn. The real problems were a stock driven too high by momentum-chasers and the fact that Netflix occupies a spot in the distribution chain where only a modest amount of value is added. Neither is the fault of Mr Hastings.Research in Motion’s shares have dropped even more dramatically, and Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, the bosses, have been accused of fiddling while RIM burns. The company has missed its own financial projections, new products have been delayed, a service outage infuriated customers and the PlayBook tablet (released, astoundingly for a company built on email, without a native email application) flopped. But it must be remembered how hard it is to halt the decline in a handset company once it falls behind the competition. RIM’s collapse looks much like Nokia’s and Motorola’s before it.Ahead by a nose, then, are the 2011 tech mismanagement champions: Hewlett-Packard’s bosses. The board and (until last September) Leo Apotheker, chief executive, pushed towards services and software but made no progress, signed off on an absurdly pricey acquisition of Autonomy and announced the separation of the personal computer business without having a plan in place to achieve it. Mr Apotheker is gone, but Meg Whitman, his successor, looks like a risky choice. HP’s 40 per cent share price drop, representing $34bn in lost market value, seals the victory.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
779;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-27T18:46:47Z;Amazon leads holiday online retailers poll;Netflix losing appeal after tough year;Amazon has extended its lead in customer satisfaction rankings over Netflix and other US ecommerce groups, as winners and losers begin to emerge from a generally strong holiday season for online retailers.A poll of 8,500 consumers for Foresee, a customer satisfaction consultancy, found that Amazon scored 88 out of 100 on its index, a two-point advance to the highest score of any retailer in the seven years since the survey began.Netflix, by contrast, dropped seven points to 79 after a bruising year in which a 60 per cent price rise and an abortive attempt to split its DVD rental business from its online streaming service lost it more than 1m subscribers and left its shares down more than 60 per cent from the end of 2010.“Netflix totally misread its customer base and is paying the price, damaging its brand among both consumers and investors,” said Larry Freed, ForeSee’s chief executive. “Customer satisfaction is predictive, which means that Netflix’s financial woes may be just beginning,” he added: “If satisfaction drops significantly, a revenue drop is likely to follow.”Shares in Netflix were down $2.27 or 3.1 per cent at $70.35 in lunchtime trading on Tuesday, while Amazon shares slipped 60 cents or 0.3 per cent to $176.68.The two companies, which for several years enjoyed similarly high customer service scores, are coming into more direct competition as Amazon builds up digital media streaming services to supply content to its Kindle devices and to compensate for declining sales of the physical books, CDs and DVDs on which Jeff Bezos first began to build the business.ForeSee’s study found that Gap’s clothing site and Overstock.com, which sells discounted merchandise, suffered declines of six points and five points respectively in the customer satisfaction rankings. JC Penney, under the new leadership of former Apple executive Ron Johnson, recorded one of the biggest gains, up six points to 83.The survey found that US online shoppers are less price sensitive than in past years, with consumers citing price as their top priority for just one of the top 40 sites it measured. Instead, the range and quality of merchandise was cited as the priority by shoppers at 25 sites.Analysts expect another year of strong growth for e-commerce sites. The National Retail Federation reported that US consumers intended to spend about 36 per cent of their holiday budgets online, up from 32.7 per cent a year ago.IBM has predicted 9.5-10 per cent growth in December online sales, and said Christmas Day sales rose 16.5 per cent year on year, while early estimates from ComScore pointed to a 15 per cent advance over 2010 and a Shop.org survey found that 68 per cent of retailers expected at least 15 per cent growth in holiday season online sales year-on-year.
780;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-22T20:05:33Z;Internet disintermediation;The joke is on internet shopkeepers after action by US comic Louis C.K.;After the vigorously profane American comic Louis C.K. decided to produce and distribute his latest concert himself, he said he hoped the experiment would work “so I can have s***loads of money”. It worked. At $5 a download straight from Mr C.K.’s website, the show, which cost $250,000 to make, grossed over $1m over 12 days.A few other entertainers, notably the rock band Radiohead, have tried going direct to fans, but none has been as transparent as C.K. The implications of his financial success for companies in the traditional distribution chain are significant but they depend on where they sit.Movie studios and TV networks can afford to shrug. Only artists with a cult-like following in a limited number of genres (comedy and music first among them) could pull this off. In most cases, financing, production wherewithal, advertising skill and distribution muscle are essential to large-scale, profitable productions.Cable, satellite and telecoms companies that pipe media into homes should be fine too. The physical infrastructure they pay billions to install and maintain is indispensable. As more entertainment is consumed from the internet rather than through cable channels, they will have to adjust their pricing models, but that seems feasible.The likes of Netflix, Amazon and Apple’s iTunes, which play an intermediate role as content agglomerators, have more reason to sweat. The website C.K. used to push his product cost him only $32,000 and was immediately capable of handling huge volume. There will always be second-tier products that require the benefit of a busy virtual store to sell but any entertainers or organisations with a loyal following already in place can now distribute their content seamlessly, without giving a cut to anyone, for next to nothing. For internet shopkeepers, the joke is on them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

But the uncertain outlook for equities may preclude investors from betting on a rebound in their performance from next month.A popular investment strategy at the start of January is to buy beaten-down stocks from the prior year in the hope that their prices rise in value as they revert to their long-term average.“The market dynamics of the ‘January effect’ assume that capital essentially cycles out of single stock losing names in December and then returns in the first month of the new year,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group.But there is plenty of caution about embracing such a strategy at this juncture.“The operative word about the January effect is January, not February and March,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “It’s a contrary strategy and best used for a short time.”One sector that has led declines this year and was again leading the broad market lower on Monday is financials. The S&P sector has lost 23 per cent this year but a number of financials have done far worse, led by Bank of America, down 63 per cent, Genworth Financial, lower by 56 per cent, AIG, off 54 per cent, and Citibank, down 48 per cent.Concern that US banks may be hurt by exposure to the eurozone have been compounded by regulatory changes , including proposed higher capital requirements, wholesale derivatives markets reform, and pending rules that will restrict trading activities.“The uncertainties over the European sovereign debt and financial crises are unlikely to abate in January,” adds Mr Colas. “If you are going to play this strategy in December 2011, you will need courage and/or foolhardiness in spades.”Other badly performing stocks have included the steel producers, US Steel, down 59 per cent, and AK Steel, off 54 per cent. High-profile technology companies, such as Netflix, down 62 per cent, and First Solar, lower by 77 per cent, have also been notable laggards this year.Looking at the list of the worst-performing stocks, David Kelly, chief markets strategist for the JPMorgan Funds, sees little reason for broad-based enthusiasm.“For the most part, these are stories not about the economy or particular sectors but about the management of the company,” he said.
782;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-14T23:58:05Z;NFL strikes $24bn deal with trio of broadcasters;Games rank among the most popular broadcasts;The National Football League has renewed its deals with three big free-to-air US broadcasters in a move that will cement its games as the most popular, and most expensive, programming on television today.The NFL will earn an estimated $24bn over nine years as CBS, Comcast’s NBC and News Corp’s Fox continue to show games through to the 2022 season, an unusually long duration for such deals that signals the importance of live sports to the broadcast networks.The networks will each pay the NFL between $950m and $1.1bn a year starting in 2014. Those fees come on top of existing deals the NFL has with ESPN, owned by Disney, and DirecTV, the satellite television provider. Taken together, the NFL is poised to take in about $6bn from broadcast rights each year, starting in 2014.“ The National Football League is the greatest television property in the world,” said David Hill, chairman of Fox Sports Media Group.The deals, when added together, represent an increase of nearly 65 per cent over the current agreements. Earlier this year, ESPN extended its contract for the NFL’s premiere Monday Night Football programme at a cost of $15.2bn for eight years, a 70 per cent increase over its previous deal.Prices for sports rights have been rising quickly as live events continue to be a big draw for viewers and advertisers in the age of on-demand shows and Netflix. Yet the fees have become so high that many wonder whether such deals make economic sense.“The rights fees are rising surprisingly fast,” said Adam Chase of Dow Lohnes, a law firm specialising in sports and media. “I’m not so sure they will be anything other than pure loss leaders.”NFL games consistently rank among the most popular broadcasts each week they air, according to Nielsen. “The NFL will beat anything,” said Mr Chase. “It is the most DVR-proof, the most – ‘you need to see it when it happens’ – thing there is. Nothing takes the place of live sports.”The agreements will also see the Super Bowl rotate among the three free-to-air broadcast networks. This year’s Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers was the most watched US programme ever, drawing 111m viewers. “No other franchise delivers ratings the way an NFL game does,” said Les Moonves, CBS chief executive.The NFL is the only one of the major US sports leagues that makes so much of its content available on free-to-air networks. “These agreements underscore the NFL’s unique commitment to broadcast television that no other sport has,” said Roger Goodell, NFL commissioner.The deals do not cover international rights to air the NFL. “It’s tough to say why America loves football so much,” said Mr Chase. “Especially when no other country does.”
783;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-14T18:44:38Z;ViaSat launch targets rural US web demand;;A newly launched $250m satellite will soon start transmitting broadband internet to rural US consumers the latest effort by telecommunications groups to satisfy skyrocketing demand for high speed residential data services.The new satellite from ViaSat will give the Nasdaq-listed company, based in California, the ability to effectively compete with other non-premium internet providers, which still are the only options for millions of US consumers.Its bandwidth will also be used to power the in-flight wireless internet service for JetBlue, the US carrier.The ViaSat launch is likely to be welcomed by the Federal Communications Commission, which is pushing for solutions to the digital divide, especially in rural areas. “If we have a really good service at a reasonable price, we can keep expanding the market,” said Mark Dankberg, ViaSat’s chief executive. “Satellite will be better for a lot of people than DSL, 3G or 4G.”While most satellites are primarily used for one-way broadcasting, ViaSat-1 will be able to handle the two-way transmission of data at 140 gigabytes per second. That is more bandwidth than the combined capacity of Intelsat and SES, ViaSat’s two largest peers, Mr Dankberg said.Intelsat, the world’s largest provider of fixed satellite services, recently outlined plans to invest $1.3bn in four new satellite launches by the end of 2012.ViaSat, in October successfully launched its new ViaSat-1, one of the highest capacity data satellites in the world. Launched with a Proton rocket in Kazakhstan, the satellite is now in geosynchronous orbit 22,500 miles above the earth. It is powered by 100 meter wide solar panels. Including launch costs and insurance, the satellite cost ViaSat $400m.Mr Dankberg conceded that his industry faces an uphill battle. “Satellite doesn’t have a good reputation for broadband service,” he said.Moreover, WildBlue, the consumer facing service ViaSat acquired in 2009, has not upgraded its service, even as the use of data intensive services such as Netflix and Hulu has increased. “Wild Blue hasn’t changed its service for six years,” he said. “That isn’t considered a good value anymore.”ViaSat had revenues of $223m in the most recent quarter with net income of just $8m. Shares in the company are up 16 per cent over the past month to about $47, giving it a market capitalisation of $2bn.Its Wild Blue service has about 400,000 customers in the US paying about $50 per month for satellite internet services. Mr Dankberg hopes to treble the number of subscribers in the coming year with capacity from the new satellite. The company also makes money by supplying components to other satellite makers, and selling services to companies and the US government.One of ViaSat’s customers is Dish Networks, the satellite TV provider, which resells its service to US consumers. Earlier this year Dish’s parent company, EchoStar, acquired Hughes Communications, a ViaSat rival, a move that could see Dish drop ViaSat as a supplier.

It said demand would return to normal in the first half of 2012.But not all analysts were convinced. “We believe Intel somewhat over-shipped real end-demand in the second and third quarters,” Tristan Gerra, a tech analyst at Baird, told clients.“Our field research points to 10 to 15 per cent excess CPU [Intel chips] inventories at PC manufacturers in the third quarter.”Mr Gerra said Intel could face low demand until the third quarter of 2012.Elsewhere, broad markets traded sharply lower as investors reassessed the eurozone deal announced on Friday. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent to 1,236.47, although the index had fallen as low as 1,227 before a late rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 12,021.54 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.3 per cent to 2,612.26.“Participants didn’t want to be short last week, because the risk was to the upside in case the summit came up with a game-changing announcement,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors. “Now investors are more willing to exit, and they’re telling us European leaders didn’t do enough.”Cyclical bank and material stocks led the fallers, with Morgan Stanley off 6.1 per cent to $15.38 and Alpha Natural Resources falling 8.8 per cent to $21.39.Citigroup also fell 5.4 per cent to $27.22 and Bank of America fell 4.7 per cent to $5.45, even though Richard Ramsden, Goldman Sachs’ US banks analyst, was broadly positive on the sector after Goldman’s bank conference last week.Mr Ramsden told clients that conference participants had pointed to strong growth in commercial and industrial loans, and suggested all major US banks would pass tougher Fed stress tests.Salesforce.com, which develops cloud-based software for businesses, fell 6.3 per cent to $116.07. Peter Goldmacher, a tech analyst at Cowen, said rapid sales growth, which has seen the market cap of the company explode since 2009, might be coming to an end.“Billings growth is the primary metric that drives Salesforce and we believe normalised billings growth is slowing faster than expectations,” Mr Goldmacher told clients. He also criticised management for offering low visibility on performance metrics, and said a move to annual rather than monthly billing would inflate revenue in the short term, but could drive away smaller customers who “prefer more favourable payment terms”.Diamond Foods’ prospective takeover of Pringles from Procter & Gamble appeared to be on ice again, as the group failed to publish its quarterly earnings report on schedule, as its auditor investigates allegations of inappropriate payments to walnut growers.Shares were down 22.8 per cent to $31.30.Vulcan Materials was the standout performer in the S&P 500. Shares rose 15.4 per cent to $39.48, after its smaller rival, Martin Marietta, launched a hostile takeover, offering half a share of its own stock for each Vulcan share. Martin Marietta climbed 1.7 per cent to $74.61.M&A hopes helped Netflix to a 6.2 per cent gain. Shares climbed to $75.26 on chatter than Amazon or Verizon could make a play for the video-streaming website, which has seen its share price fall from more than $300 this year.Apple provided ballast for tech shares, falling just 0.5 per cent to $391.84, as Brian White, analyst at Ticonderoga, said the iPhone maker had its best November on record with sales up 17 per cent month on month.Lockheed Martin bucked the market, falling just 0.7 per cent to $74.61 after the Pentagon said it had placed a $4bn order for 30F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.Edwards Lifesciences climbed 5.1 per cent to $67.85, on the back of upgrades from several analysts. A Morgan Keegan noted pointed to the group’s strong product pipeline and prospects in China.General Motors fell 1.7 per cent to $20.80, relatively unaffected by a decision to halt production of its Chevrolet Cruze at its Lordstown plant, which GM blamed on a supplier issue.

786;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-07T21:01:23Z;BSkyB hits back at pay-TV film rights proposal;;British Sky Broadcasting has hit back at the Competition Commission’s proposals to break up its “control” over pay-TV movie rights, arguing that new online entrants to the UK market such as Netflix and Amazon’s Lovefilm obviate the need for intervention.Earlier this year the Competition Commission found that BSkyB’s exclusive deals to show Hollywood movies on subscription pay-TV, and the “excess profits” resulting from them, stopped rivals offering competing services.In August the commission put forward potential remedies to the restriction on competition, including preventing BSkyB from striking deals with all six major Hollywood studios at the same time and breaking up the bundling of broadcast and digital distribution rights.In its response, published on Wednesday, BSkyB says the commission’s ruling is “insufficiently supported by relevant evidence” and “manifestly flawed”.“The CC’s inquiry has not sufficiently considered the competition for such rights posed by new internet distributors, such as Amazon, Lovefilm and Netflix,” BSkyB told the commission. Amazon and Netflix’s deep pockets meant there was no barrier to them bidding against BSkyB for Hollywood content, the satellite broadcaster said, and the regulator’s failure to consider online players was “unfair to Sky” in restricting the scope of its inquiry to broadcast rivals such as BT and Virgin Media.Netflix, which plans to launch in the UK next year, has already signed subscription deals with studios including Lionsgate and MGM, while Lovefilm has recently carved out a new exclusive window for streaming rights with Warner Bros.BSkyB offers films such as Disney Pixar’s animation Up to customers both through a “linear” broadcast over satellite and, to customers with newer set-top boxes, on-demand delivered over the internet.The broadcaster says that in homes with the capabilities a larger proportion of movies are watched “time-shifted” – on-demand or recorded using Sky Plus.Virgin Media, in an October meeting with the regulator, “welcomed and commended” the Competition Commission’s provisional findings, arguing for a “structural remedy”.Blinkbox, acquired by Tesco earlier this year, said restricting the number of studios from which BSkyB could licence content would make it “much easier” to acquire such rights and compete with Sky Movies.In recent weeks the Competition Commission has been consulting on further possible remedies. It plans to publish its provisional decisions in February.
787;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-07T21:00:41Z;Verizon: going over-the-top;The company is eyeing the launch of an internet-based video streaming service;As the options for consuming video proliferate, it can look as if chaos is breaking out in the television industry. But the laws of economics still apply. The latest wrinkle is a report that Verizon is considering offering an internet-based video streaming service similar to those offered by Netflix and Amazon. Verizon’s boss, Lowell McAdam, confirmed on Wednesday that such an “over-the-top” offering could be part of his company’s video strategy.It is superficially surprising that a company that sells a cable-like subscription video package, and has recently entered into cross-selling agreements with cable companies, wants to stream video directly. Is Verizon conceding that the traditional bundled video subscription must ultimately give way to à la carte video delivered over the internet? It is not.Bear in mind the massive gulf between services such as Netflix’s, at $8 a month or less, and cable, costing $100 a month or more. In the latest quarter, the top six cable and satellite TV providers generated $20bn in video revenue (this figure does not include sales to the 7.5m video subscribers at Verizon and AT&T). Netflix did $800m in sales.The companies that make the content, from Time Warner to Disney, know where the real money is, and will not make their best products available to distributors that threaten to kill the golden goose. The over-the-toppers get older shows and movies, and no sports at all, and they simply could not afford the hottest content while charging what they do. Netflix is spending $1bn-$2bn a year on programming, which sounds like a lot until you remember that, for example, the cable network ESPN will be spending over $2bn a year on football alone.Simply put, Verizon is happy to get into over-the-top because it is – for now – hardly a competitor to the much bigger business of piping bundled channels into homes.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
788;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-05T21:12:12Z;Online piracy: A cyber gangplank sought;In emerging markets, where profitable online business models take time to develop, big companies are still exposed to lose billions in revenues;"When Mexican police raided some suspicious warehouses in Mexico City in May, they were not going after cocaine laboratories or marijuana farms. Instead they uncovered an enormous media counterfeiting operation, seizing 1,000 DVD burners, 12 tonnes of blank discs and thousands of copies of Hollywood movies and computer programs.The raid was a victory for local law enforcement in a nation that is one of the largest producers and consumers of pirated goods. But it also highlights the evolving nature of the threat to media and software groups: while police may have seized thousands of discs, piracy in emerging economies is shifting to the web, where an ever-faster internet has made it increasingly simple to download movies, music and software illegally.For more than a decade, big media and technology groups have been grappling with global piracy. What be­gan in the 1990s as a trickle of copied films captured with camcorders be­came a torrent of counterfeit discs as cheap DVD players and copiers flooded the market in the 2000s. With high-speed internet becoming accessible around the world, it is increasingly simple for anyone with a computer to download illicit, high-quality versions of virtually any music, film or software.“Ninety per cent of our stuff is being viewed without compensation to us in most developing countries,” says Jeff Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, which makes movies including the Harry Potter films.Today, emerging markets-based “rogue sites” that facilitate piracy are the targets of proposed US laws aimed at reducing counterfeiting. However, the bills are pitting content creators, led by record labels and movie studios, against technology companies such as Google and Facebook that host content and link to other sites. The technology sector fears the laws – which would push advertisers and payment processors to stop doing business with rogue sites, and prevent internet service providers from linking to them – would land it with unfair liabilities and disrupt the basic workings of the web. In addition, some argue such laws are un­likely to prove effective when so many originators and consumers of counterfeit material operate beyond their reach.Yet media companies say drastic problems require drastic solutions. According to a report by the Social Science Research Council, a US-based think-tank, in Russia 81 per cent of movies not watched in cinemas are pirated. More than half the software installed on Brazilian computers is illegal. And in India, 55 per cent of music is obtained by consumers who have not paid for it. The result is billions in lost revenues each year for big content creators, including software groups. The software industry estimates annual losses at more than $50bn; the movie business estimates $6.1bn in annual losses in its most recent report. And the record industry puts losses to piracy at $5bn a year.While the methodology of such accounting is often disputed – not every illegal copy should be counted as a lost sale, and a relatively small number of people account for a large share of illegal downloads – the growing spectre of piracy, especially in emerging markets, has put media and software groups on the defensive. “You can’t compete with free,” says Rick Cotton, general counsel for NBC Universal, which makes movies such as the Bourne series. “If the current trends continue, it will undermine our ability to invest in new content.”The idea that piracy might become so pervasive it could disrupt an entire industry’s business model is not far-fetched. The revenues of the record business have halved in the past 10 years, since swapping MP3s became commonplace. Software and movie groups are seeking to avoid the same fate. “When broadband penetration and quality increases, piracy inc­reases,” says Kevin Suh of the Motion Picture Association of America.Be it The Pirate Bay from Sweden, Russia’s Rutracker or Demonoid from Ukraine, such sites have become infamous sources of unauthorised music, film and software downloads, serving users in their home nations and round the globe who take advantage of an internet with few national borders.The US has only one law designed to address copyright infringement on the web. The 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act criminalises wilful copy­right breaches but gives safe harbour to technology companies that remove offending content once notified. However, it has failed to prevent large-scale piracy, a growing amount of which is originated and consumed in areas outside US authorities’ reach.In its most prominent test case, Viacom, owner of Paramount Pictures and MTV, sued Google’s YouTube for $1bn in 2007, alleging the video-sharing site was facilitating illegal viewing of its content, even though it had taken some offending clips down. The courts sided with Google, citing the DMCA’s safe harbour protections. Viacom is appealing, but the case prompted YouTube to put in place much more effective measures to prevent users from uploading copyrighted material.But as counterfeiting evolves, the law looks increasingly ineffective. “The DMCA was designed for an internet where there were only isolated cases of piracy, and they were stateside,” says Frederick Huntsberry, chief operating officer of Paramount Pictures. “Right now the guys you’re fighting are overseas. The volume is so large that you can’t file enough lawsuits.” For example, piracy is moving rapidly online as access to high-speed internet spreads in countries such as Mexico, Brazil and India.…Millions of potential customers in such markets look likely to gain access to the web in the next decade – and the prospect of many growing used to downloading content for free has led media companies to scramble for new ways to stem piracy.The most sweeping, and controversial, new pieces of legislation are the bills making their way through US Congress. The Stop Online Piracy Act, and the related Protect Intellectual Property Act, would allow copyright owners to seek court orders to block advertising and payment companies from working with infringing sites. They would also push technology companies to block links to illegal content. “To say that there should be free access to sites dedicated to breaking the law is wrong,” says Mr Cotton.But when the House of Representatives heard arguments for the bill last month, technology companies protested, saying it would roll back the DMCA’s safe harbour protections. “We are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry’s continued record of innovation and job creation,” said a coalition including Google, Facebook and AOL.One clause in the Senate bill is drawing particular scrutiny. It would require ISPs to block access to infringing sites, which could include the likes of Google, Facebook and any site that links to offending content. So-called “domain name system blocking” is used to censor the internet in China, and its implementation in the US would make it easy for companies – or governments – to block sites of which they do not approve.Rebecca MacKinnon of the New America Foundation, a US-based think-tank, who specialises in free expression on the web, said the legislation “would strengthen China’s Great Firewall and even bring major features of it to America”.But just as web-savvy Chinese are able to get around the Great Firewall, so too could American downloaders skirt new US laws. “It is not likely that DNS filtering would be effective in blocking US access to targeted foreign websites,” says Leonard Napolitano of Sandia National Laboratories, a US government research facility.A review of the impact of DNS blocking prompted the Business Software Alliance, a lobby group that initially supported the bills, to withdraw support. Vint Cerf, one of the internet’s founders and now a Google executive, says: “Even our own government is beginning to go overboard in the protection of copy­right.”Media executives say they are sensitive to such views. However, says Mr Cotton: “There is a confusion between freedom of expression and lawlessness. There is simply no way you can have the broadband internet be a pillar of the 21st century and have it be a lawless Wild West environment.”…It remains disconcertingly simple to illegally download music but the record industry seems to have turned a corner. US recorded music sales are up year-to-date for the first time in six years. This turnround is the result of a concerted effort to take down the most egregious file-sharing sites, such as LimeWire, which was closed last year, making it harder for casual users to pirate music. It is also a testament to the mainstream success of digital business models such as that of Apple’s iTunes store.While legislative efforts in France, the UK, the US and other countries re­main uncoordinated, pressure from media companies to hold ISPs and search engines liable for facilitating access to offending content – and looking to governments for stronger enforcement – is emerging as a common theme. Perhaps even more effective than legislation, say media companies, is co-operation by governments. They point to South Korea, where online piracy has plummeted in recent years after Seoul stepped up enforcement.Partnerships with local media companies can prove effective, too. When NBC broadcast the Olympics in 2008 it worked closely with CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, to deter illegal online broadcasting of the Games. It worked. Beijing monitored sites and fined infringers, resulting in minimal unauthorised viewing.For media companies, the Holy Grail is digital business models that let them sell their products for profit to new emerging market consumers. There are signs of progress. US video streaming website Netflix is moving into Latin America. Cable companies such as the Discovery and Time Warner channels have found limited success with free-to-air television supported by advertising in both Latin America and eastern Europe.Legislation, co-operation and new business models will go only so far, however. The reality for media and software companies is that they are playing catch-up with a web that has outrun their ability to control it. consumers have come to expect movies, music and computer programs when they want them, where they want them and how they want them. And in emerging markets, where profitable online business models take time to develop, big companies are still exposed to lost revenues to the tune of billions each year.“The main form of access to media goods in emerging economics remains the pirate market,” says Joe Karaganis, who this year wrote a report on the subject for the SSRC. “Legal channels are all but unavailable, and those that are, are priced at US or European levels. New technology and no affordable alternatives leads to piracy.”"
789;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-12-04T16:30:54Z;Bewkes relaxed over Time Warner prospects;;Halfway through a professorial two-hour analysis of what the digital future holds for Time Warner’s film, television and magazine properties in the age of Netflix, cord-cutting and the iPad, Jeff Bewkes gives a rare pithy summary.“This is all working just fine,” he says, capturing a mood that surprises some analysts at a time of upheaval for media owners. In an office overlooking Central Park, decorated with pictures of Brigitte Bardot and Frank Sinatra, Time Warner’s chairman and chief executive is coming out swinging.Leaning back in his chair, he dismisses the idea that digital distributors such as Apple and Amazon threaten Time Warner’s business model, arguing that their platforms are useless without its content.“What power do they have over us? They have to have us on their devices,” he says. Consumers can find Time Warner brands from CNN to People magazine on iPads and iPhones without the iTunes store’s controversial subscription service, he notes.Time Inc is the only large US magazine owner not to sell subscriptions through Apple, and Mr Bewkes is withering about others who accept its terms. Publishers are allowing their subscribers to become “subscribers to Apple Corporation. I’d question where that’s headed,” he says.The iPad’s arrival both excited publishers and left them wary of Apple’s control, but Mr Bewkes argues that iTunes, despite having details of more than 200m credit cards, gives Apple little power. “All you’re down to now is whether having a store is essential. No. Of course not,” he says: “Don’t confuse the tablet with the store.”Referring to digital doomsayers who also predicted television’s demise in favour of new services from Netflix to Google’s YouTube, he adds wryly: “We’ve been misunderstood all along.”It is more than two years since Mr Bewkes announced his big bet on TV Everywhere, which lets cable and satellite subscribers watch programmes from the likes of TNT and Cartoon Network on various devices, and some analysts are frustrated that it is not yet more widespread.He insists that it has been “the fastest digital roll-out, faster than [digital video recorders], faster than [video on demand]”. With agreement from all large media owners and distributors to make content available online for no extra charge, “it’s all falling into the right place”.Time Warner’s HBO Go service, which has put shows such as Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones on 5m iPads, has been the most successful use of TV Everywhere to date, with 98m programmes streamed.But even HBO Go is still unavailable through some cable operators including Time Warner Cable, which Mr Bewkes spun off in 2009. “They’re not doing well at promoting TV Everywhere,” he concedes, adding that we are a long way from seeing most TV shows and films delivered over the internet, with less than 2 per cent of all viewing now happening online.After a detailed lecture on network technologies and data compression standards, he explains that the infrastructure cannot support vast volumes of online entertainment for the price of a cable video package. “You can’t deliver what everybody thinks is the new internet for 30 to 70 bucks a month. It’s too expensive,” he says. “We got rid of [Time Warner Cable] because of this.”Judged by its audience, Netflix would be the 50th biggest channel on cable, he notes, yet it already accounts for 35 per cent of US downstream internet traffic at peak times. “You can’t run the programming industry of the future over a two-lane road system,” he says.Consumers will have to pay more for faster digital highways, he warns, sending broadband prices higher. Yet he sees little sign of price sensitivity among entertainment customers.“People always think, ‘shouldn’t people be trying to get their TV bill down from $80 a month to $40 a month’.” But, much as they still pay extra for Starbucks coffee, for example, viewers can be irrational when it comes to Brad Pitt and Harry Potter, he says.Asked about economic turmoil in Europe, Mr Bewkes admits that he is “mindful” of it, saying that “we’ve either got not-so-good or bad as the outlook [for Europe]”. But with little advertising exposure in the region, Time Warner has not felt the need for sharp strategic changes.If economic upheavals have not shaken his confidence, it is because Time Warner faces fewer doubters than when Netflix, Hulu and Apple left analysts starry-eyed. Its shares have performed in the middle of the media pack this year, but beaten the wider market.“There’s been a tremendous amount of wishful thinking going on,” says the man who once likened the threat from Netflix to that from the Albanian army. New subscription video-on-demand services with little or no profit cannot outbid highly profitable media companies such as HBO for content, he adds, because “they get $8 a month. The entire cable dial gets $100.”As a result, such services are left with “archival content that nobody would want in Blockbuster”. That provides the likes of his Warner Bros studio with a profitable outlet for older films, but “you can’t get any movies on Netflix”, he says provocatively.“It can do certain things and not other things. It can fly, it’s not a submarine,” he says: “Don’t turn a hamburger into a cow.”

It had been expecting a 2 per cent year-on-year rise, after it opened stores at midnight on Thanksgiving to draw in Black Friday discount hunters.Sears Holdings slumped 4.7 per cent to $57.48, on reports of weak Black Friday sales, and claims that its biggest shareholder, an investment fund linked to chairman Edward Lampert, has been selling shares.Discount department store rival Ross Stores climbed 3.6 per cent to $92.28 after year-on-year November same-store sales increased 5 per cent.“We’re still seeing year-on-year growth overall, but the holiday season is shaping up to be very competitive,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.“Companies are discounting to attract traffic, while the cost of inputs like cotton and Chinese wages are rising, and that’s going to continue to eat into gross margins.”Broad US indices dipped slightly, though they held on to most of their gains from a Fed-fuelled Wednesday. The S&P 500 was off 0.2 per cent to 1,2443.59, still up more than 7 per cent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,020.03 but still in positive territory for the year following a 500 point gain on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend and rose 0.2 per cent to 2,626.2, helped by Google. Shares in the group rose 2.4 per cent to $613.77. Google was catching up with the market after sitting out Wednesday’s rally, but was also helped by reports it would launch an online shopping service with low delivery costs to rival Amazon’s Prime. That did not stop Amazon gaining 2.6 per cent to 197.35.Fertiliser producers continued to be volatile as the weak rupee increased tension between Indian consumers and North American producers.On Thursday Indian farming co-operatives threatened to cut potash imports after a Russian producer refused to consider discounts.Mosaic shares rose as much as 3 per cent in the morning session on hopes it would resist demands to discount as well. But shares ended flat at $52.77. PotashCorp also pared early gains to close up 0.4 per cent at $43.51.CF Industries rose 5.1 per cent to $146.98, for the best performance in the S&P 500. CF is more active in the nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser markets, where Indian customers have negotiated prices that take account of the weak rupee.Shares in wireless network provider Clearwire rose as much as 25 per cent before closing up 14 per cent at $2.03. Clearwire’s main customer, Sprint Nextel agreed to extend up to $1.6bn in conditional revenues and funding to allow the company to make a $237m interest payment.Sprint initially tumbled on the arrangement, but closed flat at $2.70.Yahoo climbed 3.3 per cent to $16.23 as investors appeared to grow more confident that a $16.50 per share takeover bid led by Silver Lake Partners might end the internet portal’s long-running takeover saga.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, more than any other sector, with investors remaining nervous about bank stocks.Citigroup fell 1.8 per cent to $26.66 and JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent to $30.46, as they were named among five banks in a case brought by Massachusetts for foreclosure malpractice.But market watchers were struck by an overall lack of bearish sentiment.According to data from Birinyi and Associates, in the past two years a 3 per cent rally in the S&P 500 has almost invariably been followed by losses in early trading on the next trading day. “What’s interesting about this is that Wednesday’s huge moves haven’t attracted a massive wave of short selling or profit-taking,” Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, told clients.Netflix recovered from steep falls against the market on Wednesday, belatedly participating in the rally. Shares in the DVD delivery and video streaming website were up 4.1 per cent to $67.17.Lululemon Athletica fell 5.1 per cent to $47.17.

The benchmark US index was up 7.6 per cent for the week, erasing nearly all of its losses for the month.The three-day rally pushed the CBOE Vix index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, down to its lowest level of the month, before it closed at 27.79, allowing fund managers to breathe more easily.“The Fed’s intervention is a cushion for investors,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service. “It suggests central banks will continue to intervene to prop things up if the markets get too ugly.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose almost 500 points for its best close since March 2009, closing into positive territory for the year at 12,045.68. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 4.2 per cent to 2,620.34.The rally was broadly cyclical with investors piling into the energy, metal and mining stocks most dependent on global growth to sustain commodity prices.Alpha Natural Resources, which mines metallurgical coal, used in the manufacture of steel, rose 15.2 per cent to $24.00. AK Steel Holding rose 13.4 per cent to $8.46 and US Steel rose 15.3 per cent to $27.30.Analysts said steel stocks were boosted by news that China had cut the amount of deposits banks must hold in reserve, which could support lending to the country’s construction industry.“China accounts for 50 per cent of global steel consumption, and construction is the biggest part of that,” said Aldo Mazzaferro, a steel analyst at Macquarie. “The fear is that if Chinese consumption fell, but Chinese producers did not cut back on output, we’d have a massive oversupply, which would depress steel prices, hurting US companies.”But other analysts said the steel rally was down to short sellers being squeezed.“Steel stocks are heavily short sold, and that explains the big moves,” said David Lipschitz at Crédit Agricole Securities.investors were less keen on indebted energy groups.Transocean rose just 2.9 per cent to $42.85, as analysts evaluated the impact of a planned capital raise.The oil services company will add as many as 29.9m shares while also raising up to $2.5bn in the corporate bond market, to refinance outstanding debt from the acquisition of Aker Drilling.Robin Shoemaker at Citigroup said the dilution effect could reduce earnings per share by as much as 55 cents to $3.85 in 2012.“We believe Transocean is partially financing with equity to meet near term liquidity obligations while trying to avoid losing its investment grade credit rating,” he told clients.Banks climbed into the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 up 6.7 per cent, bettered only by energy, material and industrial stocks. Morgan Stanley was up 11.1 per cent to $14.79, Citigroup gained 8.9 per cent to $27.48.Bank of America lagged behind its peers for most of the day, having touched a new year low of $5.03 on Tuesday, but closed up 7.3 per cent to $5.44,The strength of the relief rally drowned out most other news, but company fundamentals were at work beneath the bubbly surface.Nvidia rose 4.8 per cent to $15.63 after Canaccord analysts said the company’s Tegra processors have been designed into the latest Amazon Kindle Fire. Nvidia shares are now up 12 per cent since the start of last week, when reports surfaced that Apple will also use its processors in the next batch of MacBooks.Apple itself underperformed the market for a second day running, up just 2.4 per cent to $382.20, after a court ruled that Samsung can sell a tablet product in Australia, despite Apple's complaints of patent infringement.Yahoo was up just 0.1 per cent to $15.71, after reports that a group of investors led by private equity firm Silver Lake may offer as little as $16.60 a share for the internet portal.Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 4 per cent to $64.62, despite launching the first generic version of Pfizer’s anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor. Citigroup analysts said Pfizer would retain 50 per cent market share this year.Netflix shares continued their decline, falling another 4.5 per cent to $64.53 after Wedbush became the latest research firm to lose faith.The stock had traded as high as $300 before a price rise led customers to desert the streaming and DVD delivery service.“The company’s business model was broken when it raised prices,” Wedbush analyst told clients. “And continued customer defections will require it to invest ever increasing amounts on marketing.”Wedbush also forecast Netflix’s content costs will rise to $1.7bn in 2012, from $800m in 2011.

American has called time on attempts to renegotiate pension and benefit costs with pilots.Semiconductor manufacturer Corning suffered heavy selling after unexpectedly lowering fourth quarter sales guidance.The stock fell 10.8 per cent to $13.19, as the company said sales of a major LCD screen product will rise only 5 to 10 per cent quarter on quarter, compared to prior guidance of a 20 per cent sequential rise.Hospira fell 9.1 per cent to $28.17 after RBC Capital Markets said a long running Food and Drug Administration investigation into the medical device marker’s main manufacturing plant may cause “widespread” production breakdowns, and take two to three years to correct.Netflix fell 3.4 per cent to $67.57 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s debt another notch, citing the risks involved in the video streaming website’s capital intensive overseas expansion.Home Depot was the standout performer in the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. Shares rose 5.3 per cent to $38.96 after the company’s chief financial officer told an analyst breakfast meeting that November sales had been better than expected.Hard-drive manufacturers Western Digital climbed 4.7 per cent to $27.80.The company was following on the coat tails of rival Seagate Technology, which was up 3.7 per cent to $16.58, after releasing a positive update to fourth-quarter guidance, even as widespread flooding in Thailand wreaks havoc with supply chains.“[Seagate’s] guidance update was driven by increasing industry-wide prices [for hard drives] rather than anything company specific,” said Joe Yoo at Citigroup.Mr Yoo said rising prices should reduce Western Digital’s fourth quarter net loss to roughly $150m, compared to the company’s most recent guidance of $300m.Banks gave back some of their gains from Monday’s rally.Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 per cent to $13.31, leaving the investment bank up just 0.4 per cent for the week, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which is up almost 3 per cent.Bank of America was down 3.2 per cent to $5.08, after touching a new year low of $5.03 during the day.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran gave bank executives some cheer, arguing retrenchment by European lenders from the US markets could benefit midsize US banks.“This creates an opportunity for US banks such as US Bancorp, PNC and Wells Fargo who are big enough to serve large corporate borrowers and are now able to replace Europeans as they pull out,” Mr Foran wrote to clients.PNC was up 1.2 per cent to $50.83.
793;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-28T21:48:23Z;US stocks surge after European rally;Equities gain after previous week’s heavy sell-off;Shares in Genworth Financial surged amid a rash of buying, as Citigroup analysts said the insurer will avoid bankruptcy.More than 2.5m Genworth shares were bought and sold, the heaviest trading day this month, as the stock gained 12.6 per cent to $6.07. Genworth’s market capitalisation has halved this year, amid fears of losses on a consumer debt insurance product it sells in the eurozone. But Citigroup analysts told clients the market appears to “be overly discounting the possibility of bankruptcy.”Wider US markets had their best day in November, as investors seized on record Black Friday retail sales figures, and reports that French officials are pushing for a deal on eurozone fiscal union, to reverse some of last week’s heavy gains.Only eight members of the S&P 500 were in the red, while all 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded gains, as stocks across the board were caught up in the improved sentiment. Although there was plenty of bad news to chew on as the rating agency Moody’s warned of multiple eurozone defaults, investors were determined to accentuate the positive.“It’s as though many of the people who capitulated last week have decided to reverse and pile back in all at once today,” said Colin Cieszynski.The S&P 500 closed up 2.9 per cent to 1,192.55, while the Dow gained 2.6 per cent to 11,523.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.5 per cent to 2,527.34.Metal and mining stocks led the rally, with the materials sector of the S&P 500 up 3.8 per cent.Commercial Metals Company gained 23.8 per cent to $14.17 on reports that veteran investor Carl Icahn had offered to buy the steelmaker for $15 a share, a 30 per cent premium to its Friday closing price.United States Steel Corporation was up 8.5 per cent to $24.16, while metallurgical coal miner Alpha Natural Resources gained 7.9 per cent to $20.29, both benefiting from renewed optimism about Chinese demand for steel.Big bank stocks also bounced with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $13.80 and Goldman Sachs up 2.3 per cent to $90.78.Citigroup rose 6 per cent to $25.05, as investors shrugged off a judge’s decision to tear up the bank’s settlement with the SEC over alleged miss-selling of mortgages.Amazon was among the main beneficiaries of the Black Friday sales rush. It rose 6.4 per cent to $194.15 after the company said it sold four times more Kindle products on Black Friday than it did last year.First Solar gained 10.5 per cent to $44.56 after analysts at Jefferies said construction had begun on the company’s long-delayed Topaz solar farm project in San Luis Obispo County, California.Monsanto was up 2.6 per cent to $69.49 on reports that France’s highest court had cancelled previous decisions banning the use of the company’s genetically modified maize cultivation in France.Netflix shares were given a boost after Susquehanna analyst Vasily Karasyov removed his “sell” recommendation on the stock. The shares rose 9.5 per cent to $69.95 although Mr Karasyov told clients he had not changed his outlook on the company, but was simply reacting to the large falls in the share price this month.Chinese video streaming websites Youku and Tudou both made strong gains after Katherine Leung at Goldman Sachs said the companies would benefit from Chinese government plans to eliminate advertising during the airing of TV dramas. Youku was up 7.3 per cent to $16.86 and Tudou was up 3.9 per cent to $12.But US web start-ups Groupon and LinkedIn had a tough day. Groupon tumbled 9 per cent to $15.24, almost $5 beneath its IPO price. LinkedIn fell 4.9 per cent $60.Pharmacy chains underperformed the market as the US Supreme Court refused to reverse a judgment by a West Virginia court that the biggest pharmacy chains were not complying with a law requiring them to fill prescriptions with cheaper generic drugs.Sears Holdings, which owns the KMart chain of pharmacies fell 1 per cent to $57.83 and Walgreen was up just 1 per cent to $32.79.Kellogg was another faller. The cereal maker fell 0.4 per cent to $48.62 after Kenneth Zaslow, food analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said the company’s planned, “investment in manufacturing, retraining, and rehiring likely will limit margin expansion for several years.”Shares of Madison Square Garden jumped 10 per cent to $28.37 after the NBA reached a labour deal with basketball players to secure a 66-game season.Wynn Resorts gained 7.1 per cent to $114.60 on an upgrade from analysts at Keybanc, who said the Macau gaming market remained robust, refuting the fears of other analysts that Wynn might suffer from a decline in Chinese business junkets to Macau.Google shares rose 4.5 per cent to $588.19 after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney told clients the company “has begun to show signs of margin stabilisation,” which have not been reflected in share price rises.
794;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-25T20:33:41Z;Online movie services gear up for UK turf war;;Film fans in the UK will be spoilt for choice next year as a range of new digital movie portals launch, pitting internet players against traditional retailers and media groups in a crowded fight for consumers’ wallets and Hollywood studios’ content.Netflix’s announcement last month that it would be bringing its online subscription service to the UK in 2012 has galvanised competition in what remains a small – albeit rapidly growing – market.Netflix and Amazon-backed rival Lovefilm are vying with British Sky Broadcasting for rights to the newest movies, while at the same time pay-per-view services such as HMV’s new On Demand site, which launched this week, and Tesco’s Blinkbox, acquired this year, are trying to lure eyeballs from movie services attached to hardware such as Apple’s iPhone and iPad, Sony’s PlayStation3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.In the UK just 2 per cent of television viewing is online, according to analysts at IHS Screen Digest, with a large portion of that made up of free catch-up services. But analysts believe new devices that make it easier to watch internet video on the television will accelerate the shift to on-demand movies.Next month iPlayer, Blinkbox and Lovefilm will arrive on the Xbox, while next year will see the UK launches of Google TV, which provides a range of internet video services, and YouView, the long-delayed joint venture between the BBC, ITV, Channels 4 and 5, BT, TalkTalk and Arqiva.“People generally want to watch movies on the biggest device possible,” says Richard Broughton, Screen Digest analyst. “They don’t want to be watching on a small laptop screen if they have a 42-inch HD TV.”Anticipating this shift, HMV, the troubled retailer, plans to pre-install links to its on-demand movie service offering films such as Cars 2 on to digital devices such as tablets, which it hopes will make up for falling sales of DVDs.“Increasingly, the way that people are experiencing entertainment is bringing the technology and the content together,” says Mark Hodgkinson, HMV’s marketing and e-commerce director. “We want to make that as easy as possible.”But HMV faces competition from Apple, the market leader, which ties its iTunes download store to its iPod, iPhone and iPad hardware through a closed, proprietary system. Microsoft has similarly bundled its digital movie service into the Xbox.HMV’s online movie store is supplied and operated by FilmFlex, a joint venture between Sony Pictures and Walt Disney, which also powers video-on-demand services for Virgin Media and Film4oD.Jeff Henry, FilmFlex chief executive, believes these partnerships improve the economics of the internet video business for all concerned, because its resellers have large customer bases that studios are keen to tap. Mr Henry expects to sign more partners such as HMV in the coming months.Netflix, by contrast, will be making a standing start when it launches in the UK next year, with no existing customer base. Although it believes its personalised recommendation technology and presence on a variety of devices will give it an advantage over rivals, securing rights to the best content will be critical.After early skirmishes with studios Netflix has come away with movies from MGM, Miramax and Lionsgate, while Lovefilm has exclusive early access to films from Warner Bros and Entertainment One, the distributor of films such as Twilight. In each case, the internet players had to bid against BSkyB for rights.Access to such content could become easier if the Competition Commission acts over what the regulator believes is BSkyB’s dominance in the pay-TV movie market, creating significant barriers to entry (a decision Sky disputes).After its preliminary ruling in August, the regulator is consulting on whether to allow “over the top” providers to access Sky Anytime, its on-demand movie service, and publication of contract expiry dates, which could make it easier for rivals to plan rights bids.Winning access to more digital movies from Sky is expected to cost Lovefilm and Netflix tens of millions of pounds. Lovefilm generated UK revenues from its DVD-by-mail business of £90.6m in 2010, with pre-tax profits of £6.3m, meaning the market will have to grow dramatically to make that investment pay.“It is definitely a long game,” says Simon Calver, Lovefilm’s chief executive. “It’s still a small percentage of people watching.”
795;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US financials hit amid steep falls;;Sharp drops for energy and financial groups led the worst week on Wall Street in two months as investors reeled amid European sovereign woes and the collapse of US budget deficit talks.The S&P 500 index fell 4.7 per cent on the week after breaking below its 50-day moving average during trading on Monday.The break triggered further selling and the index ended at a six-week low of 1,158.67 by close on Friday. It was the worst performance for the S&P during the Thanksgiving holiday week since 1941, according to Bespoke Investment Group.“Investors are shooting first and in liquidation mode and year-end balance sheet considerations are likely to make matters worse in coming weeks,” said Richard Gilhooly, strategist at TD Securities.Over the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also down 4.8 per cent to 11,231.94, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off by 5.1 per cent to 2,441.58.The week began with the “ supercommittee” group of US lawmakers, tasked with agreeing a new budget plan to forestall automatic cuts of more than $1,000bn next year, abandoning their talks.But rating agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch all said they would not alter their US sovereign credit ratings.Most of the action took place on Wednesday when the benchmark US index slumped 2.2 per cent after investors shunned an auction of German government bonds.The week’s decline was led by energy groups, which fell 6.2 per cent on the week as Brent crude fell to its lowest level since early October.Financials fell 5.7 per cent as the Federal Reserve announced plans to restart stress tests of US banks, testing their ability to withstand 13 per cent unemployment and a 6.9 per cent fall in eurozone gross domestic product.Bank of America dropped 10.5 per cent over the week to $5.17, having touched $5.11 on Wednesday, its lowest level since March 2009. The cost of insuring its debts against default also rose to an all-time high.However, shares in Jefferies, the investment bank that has been scrutinised since the fall of MF Global in October, rebounded. They ended 4.9 per cent higher at $10.66.The company’s chief executive published a letter responding to what he termed “outright lies” about the bank’s European exposure. Analysts at Oppenheimer agreed that claims the bank needed to raise fresh capital were “just flat out wrong”.“Jefferies telegraphed broader worries about financials and took its turn as the one in the spotlight,” said Bernard McDevitt, vice-president of institutional trading at Cheevers & Company. “It all comes down to uncertainty about the impact of Europe on the banking system.”Meanwhile, recently listed web companies were hit hard by investor fears that the tactic of floating small numbers of shares in initial public offerings could lead to sharp price declines.LinkedIn, the social network, and Fusion-io, a “cloud” computing group, both did large secondary offerings this month ahead of the end of six-month restrictions on insider share sales – standard after an initial public offering.LinkedIn fell 12.4 per cent on the week to $63.08, matching its lowest price since it began trading in May. Fusion-io fell 25.8 per cent to $29.38, below its IPO price of $33. As the sector was sold off, Groupon, the online coupon seller, fell 36 per cent to $16.75, below its own IPO price of $20.Consumer staples groups were the best performers on the week, falling just 2.3 per cent. Walmart, the discount retailer, was down just 0.6 per cent to $56.89 after reporting strong crowds on “Black Friday”, the day after Thanksgiving and the traditional beginning of the US holiday shopping season.Netflix ended the week down 18.2 per cent to $63.85, well off the $300 level it was trading at earlier this year. This sell-off came after the web streaming and DVD delivery company said it would raise $400m in new capital, diluting existing shareholders by 10 per cent.Hewlett-Packard, the PC maker, ended the week off 9.3 per cent to $25.39 after chief executive Meg Whitman said the company only expected to achieve earnings per share of $4 in fiscal 2012. A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected but the scale took analysts by surprise.Apple outperformed the market on the week, off 3 per cent to $363.57, after analysts at Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research groups have suggested.Gilead Sciences bounced back from a fall of more than 10 per cent on Monday when investors had baulked at the $11bn pricetag it had agreed to pay for Pharmasett, the maker of a hepatitis C treatment. The shares were down 1.5 per cent to $39.28.John Deere, the farming equipment maker, ended the week lower just 0.8 per cent to $73.64 after easily beating analyst expectations with earnings per share of $1.62.
796;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-23T03:01:48Z;Netflix fundraising sets negative tone;;"Netflix shares slumped 5.4 per cent per cent to $70.45 on Tuesday, as investors reacted to plans for a $400m capital raise, which will dilute existing shareholders by 10 per cent.The prospectus for the fundraising revealed the video streaming and DVD delivery business expects to post a full-year loss for 2012, due to stagnant revenues and the costs of launching a service in the UK and Ireland.Under a share buy-back scheme, Netflix was repurchasing shares for more than $200 as recently as
the second quarter of this year.“The company has been buying its own stock high and is now selling it low. It’s not exactly a textbook strategy from a capital management perspective,” said Barton Crockett, an entertainment analyst at Lazard Capital.Elsewhere stocks fell on Tuesday, as a downward revision to US third-quarter growth figures put paid to hopes of a rally after Monday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,188.04, stuck below 1,200, a level it breached for the first time in a month on Monday.With trading volumes light, Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets warned the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could drive further losses. “Getaway day traders may have closed out positions and be unwilling to take on new positions over an extended weekend,” he said.The Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.1 per cent to 2,521.28, given ballast by Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, which was up 2 per cent to $376.51, after Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research firms have suggested.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent per cent to 11,508.97.Hewlett-Packard closed down 0.8 per cent at $26.65. The computer maker fell as low $25.25 in early trading as investors reacted with dismay to the company’s pessimistic outlook for 2012.A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected, but the scale took analysts by surprise: new chief executive Meg Whitman predicted full-year earnings per share of $4, well below the $4.56 median analyst prediction, with the company downbeat on both consumer and business demand.Jeffrey Fidacaro, a computer analyst at Susquehanna, said HP had at least frontloaded bad news.”We believe this could provide a conservative floor to prudently set up the stock for estimate increases from here,” he told clients.Strong earnings boosted Medtronic. Shares in the medical research group surged 4.5 per cent to $34.75, after profits for the quarter ended October 28 jumped 50 per cent compared with the same period in 2010.Declining soup sales knocked Campbell’s, which fell 5.3 per cent to $31.84, as quarterly profits fell 4 per cent year on year.Starwood Hotels and Resorts slipped 4.7 per cent to $45.39 after Nomura analyst Harry Curtis, lowered earnings estimates, citing the company’s strong exposure to Europe. Starwood derives as much as 12 per cent of total earnings from the continent, twice as much as rivals such as Marriott International.Nvidia continued to benefit from widespread reports that it will supply semiconductors for the next generation of Apple MacBooks. Shares rose 3.1 per cent to $15.08 putting the stock up 8.3 per cent for the week, and only 3 per cent off for the year.Fellow semiconductor stock Analog Devices fell 3 per cent $33.32, after the company revealed the extent of the fall in orders through the third quarter.Gilead Sciences bounced back somewhat from its 10 per cent fall on Monday, as investors got over the initial shock of the $11bn price tag it agreed to pay for Pharmasset.The stock traded 6.9 per cent higher at $38.76, as analysts weighed up the long-term potential of the acquisition. “We believe that this makes a lot of sense and will provide Gilead with a highly synergistic asset with a very long tail,” Yaron Werber at Citigroup wrote to clients.Groupon fell 14.9 per cent to $20.07, within touching distance of its $20 debut price, with options traders buying puts for the right to sell the stock for as little as $13.Gold miner Newmont Mining prospered in market volatility yet again, up
0.8 per cent to $65.79, with bearish investors possibly seeking exposure to gold.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, but the big US banks avoided hefty losses.Jefferies, whose European exposures and funding model have come in for intense scrutiny, was down 1.4 per cent to $10.06.The IntercontinentalExchange was up 1.5 per cent to $115.91, as the derivatives exchange benefited from negative sentiment towards its larger rival the CME Group.The CME was partially responsible for regulating MF Global, the broker-dealer which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the month. CME shares were 0.4 per cent lower at $240.57."
797;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;TCV takes half of Netflix’s $400m raising;;Netflix has launched a $400m capital raising after three difficult months in which the DVD and streaming operator’s shares have fallen more than 70 per cent.The capital raising is split into two parts: Netflix has sold $200m of convertible senior notes to Technology Crossover Ventures, a long-time shareholder, and has launched a $200m share offering.When the bonds are converted, the capital raising will dilute the holdings of existing Netflix shareholders by about 10 per cent. Netflix will pay no interest on the notes, which mature in 2018, although TCV has the right to convert them to equity when the company’s shares hit $85.80. Netflix shares closed down more than 3.5 per cent on Monday at $74.47.Netflix said in a regulatory filing that it intended to use the net proceeds for “general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures”.Netflix told the Financial Times that the bond sale was an “opportunistic fundraising” at little cost to the company during a time of volatile market conditions.The fundraising comes after a tough year for Netflix. Its shares touched $300 in July but have been on a downward trajectory since a steep price rise and botched rebranding of its DVD business knocked consumer and investor confidence.The group has lost more than 1m customers since the summer: it expects net subscriber additions to stabilise in November and return to growth in December.Netflix recently unveiled plans to launch its online video streaming service in the UK and Ireland but warned that the launch would push it into the red. It has already launched in countries across Latin America and the Caribbean but has put expansion into new markets on hold until it returns to profitability.The group has also made strides into original programming, paying $100m for the right to screen a new US version of the BBC series House of Cards. Then last week it delighted fans of the US comedy Arrested Development when it ordered new episodes to be shown on its streaming service.Fans of Arrested Development have been clamouring for the series to return to the air waves since it was cancelled in 2006.The company has also continued to sign new content deals and recently added films from DreamWorks Animation to its service. However, its summer problems began when talks on a contract renewal ended with Starz, the cable channel that owns streaming rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures.Starz wanted Netflix to create a tiered pricing model but the company refused, which led to the termination of the talks.
798;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Salesforce.com;‘Cloud’ software provider needs to prove it can control costs;"Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds, wrote Shakespeare, in a prescient reflection on the stock market. As investors in Netflix and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters have recently discovered, the share prices of companies with dizzying valuations can easily lose a third of their value in one day if they report slowing sales.Salesforce.com, a provider of customer relationship software, got off lightly on Friday, a day after it reported growth in billings (revenue plus increases in deferred revenue) that was below expectations. The shares were down just 9 per cent; they still trade at a hefty 70 times next year’s earnings. This gentle treatment makes some sense. Simply looking at sales, the only thing visible is momentum: 36 per cent growth in the latest quarter, accelerating from a year ago.As Bernstein points out, this growth would be more impressive if Salesforce broke out how much of it comes from acquisitions. The company has spent nearly $800m in the past two years buying other businesses. More pressingly, despite its growth, Salesforce is not delivering expense leverage, which should be one of the key features of the “cloud”, or “software as a service”, model. Gross margins on software subscriptions have contracted by 4 percentage points in the past year, raising the question of how acquisitions are changing the product mix. Sales and marketing expenses as a proportion of revenue have risen five points over the same time. As a result, the company has not made operating profits in a year.True, Salesforce has generated nearly $400m in free cash flow in the past year. But counting the company’s stock compensation expenses against this figure, it falls by half. If Salesforce cannot prove that it can control its costs before sales start to slow, investors will not stop and smell the flowers.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
799;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-18T08:28:16Z;Kindle Fire fights Nook Tablet;;No tablet maker has made much of a dent in the iPad’s share of the market, so why should we expect more from a couple of eReader makers looking to expand beyond books?Price is the key reason. The Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet are more than 50 per cent cheaper than the cheapest iPad and could win a new audience looking for value and pure content consumption, if only in the US. I have had a limited time using both in their launch week and initial thoughts are after the jump.Neither the Fire nor the Nook tablet are game-changing in their hardware or looks. The Fire bears a passing resemblance to the BlackBerry PlayBook, but is slightly shorter, has a narrower 7in touchscreen and fewer connections – just for headphones and USB.It is a stripped-down machine in order to hit its $199 price – there are no cameras, no memory expansion slot and storage is a fairly miserly 8Gb – although I have a lot of content that is stored in and streamed from Amazon’s cloud services. Wi-Fi is built in but there is no 3G option.The $249 Nook Tablet is basically a souped-up version of the Nook Color eReader – it has the same design and screen, but has 16Gb of memory (its own software takes up 3Gb of this), faster processing and features such as a built-in microphone for a read-and-record feature for children’s books, plus improved software and services.However, Nook Color eReader owners can look forward to a software upgrade before the end of the year that will give them many of the services, such as Netflix and Hulu Plus, and functionality of the Tablet.The Tablet certainly wins out over the Fire on looks and is a more mature product, with its Color heritage. It is slightly larger but is easier and nicer to hold. And yet it still feels more of an extended eReader than a multimedia machine. Like the Fire, it lacks cameras and its speaker is similarly lightweight, but it does have a memory card slot to boost storage.Turning on the Amazon device, an eLetter from founder Jeff Bezos is waiting on the bookshelf carousel interface. Inside, he says the Kindle Fire had been designed “to disappear in your hands so you lose yourself in the content you love”.I can understand Amazon wanting it to disappear, given its unremarkable looks, but, to be fair, I was also unimpressed with the iPad at first sight, until I realised the content possibilities.Barnes & Noble’s chief executive has described the Fire as a “vending machine for Amazon services”. That is largely true, but it is also a service to its customers that a complete music, movie and book service is here at their fingertips, with an easy means of paying for it.Physical goods can be enjoyed as well, with a free month of Amazon Prime included for free and fast shipping.The downside for me was that I like to rent movies on Amazon and buy music. But I prefer to watch those movies on a big-screen TV and listen to the music on an iPod. The Fire does not allow me to stream to a TV or transfer to an iPod, although I could use the headphone jack to connect to external speakers.There are games and a big selection of Android apps as well, but I found the “ultra-fast” web-browsing experience of Amazon Silk not very slick at all, with Amazon’s caching of web page elements to speed delivery making no noticeable difference to loading times (Amazon says it should get faster over time as it learns what people are reading). An email app is included, but is not that functional in comparison with the iPad’s Mail app.The eReading experience was excellent, as you might expect, and magazines looked great in colour, although they can take some time to download and install – a GQ issue I tried needed a few minutes and took up a third of a gigabyte.Magazines looked and performed even better on the Nook Tablet – Barnes & Noble has had more experience on this with the Color. However, it lacks Amazon’s music and movies services and offers apps such as Netflix, HuluPlus and Pandora radio instead. Its app store has fewer choices than Amazon, but offers a more curated approach and features some best-of-breed choices such as TuneIn Radio, the MOG music service and Angry Birds game.I like the idea of eReaders that offer colour, more media choices and browsing at a reasonable price. The Fire and Tablet certainly achieve this, with the Tablet justifying its higher price, thanks to better hardware and design. Amazon certainly has the edge on content, but its product has plenty of rough edges in both hardware and software.Neither should be compared to the larger iPad, which remains in a league of its own and is available in countries these two may never reach, unless major content deals are brokered.
800;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Disney chief backs emerging markets push;;Bob Iger, chairman and chief executive of Walt Disney, has reaffirmed the US entertainment group’s international ambitions, saying it was “imperative to this company to plant a number of seeds in the emerging world” to find faster growth.Three months on from earnings that fell uncharacteristically short of analysts’ expectations, Disney reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share for its full fiscal year to October. Net income rose 21 per cent to $4.81bn on a 7 per cent rise in revenues to $40.9bn, driven by strength in its largest divisions, cable networks and parks and resorts.Full-year earnings per share rose 24 per cent to $2.52, helped by $5bn of share buy-backs. Investors welcomed the news, lifting Disney shares by 2.3 per cent, or 81 cents, to $35.45 in after-hours trading.Mr Iger, who in October extended his contract until 2016, highlighted “significant progress” made during the year in expanding Disney’s presence in Russia, India and China.He cited Disney’s recent deal to begin broadcasting a free-to-air television channel in Russia, its plan to take full control of UTV, the Indian entertainment group, and the start of work on a new theme park in Shanghai.“When you look at the remainder of this decade or the next decade, growth from emerging markets is going to outpace growth in the developed world and that’s the first time that’s happened in 200 years,” Mr Iger noted.A 23 per cent fall in full-year free cash flow showed the significant investments Disney is making, notably in its parks and resort division, which saw heavy expenditure on a new cruise ship and theme park attractions. Capital expenditure will rise by about $500m this year, largely because of the planned Shanghai resort.US parks saw strong international attendance in the fourth quarter, with a “slight” slowdown in UK visitors offset by increases in the numbers of tourists from Asia and Brazil.Revenues from Disney’s film studio were one weak spot, falling 8 per cent in the quarter for a five per cent decline over the year as Cars 2 could not match the previous year’s success of Toy Story 3. Mr Iger said, however, that the Cars franchise had now surpassed both Star Wars and Toy Story in merchandising revenues.He expressed confidence about coming films such as The Muppets and War Horse, and planned 3D re-releases of older films, including The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo.Cable networks led by ESPN increased full-year revenues by 12 per cent and the ABC broadcasting business advanced by 3 per cent. Disney said ESPN was confident it could weather a threatened NBA lock-out.Mr Iger said Disney was “getting paid nicely” by new digital distributors such as Netflix, but emphasised that these were relatively small contributors compared to traditional distribution channels, which remained healthy.
801;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-08T11:43:31Z;US pay-TV: don’t touch that dial;Will the internet do to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines?;"Americans average five hours of TV viewing per day. If time is to be left for work and sleep, old ways of watching must decline as new ones arise. Heavy investment in internet video by Amazon, Google and Netflix surely spooks executives at pay TV companies. Their nightmare scenario: the internet does to pay TV what wireless phones did to landlines.Third-quarter results from the largest TV distributors should ease fears about mass cable-cutting. The big cable companies – Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, Comcast, and Charter – all lost video subscribers, but the declines were lower than in the year-ago period. Telecoms companies AT&T and Verizon added TV customers, and the satellite company DirectTV had a bumper quarter for subs, driven by American football, more than offsetting nasty losses at rival Dish. Nor does competition from the internet seem to be causing price pressure: revenue per user was up across the industry.Still, total 2011 sub growth for cable companies is likely to be less than 1 per cent. Perhaps the internet is stealing marginal subscribers. In any case, the game has hardly begun. There are still fewer viewing options on the internet – pay TV has a virtual lock on sport, for example. And content producers will work to ensure that cable and satellite distributors keep getting the best stuff first, because that is where the money is, for now. They see the internet primarily as a new way to earn revenue from back catalogues.What will happen if, as the options available on the internet increase, viewers leave pay TV in greater numbers? One likely outcome is that broadband access (also sold by the cable and telecoms companies) will get pricier. Video already consumes more than half of internet bandwidth; as that grows, someone will have to pay for it.

802;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-07T18:47:41Z;Media industry cashes in on Netflix deals;;"It was just a year ago that big media companies were fending off questions about whether Netflix was on the verge of disrupting their traditional business model.Today, Netflix is still the hot topic, but the questions now ask just how good the digital video distributor will be for the industry.As Time Warner, Discovery Communications and CBS posted strong quarterly results last week, each company said it was already benefiting from, or soon expecting, a windfall of cash from online video services such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.With these three digital distributors battling for market share, and bracing for new competition from Google and Apple, each is aiming to stand apart by spending lavishly for the rights to stream popular TV shows and movies.“One of the most exciting areas of growth is the increased demand of our content from online video distributors like Amazon, Netflix, Hulu Plus and others,” said Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS.The new deals represent a lucrative third revenue stream for media companies, supplementing advertising and their longstanding deals with pay-television operators. “In less than eight months we have secured deals that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually to us and are a key factor in the diversification of our revenue streams,” Mr Moonves said.Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson believes CBS will record $260mn of revenue from online video distributors in 2012, up more than 20 per cent from about $208m this year. Mr Nathanson called Netflix “the gift that keeps giving”, noting that Netflix will pay Discovery $150m over two years for shows including Man vs Wild. “Netflix has been a friendly contributor to everyone’s year,” he said.The deals have also allowed media companies to find new value in their older, so-called “library content”. Discovery, for example, has given Netflix the right to stream shows that no longer air on its cable networks, and recognised $77m in revenues from Netflix during the third quarter. Similarly, Netflix is paying CBS to supply old hits such as Frasier and Cheers.“We were able to generate significant value from library content, mostly 18 months-plus old, while retaining flexibility with regards to our other distributors,” said David Zaslav, Discovery Communications chief executive.The deals have the power to singlehandedly turn round poorly performing business units, such as the CW network, a joint venture of Time Warner and CBS. “These deals substantially improve the economics of the CW,” said Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner chief executive.Another beneficial factor for the content owners is that all these deals are non-exclusive, allowing them to sell the same content several times. “It gives us an opportunity to play in the same way with anybody else with that same window,” said Mr ZaslavBut Netflix has had a few months it would rather forget; its stock has fallen by more than 70 per cent after a botched re-branding exercise and price rise, which has led to doubts about whether the streaming and DVD subscription service will be able to continue on its aggressive path.Moody’s Investor Service recently cut the outlook on its Ba2 credit rating for Netflix from “positive” to “stable”, a move that affects about $200m of the group’s debt.Moody’s noted the loss of 800,000 subscribers in Netflix’s most recent quarterly earnings and pointed to the cost of international expansion in the UK and Ireland, which will take Netflix into the red in coming quarters. Netflix declined to comment.“We think it will likely be a challenge for Netflix to sustain growth beyond 2012,” said Carlos Kirjner, Bernstein Research analyst. “And when growth slows, margins will likely drop as content costs will not be getting any cheaper.”With margins tightening, Netflix may soon have less cash to throw share with the likes of Time Warner, CBS and Discovery. Moody’s said that a probable scenario is one in which Netflix has “limited free cash flow for the next year which …reduces the cushion that has existed to support new and existing content contractual commitments”."
803;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Nook Tablet tries to douse Kindle Fire;;Barnes & Noble has unveiled its response to Amazon’s Kindle Fire in the shape of a lighter 7in tablet with more memory, longer battery life and what it claims is a superior display.The Nook Tablet will be on shelves from next week in the US at $249, at the same time the $199 Fire launches.At a news conference in New York, William Lynch, B&N chief executive (pictured), emphasised the new tablet’s qualities as an open reading and media consumption device and criticised the Fire as a “vending machine for Amazon services”.The bookseller has partnered with Netflix, Hulu+ and Pandora Radio to offer streaming movies, TV and music apps. While claiming this makes the Nook more open than the Fire, it also exposes the weakness of it not having Amazon’s integrated movie and music rental and download service.B&N executives also had little to say about the browsing and app experience – Amazon promises faster browsing with its Silk technology and thousands of apps and games from its version of the Android Market.The Nook Tablet runs the Gingerbread version of Android, but there is only limited access to Android Market apps, with B&N encouraging developers to create apps specifically for its devices.Although both the new Nook and Kindle Fire have IPS (In-Plane Switching) technology, B&N said its screen was more vivid and less reflective because of the lack of an air gap in its layers.While it will cost $50 more, this can be reduced by $25 if buyers join its members programme. The 16Gb of memory, compared to the Fire’s 8Gb, which B&N executives described as inadequate for a media tablet, also adds to the cost.Battery life is claimed at 11.5 hours for reading and nine hours for watching video, compared to seven on the Fire. The Nook Tablet weighs 14.1 ounces, next to 14.6 ounces for the Fire.B&N also reduced the price of its existing Nook Color eReader, which has the same screen and look as the Tablet, from $249 to $199.Its Simple Touch entry-level reader has been cut $40 to $99 to offer an ad-free alternative to Amazon’s Kindle touch at that price. Its software is being upgraded for faster page turns, clearer text and longer battery life.Sarah Rotman Epps, analyst at Forrester Research, described the new tablet as a “wow” product that was perfectly timed and at a decent price. She predicted B&N would sell 1.5m to 2m units during the holiday season, but the market leader Amazon would sell double that estimate with its Fire.
804;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-02T22:11:24Z;Liberty will not challenge Murdoch for BSkyB;;Liberty Global, the largest cable company outside the US, is looking for more acquisitions in Europe but will not challenge Rupert Murdoch for control of British Sky Broadcasting, its chairman has said.John Malone, who also chairs Liberty Media in the US, told the Financial Times before reporting a 17 per cent rise in third-quarter operating income that “investment banks ran around trying to stir things up” after the UK phone-hacking scandal forced News Corp to abandon its bid for BSkyB.Asked whether he would be interested in the UK satellite group if News Corp were to divest any of its 39.1 per cent stake, Mr Malone said: “It’s a very attractive asset and that’s a very hypothetical question and I certainly hope it doesn’t come to that.”He added: “We enjoy very good relationships with News Corp and with [Mr Murdoch, its chairman] …In all the transactions we have done with him he has had the greatest integrity, [so] I am not about to jump and give him a hard time.”Mr Malone, who once held an 18 per cent voting stake in News Corp, said he “would love” to be in the UK. However, he argued that the growth of internet-delivered video services would allow cable companies to reclaim market share from satellite platforms.New services such as Netflix would be “a real advantage for cable over satellite”, he said. With online video requiring faster broadband connections, Liberty Global offers download speeds of 100 Mbps to 20m homes. He added that he saw no evidence of cable being hurt by “cord-cutting”, or consumers cancelling TV subscriptions for online video alternatives.“The impact on the distribution industry is hedged because to watch this stuff you have to have access to high-speed broadband and cable has that,” he said.Mike Fries, chief executive, said Liberty Global saw further consolidation of Europe’s 7,000 cable companies as “a critical strategic goal”, adding that the industry needed scale to compete with the likes of Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.Liberty Global faces obstacles to its plans in Germany, after the national antitrust office said last Friday that in principle it opposed the group’s purchase ofKabel Baden-Württemberg, the country’s third-largest cable group, given Mr Malone’s control of Unitymedia, the number two cable company behind Kabel Deutschland.The regulator has yet to consider remedies proposed by the company and Mr Fries said he was confident of approval.Liberty Global reported revenues up 4 per cent on an underlying basis to $2.61bn and operating income up 17 per cent to $522m as it disclosed its best third-quarter subscriber growth to date, adding 327,000 subscriptions to its video, broadband or voice products. In the year to October, it bought back $1bn of its stock.
805;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-11-02T20:36:19Z;Time Warner flies higher on Harry Potter film;Record results for Warner Bros studio;Time Warner recorded its fastest sales growth for four years in the third quarter after the last film in the Harry Potter series drove record results for its Warner Bros studio.Revenues rose 11 per cent to $7.1bn, adjusted operating income increased 11 per cent to $1.09bn and an accelerated share buyback programme boosted adjusted earnings per share by 27 per cent to 79 cents. The media group now expects full year adjusted earnings per share growth “in the high teens” from last year’s $2.41 level, up from an earlier forecast of “at least low teens” growth.Jeff Bewkes, chief executive, said Time Warner should double its earnings from three years ago despite tough economic conditions and challenging technological changes, citing the rising value of its biggest film and TV hits as new distributors such as Netflix and Hulu proliferate.“Technology and globalisation are increasing the demand for high-quality content,” he said: “As the right business models develop, we also believe the value of this content is growing.”The last Harry Potter film took in $1.3bn, making it the third highest grossing film on record and taking total box office receipts for the franchise to $7.7bn.Reporting a 19 per cent rise in film revenues and operating income from the division up 153 per cent, Mr Bewkes said its success was based on creating other revenue streams such as a Making of Harry Potter tour at its studio north of London, where advance tickets have “blown away our expectations”.Mr Bewkes, who has had harsh words for Netflix, said prospects for television content had “never been better” and that the CW network’s recent agreements with Netflix and Hulu “substantially improve” its business model. Revenues from cable networks rose 7 per cent, while higher sports programming costs lowered operating income by 4 per cent.With analysts divided about prospects for UltraViolet, the digital film standard allowing consumers to buy a film once and play it on several devices, Mr Bewkes said Time Warner would use Flixster, its recently acquired social network for film fans, to introduce a service letting consumers convert physical DVD collections into digital copies.The group gave no update on its search for a chief executive of magazine publisher Time Inc, where revenues slipped 1 per cent on a 3 per cent fall in advertising and higher paper costs knocked operating income by 12 per cent. John Martin, chief financial officer, said print advertising trends had stabilised since July.Time Warner repurchased shares at double the pace of a year earlier, following a trend of increasingly aggressive buybacks in a sector where executives have become more willing to spend spare cash on their own stock than on acquisitions. Buybacks lifted net debt from $12.9bn to $15.3bn.
806;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-28T21:19:30Z;Financials and materials power S&P 500;;US bank stocks led a Europe-inspired relief rally this week, putting the S&P 500 on course for its best month since October 1974.The main action came on Thursday as the financial sector of the S&P 500 surged 6.2 per cent just hours after European leaders agreed a sovereign debt and bank recapitalisation deal in Brussels.The financial sector ended the week up 7 per cent, bettered only by highly cyclical material stocks, which rallied 7.9 per cent on improved sentiment towards the global economy after robust US growth figures. Bank of America was up 13.8 per cent to $7.35 and Goldman Sachs jumped 13.5 per cent to $115.86.The European deal did not help MF Global, the broker-dealer thought to have big exposures to Europe, which fell from $3.70 at the start of the week to just $1.20 on Friday, as two ratings agencies downgraded its debt to junk and potential buyers circled.The broad S&P 500 finished the week up 3.8 per cent and in positive territory for the year for the first time since August. The index is up 13.6 per cent since the start of October.The Vix index of expected volatility in the S&P 500 tumbled 21.1 per cent over the week, to close below 25 for the first time since early August.The question for investors is whether all this can last.At the close on Thursday Birinyi Associates said the S&P 500 was at “its most overbought level in the past 12 months”, based on deviation from its 50-day average. “The market has reached an absolute sell price,” Jeff Rubin at Birinyi said.Mark Enman, head of global trading at hedge fund investment firm Man Group, said hedge funds “may see this as a good level to reset short positions”.But on Friday the S&P 500 barely budged, ticking fractionally up to 1,285.05, while bullish analysts argued there was enough institutional cash still on the sidelines to sustain the rally next week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.6 per cent for the week to 12,230.88 and poised for its best October on record. Only three stocks in the 30-member index fell this week, despite a rash of earnings announcements, not all of which were positive.Procter & Gamble did worst, off 2.3 per cent to $64.73 after third-quarter profits fell to $3.02bn, from $3.08bn a year ago. High commodity prices pushed the company’s operating margin down 2.6 percentage points to 19.8 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.8 per cent to 2,737.15. It had lagged behind other indices earlier in the week, as online retailer Amazon fell below $200 for the first time since August after chief executive Jeff Bezos said the company could post a fourth quarter loss, because of high spending on product development. But Amazon closed the week at $217.32, down 7.4 per cent for the period.Netflix plunged 28.1 per cent to $84.14, after the company revealed it lost a million subscribers in the quarter ended September 30, as customers rebelled against a 60 per cent price rise for the combined streaming and DVD delivery service.Cable companies suffered from renewed evidence of “cord-cutting” – the migration of cable viewers to web streaming services.Time Warner Cable fell 11.8 per cent to $62.48 and Cablevision Systems fell 13.8 per cent to $15.14, as both companies revealed subscriber losses.Material stocks were the biggest winners from renewed optimism about global growth. Alpha Natural Resources jumped 22.2 per cent to $26.56. The metallurgical coal miner is a big supplier to China’s steel makers. Alpha’s rival Cliffs Natural Resources was up 21.3 per cent to $72.81.Peabody Energy surged 20 per cent to $46.84. It had fallen as much as much as 8 per cent on Tuesday after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own. Management reassured investors Peabody could raise the needed finance on debt markets, rather than by issuing new shares.First Solar ended a tumultuous week in the black, up 0.5 per cent to $53.99. The company lost a quarter of its market capitalisation in a few minutes of frantic trading on Wednesday afternoon after announcing the shock departure of its chief executive without explanation.The stock rallied strongly after management rushed out quarterly earnings data on Thursday. The results were bad – with full year earnings guidance slashed by almost a third – but provided investors with much needed visibility.
807;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-28T15:13:19Z;Google TV redesigned for the living room;Improved look mixes web with television;Google has revived its stuttering effort to conquer the living room with a new version of Google TV, the service that mixes the web with television.A redesigned interface, an improved look for services such as YouTube, better ways of finding TV and film content and the opening of the Android Market to deliver TV-compatible applications are the main improvements announced by Google on Friday.Google TV received a poor reception when it was first launched a year ago in the US, being criticised for its complexity and for a lack of compelling content. Poor sales forced Logitech – one of its main backers, along with Sony – to slash the price of its Revue set-top box featuring the technology to $100 in the summer, from an original $300.“The initial version of Google TV wasn’t perfect, but launching it gave us the opportunity to learn,” said Mario Queiroz, head of Google TV, in a blog post on Friday.“These are still early days and we know it will take time to get it right – we’re in a marathon, not a sprint.”The simpler interface being introduced is one of the lessons learnt but there are no changes being announced for Sony and Logitech’s hardware, which featured complex remotes and wireless keyboards.TV makers Vizio and Samsung also announced support for the service in January but have yet to release their versions. They appear to have been waiting for version two, which was delayed from an intended summer release and runs on a newer version of the Android operating system designed for tablets, codenamed Honeycomb.Google said it would start pushing out the update to Sony devices on Sunday evening and to Logitech ones shortly afterwards.Google TV lost another partner this month when Intel dissolved its Digital Home group and said it would stop focusing on producing microprocessors for internet TVs.Mr Queiroz said this would not affect the service. Google had been working with other chipmakers for several months on chipsets that would feature in products from new manufacturers in 2012, including launches in markets outside the US, he told the Financial Times.“We are very confident in our partnerships – we don’t see a lack of demand for the platform. Consumer electronics manufacturers are looking for a powerful operating system and platform that allows them to makes their devices smart so the web can come to the living room,” he said.However, consumers already have plenty of options for receiving internet content through the television, from attached games consoles to set-top boxes such as Apple TV, while analysts say TV makers such as Sony and Samsung also want to continue to offer their own services.“It would be an efficient outcome for consumers if we standardise on a single operating system [such as Google TV] quickly, but it’s unlikely that’s going to happen because there are no partners in that ecosystem that want to cede that territory right away,” says James McQuivey, Forrester Research media and technology analyst.He suggests one bold move would be for Google to sell to operators set-top boxes made by Motorola Mobility, the company it is buying for $12.5bn, at a considerable discount, provided they accept Google TV bundled with the box.However, while the service features the Netflix film streaming service and Amazon Instant Video, it is not yet announcing the kind of new content deals that would enable it to catch up with the offerings of rivals.Its advantage may prove to be Android apps. Google TV allows regular web browsing through an internet connection but users are expected to prefer the kind of apps they have become familiar with on smartphones and tablets, now that the Android Market is open.Google has been working with about 50 partners on TV-optimised apps for the new version, including CNN Money, Fox Business and IMDB, the film database.Another 1,800 existing apps that do not need features such as telephony are also expected to show up on the Market over the next few days.
808;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Time Warner loses TV and voice subscribers;;Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable operator in the US, said it lost pay-television subscribers and voice customers in the third quarter, news that sent shares down more than 8 per cent in early trading.Profits were down about 1 per cent on higher costs, though total revenues were up 3.7 per cent to $4.9bn from the same period a year ago.However, analysts zeroed in on the softening of the company’s subscriber base.“Time Warner Cable’s [third quarter] results are middling, at best,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Bernstein Research. “Subscriber numbers are vaguely disappointing, particularly in phone, where residential net additions went negative for the first time but also in video, where the promised year-over-year improvement in net additions was there, but was marginal.”Time Warner Cable is the first of the big US cable operators to report earnings, and its results could foreshadow similar losses of pay-TV customers for Cablevision, which reports earnings on Friday, and Comcast, the largest cable operator, which reports next Wednesday.While low household formation and a weak economy are weighing on pay-TV subscribers, the continued losses may reignite concerns about so called “cord-cutting”, in which people opt for cheaper online options such as Netflix and Hulu.Time Warner Cable said it lost 128,000 video customers in the quarter, news that follows similar losses in the second quarter, which was the first that the overall pay-TV industry lost subscribers.The company also said it lost voice customers, which surprised analysts. Stefan Anninger, analyst at Credit Suisse, said the loss of phone customers was “somewhat worrisome although we need to better understand today’s result. We would have expected to see better demand.”The loss of video and phone customers suggests the company will look to its high-speed internet business for future growth. Glenn Britt, Time Warner Cable chief executive, has endorsed this view, calling broadband his “anchor product”.“Broadband is a powerful service for which there appears to be unquenchable consumer thirst,” said Mr Britt. “We have a great story here. We’re winning share while increasing [average revenue per user].”The company gained 89,000 residential broadband customers in the quarter, with revenues from the segment up 7.8 per cent to $1.12bn.“Weak results in video and phone leave broadband as the growth engine that, more than ever, is carrying the company,” said Mr Moffett of Bernstein Research. “Happily, [high speed data] has broad shoulders. If broadband is to be asked to carry the company, it seems more than capable of doing so.”Benjamin Swinburne, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the results “reflect a maturing business in a tough economy with a high level of competition, while at the same time consistent profitability, strong [free cash flow] and return of capital levels”.
809;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-26T21:04:36Z;Warner stops giving Blockbuster latest films;;Warner Brothers has stopped supplying discs of its latest releases to Blockbuster after the DVD rental chain refused to agree to a 28-day delay between the films going on sale and their availability to rent.The move is the first step taken by Warner Bros to stimulate retail sales and make owning film content more appealing to consumers. It will be followed by efforts to expand similar release “windows” already in place with other movie rental services, such as Netflix and Redbox.Blockbuster has rejected the Hollywood studio’s request for a 28-day window and has instead bought discs of Horrible Bosses and The Green Lantern on the open market in order to rent them to its customers.“They felt it was important to continue to offer day and date rental so rather than work with us they went around us,” said Kevin Tsujihara, president of Warner Bros Home Entertainment. Blockbuster declined to comment.“The question is: how do we make ownership more valuable and attractive?” said Mr Tsujihara. “We have started the process of creating a window in bricks-and-mortar DVD and Blu-ray rental.”Horrible Bosses and The Green Lantern are the first two titles to be released by Warner Bros through the Ultra Violet service, which allows consumers to store the movies in a cloud-based locker and watch them on a device of their choosing.Hollywood has pinned its hopes on Ultra Violet to arrest the slump in DVD sales. But with an increasing number of consumers choosing subscription rental services – such as Netflix – over ownership, the industry has to convince consumers that buying movies represents good value for money.Blockbuster was recently bought out of bankruptcy by Dish Network, the pay-TV operator, which has increased footfall in the chain’s retail outlets and recently created a $10-a-month subscription service to rival that of Netflix.Netflix, which operates the largest streaming and DVD subscription service by users, has been battered in recent months by a tumbling share price. Shares in Netflix touched $300 in July but have since fallen to below $80.Netflix currently has to wait 28 days to make Warner Bros titles available to its subscribers. Mr Tsujihara indicated that the studio wanted to increase that window. “The Netflix and Redbox deals are going to be expiring at the end of the year and beginning of next year and it’s likely we will try to extend those windows,” he said.

Up to a third of the crude refined by both companies is WTI.The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to 1,229.11, its second worst daily performance this month, after worse than expected house price data, and cautious trading ahead of Wednesday’s eurozone summit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.7 per cent to 11,706.7, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 2.3 per cent at 2,638.42, back into negative territory for the year.Netflix shares plunged more than a third after the movie-streaming and DVD delivery service said domestic users fell by almost 1m during the third quarter – a larger fall than the company had predicted in mid-September.The stock fell 34.9 per cent to $77.37. The setback followed a tumultuous month, after the company increased the price of its joint DVD and streaming service by 60 per cent before announcing and then retracting a decision to divide the two units.Netflix’s market capitalisation has fallen by two-thirds since September 15, when the company first told investors it would lose subscribers.James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities, one of the few analysts who had maintained a “buy” on the stock through its stormy month, downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a “sell”.Goldman Sachs also dropped its “buy” rating on Netflix.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar plunged 25.3 per cent to $43.27 in just a few minutes of extremely heavy trading mid-afternoon, after the company announced the departure of its chief executive without explanation.Quest Diagnostic was the standout performer in the S&P 500, jumping 10.9 per cent to $56.50, after the clinical testing company eked out positive earnings on stronger margins, despite falling sales. That helped Quest’s rival Laboratory Corporation of America rise 1.2 per cent to $84.07.Analogue semiconductor manufacturer Texas Instruments was down 2.3 per cent at $30.95, after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue estimate disappointed the market.An earnings miss and bleak fourth-quarter guidance from industrial conglomerate 3M hit cyclical industrial and energy stocks. 3M was down 6.3 per cent to $77.04, Cummins was off 5.1 per cent to $93.81, after the engine manufacturer also cut full-year earnings guidance, citing weak demand from China and India, and a strong dollar.Despite beating revenue and earnings expectations Illinois Toolworks fell 5.4 per cent to $45.65, after the company forecast weaker demand from Europe in the fourth quarter.AK Steel Holding shed 13.6 per cent to $7.47 after the company declared a loss of $3.5m or 3 cents a share.Coal miner Peabody Energy ended a volatile day down 3.1 per cent at $39.66. The stock fell as much as 8 per cent at the start of trading after ArcelorMittal pulled out of a joint bid for Australian miner Macarthur Coal, leaving Peabody needing $5bn to fund the acquisition on its own.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Management used an earnings conference call to reassure analysts the company will be able to raise the finance through debt markets, rather than by issuing new equity, leading the stock to rally back towards $40.94 where it closed on Monday, before falling again.Interactive Intelligence a business communications company, slumped 24.2 per cent to $25.61, after the company missed third-quarter earnings guidance, despite strong orders for its cloud computing products.Analysts had spent Tuesday morning debating the breadth of the current rally. Bespoke Investment Group found 90 per cent of stocks in the S&P 500 were trading above their 50-day average at the close on Monday. That is the highest level since October 2010 and suggests the rally has extended beyond large-cap stocks, multinationals and high dividend payers, which led the two previous rallies since the August slump.But fund flows into exchange traded funds appeared to suggest the opposite, with $900m withdrawn from funds targeting small-cap companies.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, also played down the strength of quarterly results. Aggregate earnings reported by S&P 500 companies have exceeded consensus expectations by 5.4 per cent. But excluding financials, the margin has been 1.9 per cent, which is below the 5.3 per cent margin in the second quarter and the 6.1 per cent margin in the first quarter.
811;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Netflix rules out reversing price rise;;Netflix has ruled out reversing a controversial price increase that sparked a customer exodus and a share price fall of more than 35 per cent on Tuesday as investors reacted to a wave of subscriber cancellations.Reed Hastings, chief executive, said it would be “accurate” to say that “we shot ourselves in the foot with the abruptness” of a summer price increase but said the company would not change course by cutting prices.Instead, he defended Netflix’s decision to lift prices by 60 per cent, insisting that the company’s two services – DVDs by mail and online video streaming – were “great value”.Shares in the company, which this week unveiled plans to launch in the UK and Ireland, have collapsed since July when they touched $300. Since then a series of stumbles, notably the price increase and the widely derided plan to rename the company’s DVD operation as “Qwikster” – which the company later abandoned – have driven the price down.The company’s reputation has suffered, with thousands of its customers taking to social media sites and blogs to vent their anger. Mr Hastings has even been lampooned on Saturday Night Live and this week gave an interview to the New York Times that revealed he had discussed the company’s plans with a friend while soaking in a hot tub.Despite the criticism, Netflix said Mr Hastings had no plans to step down and that no investors had contacted the company over his role.Netflix shares opened at $118.84 but closed down 35 per cent at $77.37 on Tuesday after the company said in its earnings report that the pace of subscriber cancellations had been higher than expected.Netflix is trying to shift customers from its high margin DVD business, which is shrinking, to its lower margin streaming business, which has more growth potential.Mr Hastings said: “We’re almost exclusively focused on improving the streaming service. We will continue to run a great DVD service … we’re just not going to invest in it.”Investors were most unnerved by an unexpected decline in the company’s streaming subscribers. Netflix expects subscriptions to return to growth in December. “Streaming looked at in any reasonable time frame is going to grow and grow,” said Mr Hastings.Netflix has consistently outspent its rivals, such as Amazon, Hulu and Google for exclusive online content, but it is unclear what effect the collapse in the company’s share price will have on its future spending plans.The bigger impact could be on the broader media sector, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research.He said: “It’s worrisome that the digital gravy train may be slowing down. Netflix has been a tremendous windfall for the media companies and the question everyone is asking is: will that windfall continue?”
812;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Netflix down 40% as subscribers drop;;Netflix shares dropped sharply in early trading on Tuesday after the company revealed that subscriber numbers had fallen by more than expected and warned that its UK launch would push it into the red.The stock fell 40 per cent in the first minutes of trading, before settling at $76.01, a 36 per cent fall.Shares in the online streaming and DVD subscription group have tumbled in the last three months after a series of gaffes, including a sharp price increase and an ill-judged rebranding exercise, sparked an exodus of customers.Netflix shares touched $300 in July but at the market close on Monday they were $118. In a letter to investors, a contrite Reed Hastings, chief executive, said that many of the company’s “long-term members felt shocked” after the company increased prices by about 60 per cent, adding “more of them have expressed that by cancelling Netflix than we expected”.The number of US Netflix subscribers fell in the quarter for the first time, with 23.79m people subscribing to the service, compared with 24.59m in the previous quarter.Netflix has been trying to shift its customers away from the DVD subscription service to the higher margin streaming business, and recently said it would separate the two businesses, rebranding the DVD business as “Qwikster” – only to abandon the plan weeks later.Netflix users have cancelled their DVD subscriptions in droves but the company warned on Monday that the number of streaming customers had also fallen as customers with bundled subscriptions left the service. “Those subscribers are cancelling streaming, which reduces revenue and streaming subscriptions,” Mr Hastings wrote in his letter.The pace of streaming cancellations had slowed, he added, although the company expects streaming cancellations to continue to fall until December when it expects a return to positive territory. The effect of these cancellations and the company’s uncertain outlook could be found in the broad earnings guidance range for the fourth quarter, with Netflix anticipating earnings per share to be $0.36-$0.70.Revenues for the three months to September 30 were $821.8m, compared with $553.2m in the same quarter the previous year. Net income rose from $38m to $62.4m while earnings per share were $1.16, compared with $0.70.●Netflix is set to launch its online TV and movies subscription service in the UK and Ireland early next year, putting it head to head with Tesco, Amazon.com and Google’s YouTube as well as new start-ups such as Vdio.
813;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-25T11:30:40Z;Netflix set to launch UK service in 2012;;Netflix is set to launch its online TV and movies subscription service in the UK and Ireland early next year, putting it head to head with Tesco, Amazon.com and Google’s YouTube as well as new start-ups such as Vdio.The companies are all betting that greater numbers of consumers will choose to watch film and television on-demand through internet-connected games consoles, set-top boxes and smart TVs, rather than the UK’s traditional satellite and cable providers, British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media, who are also providing online streaming services.In September, US-based Netflix opened up for business in 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and it is widely expected to expand into other European markets such as Spain in the coming months.But in the US, Netflix’s largest market, where it offers both DVDs by post and online rentals, the company has struggled with customer losses after a recent price hike.Shares in Netflix have fallen by more than 60 per cent since their peak in mid-July, after a rapid rise in the previous two years.The company will publish its third-quarter results later on Monday, when embattled chief executive Reed Hastings is also expected to provide further details on its strategic U-turn earlier this month, when it ditched plans to split its DVD and online streaming businesses.Netflix’s decision to enter the UK market comes amid intensifying competition, following the acquisitions of Lovefilm by Amazon and Blinkbox by Tesco earlier this year.Google has also redoubled its efforts to bring top-tier films to its YouTube site on a pay-per-view basis.This month has also seen reports that Janus Friis, a Skype co-founder, is launching Vdio, a new online video service in the UK that would plug into Facebook’s new media-sharing capabilities.Vdio’s launch, if it can secure the rights from movie studios and broadcasters, would come two years after Mr Friis and his Skype collaborator, Niklas Zennstrom, were forced to abandon Joost, a previous online video service with a substantial social networking component.Netflix has not announced its content line-up or pricing for the UK, but has invited potential customers to register their details with the site.Two factors could change the shape of the British online video market substantially in the near future, giving new entrants such as Netflix a greater opportunity to acquire and distribute films over the internet.The first is the 2012 launch of YouView, an internet-TV joint venture between broadcasters the BBC, ITV, Channels 4 and 5, with broadband and infrastructure providers TalkTalk, BT and Arqiva. YouView’s partners hope that its £200 set-top boxes will transform the TV market in the same way that Freeview did by bringing low-cost digital broadcasts when it launched in 2002, by providing a new platform for internet video providers, potentially including Lovefilm or Netflix.Secondly, online providers may soon be able to acquire the rights to the latest Hollywood blockbusters more easily. The Competition Commission is considering how to loosen Sky Movies’ grip on top-tier movies after the authority’s provisional ruling in August found that BSkyB’s market power “affects adversely competition between pay-TV retailers”.
814;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-24T23:36:32Z;Netflix: film noir;The company expects its physical DVD service to lose 3m subscribers;"Netflix used to be a perfectly good horror movie. Company management swings a chainsaw; investors scream and are cut to bits; audience is titillated. Now it has become one of those avant-garde films your pseudo-intellectual friend recommends: no fun to watch, surreal and confusing.The no-fun-to-watch part is the damage that Netflix’s abrupt price increase has had on subscriber numbers. Subscriber growth ground to a halt in the third quarter, after the increase was announced in July. In the current quarter, as the price increase is put into effect, the company expects its physical DVD service to lose 3m – about a fifth – of its subscribers. Streaming video subscribers are expected to be flat to down. Given that Netflix’s strategy is designed to encourage growth in streaming, this is far worse news than the hit to DVDs.Now the surreal part. The company’s guidance included, for the first time, information about the operating margins at the DVD and streaming segments. The added disclosure is welcome. But what is disclosed makes Netflix strategy look all the more bizarre. Margins at the DVD business are expected to be around 50 per cent next quarter, and account for four-fifths of domestic profit. Margins for streaming are at about 8 per cent. Even if streaming margins widen, as expected, the current profit balance makes the heavy focus on streaming (as expressed in the price change and the announced-then-pulled brand separation) look very premature.The final, incomprehensible plot-twist: Netflix has announced that aggressive international investments will push the now-profitable company into the red for the “next few quarters”. But investors cannot be expected to put up with heavy spending in new geographies when management has not proved it can run the core business at home.

815;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-12T03:19:03Z;Franklin leads fall in US money manager stocks;;US money manager stocks fell on Tuesday after Franklin Resources, parent of Franklin Templeton Investments, revealed an unexpected decline in fixed income assets under management during September.Overall assets under management at Franklin Resources fell from $716.4bn at the end of August to $659.9bn at the end of September – principally due to falling asset prices, with Barclays Capital estimating investor outflows from equity funds were only $2.4bn and outflows from fixed income funds less than $1bn.Equity withdrawals had been expected, but the fall in fixed income assets under management from $314.6bn to $297.7bn worried some analysts.“We had previously factored in a much lower growth rate in global fixed income [but] now we expect negative flows [in the last quarter of 2011],” Chris Spahr, an analyst at CLSA wrote to clients. Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66.

816;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Netflix;The online video rental company’s U-turn explained;"There have been some big changes here at Netflix. Way back in July, your company’s market value was $16bn. We think shareholders may prefer our new, more manageable market cap of about $7bn. This exciting shift means new investors can buy our shares for almost 60 per cent less than they cost just a few months ago.Some of our longer-term investors may find this transition a little bit confusing. We apologise most sincerely. Let us take some time to say what’s happened.Of course, we don’t set our stock price. You, our investors, do that. And to those who owned the stock at its peak, thanks for believing in us when our shares were trading at 60 times this year’s earnings. That made sense if you consider only our sales growth (over 50 per cent in June, the sixth straight quarter of acceleration) and dominant market share of US online subscription viewing (nearly 90 per cent this year, according to IHS screen digest). We appreciate the way you averted your eyes as Amazon and Hulu hopped over our industry’s low barriers to entry, and our content costs rose even as revenue per subscriber fell.Things are different now. We made two bold decisions: an abrupt and poorly presented price increase and the break-up of our brand. “Netflix” was too well known; we thought people might prefer to rent DVDs from “Qwikster”. While neither decision can explain the crash in our shares, they did focus everyone’s attention on what a hard business we’re in and how unsustainable our margins appear. Now that we have set a much lower entry point for investors, we can announce today that we’re rolling back the Qwikster idea. Please don’t worry about how our new, lower valuation (24 times earnings) still dwarfs, say, Apple’s (14 times), despite Apple’s faster growth. We hope you are as excited about Netflix’s future as we are.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
817;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-10T16:49:42Z;Netflix drops plans to split DVD and online;;Netflix has buckled under pressure from investors and customers to make one of the most high profile US corporate strategic u-turns in recent years, backing off from a controversial plan to split its mail-order DVD and its online streaming media businesses.The move is the latest twist in four months of dramatic announcements and corporate restructuring from the company, during which customers and commentators have pilloried Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings over the changes.Richard Greenfield, analyst at BTIG, called the move a “necessary reversal of a bad decision”.Shares in Netflix had fallen 60 per cent since July, as investors and analysts reassessed the company’s long-term prospects. Netflix traded up modestly in midday trading, but the finished the day down 4.8 per cent to $111.62.“They’ve completely alienated their customers at a time when there are strong new threats,” said Shahid Khan, a consultant with MediaMorph. “I don’t think their stock is ever going to recover.”Mr Hastings last month said he would separate the mail-order business, which is declining, into a new company, called Qwikster, and keep the growing online streaming business as Netflix.com. But on Monday Mr Hastings completed an about-face.“There is a difference between moving quickly – which Netflix has done very well for years – and moving too fast, which is what we did in this case,” he said.The plan to split the company followed a price increase in July that caused Netflix to lose at least 1m subscribers. Mr Hastings on Monday said there would be no more price increases.Analysts said the introduction of Qwikster and its quick demise ranks among the more spectacular debacles in recent business history.“This doesn’t quite rise to the same level of self-destruction as New Coke [when Coca-Cola briefly tried a new formula in 1985],” said Adam Hanft, a brand strategist who works with media and technology companies. “But it’s pretty close.”Mr Hanft drew a comparison between former Apple chief executive Steve Jobs, who died last week, and Mr Hastings: “It points to how sure-footed Apple is in understanding consumer behaviour, and how Netflix has lost its way.”As Netflix works to attract new customers and retain existing ones, it is having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new content deals with television and film studios such as Fox, AMC and DreamWorks. Those costs continue to rise, and negotiations between Netflix and Starz, the premium cable network that owns rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures, recently broke down.Netflix is also facing fresh competition from the likes of Amazon, which will include a free trial of its Amazon Prime streaming media service with each new Kindle Fire tablet it sells, starting next month. Hulu, the streaming service, is up for sale and has attracted bids from Google and Dish Network.The turmoil has prompted a fresh analysis of the company’s value. “In the long run if they go all digital, the economics may not work,” Mr Khan said. “The whole love affair with Netflix is, if not over, at least tainted.”
818;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-10T14:24:55Z;S&P 500 set for its best day since August;;Wall Street enjoyed its best day since August 23, as the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 3.4 per cent to close at 1,194.89.Stocks were given a shot in the arm by the Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy’s weekend pledge to lay out a plan to recapitalise banks by the end of October, and that appeared to draw investors back in to the market.Randy Warren, a fund manager at Warren Financial Service, who reduced equity holdings at the start of the month, said he was “starting to worry about missing out on the upside now” and was buying back in to the market on Monday afternoon.“But there’s still so much cash on the sidelines, that needs to come back to the market if this rally is to keep momentum,” warned Ryan Detrick, a senior technical strategist at Schaeffers Investment Research.Analysts are waiting to see if the S&P 500 can break through the 1,220 barrier, where previous rallies this summer have fizzled.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3 per cent to 11,433.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 3.5 per cent to 2,568.05.On day that only four stocks in the S&P 500 recorded losses, the two worst performers were big name tech stocks.Netflix shares tumbled 4.8 per cent to 111.62, as investors delivered a withering judgement on the company’s reversal of plans to separate its web streaming and physical DVD businesses.The stock had traded up as much as 8 per cent in the morning session, after founder Reed Hastings bowed to pressure from customers, who had opposed the decision to create a stand alone DVD service called Qwikster.But by the end of the day, the stock was trading near year lows, amid uncertainty as to whether the company will also reverse a 60 per cent price hike for the combined DVD and online service, and concerns the brand would be damaged by the latest about turn.Sprint Nextel touched lows not seen since March 2009 as investors continued to worry about the rising costs of a planned network upgrade at the third-largest US mobile phone network.Joseph Euteneuer, Sprint chief financial officer, confirmed at a presentation on Friday that the company would have to raise additional capital to fund $10bn of capital expenditure.The stock sank 7.9 per cent to $2.22.The broader rally was strongly cylical, with the financials, energy and material sectors of the S&P 500 up for more than 4 per cent.Bank of America was up 6.4 per cent to $6.28 and Citigroup rose 7.6 per cent to $26.49.The investment banks lagged behind slightly with Goldman Sachs up only 3.7 per cent to $96.14 and Morgan Stanley, which has tended to exaggerate the sector’s moves on volatile days, tracking peers more closely on Monday, up 7.4 per cent to $15.29.Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the draft Volcker rule on proprietary trading, leaked late last week, would have a big impact on margins and revenues at Goldman and Morgan Stanley’s fixed-income business because of the narrow definition of market-making activities that would be permitted.Domestic oil and gas company Denbury Resources gained 9.6 per cent to $12.84 and metallurgical coal exporter Alpha Natural Resources was up 8.9 per cent to $20.03, as energy stocks out performed.Micron Technology, the last remaining US manufacturer of Dram memory chips for computers, was up 4.2 per cent to $5.16.With the spot price of Dram at historic lows, the company has faced questions about whether it is still economical to produce them in the US, but Citigroup semiconductor analyst Glen Yeung urged clients to buy the stock, forecasting an upturn in the Dram price.Apple was up 5.1 per cent to $388.81, more than reversing last week’s losses, which had followed the death of Steve Jobs and an underwhelming reception for the latest iPhone, after data showed record levels of demand for the latter.Microsoft climbed 2.6 per cent to $26.94 after the European Commission confirmed that it would not block the software giant’s takeover of Skype, the internet telephony company.Walmart shook off the temporary closure of several Chinese stores, which have been caught up in a mislabelling scandal, to rise 2.1 per cent to $54.81.Aluminium group Alcoa will kick off earnings season on Tuesday with analysts waiting to see whether a painful summer for the markets was mirrored in company performance. The stock climbed 3.9 per cent to $10.09.
819;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-05T23:27:15Z;Microsoft unveils Xbox TV content deals;;Microsoft has struck online content deals with almost 40 television and entertainment providers around the world for its Xbox 360 games console as it aims to compete against Sony and other rivals in the “smart TV” sector.Partners include Bravo, Comcast, HBO and Verizon in the US, the BBC, Channel 4 and Lovefilm in the UK, ZDF in Germany and ABC in Australia.The TV programming, video and movie deals will add considerably to ones Microsoft already has with the likes of ESPN, Netflix and Hulu+ in the US and Sky in the UKThe company said “a new era in television” would begin this Christmas as the services were rolled out.Steve Ballmer, chief executive, had told Microsoft’s developer conference last month that its Bing search engine would be combined with the Xbox’s Kinect controller, which allows voice and motion-based commands, to make the use of guides, menus and remote controls unnecessary.Microsoft is hoping that the ability to say the words “Xbox – Bing – The Office” to bring up an episode of the sitcom will differentiate it significantly from its rivals offering similar streaming of online content.“Combining the world’s leading TV and entertainment providers with the power of Kinect for Xbox 360 and the intelligence of Bing voice search will make TV and entertainment more personal, social and effortless,” said Don Mattrick, head of Microsoft’s Interactive Entertainment Business, in a statement on Wednesday.The news follows Sony’s rebranding of its online content network as the Sony Entertainment Network last month. Last week, it unveiled a new look for its Video Unlimited service on the PlayStation 3 console that it said gave a more visual and intuitive way of discovering content in its library of more than 40,000 films and TV episodes.As internet-connected televisions become more common through built-in WiFi, wired connections or links to web-enabled set-top boxes, a fierce battle is being waged among makers of television sets and Blu-ray players, console makers, cable and satellite providers and other set-top box manufacturers to sell hardware and streaming content to consumers.IMS Research forecasts that 5.9bn transactions for internet content in the living room will take place in 2016, up more than tenfold from the 563m expected this year.Microsoft’s Xbox Live service also has an advantage over competitors in offering more live programming, particularly for sports. There is easy switching between games, music and video and Microsoft is touting the social features of sharing details of online activities.
820;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-05T22:21:13Z;Confessions of a cord cutter;;Like most US children, I grew up watching a lot of television. Saturday cartoons led to after-school specials. Before I knew it, classic sitcoms such as Cheers and Seinfeld were helping me make sense of the adult world. And dramas like The Sopranos and Sex and the City were popular in college, where HBO’s gritty shows appealed to newly independent minds.Later, I subscribed to pay-TV services wherever I lived. Whether it was RCN in Washington, DC or Comcast in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the regional cable companies that control the US market were happy to keep me supplied with a steady supply of ESPN (for sport), CNN (news) and MTV (music).It was an expensive habit. The average premium cable subscription costs about $100 per month. But I never gave it much thought. In the US, cable TV is seen as a basic utility, as fundamental to domestic life as running water.However, when my wife and I moved to New York this year, we decided to try life without it. We figured that between work, a frenetic social calendar and Manhattan’s myriad artistic offerings, we would be pretty busy. And even in San Francisco, where we had paid Comcast $2,400 over two years for a top-of-the-range cable package, we had not watched that many programmes on a regular basis.TV was the entertainment option of last resort, not the centre of cultural life. We decided that if we wanted to watch something at home in New York, we would turn to the web.We still had our 42in Samsung LCD high definition TV set. So, with a DVD player, an Apple TV – which for $99 lets us buy shows from iTunes and access our Netflix account – and some unwieldy wires, we set out to bring the best of the web to our living room.The TV industry dreads people like us. The prospect that consumers might stop buying expensive pay-TV packages in favour of online content – so-called “cord-cutting” – has had the media world on edge for years now, thanks to a heady combination of new tech alternatives and the pressure on US household spending.The second quarter of this year was the first in which the overall number of pay-TV subscribers in the US fell, and lingering concerns about price-sensitive consumers and the plethora of online options has instilled fear in a naturally bullish sector.TV everywhere: To bring TV content to the web, the industry is working to make most shows, and even some live TV programming, available for existing cable subscribers. Progress, however, has been slow.New digital distributors: Online video options such as those provided by Netflix, Amazon and Hulu make it easy to cut the cord. But so far they are also proving a boon to content companies, which are selling shows to these websites for hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The challenge for the TV companies is to manage the new model without cannibalising its traditional structure.Cheaper cable packages: Pay-TV is expensive. So in a bid to make it more affordable to more consumers, some cable operators are beginning to offer cheaper packages that do not include expensive channels such as ESPN.The concern, according to Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson, is that “the emergence of online video distributors like Netflix would lead to the death of the media industry …the killing of the fabulous pay-TV ecosystem that has been very, very good to all.”When I recently told George Bodenheimer, president of ESPN, that I had cut the cord, he looked genuinely distressed.He has reason to be worried. Most households pay for ESPN even if they are not sports fans because cable companies sell “bundles” of channels.By bundling channels, cable operators keep their revenues up and spread the wealth to content companies. The content companies use that money to invest in new programming. At the same time, distributors and content companies are selling demographically targeted advertising. It is this cycle that keeps the entire TV business churning along.But if cable companies have fewer subscribers, cable channels will have shrunken subscription and advertising revenues. That will mean less money to invest in shows and a diminished product that could lead to even fewer subscribers. If enough people start to cut the cord, the economic model supporting the TV industry could quickly fall apart.In some ways, it is easier than ever to cut the cord. In recent years, high-quality content has found plenty of homes online. From free sites such as YouTube and Hulu to pay sites led by Netflix and Hulu Plus, thousands of shows and movies are now available to stream, with new premium content being developed for the web, for instance by YouTube. Apple’s iTunes Store offers most new releases to rent or buy for a few dollars each.Content companies are keenly aware of this. “We are concerned that cord-cutting is going to be a problem,” said Mike Hopkins, Fox’s president of affiliate sales, in a recent interview. “The more you enable it by putting content out there for free without any tether to a pay-TV subscription, the bigger that danger becomes.”The good news for Mr Boden­heimer and his fellow media moguls is that so far, pervasive cord-cutting is still some way off. Despite the second quarter’s modest dip in subscribers, macro­economic factors – including low household formation – may have had more of an impact than tech-savvy penny-pinchers.“It is safe to say that the worries over cord-cutting have now been fully traded in for fear concerning the macro­economy,” Mr Nathanson says. In fact, he notes that many content companies are finding new incremental revenues by selling old content to companies such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.The bad news for the media industry is that it is early days, and this problem is not going to go away. Despite the industry’s best efforts to preserve the value of pay-TV subscriptions, it does not take much effort to find most of what is available on TV online for free or just a fraction of the cost of a pay-TV subscription.Recent episodes of series such as Saturday Night Live and Glee are free on Hulu.com. Popular cable shows such as The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from Comedy Central and SyFy’s Alphas, are available online shortly after they air. And with our $10-a-month Netflix subscription, we were able to watch full seasons of older shows including Lost and Arrested Development.We have missed some programmes. The best shows on TV are often found on premium networks such as HBO and Showtime, which have invested heavily in productions and have been judicious about not offering their content on the web for non-subscribers.It was especially painful to give up live sports. For a few months I found myself at the local pub every time there was a game that I wanted to watch. We fixed that problem by buying a $40 digital high-definition receiver, which allows us to watch the four broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox – for free in HD. Recognising TV’s central place in civic life, US lawmakers have made broadcast TV an inalienable right, mandating that they be carried free-to-air.As well as giving us access to live football, basketball and baseball games, this has allowed us to watch the new autumn shows on the nights they air and make water-cooler talk about big budget productions such as Terra Nova and Pan Am.It takes some organisational acumen to arrange the various cords, remote controls and boxes beneath our TV set. Another big drag is that we have to be proactive in choosing what to watch – one of the great luxuries of traditional TV is that something is always on.And our new-found independence from TV could easily change if we had kids. Nickelodeon, the children’s channel owned by Viacom, is still required viewing, and I would not want to deprive our kids of essential developmental material such as SpongeBob SquarePants.But as cord-cutters, we are not alone. Most of our friends – busy, young, urban professionals – do not pay for TV either. And while it can take some effort to navigate, the web has grown up and now offers a fully fledged rival to the traditional TV experience.Yet some near-term cost savings for viewers could have long-term consequences for the quality of shows, whether on TV or online. If cord-cutting does ever catch on in a big way, studio revenues could shrink, making it harder to finance the shows that are so alluring to watch, whether on 42in screens or on iPads.As one TV executive recently told me: “If everyone cuts the cord, there will be no more premium shows to watch.”
821;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-10-05T17:21:23Z;The high costs of competing in premium content;Media groups are scrambling to stream video over the internet, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson;"Forget their democratic, amateur origins of aggregated newswire stories and user-generated videos of kittens. The internet’s biggest names are suddenly putting a premium on premium content.Google’s YouTube is splashing $100m on Tony Hawk skateboarding films and Hollywood movies. Netflix could spend as much on a US version of the 90s UK political drama House of Cards.Amazon has signed up Fox TV for its streaming video service, and AOL has made the bold claim that its acquisition of Huffington Post makes it the largest premium content company on the internet.Yahoo, too, is “doubling down” on original production; it has toyed with a bid for Hulu, the web video venture; and this week it struck a deal with ABC News.How much of this, though, really counts as must-have, differentiated, premium content? “If you’re in our industry, your definition of premium content is where you work,” Tim Armstrong, chief executive of AOL, admitted in an FT interview last week.Everybody thinks their content is “premium”. It is a rare media company that admits to being in the messy middle between primetime hits such as X-Factor or live sports and high-value niche content that is indispensable to small but passionate groups of professionals or fanatics.Premium content is also a slippery thing to define. As Justice Potter Stewart said of pornography, you know it when you see it. Premium content is original, high quality, distinctive and valuable to you. For one viewer that might mean a Bundesliga match; for another, a eurozone debt crisis investigation; for a third, a high-budget drama like HBO’s Game of Thrones.You don’t always know that you are seeing premium content when you visit Yahoo or AOL. On Tuesday night, for example, Yahoo’s homepage highlighted a feature on “astonishing home conversions” and the Associated Press headline, “US wife who killed, cooked husband seeks parole”. AOL was running a Huffington Post story on Amanda Knox’s release from an Italian jail and a picture of one of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in a bikini.There are audiences for all of the above, but whether it has premium value is a question hanging over both companies’ business models. AOL and Yahoo now define themselves not as technology companies, but as content companies. They admit that they will not beat Google in search or Facebook in social media, so you can see the logic for turning to content, the third pillar holding up digital advertising.But that puts them up against groups spending billions of dollars a year on professional entertainment and news. It is doubtful that either can win this battle.What AOL and Yahoo have in their favour, of course, is massive traffic.“This is an audience the size of the Super Bowl,” raved Ben Sherwood, ABC News president, on Monday. Actually, it’s not. Yahoo gets 100m unique users in a good month, but the Super Bowl gets 100m viewers in a few hours. It is a fair bet that Yahoo is not getting $3m for any 30-second ad. Yahoo gets more video traffic than Hulu, but a “How to peel garlic in 10 seconds” clip is not as valuable as an episode of House.From Yahoo Sports to the Huffington Post’s investigative unit, each outlet produces admirable examples of high-quality work. But they lack the scale to make Yahoo or AOL premium brands, and are easily drowned out by chatter about reality TV and murder trials.“Must-have” content has pricing power. Note, however, that most of the digital natives describing themselves as premium content companies have no plan to charge for it.Their hope is that advertisers will pay a premium to appear alongside high-quality content. Online advertising trends are in their favour, but advertisers have many places to go, and one glance at AOL and Yahoo’s growth rates is a reminder that no law says they will track the market’s growth.Moreover, online advertising is their only revenue stream, unlike the content companies they compete with.Premium content has its own challenges: look at this week’s nasty contractual spat between 20th century Fox Television and the actors who provide the voices for The Simpsons. But Fox can sell Simpsons episodes on to cable networks, syndicate them to channels around the world, haggle with digital video aggregators, sell DVDs and license Homer’s image.News Corp, Fox’s owner, has been dropping hints that it could even launch a Simpsons channel.The urgent question for those trying to value Yahoo or AOL in a fresh round of deal rumours is whether consumers and advertisers will agree that their content deserves the premium tag.Yahoo and AOL could yet be successful digital media companies, if they focus on what most media companies do badly, such as innovation, tools and customer understanding. But if they want to compete in truly premium content, the costs will be higher than they realise.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s media editor"
822;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
823;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-30T20:50:01Z;Wall Street suffers worst quarter since 2008;;A poor week ended a miserable quarter on Wall Street. The S&P 500 gave up a strong rally to end 0.4 per cent down for the week. That gave the benchmark US index its worst quarterly performance since 2008. The index fell 14.3 per cent over the third quarter, 7.2 per cent of that coming in September.The blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 1.3 per cent for the week to 10,913.38, strongly outperformed the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 2.7 cent to 2,415.40. That suggested a flight to the safety of large-cap stocks.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things,” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.Other analysts blamed the divergence between the two indices on mutual fund managers taking profits, and dumping less well-known stocks, before they have to declare quarter-end positions to their clients.A mixed performance by semiconductor stocks captured the week’s other theme of strongly backing outperformers and dumping laggards.Chip-manufacturer Jabil Circuit was up 6.3 per cent for the week to $17.79, after eking out impressive earnings-per-share growth for the quarter ended August 31.For other semiconductor stocks, stagnant sales dominated. Micron Technology fell 23.4 per cent for the week to $5.04. The stock fell 14 per cent on Friday after Micron declared a quarterly loss of 14 cents, on falling sales of Dram memory components to computer manufacturers.Micron’s rival Advanced Micro Devices was down 20.6 per cent for the week to $5.08, after its own quarterly results, published on Thursday, showed the company had failed to make an impression in the growing tablet market.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, often watched as an indicator of global industrial health, because semiconductors are used in everything from solar panels to smartphones, was down 5.9 per cent for the week.The week had started brightly, with the S&P 500 up above 1,190 at one point on Tuesday on hopes of a comprehensive deal on eurozone sovereign debt. But the rally reversed on reports of disagreements between European countries over further writedowns for private holders of Greek debt.Since the index dipped below 1,200 at the start of August, it has traded in a narrow band between 1,100 and 1,220, with volatile rallies and sell-offs quickly reversed.“The longer issues in Europe remain unresolved, the more nervous the market will get, and the S&P 500 could break below 1,100 even without big news,” said Channing Smith, director of equity strategies at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were up 1 per cent for the week, more than any other sector. Life assurers were the main beneficiaries, with Genworth Financial up 7.7 per cent for the week to $5.74.Most big banks also fared well, with Citigroup up 2.5 per cent for the week to $25.61. But Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $6.12, only 12 cents off its year-low. BofA dropped certain claims against the Lehman Brothers estate to resolve its long-running bankruptcy case.Other highly cyclical stocks fell. Material stocks were down 2 per cent, over continued concerns about falling Chinese demand if the world economy stagnates.Alpha Natural Resources, the metallurgical coal supplier which is dependent on Chinese demand for steel, fell 13.2 per cent to $17.69. ANR’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent since the start of August.Gaming group Wynn Resorts continued its recent sharp decline, falling 17 per cent over the week to $115.08. The stock has suffered from rumours of declining tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macao, although data suggest Macao arrivals remain robust.Big tech stocks, which have outperformed other cyclical stocks during market volatility this quarter, also had a rough week. Apple fell 5.7 per cent to $381.32 and Google fell 2 per cent to $515.04.Consumer staple stocks outperformed consumer discretionary stocks, and utilities were up, in a sign that investors were buying defensively even as the broad index rose.Ingersoll-Rand was down 11.1 per cent for the week to $27.56. The stock fell 13.8 per cent on Friday after the company cut its earnings per share guidance for the current quarter by more than 10 per cent.Netflix fell 12.4 per cent to $113.27. The market capitalisation of the video streaming and DVD delivery company halved in September after it had lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers after a price hike.
824;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Amazon breathes Fire into tablet market;;The history of personal technology, like biological evolution, is littered with failed species. Often, higher lifeforms succumb to attack from below, as better-adapted creatures take advantage of changing conditions to grab a foothold on the evolutionary ladder.Such a moment may have come this week when Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, held aloft his company’s Kindle Fire tablet.The device, which will go on sale in November and be available only in the US, looks unprepossessing as a piece of hardware. But if the early, excited reaction in tech circles is any guide, it may already have secured itself a new corner in the personal computing world – with potentially sweeping effects on the wider personal tech and media industries.With a screen measuring seven inches diagonally – giving it only half the surface area of Apple’s iPad – and no camera or ability to connect to high-speed 3G networks, Amazon’s entry into the crowded tablet market will not arouse the techno-lust of the average gadget geek.This is not a device, though, that is designed to sell itself on its technological innards – or what, in tech circles, are called the “feeds and speeds”. Instead, the Fire is a window into a world of digital content.“It’s a full-on PC that won’t behave at all like a computer,” says Mark Anderson, a US technology commentator.Personal computing has already been going through an extended evolutionary spasm. Apple’s iPhone, the fifth version of which is due to be unveiled on Tuesday, has led to a generation of pocket-sized, touchscreen devices that have quickly become all-purpose life aids. Mobile phones, digital cameras, GPS location devices – any number of separate functions have already been sucked into the smartphone.With many device makers now looking at including mobile payments – something Apple has itself studied, though it is not yet clear whether this will be featured in its next handset – the wallet may be next to go.The more recent iPad, on sale for less than 18 months, is now threatening to disrupt the market for larger screens, ranging from PCs to electronic book readers. Yet, while in the smartphone market other handset makers have largely copied Apple’s lead, Amazon has decided that tablets are due for another evolutionary branch.In doing so, it has copied one of the most famous strategies in business history: the idea, pioneered by safety razor inventor King Gillette more than a century ago, that a company can sell one product at – or even below – cost to secure customers for more profitable products or services for which it can make repeat sales.In Amazon’s case, that means slashing the price of its tablet to just $199 – far below the $499 price tag on the cheapest iPad. At that price it will make little or no money, even on devices it sells directly from its own website, according to Wall Street analysts. But from digital books to its music and film services to its online retail store, Amazon has plenty of ways to make its users pay.“The primary concern for Amazon is to support its ecosystem and sell more content,” says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. “This is what the Kindle Fire was created to do: be a good platform for content consumption.”Rather than present its users with the familiar “desktop” screen of icons for a range of apps, the Amazon Fire will display its access to digital content prominently on its home screen. And much of that content will come from Amazon.FT tech writers upload their viewsOthers put the company’s ambition more starkly. “The idea is to kill Netflix,” says Mr Anderson – echoing a widely held view that the dominant streaming film service in the US is one of the companies most threatened by this integration of hardware and content. With Amazon pushing aggressively into other digital media services, the impact of tight vertical integration with content could also be felt more widely.In this regard, Amazon is playing to its own strengths. Besides running the largest online store, it has become a leader in the digital delivery of media and other content from its own servers.Also, thanks to its early move into the “cloud computing” market, building the data centre capacity that other companies use to reach their users online, it has an unrivalled digital infrastructure to reach consumers. By bringing this back-end technology to bear in making its delivery of online content more efficient – for instance, with a new browser called Silk – Amazon has been able to draw at least some enthusiastic reviews from the tech geeks this week.There are some obvious potential pitfalls in the Amazon approach. One is that, by stripping down its hardware to keep costs as low as possible, it will fail to excite consumers whose view of tablets has been conditioned by the iPad.“A company that loses money on every hardware unit has the wrong incentives, it cannot keep pace technologically with a general-purpose device,” says one big Silicon Valley investor. But with a radically different price point, analysts such as Sarah Rotman Epps at Forrester say that Amazon is set to expand the tablet category, not compete directly with the iPad.
825;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-29T14:18:46Z;Wall St surges on German vote and GDP figures;;A flight to the safety of big name stocks seemed to be the only clear trend on a volatile day which saw strong divergence between the different US indices.The benchmark S&P 500 swung more than 3 per cent during the session, before closing 0.8 per cent up at 1,160.38. It was sandwiched by the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 1.3 per cent to 11153.91, and the smaller cap Nasdaq Composite index, which fell 0.4 per cent to 2,480.76.“Investors are heading to the safety of names offering quality and yield,” said Andrew Wilkinson, Chief Economic Strategist at Miller Tabak.“Risks appear to be rising as the month ends: Not something that was on the cards first thing this morning,”In the first minutes of trading the S&P had surged 2 per cent on news that the latest eurozone bailout packaged had passed a key vote in the German parliament, and an upward revision to second quarter growth data.Financials led the way, eventually closing up 2.8 per cent with life insurers faring particularly well.Genworth Financial closed up 7.8 per cent to $6.00 and Lincoln National Corporation up 5.6 per cent to $16.46.Investment bank Morgan Stanley jumped 6.6 per cent to $15.09 and rival Goldman Sachs was up 3.7 per cent to $99.87, although Deutsche Bank predicted Goldman would delcare a loss this quarter.Discover Financial Services, the Illinois-based credit card company, fell 1.2 per cent to $23.60 after revealing regulators plan to bring an enforcement case over its marketing of fee-based products.But it was a strange rally, with defensive utility stocks the second best performing sector in the S&P 500, ending the day up 1.5 per cent, and cyclical consumer discretionary and tech stocks down, 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.Advanced Micro, a semiconductor manufacturer, which supplies personal computer companies, fell 13.7 per cent to $5.31 after the California-based company reduced its forecast for quarterly revenue and gross margins.“We believe AMD had a tremendous opportunity to gain revenue share in notebooks this year,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote to clients. “However, a lack of component supply has been a major impediment to growth and will probably not be resolved in the near term.”Fellow semiconductor stock Micron Technology, which was set to declare results after the bell Thursday, was also down 4.1 per cent to $5.87.Consumer discretionary stocks were led down by internet stocks Amazon, off 3.2 per cent to $222.44 and Netflix, down 10.9 per cent to $113.19.James Cordwell, tech analyst at Atlantic Equities, said Netflix was suffering a “slow bleed” because of investor uncertainty over the company’s strategy, in the wake of a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses.Several traders speculated that mutual funds were dumping small cap and less well known stocks ahead of the quarter end, when they will have to reveal holidings to clients.But others said the move to more liquid, highly traded stocks, made strategic sense.“It’s much more difficult to get out [of small caps] in a really bad market. It’s telling you the market is by no means assured that Europe has a handle on things.” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap.US-listed Chinese stocks had a rough day after the Securities and Exchange Commission said the Justice Department is looking into allegations of accounting fraud.Sina Corporation, the e-commerce and social networking site, fell 9.7 per cent to $73.23. Youku, the recently listed video-streaming website fell 18.3 per cent to $16.25.Edwards LifeSciences tumbled after the administrator of the government’s Medicare and Medicaid programmes dealt a blow to hopes of a rapid roll-out for its new cardiovascular device.The medical device manufacturer is banking on strong revenue from its transcatheter aortic-valve implant (TAVI) device, a treatment for aortic stenosis – a heart disorder – that does not involve an operation.On Thursday, the Centre for Medicaid and Medicare (CMS) began the process for considering covering TAVI under the government’s health programmes.CMS approval would normally lead to private insurers following suit.But CMS suggested that trials be limited to patients deemed inoperable rather than include patients seeking an alternative to operations.“We think TAVI will deliver very good growth for Edwards in the long-term,” said Jason Mills, medical devices analyst at Cannacord Genuity. “But we think the consensus expectations on Wall Street have been too agressive on rollout in the first few years and that’s what’s suggested by CMS today.”Edwards shares fell 6.6 per cent to $70.87.Mosaic, the phosphate and potash producer, fell 5.2 per cent to $54.20 after reporting earnings of $1.17 a share for the quarter ended August 31.
826;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Facebook media apps raise privacy concerns;;Privacy campaigners have warned that Facebook is not making users sufficiently aware of how it plans to use a mass of information, including their reading and listening habits, that it will collect from new entertainment and media applications.Changes to the site unveiled last week mean that advertisers are looking at ways to use Facebook members’ activities as endorsements that can be placed in ads and shown to their friends on the site.Facebook has not ruled out harnessing data on its users’ activity from independent websites and services for marketing, and some inside the company indicated last week that this was its intention, but the company says it has not yet started work on this area.A similarly gradual approach was taken last year when Facebook launched its Like button, which was not initially used to target ads but now plays a central role in creating “Sponsored Stories”, one of its most popular ad formats.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, last week made what he called “frictionless sharing” the centrepiece of his speech at f8, the company’s annual developer conference. By integrating applications from media companies more closely into Facebook, actions such as reading an article on a news site or listening to a song are automatically transmitted to all of a user’s friends, provided the user has first granted permission to the app.This could include every song listened to on Spotify or Deezer, every film watched on Netflix or every article read on the Guardian or Washington Post apps.Advertisers are expecting to be able to incorporate these updates into “Sponsored Stories”, an ad format which uses an individual’s name and profile picture to recommend a product to their friends. So far, Sponsored Stories have been restricted to pages or items for which users had clicked Facebook’s Like button, added a comment or used an application.Turning “passive” user behaviour into content for advertising is reminiscent of the company’s ill-fated Beacon advertising system, which allowed for the creation of ads using individuals’ names based on the items they bought on other websites. Beacon was closed in 2009 after an outcry and Mr Zuckerberg apologised for sharing users’ information without their explicit permission.“Facebook is implicitly saying, since Spotify or Netflix is a partner, anything you do you’re going to like,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research group in Washington. “So any song or movie you watch, we are going to promote as if you’d expressed that you liked it. It’s turning your interaction with a Facebook business partner into a default endorsement. That can’t be right.”Some applications have been criticised for not giving sufficient information about how their data will be used when people give their one-click approval to start sharing.Spotify faced a barrage of complaints on web forums this week when it began to require all new users signing up for its music service to use their Facebook credentials, with shared listening through the site turned on by default. Spotify says it makes logging in a “simple and seamless social experience” and users can opt out of sharing “at any time”.Peter Eckersley, technology projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a internet freedoms campaigner, said: “If your friends see an ad that’s based on things you’ve chosen to publish, that might be annoying. If the ad were to publish facts about you without your knowledge, that’s where it would cross into extremely creepy territory.”Facebook said: “Our focus now is on rolling out these features to the more than 800m people who use Facebook, not on the opportunities for marketers.” It added it had “invested heavily” in its new system to provide “complete control” over privacy. “Our new sharing features are not like Beacon at all because they only work if people explicitly opt into them. Through our data permissions model, we make clear to people what information is being asked for and how it will be used.”Advertisers are keen to begin using the new capabilities, when Facebook allows them to.“The [f8] developments are a boon for Facebook’s smart new ad product Sponsored Stories, effectively turbo charging the ads with more knowledge,” said Ben Ayers, head of social media at Carat, a London media agency, while adding: “Facebook needs to get very good at explaining to users how they can control what they share and with whom.”
827;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-27T23:12:55Z;‘Citizen Kane’ studio goes up for sale;;"The Culver Studios, where a mocked-up Atlanta burned to the ground in Gone With The Wind, will go up for sale this week with its owners hoping that the history of one of Hollywood’s oldest independent lots will attract a $150m-plus offer from a trophy-hunting international business mogul.Built in 1918 by Thomas Ince, the silent movie pioneer, the studios have been owned by Cecil B. DeMille, RKO’s Joseph Kennedy and Howard Hughes. Their 13 sound stages have been home to epics including King Kong, Rebecca and Citizen Kane; more recent films including State of Play; and television series from Lassie to America’s Next Top Model.Pacific Coast Capital Partners, Lehman Brothers and Picbengro, a private vehicle for an undisclosed New York investor, bought the studios from Sony for $125m in 2004, later selling a series of office buildings for about $50m.The owners tried to sell before the 2008 financial crisis, attracting offers of more than $150m, but were caught out by the market collapse that brought down Lehman, said Jamie Cella, chief executive. It is expected to announce within days that it has appointed CB Richard Ellis, the property agent, for the sale.“This is an iconic trophy. I’ve always felt I was a steward of history because it’s been owned by all the kings of Hollywood,” Mr Cella said. “The interest in 2008 came from entertainment entities and some real estate opportunity funds, but now we see the market being driven by more international players.”The sellers hope to attract wealthy emerging markets bidders, Mr Cella said. “It’s like when [the Sultan of Brunei] bought the Beverly Hills Hotel [in 1987]. It made no sense financially, but he was right and I was wrong. Over time, the value has increased.”Kevin Shannon, a vice chairman with CB Richard Ellis, said studio properties were outperforming the weak office market. “The fundamentals for entertainment have been improving and the trend for this studio specifically has been improving,” he said.The Culver Studios represented an unusually large site with potential for development in west Los Angeles, “LA’s most desirable sub-market”, he said, and “an emotional property”Mr Shannon said he expected “entertainment moguls and high net worth people” from nearby Beverly Hills and Malibu and from “several continents” to show interest. Ren-Mar Studios, where I Love Lucy was filmed, was sold last year to the entrepreneur behind Oakley sunglasses.Mr Cella would not disclose details of the Culver Studios’ finances but said the current owners had increased profitability as they cut staff from about 60 to 48, erected new buildings and secured permission to build another 200,000 square feet of new office space. Known in the RKO years as “40 Acres”, the site never covered more than 29 acres and is now 14 acres.Despite a growing television production market, sales had dropped since the financial crisis set in as big studios make fewer films and Hollywood faces more competition from other US states and international locations offering tax breaks to filmmakers.“It’ll come back, because California is where filmmakers should be. The weather is better and you can fake a lot of places in California. You can fake New York in LA, where you can’t do that in New Mexico or Georgia,” Mr Cella said. “Other places don’t have the city grit New York or Chicago have. You see something shot in Toronto and think ‘that’s too clean’,” he said.The sale comes after Pinewood Shepperton’s largest shareholder was blocked by another investor this summer from taking the UK studio behind James Bond private. Viacom’s Paramount Pictures last week announced plans to spend $700m over 25 years to improve its 62-acre Hollywood studio lot and neighbouring properties.● Paramount announced a restructuring on Tuesday that will combine its home entertainment, digital and licensing businesses into one division, reporting to Dennis Maguire, its current home entertainment president. Viacom released no details about the financial impact of the move, which reflects a fast-changing film market where DVD sales are declining and online streaming services from companies, including Netflix and Amazon, are gaining ground.The changes will also centralise global theatrical management operations in Los Angeles and fold Paramount’s online games and digital content creation activities into other businesses."
828;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Energy and materials push Wall Street higher;;Wall Street enjoyed a second straight day of gains on hopes of a deal that would provide Greece with some debt relief. But a strong rally petered out late in the day, with bank stocks paring gains, as German and Dutch politicians demanded greater private sector participation in a second bail-out.Banks have tended to lead Europe-linked relief rallies, but global-facing industrial, material and energy stocks had the most momentum on Tuesday, mirroring a rally in commodity markets.Metals producer Allegheny Technologies Inc was up 7.4 per cent to $41.62 and oil and gas explorer QEP Resources jumped 6.2 per cent to $29.58. Mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global was up 8.1 per cent to $71.49.But concerns about global growth lingered. Metallurgical coal miner Alpha Natural Resources, whose market capitalisation fell by a third last week after the company warned of falling demand from China, fell 0.8 per cent to $21.26. It had been up as much as 8 per cent early in the day, when hopes of a comprehensive European deal were strongest.“The headline risk from across the pond has been weighing heavily on US stocks,” said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, “But for the first time in this crisis over the past 18 months it appears that European leaders finally get it.”In morning trading Mr Orlando allocated more funds to a US ETF tracking the German Dax index, and bought S&P 500 futures to profit from any rise in the benchmark index.“Stocks are just so cheap after last week’s fall, and we’re starting to see some positive news flow. You have to start buying or you’ll miss out on what could potentially be a significant rally,” he said.But not all investors climbed on board. Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors, initiated a position in oil company Suncor on Friday but has stayed on the sidelines on Monday and Tuesday, questioning the sustainability of the rally.“The liquidity issues at European banks might be solved quickly, but resolving the wider sovereign debt crisis will take much longer,” he said.The S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 1,175.42, although it had topped 1,190 for much of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.3 per cent to 11,190.69 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.2 per cent to 2,548.83.Financial stocks were the second worst performing sector in the S&P 500, up only 0.4 per cent. Bank of America fell 1.8 per cent to $6.48 and JPMorgan fell 0.3 per cent to $31.57, but Citigroup, up 1 per cent to $26.99, and Morgan Stanley, up 2.5 per cent to $14.37, both managed to hold on to gains.Department store Sears Holding was up 6.6 per cent to $57.51, the second best performer in the S&P 500, up 14.1 per cent to $61.57, although analysts were at a loss to explain the jump.Reports suggest the company is moving to maximise revenue from its under utilised property assets, but that does not seem to justify Tuesday’s pop.The Vix index of volatility was down to 38, a fall of 3 per cent from Monday. Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” had been above or near 40 for almost a week.Shares in Walgreen, the pharmacy chain, fell 6.3 per cent to $33.77, even though the company posted unexpectedly strong results for the quarter ended August. Earnings per share were 87 cents, a jump of 79 per cent from the same quarter last year.But Walgreen said there has been “no substantive progress” in contract renewal talks with Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager whose prescriptions account for up to $5.3bn of Walgreen revenue.Walgreen suggested losing the Express Script contract would cost it between 7 and 21 cents in per-share earnings next year. Walgreen’s rival CVS Caremark was up 0.8 per cent to $34.69.But Steven Halper at Stifel Nicolaus wrote in note to clients: “We are more pessimistic about the potential impact,” and that without the Express Scripts contract, “Walgreen will have increasing difficulty expanding gross margins at the same rate we have seen over the past two years”.Netflix continued a torrid trading period, down 3.6 per cent to $127.49.The stock is in negative territory for the week, despite the strong performance of the broad index, even though the company is reported to be on the verge of signing a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content.Family Dollar was down 1.2 per cent to $54.18. The discount retailer has been on a bullish run, as more cyclical stocks suffered, up 3 per cent for the month, while the broad S&P 500 has declined.
829;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-27T17:52:38Z;High expectations for Amazon’s tablet;;If Amazon unveils its tablet computer on Wednesday, as is widely anticipated, consumers, application makers and media companies will be eagerly looking for signs that a true rival to Apple’s iPad has finally arrived.According to people familiar with the device, the Amazon tablet will be a full-colour touchscreen device powered by a modified version of Google’s Android operating system. It will offer applications through the Amazon Appstore, music through Amazon’s Cloud Player music service, video through Amazon’s Instant Video service, and books and periodicals through its Kindle platform.With its own curated app store and a suite of media delivery applications, the Amazon tablet will be the first to try to replicate Apple’s ecosystem, in which users can purchase music, video and reading material from one source. Two content owners talking to Amazon about creating native applications for the tablet said they welcomed the company's attempt to create a more orderly version of what they saw as a confusing Android marketplace.This strategy could position Amazon as a rival to Apple in the business of digital media distribution. Although Amazon is the biggest seller of ebooks, it trails Apple in music sales, and Netflix and others on digital video sales.Anthony DiClemente, Barclays Capital analyst, said continued Kindle sales and the new tablet were “tailwinds for Amazon’s digital media businesses”, though he noted that other tablets besides the iPad have struggled. Nonetheless, he said: “We believe a tablet will help accelerate Amazon’s shift from physical to digital media sales.”As it did with the Kindle, which was a loss leader designed to spark ebook sales, Amazon sees the tablet as a low-margin device it hopes will ignite sales of music, video and applications. “While we believe Amazon has the opportunity to take share of the tablet market, we believe the bigger opportunity remains on the content side,” said Mr DiClemente.Amazon is working to distinguish itself from Apple, which has grated on media companies by demanding 30 per cent of media sales through its iTunes store and been reluctant to share data about consumers. According to people familiar with the deals, Amazon will freely share subscriber data with magazine and newspaper publishers.In the lead-up to Wednesday’s launch, Amazon has been striking deals with media companies, including arrangements to stream video content from Fox, CBS and NBC. On Tuesday, Amazon and Hearst, the magazine and newspaper publisher, announced deeper co-operation.“The good news for Amazon is that, unlike everyone else who has tried to compete, they have spent a lot of time building out the services before they launched the device,” said Michael Gartenberg, Gartner analyst.Amazon’s history in ecommerce will also give it an advantage as it seeks to increase its digital media sales. “They have millions and millions of credit cards,” said Mr Gartenberg. “It becomes really easy to charge for these services. One click and you can rent a movie.”Of course, many companies have tried to take on the iPad and come up short. Hewlett-Packard discontinued its TouchPad after poor sales. The BlackBerry PlayBook has met with poor sales. Even the Samsung Galaxy, regarded as the best alternative so far to the iPad, has not come close to matching Apple’s sales.Barclays estimates Amazon will sell 2m units in the fourth quarter and up to 7.9m units in 2012, figures that would easily make it the second-bestselling tablet after the iPad. Apple has sold more than 28m units since the iPad was launched last year.The Techcrunch blog has reported that the Amazon tablet will cost just $250, undercutting the iPad’s introductory $500 price.“Few companies are poised to enter the market with the resources they have,” said Mr Gartenberg. “And, of course, it’s going to be prominently placed on the Amazon homepage, which is another homecourt advantage that few other players have.”
830;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
831;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-25T22:12:22Z;Netflix to announce DreamWorks deal;;Netflix, the DVD and online video subscription service, will this week try to bounce back from a torrid few months in which its shares have halved in value as it unveils a new streaming deal with DreamWorks Animation, the company behind the Shrek films. The deal could be announced as early as Monday, according to people familiar with the situation. DreamWorks Animation is under contract with HBO, the Time Warner-owned cable channel, until the end of 2013 but has struck an agreement with Netflix that will allow the company’s streaming service to show some of its films before that time. Netflix will replace HBO as the company’s output partner when the HBO deal expires. Netflix is keen to bolster its content library before February, when its contract ends with Starz, the cable channel that owns rights to stream movies by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures. Negotiations between Netflix and Starz broke down recently when the two sides could not agree a new price.Netflix is aggressively pursuing other licensing agreements and is also in discussion with Warner Brothers about putting its television programming on the streaming service, according to people briefed on the situation.Warner Bros, which is part of Time Warner, is the largest producer of TV programming in the US. The talks with Netflix cover teen-oriented shows such as Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries, people familiar with the situation said. Warner Bros and Netflix declined to comment.Netflix last week struck a deal with DiscoveryCommunications which gives it older programming from Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel. More deals are expected in the next few months as it seeks to restock its service before the Starz deal ends in February.Netflix shares have tumbled since July, when it announced a 60 per cent price increase. The move angered many of its customers who began to cancel their subscriptions in higher numbers than Netflix had anticipated.Investors were further spooked when Netflix adjusted its third-quarter guidance, saying it had underestimated by 1m the number of subscribers it expected to quit the service.The anger intensified again last week when Netflix unveiled plans to split its business into two distinct entities, each with a separate management team. It has renamed its DVD business “Qwikster” and will operate it as a standalone business. Customers that want both the DVD and the streaming service will require two separate accounts.Analysts have suggested that the separation could presage a sale of the DVD business but the company is adamant that it intends to keep it. However, its new investment in content is aimed at the streaming business, in a sign of the company’s confidence in its potential in the US and in international markets.Netflix recently unveiled plans to launch the streaming service in 43 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean and plans eventually to take it to Europe.
832;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-24T00:04:32Z;Dish launches streaming and DVD service;;Dish Network has announced a new film streaming and DVD rental service under the satellite television provider’s recently acquired Blockbuster brand, mounting a fresh challenge to the troubled Netflix service.Dish also revealed that Blockbuster had signed up nearly 500,000 customers to new film subscription services over the past 30 days “given recent events”, referring to subscriber desertions from Netflix after it announced a dramatic rise in rates and the splitting of its streaming and DVD rental services.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said in an email on Monday apologising to subscribers about the handling of the split that film streaming and DVD by mail had become two different businesses that needed to be marketed differently.But Joe Clayton, Dish chief executive, argued at a news conference in San Francisco on Friday that consumers wanted the opposite.“It’s one company, one bill, one connection for everything you need in video entertainment,” he said of Dish’s offering.The new Blockbuster Movie Pass launches on October 1 for Dish subscribers only. Existing subscribers can choose from more than 100,000 DVD-by-mail titles, including 3,000 games, for an extra $10 a month on their bill. The ability to stream thousands of films on a PC or to their TV through their set-top box is also included.New Dish subscribers can have the service free for a year and the company said it would be offered to non-Dish subscribers in the future.Michael Pachter, media analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the new offering lacked the depth of catalogue of other streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon and it would have only a limited impact through being confined to Dish customers.“To the extent that if you’re a Dish customer and a Netflix customer and you’re pissed at Netflix, maybe they’ll pick up one or two million subscribers,” he said.Mr Pachter said he was now convinced that Netflix had divided its business with a sale to Amazon in mind for the streaming portion. He raised the stock on Thursday from “underperform” to “outperform”.Blockbuster was the arch rival of Netflix until it filed for bankruptcy a year ago. It had been closing stores to try to cut losses incurred as services such as Netflix and RedBox – a low-cost DVD rental kiosk business – gained ground.Dish acquired Blockbuster in April and has been rebuilding and integrating its business. While the number of stores in the US has been halved to about 1,500, they have been redesigned and DVD rentals priced more competitively, at as low as 99 cents.
833;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-23T20:56:15Z;Wall Street extends losses on growth fears;;The S&P 500 suffered its second-worst week since the financial crisis, as investors’ fears for global growth increased.The Federal Open Market Committee’s warnings of “significant downside risks” to the US economy sent markets into a tailspin late on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 falling almost 3 per cent ahead of the close. It continued to slide on Thursday.The Fed’s much anticipated decision to launch “Operation Twist” to lengthen the maturity of its Treasury holdings in order to drive down long-term interest rates unnerved investors further. “I don’t know if I want to use the word desperate, but it feels like the Federal Reserve is out of bullets,” was the verdict of Scott O’Neil, president of equity research group MarketSmith.The S&P did rebound slightly Friday, up 0.6 per cent for the day. But the two previous days of heavy selling left the benchmark index down 6.5 per cent for the week at 1,136.43.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.4 per cent to 10,771.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 5.3 per cent for the week at 2,483.23.Some US bank stocks hit their lowest levels since the financial crisis.Commercial banks Bank of America and Citigroup touched lows not seen since 2009, after Moody’s downgraded their credit ratings, along with competitor Wells Fargo.Moody’s said the government would be less likely to rescue big banks once banking reforms were implemented.On Thursday afternoon, BofA shares hit $6 and Citigroup touched $23.19, although both prices were still more than double the lows recorded in March 2009. At Friday’s close, BofA was down 12.7 per cent for the week to $6.31, and Citi was down 13.8 per cent to $24.98.Investment bank Goldman Sachs also sunk to a post-March 2009 low. Its shares fell to $91.40 before recovering to $95.18, off 11.5 per cent for the week.Morgan Stanley, however, did break through 2009 levels. Its share price fell to $12.49 on Thursday afternoon, a level not seen since December 2008.Morgan’s market capitalisation has now almost halved in just eight weeks, as investors fret about the bank’s ability to fund itself.The bank has been at pains to emphasise its funding stability. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, told an investor conference earlier this month that it had increased the average maturity of its borrowings and reduced dependence on secured funding.“Post-crisis, we have moved to a model of much more stable funding,” Ms Porat said.On Friday, Morgan’s shares had staged a partial recovery, up 5.1 per cent on the day to $13.72, but still down 17.1 per cent for the week.Poor economic data from Germany and China and signs of reduced demand for raw materials pummelled materials and energy stocks.Alpha Natural Resources, the metallurgical coal miner, saw its market capitalisation drop by almost a third after warning of falling demand from Asia. Alpha lost 31.5 per cent for the week at $20.39.Cliffs Natural Resources, the international mining and metals group, fell 25.8 per cent for the week to $57.84. Mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global fell 20.1 per cent to $65.01.Despite a mini recovery for industrial stocks on Friday, the 10 biggest fallers in the S&P 500 for the week were all from the energy, materials or industrial sectors.Netflix fell 16.6 per cent for the week to $129.36, as investors assessed the impact on the brand after a decision to separate the physical DVD delivery and streaming businesses and raise the price of the joint service by 60 per cent.Hewlett-Packard fell 5.1 per cent to $22.32, after announcing Léo Apotheker would be replaced as chief executive by Meg Whitman.Goodrich was by far the best performer in the S&P 500, up 31.1 per cent per cent for the week to $121.75, after industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation said it would buy the aircraft manufacturer for $16.5bn, or $127.50 a share.UTC shareholders were less impressed with the decision that will increase the company’s debt to about 50 per cent of market capitalisation. UTC shares fell 8.7 per cent for the week to $68.92.Oracle fell 1.1 per cent for the week to $28.90 but significantly outperformed the market, after reporting better than expected earnings.The company’s software sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, grew more than 50 per cent compared with the same quarter last year, confounding fears that Europe’s debt crisis would hurt demand.
834;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-23T18:13:25Z;Media mood darkens as advertising outlook dims;;"The mood of multinational media groups darkened this week as growing uncertainty about the advertising outlook clouded their assurances that new digital distributors would increase the value of premium content rather than hit traditional revenues.The annual Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference took place against a backdrop of slumping media share prices, as wider market nerves were accentuated in the sector by downgrades to forecasts from Viacom and the New York Times.“The watchword is caution,” said Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the advertising and marketing group.Agencies had seen little change yet in clients’ spending, he said, but “we’re going to tell our people to come in very cautiously with their budgets”.“In general, we don’t necessarily see the recovery, but we don’t see another big downturn,” added Randall Weisenburger, chief financial officer of Omnicom, WPP’s closest rival.Michael Roth, chief executive of Interpublic, the smaller advertising holding company, said: “This isn’t what we saw in 2008. There’s cash out there; [advertisers] have money to spend in this environment.“That said, there’s uncertainty out there and you have to be concerned. In 2008, we didn’t see the pullback until December and the fourth quarter.”Analysts expressed caution after Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, lowered guidance for fourth-quarter advertising growth to “high single-digits” from the double-digit growth it predicted in August.“Despite widespread comments that the market is healthy, we worry that slowing national TV scatter [advertising] …is as much to blame as ratings,” said Michael Nathanson, a Nomura media analyst.Print media, hit first and hardest by the 2008-09 advertising slump, appear again to be struggling. Janet Robinson, chief executive of the New York Times, lowered its guidance for the coming quarter.Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief of Time Warner, said that while advertising was still “pretty strong” in its cable networks, such as TNT, it was “a little softer” in its magazine division.Credit Suisse analysts estimated this month that one in five Americans could one day cancel cable or satellite subscriptions to take digital video from the likes of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com, but Mr Bewkes and Mr Dauman insisted that “cord-cutting” was a reflection of a weak economy rather than a challenge to pay-TV models.“Over the top” digital video services would provide incremental revenues, content owners argued. “The beautiful thing about Netflix is that it’s a new window for us,” after a show’s first-run airing and later TV syndication, said David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications.Les Moonves, CEO of CBS, and Chase Carey, chief operating officer of News Corp, both dubbed Netflix a service for “library” content, which could add value to older hits. Such services were “working out as a net plus for everybody”, Mr Bewkes added.Even as they reassured their biggest cable and satellite customers, however, content creators hinted at financial battles to come with their traditional distributors. Content owners said they expected extra payment in order for the cable industry to fulfil its ambitions to provide “TV Everywhere” or “authenticated” services that let subscribers see a full line-up of channels on any device.Executives also highlighted the profound shifts in TV economics being wrought by digital distribution. HBO Go, the TV Everywhere product from Time Warner’s premium cable channel, had increased users’ viewing of HBO programmes by 50 per cent, Mr Bewkes noted. “What happens when every other channel does it?” he asked."
835;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-22T14:02:39Z;Innovators don’t ignore customers;Customers don’t care about corporate structures, cash flows, technologies and growth ratings. They care about service;"According to the business textbooks, Reed Hastings is a visionary and innovator. But thousands of his customers, and many of his investors, think the chief executive of Netflix is an idiot.The DVD rental and online film service is “going to be held up as a gold standard of how to avoid being disrupted”, Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor and author of The Innovator’s Dilemma, tweeted this week. As he opined, Netflix shares were dropping rapidly and 25,000 of its customers were posting irate protests at having their service disrupted.I’m with them. Mr Hastings is the latest chief executive to blow up his company in response to changes sweeping the media and technology industries – Léo Apotheker was just as explosive at Hewlett-Packard last month. But no matter how solid the logic and brave the strategy, it has to carry people with it.In practice, there was a vast gulf between what customers wanted – largely what they had already – and Mr Hastings’ vision of his company’s future. He rebranded its declining DVD rental operation Qwikster (yes, seriously), confined the Netflix name to its high-growth but immature online streaming service, and imposed a 60 per cent price increase on subscribers to both.He did not help matters with his online apology – “I messed up. I owe everyone an explanation” – in which he claimed that the problem was that Netflix “lacked respect and humility” in how it had explained the price rise, rather than the rise itself. He antagonised his audience further with the rebranding.The fall in the shares – 13 per cent on Monday and Tuesday and by more than half in two months – does not matter so much. They had risen sixfold in three years on hopes that Netflix was seamlessly adapting to the digital era, and even if Mr Hastings had not clumsily made that error clear, they would have adjusted eventually. But the customer revolt has long-term consequences.Mr Hastings is not alone in struggling with upheaval. Many technology and media companies – from Microsoft to Time Warner and News Corp – now own businesses that produce plenty of cash but grow slowly, if at all, alongside promising digital operations.Such divergence of activities under one roof is nothing new. The Boston Consulting Group came up with its famous matrix dividing businesses into cash cows, question marks, stars and dogs (now politely renamed “pets”) in 1968. On that matrix, Netflix has a cash cow in Qwikster and a star with trailing question marks in streaming.The traditional prescription was for businesses to reinvest the proceeds of cash cows into stars, which is what Netflix did until now. It launched a free streaming service in 2007 and later bundled it with its monthly DVD subscriptions for $2 extra a month. In July, however, it abruptly abandoned bundling and forced those who wanted both services to pay twice.Mr Hastings was influenced by Prof Christensen’s work which has rightly become a set text in Silicon Valley. As Prof Christensen noted in 1996, well-managed companies can fall prey to new technologies that are “simpler, cheaper and more convenient” than their own.He recommended that those faced with the dilemma of whether to stick with incremental improvement of products, or act radically by cannibalising their business before someone else did, should choose the latter. Companies often lost their way “precisely because they listened to their [existing] customers”.Mr Hastings added this week: “Most companies that are great at something – like AOL dial-up or Borders book stores – do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business …Companies rarely die from moving too fast and they frequently die from moving too slowly.”Leaving aside the fallacy in the last sentence (many companies die from making things that too few people yet want; that’s how markets work) his missive felt squarely aimed at the wrong audience – business strategists, professors and managers, rather than customers.Customers don’t care about corporate structures, cash flows, technologies and growth ratings. They care about whether the familiar envelope containing a DVD arrives on time and whether they can stream a good selection of films at a decent price without their television screens freezing. They were not holding Netflix back from streaming – they were adopting it.Netflix has been extremely good at providing its service, which is why it flourished while competitors fell away. Its disruption of the Blockbuster business model of charging high fees for late returns of DVDs to stores is one of the biggest reasons why that company filed for bankruptcy last year.Now Mr Hastings faces new challenges – the rising costs of leasing films, new competition from Apple, Amazon and others, and a fading DVD business which Netflix last year predicted would keep growing until 2013. His response has been to leap into the chasm.But Netflix subscribers liked both DVDs and streaming and saw them as complementary – they wanted both the traditional product and the disruptive one. Even if it made sense to split the two in financial reports and even to separate them into business divisions, there was no need to force Netflix customers to snap to the organisation chart.From a business strategy perspective, I admire Mr Hastings’ quest to revolutionise his company. From a customer’s perspective, however, I cancelled my Netflix subscription on Tuesday. I suspect the second matters more.john.gapper@ft.com"
836;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-21T00:15:24Z;Should a CEO explain strategy shifts?;Apology by Netflix’s founder prompts questions;THE PROBLEMOn Sunday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings apologised for the way the company had handled a decision to raise prices and split its streaming and DVD services. He said: “I should have personally given a full justification to our members.” Is he right? Do explanations about big strategic changes need to come straight from the CEO or do they just need to be good explanations?THE ADVICEThe academic: Paul Argenti“I messed up. I owe everyone an explanation,” wrote Reed Hastings in a missive that appeared in my inbox at 3:13am. My first thought on reading this at 6am was that he noticed that my rented copy of Shawshank Redemption had languished in Martha’s Vineyard for too long, and he was apologising for charging me a year of fees. But no, he was apologising for weak communications! Are you kidding me?In my view, this went too far. Yes, the CEO needs to be involved in strategy execution, but I didn’t even know this was a problem until Reed raised it to a level where everyone I know wanted to discuss his letter.Explain the new model, charge me for whichever of the two businesses I opt for, but no mea culpa is necessary here, Reed. Next time, stay above the fray.The writer is a professor of corporate communications at the Tuck School of Business…………………………………………..The executive: Gerald RatnerPeople would rather hear from the CEO warts and all rather than some professional PR person. The public are fed up with emollient management speak. Hiding away in an ivory tower where nobody really sees you can cause hostility. You can get away with it if you’re Facebook or Google and your results are fantastic, but when things get difficult you can’t do that.So on the one hand it was right for the CEO to deal with this personally. But on the other hand, there is the danger that CEOs can be too obsequious. You shouldn’t be too humble because people will just take advantage of it.The writer is founder of jewellery retailer geraldonline.com, and former chairman and CEO of Ratners Group…………………………………………..The PR: Mark HutcheonChange is always best communicated within an overarching narrative that connects the core decision to the future benefit of the customer and employee. And stay loyal to tone and voice of the brand. Netflix has forged a deep personal connection with its customers through the power of movies. The CEO recognises this and has taken personal responsibility to move the conversation on.Often, followers of technology brands over-focus on the CEO or founder. The CEO is a symbolic figure but not the only champion. Communicating the message through the leadership, sales force and customer service can be just as valuable. It gives the message scale and depth.The writer is an associate partner at ReputationInc
837;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-20T18:47:01Z;Netflix hit by investor confidence;;Netflix shares slumped 9.5 per cent to $130.03 on Tuesday, as the combined impact of a corporate restructuring and an unexpected fall in subscribers continued to weigh on the movie-streaming company.The stock is down 13 per cent this week, after Netflix announced on Monday that it will hive off its physical DVD delivery business into a separate company called Qwikster. Last week shares fell 24 per cent after the company revealed a pricing change introduced in July had cost it 1m new subscribers.“In the long run, it makes sense to separate into two companies because the growth profiles and future prospects of the DVD and streaming businesses are dramatically different,” said Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets. “But the brand has been tarnished because they didn’t communicate the pricing change to customers well. We don’t know how much subscriber churn there is going to be as a result.”George Askew, the Netflix analyst at Sitfel Nicolaus, said the company’s decision to set up Qwikster is a first step to selling the DVD delivery business altogether.Netflix’s market capitalisation has now fallen by more than half in just over two months, from a share price peak of $304.79 in mid-July.The wider market had a see-saw day. The S&P 500 was up as much as 1.5 per cent in mid-afternoon, but ended the day in negative territory after a late sell off.The benchmark index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,202.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,590.24. But the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 11,408.66.“The S&P 500 has always pared gains on reaching 1,220 during the past month,” said Colin Cieszynski, a market strategist at CMC Markets. “There are a lot of resting sell orders which kick in at that point, so this is a normal technical correction.”Other analysts pointed to investors paring risk ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy announcement tomorrow.Barry Knapp at Barclays Capital suggested financial stocks might sell off in anticipation of “Operation Twist”, an expected move by the Fed to lower long-term interest rates, which would in turn impact on the margins banks can charge on lending.Citigroup fell 2.8 per cent to $26.93 after RBC Capital Markets reduced earnings expectations, citing “lower than expected capital markets revenues and a lower net interest margin [on lending]”.But the worst performing sectors in the S&P 500 were industrials and materials, which fell 1 and 0.7 pe cent respectively, although companies in those sectors would stand to benefit from cheaper long-term loans.CF Industries fell 6.5 per cent to $163.67 and Cliffs Natural Resources 6.4 per cent to $70.60.Defensive stocks, including utilities and healthcare companies, were the best performers.Pharmaceutical company Celgene Corporation rose 7.1 per cent to $65.56 on expected resolution of an ongoing European review of its Revlimid product.Watson Pharmaceuticals gained 3.8 per cent to close at $72.01 on the unexpected approval of its generic Lovenox drug by US regulators.Newmont Mining jumped 5.5 per cent to $69.90 after the gold miner promised to pay out higher dividends with the price of gold at historically high levels.Newmont said it would increase its gold price- linked dividend by 7.5 cents a share for gold prices above $1,700 an ounce and 2.5 cents a share for gold prices above $2,000 an ounce.Advertising group Interpublic was the best performing stock in the S&P 500, up 8.3 per cent to $8.13, in what appeared to be a reaction by statistical traders to a sell-off in the stock on Monday.The stock had fallen more than 5 per cent on Monday and it remains well below its 50-day moving average of $9.45.Apple shares hit an all-time high of $422.86 before slipping back to $413.45, a gain of 0.5 per cent.Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse said emerging markets penetration could result in extra $68bn in sales and $18 in EPS,” for Apple by 2015.“Apple is only at the cusp of unleashing its vast EM potential”, Mr Garcha said in a note to clients.Goodrich Corp, which jumped by 15.8 per cent on Monday on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation was preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer, rose another 4 per cent to $111.82 on conflicting reports of a possible sale price.In US data news, new home construction fell 5 per cent in August to 571,000, according to numbers released on Tuesday.“The further fall in housing starts in August adds to other evidence, such as the recent drop in consumer confidence and fall in mortgage approvals, suggesting that demand for new homes remains close to rock bottom,” said analysts at Capital Economics.“This goes some way to explaining why equity prices of homebuilders have recently fallen by more than the wider market.”But homebuilder stocks took the news in their stride. PulteGroup was up 2.9 per cent to $2.85. Lennar fell 1.1 per cent to $14.31, although it remains in positive territory for the week after it revealed an increase in orders in quarterly results on Monday.
838;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-19T23:06:55Z;Netflix to split DVD and web services;;Netflix will separate its online video streaming and DVD-by-mail services into two businesses, its chief executive said.The announcement came in a corporate blog post on Sunday night after Netflix said it would begin charging separately for the two services and raised prices as much as 60 per cent, a move that was poorly received among subscribers.The company’s shares dropped nearly 15 per cent last week after Netflix said it expected 1m people to cancel their subscriptions.“I messed up. I owe everyone an explanation,” wrote Reed Hastings, chief executive. “We realised that streaming and DVD-by-mail are really becoming two different businesses, with very different cost structures, that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.”The streaming service will retain the Netflix name, while the DVD service will be renamed Qwikster, Mr Hastings said.Andrew Rendich, who has led the DVD business for the past four years, will become chief executive of the new company, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Netflix.There will be no further pricing changes but customers will be billed separately for the two services and they will use a different, non-integrated website for each, Mr Hastings said.Mr Hastings took an apologetic tone in his post, saying that “in hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success. We have done very well for a long time by steadily improving our service, without doing much CEO communication.”He said he should have more fully explained the decision to split the services to subscribers. “It wouldn’t have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.”Rich Greenfield, research analyst at BTIG, wrote in a note last week: “While Netflix thought they had weathered the worst of the storm when they reported earnings [in July], they clearly underestimated the number of people that would call back in late August/early September to cancel/alter their subscription plan as the price increase was going into effect.”He added that the shrinking subscription base in the US may open the door for competition from other video streaming services, such as Amazon, Google and Dish Network.Netflix shares dropped 7.4 per cent to $143.75 on Monday in New York.
839;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-19T21:04:56Z;Defence stocks diverge on M&A talk;;Goodrich Corp jumped 15.8 per cent to $107.60 on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation is preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer.Indications last week that Connecticut-based UTC was raising an acquisitions war chest had sent several shares in potential targets in the defence industry soaring.On Monday shares in Rockwell Collins, down 4.2 per cent to $53.87, and Textron, off 5.7 per cent at $17.57, dropped back, as UTC appeared to focus on Goodrich.Some analysts warned that those stocks could continue to see large swings, until UTC confirms an acquisition of Goodrich, but there seemed little prospect of HTC bidding for more than one company at once.“Buying Goodrich would take UTC’s net debt from 20 per cent to almost 50 per cent of market capitalisation. If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.
840;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Netflix /Qwikster: silver screen magic;It is trying an old-time trick: cutting something in two without actually doing so;Netflix is trying an old-time magic trick: appearing to cut something in two (the company, rather than a lovely assistant) without actually doing so. Following last Thursday’s announcement of poor subscriber growth, Netflix’s chief executive officer said on Sunday that the DVD and streaming video businesses would be separated. DVDs will have its own name (Qwikster), web site and payment system. Its forthcoming separation into its own operating division was announced in July and pricing is already distinct. So what has changed is the way customers will use Netflix, not the corporate structure.The immediate issue, then, is whether the move can work as a marketing ploy. Perhaps the company was having trouble selling the streaming-or-delivery model at a price that made sense in an evolving market. But it is hard to see how rejigging brands could make customers less price-sensitive in an increasingly competitive market.Perhaps the move is a step towards a sale or spin-off of the DVD business. What will the financials of the two businesses look like? Margins might not be terribly different currently. Cost of goods for streaming subscriptions was lower in the past 12 months (a quarter of total sales, versus 40 per cent for DVDs), according to Barclays estimates. Technology and marketing costs (20 per cent of sales) are surely heavily skewed towards streaming, though. But streaming margins will shrink as streaming content costs keep rising: Barclays reckons these costs will rise 80 per cent in 2012, faster than revenues.So a split could leave a larger, faster-growing but lower-margin streaming business and a higher-margin, ex-growth DVD business. Some corporate prestidigitation can make Netflix (sans Qwikster) grow even faster. So what if it’s more illusion than reality? Hey, presto!E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
841;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-19T09:56:19Z;Netflix splits DVD and streaming businesses;;Tech news from around the web:Netflix CEO Rex Hastings has announced that the online movie rental company is to separate the DVD and video streaming services, CNN reports. The DVD-by-mail service will now be called Qwikster, and the streaming service will maintain the Netflix brand. Customers can still subscribe to both, but the two sites will no longer be integrated.Google Wallet, the online company’s mobile payment and daily deals service, is set to be launched on Monday, according to TechCrunch. The service was first unveiled in May and will allow users to load credit cards onto its app and tap a mobile phone equipped with Near Field Communication to a special reader at a till to make a purchase.Staying with Google, All Things Digital reports that the company is preparing for Wednesday when its executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, faces a Senate hearing on whether the company is abusing its dominance in internet search. Google has hired at least 13 lobbying and communications firms since May, when the Federal Trade Commission launched its investigations.Associated Press and 40 newspapers have launched iCircular – a mobile version of the coupons and sales notices found in US papers, PaidContent says.

842;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-16T21:40:30Z;Wall Street enjoys best week since July;;US stocks enjoyed their best week in 11, with the S&P 500 rising on all five trading days for the first time since late June. The benchmark index was up 5.2 per cent for the week at 1,216.01.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.7 per cent to 11,509.09 and the Nasdaq Composite index 6.1 per cent to 2,622.31.But amid the strong performance, a pair of previously high-flying tech shares were hit hard by falling expectations.Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, plunged after the company reported disappointing sales of its new tablet products, just 200,000 versus forecasts of more than half a million. RIM had been hoping that its PlayBook units could compete with Apple’s iPad. It also shipped 1m fewer Blackberries than forecast.RIM was down 19 per cent on Friday, and 19.7 per cent for the week, at $23.93. That is just above the shares’ trough of $21 in August, which was a five-year low.“With Android [phones] combined with increasing distribution of the legacy iPhone 3GS from Apple at aggressive price points globally, RIM continues to lose global smartphone market share,” said Michael Walkley, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Meanwhile, Netflix, the DVD and movie-streaming subscription service, led decliners in the S&P 500 for the week, falling 24 per cent to $155.19. The company was one of the best performers in 2010, when its share price more than tripled. But it has been hit by subscriber losses after raising the price for customers who want to receive physical DVDs by post, as well as stream content online. It reported this week that it had lost 1m customers after the price change. On Friday, analysts at Jefferies lowered their price target to $190.Cyclical sectors were the top performers in the S&P 500. Consumer groups catering to discretionary spenders were up 6.9 per cent, and tech stocks rose 7.1 per cent. However, both sectors are still trading beneath their levels at the start of August, convincing some strategists that the rally is not based on a major shift in expectations.“There are only two sectors trading above their 50-day moving averages – consumer staples and utilities – and both of them are defensive in nature,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. “Until we begin to see some cyclical sectors start breaking their recent downtrends, it will be hard for the bulls to get comfortable,” they added.The top performer in the index for the week was Textron, the aircraft manufacturer. The shares added 22.1 per cent to $18.63, as the company announced a swap of convertible debt for straight debt. Analysts said it was, in effect, a share buy-back, likely reducing outstanding shares by 12 per cent, according to Credit Suisse.The shares were also on the rise amid rumours that United Technologies, the defence and industrial conglomerate, was on the hunt for acquisitions. Its shares added 7 per cent on the week to $75.50, while Rockwell Collins, another potential bid target, jumped 17.3 per cent to $56.21McGraw-Hill added 16.7 per cent to $45.29 after announcing it would split into two companies following pressure from investors. The split will result in an education group and a financial group that includes Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agency.Juniper Networks fell 6.2 per cent on the week to $20.15 after its larger rival in computer networking equipment, Cisco, announced it was launching products directly aimed at stealing customers from Juniper. Cisco’s shares added 4.9 per cent this week to $16.62.Banking shares staged a recovery following an injection of liquidity for their European counterparts, when the European Central Bank announced a dollar-swap agreement with other central banks.The KBW bank index was up 6.8 per cent, although it is still down by 16 per cent since the beginning of August. Morgan Stanley added 7 per cent this week to $16.45, and Goldman Sachs rose 5.1 per cent to $107.49. But Bank of America cut its gains on the week almost in half on Friday, ending the five days up just 2.9 per cent to $7.23.BofA shares fell 1.4 per cent Friday after Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said the company was not getting good value, as it sells assets to shore up its capital base and assure investors it can withstand an economic slowdown.Analysts this week also notched down their estimates of the costs of litigation related to writing bad mortgage loans. Glenn Schorr of Nomura said, based on a detailed study of the mortgages in question, losses could be as much as $20bn, well below previous estimates of $40bn.
843;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;S&P 500 tops 1,200;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time since September 1 as the rally stretched to four days.The benchmark closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,209.11, though bearish investors warned that it was unlikely to top 1,250 with fears about Eurozone debt still elevated.“There’s a limit to how far any rally can go without a resolution to the crisis in Europe,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financials rose 2.6 per cent, with big bank stocks to the fore.Morgan Stanley was up 7.2 per cent to $16.59 after the company paid a regular dividend on news that Wall Street veteran John Mack will step down as Chairman. The bank also paid a regular dividend on its preferred stock.Goldman Sachs also rose 3.7 per cent to $107.97.Earlier, European banks stocks had soared after central banks committed to action to provide dollar liquidity.But Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent at $43.46 on fears that weak macroeconomic data had not filtered through to a reduction in spending by its credit card holders.New England bank People’s United Financial was flat at $12.43 as Goldman initiated coverage of north-eastern banks with a “sell” rating on the stock.Goldman said north-eastern banks were “as good as it gets” in the financial sector, given the low mortgage and default rate in the prosperous region, but worried that People’s United’s stock price implied optimistic capital deployment and value creation.Netflix fell 15.6 per cent to $176.20 after the online group cut its forecast for physical DVD subscribers, as a change in pricing structure took effect.The group projected that DVD-only subscribers would reach just 2.2m by the end of September, 25 per cent fewer than the forecast it made in July. It also lowered its forecast for streaming-only subscribers from 10m to 9.8m.The fall in projected customer growth pushed the stock beneath $200 for the first time since March.“Management have clearly underestimated the impact of the price hike for the combined service,” said James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities. But he said the stock price fall might be an overreaction, as “the vast majority of Netflix growth came from its streaming-only package”.Aircraft manufacturer Textron rose 4.1 per cent to $17.44 as investors continued to be impressed by the potential for earnings-per-share growth from a debt-juggling operation announced on Wednesday.Textron will issue debt to buy back outstanding convertible bonds. Credit Suisse calculations suggest the diluted share count will fall 12 per cent if Textron is able to retire all of the outstanding convertible bonds.That would raise earnings per share at the cost of a hit to earnings per share this year from higher interest payments on the newly issued debt.But Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said the group, which relies heavily on defence spending, was unlikely to deliver sales growth. “Our scenario work indicates that Textron has less than average upside in a low growth scenario, which investors seem to believe is the most probable, and higher than average downside in a bear scenario,” he told clients.The strong run in semiconductor shares, which has seen stocks such as Micron up as much as 15 per cent this week, ran out of pace just as JPMorgan urged investors to buy into the momentum.“Semis starting to – finally – break out. Time to gas up the minivan and climb on board,” JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely wrote to clients, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index underperformed the S&P 500 on Thursday, and Micron dropped 2.2 per cent to $7.04.Life insurer Lincoln National Corporation, up 8.2 per cent at $19.78, rose more than any other stock in the S&P 500. But the stock is still underperforming peers, down 31 per cent in the quarter to date, compared with 23 per cent for the group, as its portfolio makes it sensitive to equity markets and low interest rates, according to Andrew Kligerman at UBS.Tenet Healthcare bounced 6.2 per cent to $4.77 but remains in the red for the week, after poor earnings results.Higher than expected inflation figures for August led to concerns the Fed might delay further easing. There were also signs weak macro data were working their way through to earnings expectations.
844;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-15T19:44:13Z;Netflix: valuation, not pricing, that's dubious;It is far from clear how the company can maintain mid-teens margins;Netflix’s customers and investors are now in agreement: they’re angry. The customers became mad in July, when Netflix separated pricing in the US for its DVD delivery and streaming video services, leading to a potential 60 per cent price increase. But the stock underperformed the market only slightly in the following weeks. That gap widened in August when a deal with content provider Starz ended. And on Thursday the company’s cut to guidance on the number of subscribers in the next quarter, from 25m to 24m, hit the stock hard. The shares are down 40 per cent since the July pricing change.This may look like a clear indictment of the company’s strategy. It is not. Netflix is expected to have an almost 90 per cent share of US online subscription service viewing in 2011, according to IHS Screen Digest. But competitors are everywhere. For content produced relatively recently, new entrants directly controlled by content producers – such as Time Warner’s HBO GO – are frightening. And for older “tail” content, Amazon and Hulu loom. To win this fight and hold share, therefore, Netflix has to pay up for content. The cost of subscriptions went from 51 per cent to 54 per cent of revenues in the past quarter, driven by a big increase in content costs. This cost growth will not subside as Netflix fulfils its plan to enter Latin America and, reportedly, Europe.Sooner or later, paying for content requires increasing revenue per user, which had been on a downward trajectory. How the price increase was handled can be quibbled with, but Netflix had to act. Still, that does not mean the market is wrong. It is far from clear how a company that aggregates and delivers other companies’ content can maintain Netflix’s mid-teens operating margins or a forward price/earnings ratio of 30 times. It is Netflix’s valuation, not its strategy, that is dubious.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
845;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-08T18:53:44Z;Tablet computers: come round to my pad;The game may become how to control and price and deliver services and content;The future will be crawling with tablets. The success of Apple’s iPad has convinced the world that a slim rectangle with a touch screen is tomorrow’s computer. Unit sales will grow at an average annual rate of more than 50 per cent from this year to 2015, when nearly 300m tablets will be sold, Credit Suisse expects – about the number of personal computers sold in 2008.But will any company besides Apple make sustainable tablet profits? A tablet is, in one sense, just a simple PC that, like the netbook before it, could be subject to brutal price competition. Lenovo’s introduction of a $199 tablet is one indicator of this (Hewlett-Packard’s $99 fire sale of its discontinued TouchPad does not count). Various competitors – Motorola, HP, Research in Motion, and recently Sony – have tried to price theirs near the iPad’s $500. Sales have been meagre and price cuts have often followed. There is no reason to pay up when Apple’s operating system runs more smoothly than the only real competitor – Google’s Android – and the iPad is seamlessly linked to pools of applications and content that many customers already use.This could indicate that Apple will lock-up the high end of the market while commoditisation of lower-end devices means only advertisers such as Google, or content producers and distributors from Disney to Netflix, will profit meaningfully from cheaper tablets’ popularity.If, however, the quality gap with Apple’s operating system closes over time (probably a fairly long time) there is a chance that another company will back up its tablet with an arsenal of content and services to rival Apple. If Amazon introduces a tablet, as is expected, its position in retail and digital media could provide just this threat – especially if Amazon offers a price as low as $250. In that scenario, price competition could touch even Apple’s beautiful devices.Then the game becomes how to control, price, and deliver services and content. The actual little rectangle will become an afterthought.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
847;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-08T00:22:38Z;Facebook adds Bowles to board;;Facebook has added Erskine Bowles, a Democratic political figure and academic administrator, to its board of directors.Mr Bowles served as White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton and is currently the co-chair of President Barack Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. He also served as president of the 17-campus University of North Carolina system and holds board positions with Morgan Stanley and Cousins Properties.Facebook has been building its board of directors in anticipation of an IPO, expected sometime next year. Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, was appointed to the board in June.“Erskine has held important roles in government, academia and business which have given him insight into how to build organisations and navigate complex issues,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, on Wednesday. “Along with his experience founding companies, this will be very valuable as we continue building new things to help make the world more open and connected.”The announcement comes at the same time Facebook’s revenues reportedly doubled to $1.6bn in the first six months of 2011, according to Reuters.Mr Bowles will also bring political savvy to the company in advance of the 2012 presidential elections, in which Facebook outreach is expected to figure prominently, as it did in 2008.Facebook recently hired other Washington insiders, including Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary under Mr Clinton, and Joel Kaplan, who served as George W. Bush’s deputy chief of staff.“Facebook has clearly emerged as a transformative force in the world,” Mr Bowles said. “It’s no wonder given the talent Mark has put in place and the company’s focus and dedication to its mission. I’m really looking forward to getting to work and helping Facebook however I can.”
848;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-07T20:11:23Z;Hulu owners should take the money and run;Online content is still a rocky road to profitability;While advisers in other sectors anxiously watch the latest twitches in global financial markets, technology bankers still look confident about the depth of potential bidders’ pockets. Speculation that Yahoo could again become a target after Carol Bartz’s unceremonious exit is a reminder that cash is not an issue for most would-be buyers.In this context, the auction for Hulu, the US online video site founded just four and a half years ago, has attracted offers of $1.5bn-$2bn from Amazon, Dish Network and Yahoo itself. Apple, DirecTV and Microsoft looked at an earlier stage, and according to an AllThingsD report corroborated by one person familiar with the auction this week, Google is still hovering, indicating albeit vaguely that it could offer substantially more in exchange for sweeter content agreements.Yet not everyone is convinced that Hulu’s owners should sell. Hulu was founded by NBC and News Corp’s Fox network in 2007 as an advertising-supported online outlet for their television programming. Providence Equity Partners invested $100m months later, valuing the fledgling service at $1bn, before Walt Disney, the owner of ABC, took a stake in 2009.Its revenues have grown fast, helped by last year’s launch of Hulu Plus, an $8-a-month subscription tier with a wider array of content. Jason Kilar, chief executive, has said that revenues could hit $500m this year, nearly double last year’s $263m.It has been helped by bigger trends. Analysts at eMarketer expect US online video advertising revenues to grow by 52 per cent to $2.16bn this year.But that growth has presented Hulu’s media owners with a dilemma. Its success depends on the quality of the content it offers, but the more shows ABC, Fox or NBC make available online, the more they alienate the cable and satellite companies that pay most of their bills and the retailers still selling their DVD box sets.NBC’s takeover by Comcast, which agreed to take a back seat at Hulu to satisfy regulators anxious about a cable company dictating the future of online video, has only highlighted that tension. Comcast, Providence and Disney are now seen as sellers, but News Corp is said to be on the fence.Hulu is a rare digital success for content owners. For years, critics mocked music companies for not setting up their own download site, letting Steve Jobs’ 99-cent tracks dominate the market at iTunes.Quite apart from the financial returns, which have exceeded expectations, Hulu has given the networks more of a say in how their content is consumed online. Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG, calls the idea of selling now “a mistake of epic proportions”. A mishandled sale certainly risks further empowering a technology giant such as Google, Amazon or Apple just when content companies are fretting that they are already too influential.In the same breath, however, Mr Greenfield notes that media companies have “utterly failed at building their own digital assets”. There are broader questions about media groups’ ability to invent the digital future in-house, and about the sustainability of Hulu’s success under its current ownership.Now, no one is pressing record labels to set up their own digital music store. Instead, the music industry is finally seeing glimmers of growth as competition to iTunes flourishes from alternatives such as Spotify and Google Music. Vevo, the labels’ music video venture with Google, has given them an income stream and a measure of control over online content.The lesson of the past decade has been that content owners’ attempts to keep everything in-house, or to favour one digital distributor, rarely work and rarely last. Hulu has many challenges to crack. It is only at the start of its international expansion plans, and advertising is still an unsatisfactory revenue stream for professional online video.It would undoubtedly benefit from the online advertising clout, mobile device savviness and international brand strength of an Amazon, Google or even Yahoo. The ideal outcome for media companies would be to have three or more strong competitors bidding against each other for their content. Selling to Google, for example, would create a strong counterweight to Netflix and Amazon.Hulu always looked like a temporary solution, a stepping stone to the TV Everywhere promise of making a full programming array available to subscribers on any device, any time.That people are talking about a valuation in the billions of dollars is a remarkable achievement, but joint ventures rarely last. Already, the conflicts of interest are showing. Hulu’s owners should take the money and run, reinvesting it in content that will cut through the digital clutter.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editor
849;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-06T18:06:33Z;US banks lead Wall Street lower;;US bank stocks fell sharply on Tuesday – following the lead of their European counterparts 24 hours earlier – as renewed fears about eurozone sovereign debt hit investors’ confidence as they returned from a long Labor Day weekend.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 led the market lower, with bank shares down 1.8 per cent as the S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,165.24.The broad index has now more than reversed the late August four-day rally, and is trading only 60 points above its year lows seen early last month.“There is no reason to think this ends anytime soon,” said Dan Greenhouse, chief strategist at BTIG, blaming European politicians for the falls in US equities.Morgan Stanley was the biggest faller among the big banks, off 4 per cent at $15.33. Citigroup fell 2.5 per cent to $27.70. Bank of America, the biggest faller in early trading, pared some losses to close down 3.6 per cent at $6.99.On top of bond market jitters about Italian sovereign debt, US banks had their own bad news to contend with, as federal lawsuits against big banks dominated US headlines over the holiday weekend. The possible settlement of one case concerning foreclosure practices was balanced by a new case announced on Friday over mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.But Nomura analyst Brian Foran held out hope for bank stocks, predicting mortgage refinancing revenue “will be big in the second half of 2011”.In a note to clients Mr Foran argued that as many as 75 per cent of US mortgage holders have an incentive to refinance at current record low interest rates. “Capacity constraints and pricing power,” mean banks are better placed than customers to benefit, as they can charge customers interest rates higher than banks’ own cost of funding.Mr Foran upgraded Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp – up 1.4 per cent at $9.75 – from hold to buy, because of its large mortgage book.Mr Foran also said big mortgage originators, Wells Fargo – down 1.2 per cent to $23.92 – and Bank of America should receive temporary revenue boosts from refinancing.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said another refinancing spike, “would be helpful but not a game changer”.Even at the peak of the last refinancing spike in the fourth quarter of last year, mortgage refinancing revenue only accounted for 14 per cent of revenue at Wells Fargo and 11 per cent at Fifth Third.Credit Suisse recommended clients buy regional bank stocks, arguing low interest rates are already priced into their business models because most regional bank lending is to commercial clients at variable rates.On the other hand, national banks are likely to see interest rate margins compress over time, as fixed rate consumer loans mature and are refinanced at lower rates.Analyst Craig Siegenthaler recommended buying Fifth Third, Zions and Synovus Financial.But Zions and Synovus both fell, down 1.2 per cent to $15.99 and 2.2 per cent to $1.31 respectively. Bellwether regional bank, Regions Financial was among the the biggest fallers in the S&P 500, down 5.8 per cent at $3.89.Consumer discretionary stocks fell 0.4 per cent, with Harley Davidson, down 2.4 per cent to $35.15, suffering after a survey of dealers by RBC Capital Markets found sales growth likely slowed in August.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 4 per cent to $4.21.But consumer staples were also off 0.4 per cent, and utilities were down 0.6 per cent as defensive stocks fared badly too.Netflix shares rose 2.7 per cent to $218.77, after the company announced its Latin American customers will have access to Miramax content.Netflix shares are still down almost 10 per cent for the month after the breakdown, last week, of contract renewal talks with the cable network Starz.International Paper Company, the largest US pulp and paper maker, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500. Its shares rose 8.9 per cent to $27.77 after the company successfully concluded its 3 month battle to acquire shipping-box manufacturer Temple InlandThe $3.7bn bid values Temple-Inland at $32 a share. Temple shares rose 25 per cent to $30.85.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, underwriters of Dunkin’ Brands summer IPO, both initiated coverage of the donut and coffee chain owner. Goldman told clients to sell the stock. Morgan Stanley rated it hold. Analysts at both banks said the potential for earnings growth was already reflected in the share price.Dunkin shares rose 0.1 per cent to $27.02Energy stocks were down 1.1 per cent, but Sunoco was up 5.3 per cent at $38.03, after the chemical manufacturer decided to shut its last two petroleum refineries.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 0.9 per cent at 11,139.3, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,473.83.
850;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Netflix to test Brazilian broadband;;"As the FT first reported in May, Netflix, the US-based DVD subscription and online video streaming service, is setting up in Latin America.The US-based group launched its movie and TV streaming business at the Grand Hyatt in São Paulo with much fanfare on Monday, saying it would launch in virtually every country in Latin America by next Monday.The service promises to throw open Brazil’s home movie market to competition. The DVD of blockbuster animated film Rio, for instance, costs a pricey R$39.90 (about US$24) at the Livraria Cultura bookshop in central São Paulo.A monthly subscription to Netflix will cost only R$14.99.Anti-piracy advocates hope the reasonable price and easier access to movies and television programmes provided by legitimate online services such as Netflix will help deter piracy. Brazil remains on the US watchlist for countries that violate intellectual property rights, according to the 2011 Special 301 Report of the Office of the United States Trade Representative.From the report:Piracy and counterfeiting persist at significant levels in Brazil, including book piracy and a reported growth in piracy over the Internet. While enforcement efforts improved, including a larger number of raids and seizures, stronger enforcement at the border and deterrent level sentences are still needed.Netflix also promises to test the robustness of Brazil’s broadband network. According to the Associated Press:Only 20 per cent of Brazil’s 42m internet users have a connection speed above 500 kilobytes per second, according to a May report from Ibope Nielsen Online. A speed of around 800 kilobytes per second is the minimum required to stream movies online.The issue of internet access is a wider problem for Brazil as it seeks to build a more productive economy. A study (in Portuguese) by Ipea, Brazil’s institute of applied economic research, suggests multiple ways for the government to promote universal internet access.These include reducing the tax burden on mobile phones and televisions (in addition to existing tax breaks on computers, tablets and fibre optic networks) to make them more affordable as a means of accessing the internet.Netflix may want to bring Hollywood to all Brazil. But first Brazil will need to find ways to bring broadband to more Brazilians.Related reading:

851;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-02T22:08:24Z;DirecTV knocked out of battle for Hulu;;The race to buy Hulu, the online video site, became a three-way fight between Amazon, Yahoo and Dish Network, after DirecTV, the satellite TV operator, was ruled out of the auction for submitting too low a bid, said people familiar with the situation.The three leading bids for Hulu are in the $1.5bn-$2bn range, said a person close to Hulu.With three of its shareholders direct competitors with each other, a sale is not necessarily certain. However, one person close to the situation expressed confidence in the completion of a sale, describing the auction as “robust and competitive”.The US-based site, which in the past three years has become one of the biggest online video services, is being sold by its owners: News Corporation, Walt Disney, NBC Universal and Providence Equity Partners.Hulu, which has thousands of hours of hit TV shows on its site, including Modern Family, The Office and Saturday Night Live, recently unveiled plans to launch its service in Japan. The sale of the company initially attracted a broad field of interested bidders, with Google, Apple and Microsoft among the companies to explore a potential acquisition.But, after first round bids were submitted, the field narrowed significantly. Amazon has an established connection with the group: Jason Kilar, a former Amazon executive, is the chief executive of Hulu and remains close to Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who is his former boss.“Buying Hulu would propel Amazon’s video strategy forward with exclusive content versus Netflix and others,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, in a recent note. “It could also create a unique marketing advantage for the coming Amazon tablet.”Yahoo is keen to bolster its network of advertising-supported sites with the professionally made content provided by Hulu. The deal is also attractive to Yahoo because Hulu is a dual revenue stream business, generating income from 1m paying subscribers as well as advertisers.Dish Network is also keen to buy Hulu. The satellite TV provider recently acquired Blockbuster, the DVD rental chain, out of bankruptcy and wants to build a viable digital alternative to Netflix, the DVD and online streaming group that has upended TV viewing trends and the broader home entertainment market.Hulu was created by its media company owners in response to YouTube, to provide them with a digital platform that could retain TV viewers who were migrating online.The site’s growth has surpassed expectations, although the journey has not always been smooth. Mr Kilar recently angered his media company shareholders when he wrote a blog post that lambasted the traditional TV business model. He also tried to lead an initial public offering of Hulu but failed to generate sufficient investor interest.However, an outright sale of the company quickly became the most favoured option, with several companies coveting the site and its growing subscriber base.But not everyone is convinced a sale of the company would be best for its media company shareholders. Mr Greenfield has described the auction as “a mistake of epic proportions”.“While Hulu can generate meaningful value for media companies owned by a third party … maintaining ownership in Hulu would allow [its shareholders] to build significant long-term equity value, have direct control of their digital future and propel Hulu’s growth in unique, proprietary ways,” he wrote in his recent note.Hulu’s biggest competitor is Netflix, which suffered a setback this week when Starz Entertainment, the premium cable network that owns rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures, ended discussions on a contract renewal.The termination of talks, which means Walt Disney, Sony and Pixar films will not be available on Netflix after February 28 next year, sent Netflix shares down more than 8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday.The shares failed to rally on Friday, although some analysts expressed confidence that Netflix had time to replace Starz’ content with programming and films from other suppliers.“We believe TV studios are more willing than ever to license content to Netflix and there is a lot of content still available,” said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital.
852;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Mortgage mis-selling cloud hangs heavy over banks;;Weak employment data and reports that a government regulator would bring mortgage-related lawsuits against US-based banks, reversed what had been a week of strong gains on Wall Street.By Wednesday the S&P 500 index had recorded four successive days of gains for the first time since late June, and by Monday the index had closed above 1,200 for the first time since August 4. But at midday Friday it was down 1.7 per cent on the day.Traders said the sell-off was driven by the payrolls data, which showed the economy failed to add any jobs in August. But they said the decision by a government regulator to bring lawsuits against banks, would exacerbate problems.“[The bank lawsuits] kind of shocks me. Why would the administration, which has control over these things, let a regulator sue the banks, when it’s trying to create jobs?” said Randy Warren, fund manager at Warren Financial Service.“The banks have been leading markets lower for three years, and now we could go back to the lows at the start of August,” he added.The S&P 500 index was at 1,183.58, up only 0.5 per cent for the week, far beneath the week high of 1,230 on Wednesday. Financial stocks in the index were down 2.8 per cent Friday, and off 0.7 per cent for the week.The lawsuit to be bought by the Federal Housing and Finance Agency will accuse banks of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said the biggest US players in mortgage securitisation up to 2008 were Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.All three stocks fell on Friday. Bank of America, down 6.5 per cent on the day and 4.6 per cent lower for the week, was among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Goldman fell 4.6 per cent Friday to $106.96. The stock was down 4.3 per cent for the week and on course for its second day of big losses after the bank wrote down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans on Thursday as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.JPMorgan shares were down 3.9 per cent at $34.90, a 3.6 per cent loss for the week. Regional banks, which originated many mortgages, but were less active in securitisation, fared slightly better. Regions Financial was down 2.2 per cent to $4.22 on Friday. But Citigroup, which Mr Staite said had not been active in securitising, was down 3.7 per cent on Friday and 3.2 per cent lower for the week at $28.90.“The lawsuit leaves huge uncertainty hanging over the whole sector,” Mr Staite said.“The fact that a regulator has filed a case may add credibility to private lawsuits that are already pending. And more suits could follow in the next year.”Mr Staite said bank stocks could remain volatile for some time, as investors have no real way of calculating either how much lawsuits will cost, or how able banks are to withstand losses.“There is no precedent for similar lawsuits, so investors don’t know how the courts will react. And banks have been reluctant to disclose the size of their legal reserves, because the people making claims might use the information to their advantage.”Netflix, the DVD and movie-streaming website, fell 9.3 per cent on Friday, down 4.9 per cent for the week at $211.70, after the cable network Starz broke off contract renewal talks over differences in pricing and packaging.“We believe Starz accounts for roughly 8 per cent of total NFLX viewing hours and the absence of the Starz content diminishes NFLX overall film content,” Credit Suisse analyst John Blackledge said.However he maintained his $310 target price and urged clients to buy while the share price was depressed.AT&T was down 2.9 per cent for the week at $28.19, after the government declared its intention to block the mobile network’s $39bn bid for smaller rival T Mobile, on competition grounds.Sprint, the third-largest network in the US, which would be dwarfed by both AT&T and Verizon, was the main beneficiary of the government’s move. Despite a 5 per cent fall Friday, Sprint shares were still up 9.2 per cent for the week at $3.55.Newmont Mining, was a top performer, up 2.7 per cent on Friday at $64.18. The stock was up 3.2 per cent for the week suggesting there was still plenty of appetite for counter-cyclical stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.3 per cent for the week at 11,315.53, but the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1 per cent to 2,505.22.
853;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-09-01T23:17:14Z;Setback for Netflix as Starz ends talks;;Netflix, the fast-growing online video service, suffered a big setback on Thursday when Starz Entertainment, the premium cable network that owns rights to films by Walt Disney and Sony Pictures, ended discussions on a contract renewal.Netflix has been supplying films from Disney, Disney’s Pixar label, and Sony to its 25m DVD and online streaming subscribers thanks to its relationship with Starz, which is controlled by John Malone’s Liberty Media.But news that negotiations had been terminated on a contract that Netflix has called “one of our most important deals” sent Netflix shares down more than 8 per cent in after-market trading.The existing four-year contract ends in February 2012 and, unless a new agreement can be struck, Disney, Pixar and Sony titles will not return to the Netflix service.“When the agreement expires … Starz will cease to distribute its content on the Netflix streaming platform,” said Chris Albrecht, Starz chief executive. “This decision is a result of our strategy to protect the premium nature of our brand by preserving the appropriate pricing and packaging of our exclusive and highly valuable content.”Netflix said it was “grateful” for the early notice of the Starz’s decision, “which will give us time to license other content before Starz expires”.It added that Starz content was a “huge” part of viewing on Netflix several years ago but said it now represented 8 per cent of the content available on the service.If the two sides cannot reach a new agreement, Starz will be free to license its content to the other online video platforms that are competing with Netflix.Amazon recently launched its own premium video service, while Google’s YouTube platform could also emerge as a likely buyer of Starz’ programming. Hulu, the online video service owned by News Corp, Walt Disney and NBC Universal, is on the auction block but may also become a viable buyer of Starz’ films and other content.Starz is not the first supplier to withhold its content from Netflix. Showtime, the premium cable network owned by CBS, recently pulled its programming from the company’s service.Hundreds of Sony titles have been missing from the service in recent weeks and were apparently withdrawn by Sony when the number of viewers exceeded a pre-agreed limit.Starz supplies about 2,500 titles to Netflix, which will make a considerable dent in the size of its streaming service’s content library: it has more than 10,000 titles available to view.However, Netflix, which is expanding into Latin America, continues to strike content deals, and recently added Miramax films to its service.Netflix has grown rapidly in recent years, adding films and TV programming from a range of providers. Its content represents 30 per cent of traffic flowing to US web users in peak viewing hours. However, the group recently antagonised many of its subscribers when it raised prices for its combined DVD subscription and streaming services by almost 60 per cent.
854;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;How Jobs made Apple fit for the future;The group is really three lashed together;As Apple moves from a period of charismatic leadership under Steve Jobs to more organisational leadership under the more low-key Tim Cook, it is following a managerial tradition that pertains in every successful organisation when the founder entrepreneur retires. As Mr Jobs leaves his chief executive post, attention has rightly been paid to his record as a product and marketing innovator, but less to his management style – which, both good and bad, is inimitable. Along with his enviable aesthetic sense, focus and negotiating prowess came a readiness to humiliate and embarrass others.As with many highly effective men, it is much easier to know whether one would like to invest in Mr Jobs or buy one of his products than if one would like to work for him. It would be a case of “yes”, to the fascinating demands and the opportunity to succeed on an epic scale, and “no” to the shouting and abuse. I met a Silicon Valley psychologist this year who told me that much of his practice was made up of recovering Apple employees.To discover the useful lessons of Mr Jobs’s managerial legacy, it is worth depersonalising the company he has built. For instance, Apple is not really one company, but three very different organisations lashed together and devastatingly fit for purpose.At the top is a small company, a decision-making and innovation group made up of senior executives with specialised knowledge, covering Apple’s products and functions. They live and work in Cupertino in California and are physically clustered close to the offices of Mr Jobs and Mr Cook. They range from the heads of marketing and finance, to the design group, which occupies its own building and workshop. Members of this group take total responsibility for anything that occurs on their watch and are summarily fired if they fail.The hierarchy around them looks flat, but when they make decisions and issue orders, they expect them to be fulfilled with little questioning. They have no interest in watching 1,000 flowers of innovation bloom all over the company. Employees are not empowered to make a difference. They are expected to do a clearly defined job and do it as well as they can.Apple’s aversion to big mergers or acquisitions also liberates senior managers from this most tedious, and often disastrous, path to growth.Within this small group, the principle of “talent density” applies. By having just a few very talented people working very hard you not only get superb work, but also reduce the waste incurred by office politics. It is a principle now very popular in the Valley since it was given a label by Reed Hastings, founder of Netflix. The idea is that one great employee can do the work of five lesser ones, without the need for bickering, cc’d e-mails and interventions from human resources. Mr Jobs has hired consistently along these lines.The second company consists of most of the 46,000 other full-time Apple employees, most of whom are in marketing and sales. A surprising number of these are the fresh-faced university graduates sweating it out behind the Genius Bars in Apple’s stores – highly educated yet counting their blessings to have a job.The third company is made up of the vast armies of contract manufacturing employees across Asia, at companies such as Foxconn, who assemble Apple’s products. This is very much Mr Cook’s creation. As a supply chain expert, he pulled Apple out of manufacturing in the late 1990s, and established these contract relationships. No inventory and no unions have been vital to forcing down Apple’s costs. But it has taken a very different kind of management from that required in either the first or second companies.Mr Cook uses what he calls Apple’s “mother of all balance sheets”, now stockpiled with $76bn of cash, to exercise control over his suppliers. Rather than owning plants or managing inventory or factory employees, Mr Cook corners the market in existing components, such as flash memory, and finances the expensive and exclusive production of new components so Apple has access to them long before rivals do. Bringing truckloads of cash to the low-margin manufacturing and assembly business buys Apple a lot of loyalty and discipline. Coupled with Apple’s knack for forecasting demand, it allows Mr Cook precise control without ownership, the aspiration of supply chain management.Apple’s structure allows for rapid decision-making at the top and unwavering discipline and efficient execution at the bottom, both vital in this era of ever faster product cycles.

855;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Walmart’s online movies overtake Amazon;;Walmart has become one of the largest providers of movies online in the US, overtaking established operators such as Sony and Amazon and competing directly with Apple’s iTunes store, according to a new report.The retailer is the largest seller of DVDs in the US and has generated $3.5bn in revenues for Hollywood in 2010, according to IHS Screen Digest, a media research firm.But with physical disc sales in steep decline, Walmart has been aggressively building an online presence. It bought Vudu, an online film store, last year and has discounted prices of digital movies to increase market share.The report from IHS Screen Digest found that Vudu’s share of the nascent digital movie market – which includes digital downloads and online movie rentals – rose from just 1 per cent in the first half of 2010 to 5.3 per cent in the first half of 2011.Walmart’s growth came at Sony’s expense, said Arash Amel, the report’s author. “The Sony PlayStation store fell out of the top three rankings chiefly because [of] Vudu,” he said. “The global security breach that shut down Sony’s online gaming operations during the first half [of 2011] had a deleterious impact on the PlayStation store’s business.”Walmart recently launched its Vudu service on the iPad device, saying it wanted the service to be available “anywhere and everywhere”.But it has some way to go before it overtakes Apple, which remains the dominant online movie retailer. Apple’s iTunes store slightly increased its share from 64.9 per cent to 65.8 per cent of the market.Digital film sales are growing, albeit modestly, and represent only a tiny fraction of the revenues generated by physical discs. Revenues from DVDs generated more than $20bn a year at their peak five years ago but total US online film sales and digital rentals were just $229m in the first half of 2011, compared with $183m in the first half of 2010.Total US digital revenues, which excludes subscription operators such as Netflix, will be $487m by the end of 2011, according to IHS Screen Digest.With online movie sales not growing as quickly as expected, several operators have changed tack. Amazon has shifted its online movie business to a streaming video-on-demand model: the online retailer has made 9,000 movies and television programmes available to members of its Amazon Prime premium delivery service.Amazon has also increased the number of movies and TV shows available on its instant video service, following recent content deals with CBS and NBC Universal. It now has 100,000 titles available to buy or rent online: users of the service will be able to stream TV programmes the day after they have aired in the US.The addition of new content to the Amazon service comes as Hulu, the online video site owned by NBC Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp, is nearing a sale, with potential buyers due to submit first found bids.Microsoft was the second-largest online movie retailer in the first half of the year, thanks to its Zune Video Marketplace, according to IHS Screen Digest. But the group’s share of the market declined to 16.2 per cent, from 18.5 per cent during the same period in 2010.
856;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Walmart launches video service for iPad;;Walmart is launching its video streaming service on Apple’s iPad as it steps up digital investments to counter the effect of declining DVD sales, a waning staple of its retail business.The world’s largest retailer by revenue announced the new platform for its Vudu video service on Wednesday, saying that streaming user numbers and revenues had tripled so far this year. Vudu lets consumers buy and rent movies via a variety of devices.Vudu, which Walmart acquired in 2010, is growing from a low base and the company declined to provide specific figures, but analysts say it is gaining ground in spite of stiff competition from Apple’s iTunes, the market leader, and a crowd of competitors.Video-on-demand and Vudu’s cloud computing system are far from Walmart’s comfort zone in big box retail, but the service underlines how falling sales at the company’s US business are forcing it into unconventional new ventures.In a reminder of the inherent difficulties, Walmart confirmed on Tuesday that it would close its digital music store at the end of this month, nearly eight years after opening it in an unsuccessful effort to take on iTunes, which also opened in 2003.Edward Lichty, Vudu’s general manager, told the Financial Times that iPad accessibility would enhance Vudu’s appeal to existing and new users. “We want Vudu to be available anywhere and everywhere [that] people want to consume media,” he said.Vudu has signed licensing deals with “all major Hollywood studios and scores of independents” as well as television production companies, Mr Lichty said.It was adding 4,000 or so new titles a month and made most movies available as soon as they were released on DVD.Walmart is the biggest seller of DVDs in the US, accounting for 40 per cent of all sales last year, according to IHS Screen Digest, a research group. But the market is contracting as more consumers watch movies from video streaming services instead.Walmart said last month that it would integrate Vudu with its main Walmart.com website, making it more visible to potential users.Beyond iTunes, Vudu’s pay-as-you-go service is also competing against Microsoft’s Zune service, which is available via its Xbox 360 console, and a Sony video streaming service available on its PlayStation3, as well as Amazon Instant Video.Those services are distinct from Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, which let users stream older movies from libraries for a fixed monthly fee.Tom Adams of IHS Screen Digest said: “The iPad will be more attractive with a groovy service like Vudu, and Walmart’s choice is between staying in a shrinking packaged DVD market or getting into a growing digital one, so it makes sense to go digital.”He said one challenge for Vudu was that Apple, Microsoft and Sony were using video services to attract consumers to their hardware and were willing to lose money on some movies.Mr Lichty, while declining to provide any financial information on Vudu, said: “We’re not in the business of selling content at a loss.”Before Wednesday’s iPad launch, Mr Lichty said Vudu was most commonly used on the PlayStation3, Blu-ray players and high-definition televisions.When it reports earnings next week, Walmart will tell investors whether it has ended a run of eight consecutive quarters of falling like-for-like sales in the US, blamed on a weak economy, changing consumer preferences and poor merchandise choices.
857;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-08-06T00:38:54Z;Digital deals boost Viacom profits;;Robust third-quarter results for Viacom, the media group behind MTV and Paramount Pictures, have capped a week of strong earnings for the television and film industry, even as shares in many of the sector’s companies have fallen with the broader market.Double-digit gains in revenues and net earnings at Viacom were driven by growth in the fees that cable operators and digital distributors pay to carry Viacom’s shows and movies. Revenues for the quarter were up 15 per cent to $3.77bn, while net earnings were up 33 per cent to $574m from the same time a year earlier.Viacom has joined CBS and NBC in growing more willing to sell programming to new digital distributors such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.“These new digital deals come with very high margin and fortunately for us, there was a lot more room for incremental growth from these types of deals, both in the US and internationally,” said Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom. “We are talking with a number of new partners who are entering the digital distribution arena.”Such deals, which can be worth $100m a year each, helped Viacom for the quarter.“This is the first example of a cable network business demonstrating clear and significant revenue potential from online distribution of largely library content,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne.Mr Swinburne said Viacom and other media groups will continue to derive increased revenues from such deals. “While these revenues will probably be lumpy, consistent with our ‘connected TV’ thesis, there is likely to be more ahead as new entrants emerge, including moving from library sales to live linear streaming,” he said.The long-term concern among analysts and media executives is that as Netflix, Amazon and other digital distributors have access to more content, consumers will cancel their subscriptions to cable and satellite operators. But in the last quarter, media groups have shown they can benefit from the new competitive landscape.“Right now, we’re in this goldilocks scenario where the media companies are picking up loose change by relicensing old catalogue content,” said Craig Moffett, Bernstein Research senior analyst. “At least so far they believe there is no cannibalisation on their core subscription business.”Viacom said revenues for its TV networks, which include MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, were up 16 per cent to $2.4bn for the quarter. Paramount Pictures revenues were up 13 per cent for the quarter to $1.4bn.CBS, Time Warner, Comcast, Discovery Communications and DirecTV all posted strong quarterly results this week as content owners benefited from new bidders at the table, and consumer demand for cable and satellite subscriptions proved robust.But media stocks were down for the week as investors punished shares particularly exposed to volatile consumer spending. “Right now people are selling stocks indiscriminately,” Mr Moffett said. “A lot of that relates to simple selling indices, especially the consumer discretionary index.”
858;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-08-03T18:08:31Z;Bears take aim at Wall St’s two-year bull run;Bruising summer has placed the index on cusp of a breakdown;"There is little cheer on Wall Street. A bruising summer has placed the benchmark S&P 500 index on the cusp of a breakdown that could imperil an impressive bull run that began more than two years ago.The world’s most followed equity index briefly tumbled into negative territory for the year this week. Ominously, it sits below its 200-day moving average and has been testing a bullish trend line that dates back to the market’s nadir in March 2009. These moves come after the market has dropped for each of the past three months. A modest rebound on Wednesday left the S&P down 7.6 per cent at 1,260.34 since the bull run peaked at 1,363.61 at the end of April.Any relief that the US has avoided a debt default has been wiped out by a string of economic reports that cast doubt over a second half economic rebound.Bullish investors, who backed the recovery, are now searching for glimmers of positive news in the hope this will stabilise the market and confirm this week’s sell-off as a temporary dip.For many, the monthly jobs number for July, due on Friday, now looms as a critical event. Further evidence of economic weakness could push the S&P down towards the 1,200 level.“We need a catalyst to change the mindset of investors and a good piece of data would help enormously,” says Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.For the undaunted, the recent weakness is only making stocks look more attractive on a long term horizon. Based on conservative projections for 2011, the S&P p/e ratio is below 13 times, a historically attractive valuation. Dividend yields for many strong companies compare favourably with the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.58 per cent.“Earnings are still robust and valuations are not rich, we don’t think the economy is heading into the tank,” says Jim Sarni, managing principal at Payden & Rygel. “There is just a lot of nervousness and we have a stock market that is stepping back and recalibrating expectations of lower economic growth.”That growing nervousness has pushed investors to look past solid second-quarter earnings to the impact of a deepening crisis in the eurozone and a possible “double-dip” in the US. The attractive valuations on stocks may simply be pricing in the realistic prospect of a halt to the recovery, or worse.“The problem with strong earnings coupled with a weak economy is that investors tend to be less willing to pay up for those earnings,” says Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo. “That could keep valuations low.”Companies have compounded the gloom, some lowering guidance for future earnings and others not providing it as they have become less confident about the third quarter. Out of the 360 companies that have reported second-quarter results, 76 have provided guidance for the next quarter, with 51, or 67 per cent, lowering their outlooks, says John Butters, senior equity analyst at FactSet.Notable examples of companies dropping their third-quarter earnings estimates include Tyco International, Illinois Tool Works, Netflix and Texas Instruments.And, as earnings become more difficult to forecast, investors are placing lower value on future income prospects, which translates into a lower multiple on current earnings.Over the course of the second quarter, analysts cut their third-quarter earnings forecasts for six out of the 10 S&P sectors, led by materials and financials.“The press releases have been overwhelmingly bullish, but the lack of quantitative guidance suggests to me that companies are reluctant to commit to exact expectations in an uncertain economic environment,” says Christine Short, senior manager at S&P Valuation Risk.Adam Parker, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, says: “We expect earnings per share growth in coming years to be more volatile and lower than historical norms, both of which are negative for the multiple.” He has lowered his base case scenario for the p/e multiple on the S&P 500 by the end of 2011 to just 12 times earnings, from the 13.5 times multiple seen last year.Healthcare is among the sector hardest hit, down 8 per cent in the past three months.Technology shares have shown relative resilience, falling 3.5 per cent in the past three months.“Our defensive sectors include technology, or what we call ‘tech staples’,” says Nicholas Bohnsack, strategist at Strategas. “Microsoft is a prime example, as it has a diversified, multi-
billion dollar product portfolio that does not ebb and flow as the market does.”The uncertainty in the market comes as many investors have moved to the sidelines, choosing to stockpile cash.“People are looking at whether they should catch a falling knife or wait for the market to turn,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Mr Sarni says: “I view this more in the camp of a buying opportunity. You have three choices at any given time: you can buy, sell or hold . . . We are buyers as what we are seeing is volatility along the way to a long drawn out recovery.”"
859;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-08-03T17:12:34Z;Basketball racks up Time Warner revenues;;Basketball tournaments and a raunchy comedy helped Time Warner, the US entertainment group, post an increase in second-quarter revenues and profits.Strong ratings for the US college basketball tournament and a 25 per cent ratings boost for the National Basketball Association playoffs on the TNT network led to higher advertising revenues, while The Hangover II grossed more than $563m internationally, becoming the most successful R-rated comedy of all time.Overall revenues for the second quarter were $7bn, up 10 per cent from the same time a year earlier, the highest quarterly revenue growth in 10 years for the company. Net income was $638m, up 13.5 per cent.“Top-line results were largely ahead of expectations, as the revenue at each segment beat our forecasts,” said Benjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a note. Nonetheless, the shares fell 1.2 per cent to $69 by midday in weak New York trading.Revenues from Time Warner’s TV networks, which include TNT and HBO, rose 9 per cent from a year earlier to $3.45bn. The Warner Brothers film studio posted a 13 per cent gain to $2.85bn. The Time Inc publishing unit also posted gains, as magazine subscriptions rebounded.On a call with analysts, Jeff Bewkes, chief executive, emphasised Time Warner’s ongoing efforts to use new technologies to extract value from its content. Through initiatives across TV, film and publishing, Time Warner is “positioning ourselves to take advantage of new digital opportunities,” he said.The HBO Go application, which allows subscribers of the premium channel to watch shows and movies on tablet computers, has been downloaded more than 4m times. Mr Bewkes said Time Warner’s TV Everywhere programme, which allows subscribers to watch TV on computers and tablets, was making progress.With Nielsen, the ratings agency, now incorporating TV Everywhere usage in its data, Mr Bewkes said Time Warner was “agnostic to whether viewers watch our shows on TVs, PCs or mobile devices.”For film releases, Time Warner will begin rolling out the Ultraviolet programme later this year, which will allow customers to watch films online if they buy a DVD.Time Inc, meanwhile, will make available all 21 of its US magazine titles on all tablet platforms by the end of the year.“Similar to what we are doing in our other businesses, it’s another example of the aggressive steps we are taking to accelerate the digital transition and help define these new business models,” said Mr Bewkes.While other TV and film groups are generating hundreds of millions of dollars by selling content to digital distributors such as Netflix and Amazon, Time Warner has been more cautious, prompting analysts to ask Mr Bewkes if he would become more aggressive in striking deals.“We’re already selling some products to Netflix and we have ongoing discussions with all of the digital outlets, Apple, Amazon, Netflix to sell series and movies,” Mr Bewkes said.But Mr Bewkes said Time Warner would hold out for deals it felt extracted the full value of its programming. “Some of the sales that we saw content owners make to various digital outlets actually under-valued or reduced the lifetime stream of earnings for those products,” he said.Time Warner raised its full-year outlook, as the final instalment of the Harry Potter films broke box office records since its July release. But the success of Harry Potter films will make for tough comparisons in the second and third quarter next year, said David Joyce of Miller Tabak.
860;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-08-02T22:23:45Z;CBS benefits from digital distribution;;New deals with digital distributors helped CBS increase its second quarter revenues and profits.The US TV group’s revenues from content licensing and distribution were $889m for the three months ended June 30, a 21 per cent rise from the same time a year earlier.CBS is receiving about $200m from Netflix over two years, and last week it also struck a deal with Amazon that will allow the online retailer to stream the network’s content online. Analysts at Barclays Capital estimate Amazon will pay CBS $100m over less than two years.“We are capitalising on the value of our content by selling it to new distributors without taking away from established revenue streams,” said Les Moonves, CBS chief executive. “New entrants are coming into the marketplace all the time and we will look to negotiate additional prudent, online distribution deals going forward.”Dish Network, the US satellite TV provider, said this week it would spend aggressively to acquire more content, and BarCap analysts believe CBS is in talks for similar deals with companies such as Microsoft and Facebook.Last week, CBS struck a new deal that will allow Netflix to stream some of its shows in Canada and Latin America. “International expansion is a key strategic growth area for our company, and this deal represents a significant step in that process,” said Mr Moonves.None of the shows CBS is offering to Netflix and Amazon are currently on the air, leading Mr Moonves to suggest that the deals are unlikely to cannibalise TV viewers and advertisers.“At the heart of all the success is great content,” said Mr Moonves. “Our content is performing extremely well and we are increasingly distributing it in the most profitable ways with new possibilities opening up all the time.”Overall advertising revenues, which include CBS’s broadcast network, local TV stations and billboard business, were up 3 per cent.CBS’s publishing house, Simon & Schuster, was the one weak spot for the quarter, with revenues falling 3 per cent to $183m. Though digital content revenues more than doubled, they could not offset falling print sales. Publishing profitability improved, however, thanks in part to the better margins from e-books.Overall, revenues were $3.59bn for the quarter, up 8 per cent year on year. Net earnings were $395m, up more than 150 per cent.
861;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-08-01T18:32:22Z;Internet launches new episode for TV groups;;The internet was supposed to be bad for the television business. Free online content was going to steal eyeballs away from TVs, depriving networks of their advertising base and cable operators of subscribers.But television has not gone the way of the music business, which has suffered as a result of the web.Mainstream shows produced by the big networks are the most popular content online, and the cable operators are now streaming shows to computers and tablets.Last week, a flurry of new agreements between networks, cable operators and digital video companies revealed a surprisingly dynamic marketplace, where the rules of the US television business are being rewritten on the fly.Television and film studios are cashing in as they sell their content to a growing pool of buyers. Netflix, the leading digital film and TV subscription service, is being challenged by new entrants such as Amazon and Walmart. And cable operators are taking more aggressive steps to protect their business models from the threat of digital competitors.The proliferation of online video choices is resulting in paydays for TV networks and film studios.NBC, ABC and CBS have found new appetite for their huge back catalogue of programmes.In the past week alone, Netflix and Amazon struck deals with CBS and NBC Universal for the rights to stream shows and films such as 90210 and Notting Hill over the internet.“Digital media distribution is an incremental boon to core film [and] TV studio economics,” said Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente. “Media content owners like CBS continue to benefit from the simple laws of supply and demand.”Mr DiClemente believes Amazon will pay CBS $100m over less than two years, and that CBS is receiving $200m from Netflix for a two-year deal. Other networks and film studios are striking similar deals with online distributors, finding new value in their old shows, and he believes more deals with the likes of Google, Microsoft and Facebook are on the way.Netflix, with more than 25m subscribers and a vast library of content, is at the forefront of digital distribution.The company, which ruled itself out of the running to buy Hulu last week, bolstered its library and its international prospects when it struck a licensing deal with CBS that would see some of the US network’s programming streamed in Canada and Latin America.Netflix also struck a licensing deal with Televisa , Mexico’s biggest broadcaster, covering about 3,000 hours of telenovelas and other programming.It has exclusive licensing deals with several Hollywood studios, including Paramount Pictures, and is in talks with DreamWorks Animation, the company behind Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, to stream its content when its pay-TV deal with Time Warner’s HBO expires in 2013.But Netflix, once perceived as unassailable, is being challenged by a growing range of well-armed competitors.Amazon is offering online TV shows and films, Google is developing its own TV strategy, although it has had a rough start, and Walmart is investing in Vudu, its on-demand online film service.“Those are companies that have a lot of cash to compete with Netflix,” said Jonathan Weitz, partner at IBB Consulting.Amazon is coming on the strongest. On Thursday, the group struck a deal with NBC Universal to show films including Elizabeth, a move that follows its deal with CBS.The heavy spending by Amazon, Netflix and others is a growing worry for cable operators such as Comcast.After the biggest US cable operators posted an increase in subscribers last quarter, executives and analysts proclaimed that the threat of new digital distributors such as Netflix was overblown.Then last week, Time Warner Cable reported a loss of 16,000 video subscribers in the second quarter.In the strongest sign yet that networks are wary of undermining their core business model, Fox, the broadcast network owned by News Corp, last week took steps to limit the amount of free content it makes available online.
862;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-31T19:52:25Z;Entertainment industry: A cloud up in the air;As DVD sales dive, what next for movie studios?;"Executives at Universal Pictures thought they had a hit on their hands. The Hollywood studio had been offered the chance to turn Stephen King’s best-selling The Dark Tower series of books into a trilogy of films and a spin-off television series.The omens looked good: the movies would have a vast, ready-made fan-base, thanks to the popularity of the book series – a sprawling fantasy epic with echoes of The Lord of the Rings. Ron Howard, a renowned director, was lined up to direct; Oscar winner Javier Bardem was on board to star.Yet at Universal’s recent “greenlight” meeting to decide whether to put the project into production, the studio’s senior management balked at the cost. “The economics just didn’t work,” says a person familiar with the project.The rejection of such a hotly anticipated proposition would have been unthinkable five years ago, when Hollywood studios were swimming in cash. Back then, booming DVD sales had brought a spike in productions: even films that flopped at the box office would make their money back when they were released on DVD.Times have changed. DVDs used to generate more than $20bn a year but since 2006 sales have fallen by more than $6bn, while attempts to reverse the decline with a new format – higher-quality Blu-ray discs – have largely failed. Hollywood is now betting that the consumers who stopped buying physical discs can be persuaded to buy films digitally.But new sales data and analysis of buying patterns raise big questions about whether consumers are willing to spend money to own film and TV content at all, regardless of the format. For an industry desperate to avoid the grim fate of the music business, this presents a serious problem.At stake is America’s biggest cultural export. The most recently available figures from the Motion Picture Association of America show that Hollywood generated a $11.7bn trade surplus in 2008, larger than industries such as telecommunications, consulting, legal and insurance services.A failure to replace DVD revenues with digital sales means fewer films will be made. The decline is already under way: in 2006 the members of the Motion Picture Association of America released 204 films; by 2010 that had shrunk to 141.So far, the studios have done a poor job of persuading consumers to buy online – mainly because of the popularity of renting. “What Hollywood wants and what the consumer wants is diverging,” says Arash Amel of IHS Screen Digest, a research firm that recently produced a report on digital movie sales. “The studios now want you to buy movies digitally and to own those movies. But the consumer wants access to film and TV programming without the burden of ownership.”The last time the Motion Picture Association of America studied the effect of copyright theft in Hollywood was 2005, when it found that piracy was costing the industry more than $6bn a year in lost revenues. Since then, the growth of fast broadband has made piracy more difficult to contain and when one illegal web site closes, another one opens up.Creative America, a new coalition for the entertainment industry, says piracy has resulted in the loss of 140,000 jobs in the US. It estimates that websites trafficking in stolen film and television content receive about 150m visits every day.If he is right, Hollywood’s latest technological venture – a project the studios hope will restore the industry to its cash-rich glory years – could be doomed even before it formally launches this autumn. Universal, Warner Brothers, Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures – all of the big studios, apart from Walt Disney – are backing the venture, a cloud-based “rights locker” and authentication system called Ultraviolet. It has the backing of big retailers in the US such as Best Buy; technology groups such as HP, Intel and Cisco are on board, as are phone makers like Nokia and Motorola. Apple, like Disney, is conspicuous by its absence; the two are working on their own cloud-based rights locker.The companies involved in Ultraviolet have much to gain if it takes off: consumers will in theory buy more movies, much to the delight of retailers, device makers and the studios. Ultraviolet is a simple enough concept: the studios are convinced consumers will begin buying films in digital formats in large numbers if they are able to stream them remotely from cloud-based servers. They argue that cloud-based streaming is more appealing than downloading and storing titles on a hard disc, because video files take up lots of space.Ultraviolet will give consumers their own rights locker: buying a movie online will give them the right to stream it from the cloud to any device of their choosing, such as a smart phone, a tablet computer, a PC or an internet-enabled television. The studios hope this will stimulate digital sales – or “electronic sell through”, as it is referred to in Hollywood.“We have to make EST easier,” says Rick Finkelstein, chief operating officer of Universal Pictures. “If you can store a movie in the cloud and watch it on any device, that’s a great consumer proposition. And you don’t have to watch it in 24 or 48 hours, like you do with rental.”The problem with digital film ownership today is the lack of interoperability between devices: moving files is clunky and impractical, which has held back sales, according to Mitch Singer, president of Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem, the consortium behind Ultraviolet.With Ultraviolet, that “friction” disappears, he adds. “Consumers are telling us loud and clear that if they could access their film libraries on any device that they may own – or want to own in the future – then they will continue to collect movies.”Parents who have bought electronic or physical copies of films will be able to share them with family members hundreds of miles away with the click of a mouse. “I have a high level of optimism that if we make it possible for consumers to collect movies, then they will continue to collect,” says Mr Singer. “EST isn’t dead …we just haven’t offered consumers something they want to collect yet.”…Yet for all of the enthusiasm, Ultraviolet increasingly looks like a last throw of the dice for an industry desperate to preserve its retail business model. It is clear why Hollywood wants to keep selling movies: the profit margin on a DVD sale is more than 65 per cent – close to double the margin on a rental. Selling an electronic format is even more profitable because there are no manufacturing costs and minimal distribution costs.But consumer behaviour has changed radically in the five years since DVD sales reached their peak, making it difficult to predict demand for a cloud-based rights locker. After all, consumers hardly lack choice when it comes to streaming movies or online TV programming.Netflix, the US-based DVD and online movie streaming service, for instance offers an unlimited mix of older movies and newer titles to rent by streaming online for a fixed monthly price: in the last five years the company has grown from a niche operator to the dominant player, with more than 25m subscribers. Most of its customers are in the US but the company recently unveiled plans to launch in 43 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean. Availability in Europe is due to follow.In the last five years, movie studios and online retailers have also experimented with selling downloads of their films online, with Apple’s iTunes store the largest outlet. But in each country where movie downloads have been made available, sales plateau after an initial flurry of interest, says IHS Screen Digest. The numbers are not large. Outside the US, online movie revenues in 2010 were just $243m, according to data compiled by the media research company – a small fraction of the revenues generated by the rental and sale of physical discs.There is increasing evidence that manufacturers and retailers have given up on movie downloads. Apple is the world’s largest digital film retailer, representing 55 per cent of all global online movie transactions, yet the latest version of its Apple TV device does not have a hard disc: viewers who want to watch movies have to rent them digitally and stream them to the box instead. Globally, more than 30 online retailers have stopped selling films online in countries including Canada, Germany, France and Italy. In the UK, LoveFilm and the BT Vision Download store have stopped selling digital movies – although LoveFilm continues to rent titles.Digital rental, also known as internet video on demand, continues to be popular, however. “Consumers want to rent, not buy, in a digital world,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. “There are so many ways to access content – why would you ever need to actually own a movie?”…Whether a cloud-based service can persuade consumers to resume buying movies as opposed to renting them is up for debate. Many in Hollywood think the problem is related to pricing: at more than $15, buying a digital copy of a film seems expensive when it can be rented from the same online store for $3 or $4 – especially when you consider that most people watch a film just once.“Retail sales are not dead, although the performance of the industry has not been good,” says John Calkins of Sony Pictures Entertainment. Hollywood “has not managed the digital retail model successfully”, he adds, while the placement of rental titles in online stores alongside films that are for sale has not helped. “It’s not rocket science to work out that the consumer will want to rent, not buy.”He advocates price cuts to bring buyers back. It often costs more than $15 to buy a newly released film online: Sony recently cut its wholesale prices and saw a sales uplift, he says. “If new titles were priced at $10-$15, people would buy them. If you were planning on renting for $4, buying for $10 doesn’t look so bad.”Others, such as Mr Singer, say Hollywood should explore changing so-called release “windows” – the periods of time between a film’s release in cinemas, on DVD and on pay-TV. At the moment, new movies can be rented or bought in the same window. But if they were made available to buy online several weeks before they were released to rent, that could boost sales, he says.Could such measures revive the sales model? Proponents of Ultraviolet say Hollywood has a fighting chance. “Consumers still want to watch film and television shows,” says Mark Teitell, general manager of the DECE consortium. “They still want to spend time watching content …it’s not like they’re saying: ‘I don’t care about movies any more’. That would be much worse.”The problem is there are an increasing number of ways to watch movies illegally, with illegal web sites that offer free movies “growing in sophistication, consumer reach and quantity”, according to Screen Digest’s Mr Amel. Piracy could further dent the industry’s plans to revive EST. With that in mind, and the wide availability of films to stream on a rental basis, convincing consumers to buy movies again will be hard.“In a world where the internet exists, the power no longer rests with the studios,” Mr Amel observes. “The web has empowered consumers and ultimately the studios will have to come into line with what consumers want, rather than what is best for Hollywood.

This is a new word I have just made up to describe something I’ve been doing for a few years but that now seems in need of a name. Worliday is a bit like holiday and a bit like work. It’s the future for most professional workers, and actually, contrary to what most people would have you believe, worliday is really rather nice.Here is the sort of thing I did when I was on worliday 10 days ago in north Cornwall. I would wake up, do a few e-mails and then go for a walk by the sea. Later, I might write an article sitting under a window with a view of a stream. After that, I’d go outside to light the coals to barbecue a sausage. Or rather, I’d look at the glowering sky and put the sausages under the grill instead.Most professional workers have been taking worlidays for some time now. The steady advance of the concept can be traced by the rise and fall of the automatic out-of-office e-mail. Five years ago these were all the rage: if you sent anyone an e-mail in August, you would get an automatic message straight back telling you that the recipient was off on a two-week break. Then, a couple of years later, the response changed: you would still get the automated message but it would be swiftly followed by a proper response tapped into a BlackBerry from a Tuscan poolside.This year, you will just get the message from the pool – hardly anyone sends out-of-office e-mails at all. Indeed last week I had lunch with the head of a media company who has forbidden his staff from sending them at all, on the grounds that they are both pointless and unprofessional.Most people will tell you that worlidays are psychologically unhealthy. It is surely terrible that we are all chained to BlackBerrys and in touch with offices even when supposedly having a break in the sun (or rain). Taking time off completely, stress experts say, is essential if we are to connect with our families and with our souls and recharge our batteries.But in my experience it doesn’t work quite like this. A human battery is a funny piece of kit, and doesn’t always respond well to a sudden, cold turkey immersion in idleness with the family in a strange place. Intellectual stimulation charges my batteries more reliably than sitting in the rain with bored teenagers.Back in the old pre-internet days when holidays represented a forcible break from work there was a wild dash to get everything done before you left. Then you arrived at your destination shattered and with a mind stuffed full of work concerns. It used to take the first week to relax and stop worrying about what was happening at work. By the time you had stopped fretting, it was time to go back to work, and then further discombobulating acclimatisation was required in the other direction.The first great thing about the worliday is that there is no stark transition between the two states. Because I work when I’m away, there is no unseemly dash before I go. Better still, the worliday means you should be able to go away more often to compensate for the fact that you are still (sort of) working when absent.This means the worliday is not family unfriendly at all as families get twice as many holidays. Admittedly they only have half the minds of their parents at any given time, but most children may see this as an advantage.However, the mass adoption of the worliday doesn’t mean everyone ought to be given longer holiday entitlements. It means that holiday entitlements should be scrapped altogether. The current arrangement only makes sense for people who work fixed hours – they clearly need fixed holidays too. But for professionals who have not worked set hours for decades, fixed holidays seem an anachronism.Netflix, which has a famously groovy culture, worked this out some time ago. Its employees are allowed to take whatever holiday they feel like taking – no one keeps records.The danger with such a scheme is that ambitious people could stop going away at all, but that is already a danger with the existing system. Indeed, so long as people are paid for results rather than for sitting at their desks, taking a great deal of worliday seems entirely consistent with achieving a great deal of success.And on that happy note, I’m about to pack my bags and head off cheerfully with my family to Yorkshire for a few days. In my suitcase will be my sunglasses and Wellington boots – as you never know with the weather up there – as well as my BlackBerry and computer.lucy.kellaway@ft.com
864;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-29T16:14:11Z;My Portfolio: Performance updates;Takeovers, US shares and cash have all affected our columnists’ performance;"John LeePerformance year-to-date: 8.9%Against a backdrop of very unsettled markets, I am well pleased with my 8.9 per cent capital appreciation (excluding dividends) in the year to date. It’s a useful advance on my 3.5 per cent capital gain at end-April. Corporate activity has been particularly beneficial, with two confirmed takeovers: Greene King for Capital Pub and Smiths News for Dawson Holdings. Niche insurance broker THB – which I had only recently built a stake in– is also bid talks with a potential large American suitor. A number of other holdings have performed well since April, mainly on the back of results and trading statements: Ensor, Fenner, MS International, Nichols, Northbridge Industrial, Park Group, and PZ Cussons. On the debit side, thankfully no disasters – just disappointing drifting from the two Cable & Wireless companies and more recently Smiths News (more to come in my August 6 article). Suffice it to say that I have taken advantage of the price weakness in the latter to buy more.Dina IordanovaPerformance year-to-date: 5.1%Good gains from US and Canadian holdings were pulled down by UK sluggishness and/or volatility.My individual savings account (Isa) holdings performed below expectations. I earned well on Ithaca Energy but lost on Barclays.In recent months, planning and trading has been difficult due to problems with the service from my broker TD Waterhouse. I am now moving providers and, once this is completed, I hope to do better. However, the difficulties with the British-based TD Waterhouse brokerage were in part compensated for by good performance – both in terms of growth and dividends – from my TD shares, which I hold in my Canadian portfolio.My US portfolio has grown by an overall 25 per cent, through gains for Netflix, Amazon.com, Apollo, Visa, and TiVo. My only fundholding, however – the Fortune-praised Fairholme – has not lived up to expectations.Due to a focused but risky approach, my self-invested personal pension (Sipp) has grown well, driven by stakes in Smith & Nephew and Pan African Resources.Kevin Goldstein-JacksonPerformance year-to-date: -2.8%My Sipp has continued its disappointing start to the year – it is now down by 2.8 per cent.Poor performers included: Lonmin, down from £19.66 at the start of the year to £13.22; Immupharma, down from 87p to 74.25p; and Falkland Islands Holdings, down from 331p to 310p. However, over the years, I have reduced my holdings in all three companies and taken sufficient profits to more than cover their entire purchase cost. Performance from my City of London Group holding was also disappointing (91p to 78.5p).Another drag on the portfolio was its high level of cash: it accounts for more 35 per cent and interest rates remain very poor.My best performers included two firms in the pharmaceuticals sector: BTG, whose shares were up from 231.4p to 293.7p; and Oxford BioMedica, up 5.53p to 7.05p. Both have issued a number of encouraging statements regarding their medical treatments. Industrial engineer Weir has delivered outstanding performance: its shares are up from £17.80 to £22.10p.Nick LouthPerformance year-to-date: 6.0 per centIn less than a month, the year-to-date performance of my portfolio has jumped by 4.5 percentage points to 6 per cent – helped by a strong rise in Apple shares that I had repeatedly argued was overdue. I have rarely been more sure of a value proposition than this one and, last year, devoted the entire US portion of my portfolio to it. Apple shares have risen by around $80 (£50) to $400 in less than a month, but could easily top $500 by Christmas. Other good performers include: Mozambique miner Kenmare, up 65 per cent; recent buy Sportingbet, up by a third; as well as Cape and Scottish and Southern Energy, each up 16 per cent. There have been no big fallers since Domino's Pizza, back in January/February, although I have recently sold a sizeable holding in engineer Rotork which had gone sideways for a year.All of the columnists are active private investors, writing about their own investments.

865;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-28T00:28:21Z;Correction: Netflix;The 5% fall in Netflix shares on Tuesday represented a recovery from lows in after-market trading on Monday;● The 5 per cent fall in Netflix shares on Tuesday represented a recovery from lows in after-market trading on Monday and was not on top of the after-market fall, as wrongly stated in an article in some editions on July 27.
866;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-27T01:33:46Z;Netflix shares continue fall on Walmart news;;Netflix shares fell 5 per cent on Tuesday, as investors in the streaming and DVD subscription service reacted to news that Walmart was stepping up its efforts in online video.Walmart said it would integrate Vudu, the streaming service it acquired last year, with its main Walmart.com website, giving its retail customers the opportunity to buy or rent digital video.The world’s biggest retailer – and the biggest seller of DVDs in the US – plans to promote Vudu more aggressively in its stores.“This integration allows us to introduce more Walmart.com customers to digital entertainment and give them access to thousands of new releases and popular movie titles,” said Edward Lichty, Vudu general manager.Netflix shares had tumbled as much as 10 per cent in after-market trading on Monday, when the company warned of a possible exodus of customers following a change to its pricing model.However, analysts expect Netflix to have a stronger second half. “We believe growth in net subscriber additions and revenue will rebound in the fourth quarter,” wrote Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital in a research note.Netflix shares closed down $14.62 at $266.91 on Tuesday, although they had recovered from Monday’s after-market lows.This article has been amended since initial publication to remove an incorrect reference to the share price movement in after-market trading on Monday.
867;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-26T21:04:58Z;New York stocks down on debt worries;;US stocks stumbled for a second straight session on Tuesday as investors waded through a heavy volume of quarterly earnings reports amid continuing anxiety over the US federal debt limit.The S&P 500 stock index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,331.94 in New York.The benchmark was weighed down by the industrials sector, off 1.9 per cent, and materials, which declined by 1 per cent, while technology shares offset the gloom.Illinois Tool Works, a diversified manufacturer, ended the day down 8.2 per cent at $52.34 after profits missed analysts’ forecasts. 3M, which produces goods from Post-it notes to stethoscopes, dropped 5.4 per cent to $89.93. Paccar, the maker of truck brands Peterbilt and Kenworth, fell 10.7 per cent to $45.02 after profits disappointed analysts,United Parcel Service, the global package shipping company, declined 3.3 per cent to $71.59. While second-quarter sales beat expectations thanks to price increases and a continued recovery in its supply chain business, chief executive Scott Davis noted that high US unemployment was braking demand for services and imports.Mr Davis also warned of ill effects from the political stalemate over raising the $14,300bn federal debt ceiling in Washington. The US Congress showed little progress towards a compromise before the August 2 deadline imposed by the Treasury.On Monday, Harry Reid, the Democratic Senate majority leader, and John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, offered separate plans to resolve the borrowing limit issue.The White House threatened a presidential veto of Mr Boehner’s legislation Tuesday.“To move significantly one way or another, we’re going to need news on a deal out of Washington. It’s just another check point you need to get beyond,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4 basis points to 4.284 per cent, suggesting continued demand despite the political uncertainty.Janney Montgomery Scott noted the situation seemed to have strengthened correlations among asset classes. “Given that the traditional safe haven asset class, Treasuries, is the source of capital markets uncertainty, we can expect this relationship between risk assets and Treasuries to remain off-kilter until Washington better wraps its hands around the debt ceiling and deficit problems or the government faces a credit event,” the broker-dealer said.Not every industrial stock lagged. Cummins, the diesel engine maker, rose 3.9 per cent to $110.82 after surpassing profit expectations. Lockheed Martin, the world’s biggest defence company by revenues, rose 1.9 per cent to $80.82 as sales rose and executives raised their outlook for the year.Ford Motor lost 1.8 per cent to $12.94 after announcing a drop in second-quarter earnings. The Detroit-based carmaker said that pre-tax operating profit and cash flow for the year as a whole would be higher than in 2010.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 12,501.30.Second-quarter results have revealed a “pretty good earnings season so far”, said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems. Through Monday, almost a third of the 500 companies in the S&P index had reported quarterly numbers, and 83 per cent had beaten Wall Street estimates of earnings per share, he said.“The sector where we have seen the biggest surprise is in the technology sector,” he said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite held its ground, closing 0.1 per cent lower at 2,839.96.Broadcom, which makes chips for wireless devices, jumped 9.4 per cent to $38.20, after issuing a positive revenue outlook. Lexmark International, which supplies computer printers, gained 17.7 per cent to $33.93. Texas Instruments rose 0.3 per cent to $31.57, though executives foreshadowed a lacklustre holiday season.However, Netflix, the DVD and online video streaming service, tumbled 5.2 per cent to $266.91 after warning that a recent price rise would prompt some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also indicated that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.After the New York market closed, Amazon reported second-quarter net profit of $191m, or 41 cents per share, sliding from $207m, or 45 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected the online emporium to earn 34 cents per share.
868;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-25T22:31:24Z;Netflix falls on subscription warning;;Netflix shares tumbled more than 10 per cent in after-market trading when the DVD and online video streaming service warned that a recent price rise would cause some customers to downgrade or cancel subscriptions.The company, which was reporting second-quarter results, also warned that revenues would “only grow slightly on a sequential basis” following the price change, which separates DVD and streaming into different subscription packages.Netflix said it had increased the number of paying global subscribers to 25.6m, a 70 per cent rise on the same period last year. In his quarterly letter to shareholders, Reed Hastings, chief executive, also ruled Netflix out of the bidding for Hulu, a competing video service.“We aren’t planning to bid on Hulu because most of its revenue is from providing free ad-supported streaming of current-season TV shows, which is not our focus,” wrote Mr Hastings.Hulu, which is owned by NBC Universal, Walt Disney and News Corp, has attracted interest from several companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, but it is unclear if any will make a credible bid.Hulu’s subscription service added 325,000 paying subscribers during the quarter, whereas Netflix added almost 2m, Mr Hastings wrote. Netflix, which is available in the US and Canada, intends to launch its streaming service in 43 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean.It recently angered many customers with the change to its pricing model in the US, separating streaming from DVD subscription. For consumers intending to keep streaming film and TV programming and watch them on DVD, the move increased the price of a Netflix subscription by about 60 per cent.“Some subscribers will cancel Netflix or downgrade their Netflix plans,” wrote Mr Hastings, although he added: “We expect most to stay with us.”The company expects to have about 22m streaming subscribers in the US by the end of the third quarter, with about 15m people subscribing to the DVD service. The move to separate the DVD and streaming business is an acknowledgement that “DVDs have peaked”.Netflix faces competition from new streaming services such as HBO Go, which was launched by HBO, the pay channel owned by Time Warner. “While HBO GO and Netflix do not have overlapping content …we do compete with HBO for studio content and for viewers’ time,” wrote Mr Hastings.Results for the three months to the end of June were in line with expectations, with revenues rising from $718.6m to $788.6m. Net income rose from $60.2m to $68.2m, while earnings a share were up from $1.11 to $1.26. The shares were down 10 per cent at $254 in after-market trading.
869;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-25T20:53:46Z;LinkedIn launches job application plug in ahead of first quarterly earnings call;;LinkedIn’s new “Apply with LinkedIn” button began appearing alongside job postings on a thousand different company websites on Monday, including Netflix and LivingSocial, allowing candidates to submit their LinkedIn profile in lieu of a resume or application form.The product announcement comes the week before LinkedIn will release its first quarterly revenue statement, following its massive IPO in May, and must respond to investors looking for regular returns.Deep Nishar, LinkedIn’s senior vice president of products, said that although the new feature is free of charge to applicants and employers, it is part of the company’s overall growth and product strategy.“‘Apply with LinkedIn’ allows LinkedIn to power the professional web,” he said, “and allows members to take advantage of the network effects.”The plug-in is a logical addition to LinkedIn’s recruitment tools, which currently bring in 43 per cent of the company’s revenues, and have been noted by analysts as the most promising area for growth. Since the enormous success of Facebook’s ‘Like’ button, launched just over a year ago, similar plug-ins have proliferated across the web as companies attempt to expand their reach and drive more traffic from outside their own sites.With one click, LinkedIn members can share their public profile with a potential employer, then see a list of people in their network who work at the company that they could ask for a recommendation.For companies, “it really gives them a 360 degree view of the candidate,” Mr Nishar said. They can see how candidates interact on various public forums, how they answer questions, what kinds of articles they share, and how they behave in a professional online environment in general.“A lot of difficulty in hiring has been in reviewing applications and finding the right candidates to interview from the larger pool,” said Andrew Weinstein, spokesperson for LivingSocial, which currently has 700 job openings worldwide, the majority in sales. The company is integrating applicants’ LinkedIn data into its existing Jobvite recruitment tracking software.“This makes it easier on the receiving end to automate the review process,” he said.At some companies, the LinkedIn profile can be connected into Chatter, a company’s internal professional social network, surfacing even more personal connections between applicants and current employees.This quasi-viral sharing of a job application holds candidates to an even higher level of accountability, said Ted Elliott, chief executive of Jobscience, which has integrated LinkedIn data provided through the plug-in into its recruitment filtering and tracking systems.“There’s a new burden on the individual to take responsibility for their own data,” he said.But the network effects work the other way around, too, he said, especially amidst the talent war in Silicon Valley where competition for top engineers and designers is fierce. Competitive candidates can see who they know at various companies and contact them for unbiased views on the corporate culture.“It makes it even more important to have a good work environment,” Mr Elliott said.
870;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-20T18:36:57Z;20th Century Fox to launch movies on Android phones;;Twentieth Century Fox is bringing movie downloads to Google’s Android smartphone and tablet platform for the first time later this year, setting up the fast-growing operating system as a media platform to rival Apple’s digital dominance.Buyers of Fox’s high-definition Blu-ray discs from October, starting with X-Men: First Class, will be able to download an Android-compatible digital copy of the movie from its website using their computer. This can then be “side loaded” onto an Android phone.The Android download service – which Fox says is the first of its kind – will first be made available in the US, UK, France and Germany.Until now, digital downloads of its movies have only been available for Windows and Apple iTunes, the dominant PC and smartphone platforms. Recent months have seen Google itself launch a digital movie rentals service for Android in the US, while Netflix, the streaming service, launched an app for some Android phones in May.Fox’s move into Android comes six months after Google’s platform overtook Nokia’s Symbian as the world’s biggest-selling smartphone operating system. Its worldwide smartphone market share is expected to climb to 49 per cent by 2012, according to analyst group Gartner, while also capturing some 24 per cent of the tablet market, which is today dominated by Apple’s iPad.Unlike Apple’s iPhone, which comes tied to its iTunes music and video store, Android has not been seen as a media platform because it has lacked some playback and copy-protection technologies which movie studios require. In December, Google went some way towards addressing studios’ concerns by acquiring Widevine, a rights-management and streaming technology which powers services such as Netflix.“Given its strong growth as a mobile operating system, the support for Android is an important move for us because it further enhances Blu-ray discs as the best way to get your movies to all your screens,” said Vincent Marcais, senior vice-president for marketing at Twentieth Century Fox International Home Entertainment.Screen Digest, a research group, reported this month that growth in sales of standalone movie downloads had slowed sooner than expected, dealing a blow to Hollywood’s hope that digital revenues would replace those from DVDs, which are plummeting.Fox began selling bundles of Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies in 2009 and believes that the combination is a better way to sell content than standalone downloads.“The starting point for us is that people like to own a movie,” Mr Marcais said. “We need a business model that satisfies that need and Blu-ray is the business model that satisfies that.” He described streaming services that allow online rental without a permanent download such as Lovefilm and Netflix as “good complements” to ownership.The Blu-ray disc format was designed to anticipate future developments such as 3D TVs and digital delivery, with the forthcoming “Ultraviolet”, a new technology standard, allowing movies and other content to be moved wirelessly from a Blu-ray player to other devices.“One thing we didn’t anticipate was that people would be walking around with something called a tablet,” Mr Marcais said. “But with the connectivity and interactivity [in Blu-ray] we can now use the tablet as a second screen device to complement what is happening as you watch the big screen.”Fox is developing new smartphone and tablet apps for Android and Apple, designed to be used in conjunction with a film being watched on the TV, for example allowing social networking, companion materials such as quizzes and actors’ biographies or other interactive features.
871;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
872;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-16T17:00:06Z;Story of the week: Media streaming;;Media streaming has become a staple of our daily digital consumption. So much so that this week music lovers in the US finally welcomed the arrival of Europe’s music-streaming subscription service Spotify, while angry Netflix customers turned to social networking sites to vent their rage over subscription fee increases.Early in the week, Netflix announced a 60 per cent price hike of its DVD and streaming subscriptions. Almost immediately, customers of the service expressed anger through Twitter and Facebook.CNet reported that the price increase wasn’t a surprise to analysts who cover Netflix. Analysts had predicted price hikes because there were “few other ways the company could afford to expand its library–which customers are discovering is lacking in some important content areas”.Around the web, Slate’s Brow Beat blog compiled a list of movie streaming substitutes and PCMag polled its readers and found that a “vast majority (55 percent, or 2,530 people) said they’re quitting Netflix”.Siliconvalley.com pointed out that the move is likely to “push more people into the streaming service, which will help Netflix to lower its postal expenses”.Of course, it’s not a surprise that Netflix should emphasis its streaming services. In fact, comScore this week released data that also highlighted the growth in online video in the US.“In June, 178 million US Internet users watched online video content for an average of 16.8 hours per viewer,“ reported Leena Roa of TechCrunch.In other streaming news, Spotify finally made its debut in the US on Thursday. But does Spotify have what it takes to compete with similar music-streaming services, DigitalTrends asked. The review had Spotify battling with Pandora and Grooveshark’s music catalog, social features and music discovery.The spread of media streaming services, meanwhile, assumes that the luxury of high-speed Internet access is widely available – something that should not be taken for granted. Wired wrote of a man in Seattle, Andre Vrignaud, who was locked out of his Internet connection for violating his data cap two months in a row.Internet Service Providers have already announced an agreement that customers offering pirated content for download will face penalties, reported the FT late last week. At the same time, there is speculation that broadband providers could introduce “consumption-based pricing” in the near future, the WSJ reported.“Long offered on an effectively unlimited basis, American consumers aren’t used to thinking about the bytes they consume online at home,” said Martin Peers.
873;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-14T22:22:37Z;Wall St stocks fall amid default concerns;;Wall Street stocks closed down after an early equity rally amid concern that US politicians may fail to agree on raising the US debt ceiling, which could lead to a catastrophic default, and as investors reassessed the likelihood of the Federal Reserve’s embarking on “quantitative easing”.In spite of initial efforts to look away from the possibility of Moody’s downgrading the US debt, equities pulled back after modest morning gains. Relatively good economic news and JPMorgan Chase beating earnings estimates initially helped investors gain confidence. JPMorgan Chase, the first big bank to report results, was up 1.84 per cent at $40.35 after announcing that its second-quarter profits rose 13 per cent to $5.4bn or $1.27 a share, in net income.“Bernanke’s comments took away the enthusiasm. The market reacted, as it is very much focused on negotiations in Washington”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 per cent at 12,437.12, after climbing almost 90 points early in the session, when investors were focused on the heavyweight bank’s growth. Financials, one of the worst performing sectors, are under pressure to show that they can increase revenue. Citigroup is due to release earnings on Friday.“But there were some good news in the retail sales and employment fronts, and good numbers from JPMorgan pushed it up a little initially. All in all, this is still a very cautious market looking at debt issues, both in Europe and the US, and the corporate earnings season”, Ms Krosby said.According to the US Commerce Department, retail sales rose 0.1 per cent in June, after dipping 0.1 per cent in May, while weekly jobless claims dropped 22,000 to 405,000, compared to an expected figure of 415,000.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was in negative territory, down 1.2 per cent at 2,762.67 and the benchmark S&P 500 also closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,308.87. All of the S&P sectors lost ground, closing in negative territory.Yet ConocoPhillips was one of the S&P top performers at 1.6 per cent to $75.61, after an early announcement that the company plans to split its refining and production businesses into two different publicly traded companies.“We estimate the value range on a split-up is between $73 and $92 per share. Essentially, we see little downside to owning the stock at current levels. Overall, we estimate we can comfortably get to $80 per share on a break-up value,” said Faisel Khan, analyst with Citi investment research.“It remains to be seen how ConocoPhillips will deal with the downstream, how it will allocate the midstream and chemicals business among the separated company, whether there will be dis-synergies and most importantly how the upstream business will be valued. The upstream valuation is the key component here,” he added.Yum! Brands, reached an all-time high at $57.75 before paring its gains at 1.4 per cent to $56.37. On Wednesday, the US fast food Restaurant Group, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, reported a 10 per cent gain in profits, or $0.65 per share, in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations and raising its full-year forecast. According to the company’s chief executive, David Novak, profit was helped by “strong performance in China and other emerging markets”, with sales in China growing more than 18 per cent.“Outlook for consolidated fundamentals are probably coming down slightly, with upside in China not fully offsetting weakness in the US. That said, Yum! is making the case for multiple expansion, which should be more important for the shares,” said Keith Siegner, an analyst with Credit Suisse.Google closed down 1.7 per cent to $528.94, but jumped as earnings results, released after the closing bell, exceeded estimates.

Yet they came off their session highs after a top Fed official opposed Mr Bernanke’s comments saying he was against providing a stimulus even if the economy worsens.Stocks lost further ground after John Boehner, house speaker, said there would be no guarantee that the debt limit would be raised if an agreement was not inked by early August.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.31 per cent at 1,317.6 and the Nasdaq Composite was also in positive territory, up 0.54 per cent at 2,796.92.Most of the S&P sectors were up, with the materials sector 0.8 per cent higher with Titanium Metals at the helm, up 7 per cent at $18.9. The energy sector was up 0.7 per cent – spurred on in part by a decline in oil inventories, led by Alpha Natural, the coal producer, up 3.7 per cent at $45.The Dow Jones Industrial average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,491.61, led by Caterpillar, which was up 1.6 per cent at $108.60.Financials weakened, but JPMorgan Chaseclosed 0.6 per cent up at $39.62, ending a three-session losing streak. However, poised for a lacklustre report of earnings before the bell on Thursday, it may say second-quarter revenue declined 0.8 per cent to $24.9bn according to average estimates by analysts.“The next big thing coming is JPMorgan releasing results, and that will fuel the fire,” said Sam Ginzburg, head of capital markets at First New York Securities.Investment Technology Group, an agency brokerage that serves large institutions, was down 13.73 per cent to $11.80, after the announcement of a large write-off for the second quarter alongside layoffs.

Yum reported a 10 per cent gain in profits or $0.65 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ expectations. Marriott’s diluted earnings per share totalled $0.37, a 19 per cent increase over the same period last year. Both companies announced results after the closing bell on Wednesday.“Yum! Brands has cash flow, strong, predictable and sustainable earnings. It has global reach with 40 per cent of its profits coming from China, which contributed to great earnings over time,” said Tucker Brown, research principal with SGA.On the media front, Netflix, the DVD subscription and streaming video company, hit an all-time high of $304.80 in early trading, though it pared its gains to $298.70, up 2.6 per cent.

The stock is still up 20 per cent over the year, however.The fall weighed on the S&P media index, which was down 0.9 per cent.In other news from the sector, there were reports that the owners of Hulu – which includes Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast’s NBC Universal – were committed to selling the video streaming service. Shares in Disney were down 1 per cent to $39.57 while Comcast fell 1.9 per cent to $25.49.But despite these losses, the benchmark S&P 500 index was flat at 1,339.22 overall as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of crucial employment data on Thursday and Friday.“The markets are probably just going to bounce around a bit until the employment report later this week,” said Yu-Dee Chang, chief trader at Ace Investment Strategists. “But the report is likely to surprise to the upside and I think the markets will continue up from there.”Sentiment on Wall Street was not helped by the largely disappointing economic news in the session.Data from the Institute for Supply Management indicated that US non-manufacturing business had expanded less than expected last month.The ISM index showed a reading of 53.3 in June, which was below the 54 expected by economists and down from 54.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals expansion.Separate figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consulting firm, showed an 11.6 per cent rise in planned job cuts in June to 41,432 from May’s 37,135.

Urban Outfitters was up 5.6 per cent to $30.75 while Caterpillaradded 1.5 per cent to $110.08.The Nasdaq Composite crept up 0.3 per cent to 2,834.02.Many analysts were still confident that the markets would march higher in the second half of this year – even despite the 5.6 per cent gains last week – as they believe that the US economy will start to pick up in the next few months from the “soft patch” of the last few months.We “expect a second half recovery for the equity market,” said analysts at Citigroup. “Strength from corporate America and some resolution on southern European and US debt concerns should lead to equity market gains.”In other news, General Motors was up 1.1 per cent to $31.19 after Morgan Stanley added the carmaker to its “best idea” list, saying share-price declines have made US carmakers more attractive.Walgreen, the pharmacy chain store, was up 1.5 per cent to $43.38 after reporting that same-store sales had risen by 4.8 per cent in June, which was well above analysts’ estimates of 2.2 per cent growth.Shares in Tesorowere up 4.1 per cent to $24.10 after Barclays Capital upgraded its rating on the oil refiner, saying its restructuring will help it outperform peers over the next few years.It has now been just more than two years since the start of the US economic recovery. Of the stocks to gain ground since the end of June 2009, Netflix, the DVD subscription and online video streaming service, is up 603 per cent and Wynn Resorts, the US casino operator, has risen 397.7 per cent.

879;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:02:11+0000;Wall St flat after strong rally;;Shares in Southern Union jumped as the bidding war for the pipeline operator escalated while the wider markets remained relatively flat as investors paused for breath following the strongest rally for two years last week.Shares in Southern Union were up 4.3 per cent to $42.10 after Energy Transfer Equity agreed to take over the Texas-based group in an $8.9bn deal – significantly more than the $7.9bn that it had agreed on last month.The higher offer follows a bid two weeks ago by Williams, another natural gas group, designed to break up the already agreed deal.Shares in Williams were down 0.2 per cent to $30.68 while ETE added 0.6 per cent to $44.93.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Zion Oil & Gas tumbled 17.6 per cent to $4.86 after the oil-and-gas exploration company said on Friday that there was little chance a well in northern Israel contained commercially viable hydrocarbons.But overall, the sector was up 0.5 per cent, one of the few to gain in a generally caution session, helped by a rise in the oil prices. Marathon Oil was up 3.4 per cent to $34.06 while Peabody Energy added 2.2 per cent to $60.69.But this failed to prevent the S&P 500 edging lower, losing 0.1 per cent to 1,337.88 as investors worried about which direction the markets would now turn after the 5.6 per cent jump in the S&P last week – the best week of gains in the index for two years.The index is now just 1.9 per cent away from a three- year high and is well above its 100-day moving average.Financial stocks were some of the worst hit by these nerves, also hurt by news that Portugal’s credit rating had been cut to “junk” and that Citigroup had cut its price target on a number of regional banks.Morgan Stanley was down 2.6 per cent to $23.15 while Comerica, a regional lender, lost 3 per cent to $34.32. The S&P financial index was down 0.8 per cent, paring some of the 5.9 per cent gains seen last week. The KBW banking index fell 1.2 per cent.The industrial sector was the next worst performing in the session, not helped by news that factory orders had risen by less than expected in May.Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, led the losses, falling 5 per cent to $22.74 while Cummins declined 1.6 per cent to $105.69.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, paring some of the 6.4 per cent gains last week.But most of the remaining sectors on the S&P saw little movement and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,569.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,825.77.This pause follows the best weekly gains in two years on both these indices last week.The upswing came as the indices bounced up off their 200-day moving average and investors cheered a perceived improvement in the Greece situation.The markets were also looking ahead to the earnings season, which starts next week and is expected to be relatively strong.Analysts are expecting a healthy 11.9 per cent rise in earnings from the previous year for S&P 500 companies, according to data complied by Bloomberg. This would mark the seventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the index.But despite an assumption that second-quarter earnings would be healthy, there is some concern that guidances for the full year will be lowered due to the “soft patch” in the US economy over the past two months.Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, argued that the S&P 500 will reach a ceiling at 1,350 before running back down to 1,250 again in the coming months, thanks partly to lower guidances.But he goes on to argue that there will be a late rally towards the end of the year, which will see the S&P finish between 1,370 and 1,400. “In the end, the market wants to go up,” he reassured.In other company news Ameron surged 28.3 per cent to $85.05 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the fibreglass pipe manufacturer in a deal valued at $772m. National Oilwell Varco was up 2.2 per cent to $80.02.Netflix led the gains on the S&P 500, jumping 8.1 per cent to $289.63 after saying that it was expanding its video streaming service to 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Immucor, the biotechnology company, added 30.2 per cent to $26.99 after agreeing to be bought by private equity group TPG Capital for a fully diluted equity value of $1.97bn.Baidu, the US-listed Chinese search engine, was up 1.8 per cent to $145.87 on news that it will team up with Microsoft to create an English-language search.
880;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-07-05T19:46:12Z;Netflix sets Latin American expansion;;Netflix, the DVD subscription and online video streaming service, is expanding into 43 countries across Central and South America and the Caribbean, after striking deals to show programming from Spanish and Portuguese language broadcasters.The announcement, which confirmed a Financial Times report from May, lifted Netflix shares about 8 per cent to hit a one-year high and consolidated the company’s position as the world’s biggest online video operator.The expansion will take Netflix into fast-growing media markets, such as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico and comes after the group struck deals with broadcasters including Grupo Televisa and TV Azteca of Mexico and Globo of Brazil, according to several people briefed on the plans.Netflix said it would offer a mix of English and local language content. The company has amassed close to 24m subscribers in the US and Canada offering DVDs to rent by mail. But most of its recent growth has been powered by its online streaming service.Netflix will only launch the video streaming service internationally: taking its DVD service into multiple new territories would have been a costly logistical headache at a time when demand for DVDs is falling.The California-based group said subscribers to the new service in Mexico, Central America, South America and the Caribbean would be able to “instantly watch a wide array of American, local and global TV shows and movies right on their TVs via a range of consumer electronics devices capable of streaming from Netflix”.The expansion comes as competition intensifies in the online video market. Hulu, the online video site owned by NBC Universal, Walt Disney, News Corp and Providence Equity Partners, is on the auction block and has attracted interested from about 12 possible buyers, including Google.Amazon has also bet on the growth of online video internationally, buying Lovefilm, the UK-based DVD and streaming operator, for more than $300m and launching its own premium video service in the US.Meanwhile, Apple is working on a cloud-based streaming service for movies and television programming, while Walmart is backing its own Vudu streaming service.Pay-TV operators are also on notice about the growth of Netflix and have launched their own online operations to increase their appeal to subscribers. Time Warner’s HBO channel recently launched HBO Go, an streaming-only service that offers all programming ever screened on HBO to viewers that receive the channel via cable or satellite subscriptions.Netflix has maintained that it is not competing with pay TV channels but the company recently set the Hollywood rumour mill ablaze when it beat HBO and other channels to acquire exclusive rights to show the US remake of the hit BBC series House of Cards in a deal that could eventually be worth $100m.
881;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-06-30T00:37:04Z;Univision names Falco chief executive;;Univision Communications’ private equity owners have chosen Randy Falco, a former AOL and NBC Universal executive, to lead the US Hispanic broadcaster.The hiring ends a three-month search following the surprise exit of Joe Uva as chief executive.Mr Falco, who joined Univision as chief operating officer in January, is stepping up at a time when the network is seeing strong primetime ratings and advertising sales, driven by the growing size and buying power of the US Hispanic population, but is still carrying the debt burden from its $12.3bn leveraged buy-out in 2006.Mr Falco told the Financial Times his mandate included accelerating talks with distributors about so-called ‘TV Everywhere’ and ‘over-the-top’ deals to get its shows online to subscribers of services from cable TV to Netflix.He added that he would also take advantage of a long-term supply agreement struck last year with Mexico’s Televisa, which guarantees a supply of telenovelas, library programming and digital rights until 2020.The deal with Televisa gave the Mexican group 5 per cent of Univision, with debentures that could convert into a further 30 per cent and an option to reach 40 per cent should the US relax foreign ownership laws. It also bought Univision breathing space on its debt.“The balance sheet is much stronger than it was. I feel good about our financial position,” Mr Falco said, but added that it was not his decision when the group’s owners might seek an initial public offering or other exit. Some people close to the private equity consortium believe an IPO may be possible next year.Univision was bought by a group led by Madison Dearborn, Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Thomas H Lee and Saban Capital. Haim Saban, the company’s executive chairman, said the board unanimously agreed that Mr Falco’s experience made him ideal to accelerate its growth.Mr Falco, a New Yorker of Italian-American and German extraction, is the latest non-Hispanic leader of a Hispanic media company. “I speak the language of television. I speak the language of culture and I understand the Hispanic culture and the importance of reaching out to [Hispanic audiences] in culture,” he said.The demographic growth of Univision’s target audience, underscored by the 2010 US census, made it “one of the strongest assets in all of media,” Mr Falco said.

883;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-06-15T19:07:40Z;Content owners find nothing going on but the rent;;Rent or buy? The house-hunter’s dilemma is becoming an increasingly serious question for media companies as they contemplate the digital era’s latest upset to their businesses models.Content companies have long mixed various methods of making money into their models, notably advertising, taking a cut of subscriptions to services such as cable television, or selling physical media such as CDs, DVDs or video games.According to a thick report on the industry out this week from PwC, global advertising revenues rebounded by 5.8 per cent last year from their slump, and TV subscriptions were up 5.9 per cent. But recent figures on what media consumers actually buy, particularly in the most advanced media markets, are much less reassuring. US consumer spending on home video fell 3.3 per cent last year, according to the Digital Entertainment Group. DVD sales, even including Blu-Ray discs, have been falling since 2007, and the US physical video market was down 14.9 per cent by the middle of May, IHS Screen Digest reported.Digital music downloads from stores led by Apple’s iTunes are now sputtering, rather than compensating for the long slide in CD sales, and the US video game market hit a four-year low in May, according to the NPD Group, driven down by a 20 per cent fall in packaged software sales year-on-year.Such figures can swing around with hits such as Harry Potter, Adele or LA Noire, but the trend is clear. As PwC’s global survey put it, “a significant shift is emerging – away from payment models that involve buying and owning content that is stored on a device and toward paying for the right to consume it on a rented basis via streaming from cloud-based services.” The tale of physical media substitution by less lucrative digital forms is a familiar one, but the shift from ownership to rental or access models could be as important a secular change. It suggests nothing less than a reappraisal by consumers of the value of media content.Since Blockbuster’s video stores were booming, consumers have had the choice of borrowing a film cheaply, or spending more to own it. The calculation usually came down to how often they thought they would watch it, but other less rational factors played a part, such as the library-building desire for a shelf of Truffaut films that you might rarely watch but would impress your friends.What should worry media companies is that Americans have become “a nation of renters”, according to a recent note by Michael Nathanson of Nomura. And where once they rented DVDs from Blockbuster, making studios about $1.45 per film, they are now choosing digital subscription services such as Netflix, which yield just $1.25, or Redbox’s rental kiosks, which pay studios just $1 per film.As consumers move from high-margin purchases to low-margin rentals, Morgan Stanley estimated in March that studios’ annual profit per household would tumble from $135 in 2005 to just $89 by 2015.The rent-versus-buy equation has been different in music, because people who might watch The Sopranos only once or twice would listen to a soprano’s album dozens of times. On-demand access for a monthly fee changes that equation, however, and streaming or access models such as Pandora and Spotify are gaining ground while downloads flatline.In the digital world, owning big video files also hogs hard drive space, pushing consumers to streaming services instead.Why, then, do most content owners see new services using storage in the digital “cloud” as an incremental growth opportunity? First, Apple’s iCloud and others actually encourage ownership: users get access from any device to content they have already bought.High video on demand margins also prove that consumers will pay good prices for such convenience, and explain why Hollywood is racing to roll-out its own “buy once, play anywhere” models such as Ultraviolet.Apple, Amazon and Google, with their huge reach, may also add value to dustier content (it was never easy to buy or rent a Truffaut film), as well as discouraging piracy and the second-hand market.Finally, media owners know that there are rational and irrational reasons to believe that rental and ownership models can still co-exist. Anyone who has watched Toy Story countless times with their children will tell you that ownership will always make sense for some films.With compelling content, and the right packaging, you can still persuade people to buy. Since The Beatles’ arrival on iTunes in November, 1.3m digital copies of their albums have sold, helped by extras such as exclusive documentary footage.In short, if the packaged goods end of the media industry is to survive, content owners must get better at packaging.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com
884;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-06-06T22:44:06Z;Microsoft makes new E3 Kinect-ions;;Microsoft kicked off this week’s E3 video game trade show in Los Angeles with its usual eve-of-show press conference, where the emphasis seemed to be on consolidating its place in the living room rather than making any ground-breaking announcements.While Sony is expected to reveal more details on its next-generation portable device coming later this year at the show and Nintendo is due to unveil its successor to the Wii, Microsoft confined itself to touting the success of its Kinect motion controller and revealing new features and games that would take advantage of it.With the growing challenge in the living room from other devices offering games and entertainment, the company also announced new content deals that would keep it competitive with rival consoles, smart TVs, networked Blu-ray players and other set-top boxes.But it obviously sees the Kinect as a key differentiator, with its voice and gesture recognition capabilities.We were shown a fresh looking interface for the Xbox 360’s dashboard with the Kinect breaking out from its section to drive other parts of the Xbox Live service. Bing search has been added with voice commands for carrying out universal searches – pulling games, movies and TV shows and combining the results found in services such as Netflix and Hulu Plus.YouTube, available on many other services such as Apple TV, has finally been added and Microsoft said it would be extending the 360’s ability to show live TV including local channels.New features announced for the Kinect were people-scanning – the ability to create a true-to-life avatar from capturing an image of the gamer’s clothes and face with the camera – finger-tracking, which allows more precise drawing motions, and object scanning, where a toy or car or weapon can be scanned front and back by the camera to become an animated 3D object inside a game.However, none of the features seemed to be fully integrated with the Xbox interface or other games. They were stand-alone “gadgets” inside “Kinect Fun Labs”, a section on the Xbox where Microsoft is tapping into the cult craze of hacking the Kinect’s capabilities to produce new effects.The finger-tracking demonstration also consisted of the player holding two fingers together to draw lines, suggesting single-finger precision is not yet available.Analysts have criticised a lack of compelling games for the Kinect and Microsoft responded in its presentation with demos of Star Wars, Disneyland and Sesame Street games that looked both richly detailed and more imaginative.A bigger trend was Kinect’s integration into new versions of sophisticated existing titles. For example, I watched a gamer mimic shaking the reins of a horse to gee it up in Fable: The Journey, there was head-tracking to move the view from the driver’s seat around in Forza and a variety of movements to spot and shoot enemies in Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Future Soldier.The Sims Pets will have Kinect voice control and golf clubs can be swung naturally in Tiger Woods PGA Tour.However, things can perhaps go too far. Some vicious sword wielding and head-butting motions in Crytek’s Ryse produced some gruesome effects on screen. Those worried about the effect of violence in video games will find cause for concern where players are carrying out vicious virtual assaults with real actions rather than the traditional button-pushing on a controller, which seems at another remove from the action in comparison.
885;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-05-10T01:48:34Z;YouTube expands movie rentals;;Google has moved to bolster the appeal of its YouTube video site by striking deals with several Hollywood movie studios to make their films available to rent online in the US.The deals with companies including Warner Brothers, NBC Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment will add 3,000 titles to You­Tube’s movie rental service.The site has offered free movies alongside user generated content for the past two years but its move into newer titles aims to capitalise on the gradual shift of viewers online.Salar Kamangar, head of YouTube, wrote in a blog that viewers were spending an average of 15 minutes a day watching YouTube, compared with five hours watching television. “As the lines between online and offline continue to blur, we think that’s going to change,” he said.Hollywood has become more willing to strike deals with operators following the collapse in DVD sales, once the industry’s most profitable revenue stream.The Digital Entertainment Group, which represents studios and consumer electronics groups, published figures last week showing a near 20 per cent annual decline of packaged media sales in the US, including DVDs and Blu-ray discs.The deals between the studios and YouTube will add older titles such as Goodfellas and Scarface to newer films including Inception, The Green Hornet and Despicable Me.YouTube has been deepening its ties with Hollywood for several months, hiring a team of new executives with film industry experience. Last year it hired Robert Kyncl, a former Netflix executive, as well as Alex Carlos and Malik Ducard, two former executives with Paramount Pictures’ digital unit.The new team has been courting talent agencies, outlining plans to create a network of channels based around specific themes or niches, such as fashion, food and video games.YouTube’s Hollywood plans come as other online operators with different business models have emerged as competitors.Netflix, the film and television subscription service, has amassed 24m paying subscribers and plans to expand internationally, first in Latin America. It is aggressively buying streaming rights to films and TV shows and recently struck a deal to buy exclusive rights to the US remake of the BBC hit House of Cards.For YouTube, the Hollywood content will help deepen user engagement. The company generated revenues of $825m in 2010 and is forecast to generate $1.3bn in 2011, according to research by Mark Mahaney, an analyst with Citigroup.
886;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-05-08T22:36:49Z;Netflix pushes into Latin America;;Netflix, the film and television subscription service, is working on a push into Latin America and is close to announcing deals with three of the continent’s biggest broadcasters to begin streaming programming online in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.The California-based group is negotiating to acquire telenovelas and other content from Grupo Televisa and TV Azteca of Mexico, and Globo of Brazil, according to several people briefed on the plans.Netflix declined to comment on its Latin America plans, though it told the Financial Times that the group had significant international ambitions. “Our long-term goal is to have a worldwide service at some point,” the company said.Televisa, TV Azteca and Globo declined to comment.Netflix has almost 24m subscribers in North America, including about 800,000 in Canada – up from about 15m a year ago. Reed Hastings, its chief executive – and a Microsoft board member – told Bloomberg TV last week that Netflix was on a 70 per cent growth curve.It plans to launch its streaming service in many territories in the next few months, offering a mix of locally produced content and US-made films and TV programmes.Internet penetration in Latin America and the Caribbean is growing fast, with the region seen as one of the most promising markets for online groups, such as Google, which grew its sales in various countries in the region by between 50 and 100 per cent last year.Netflix’s growth in the US has been fuelled by its aggressive licensing of programming, with the company having 10,000 films on its service.Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS, said this week that a deal struck with Netflix to add CBS programming to its service would generate “hundreds of millions of new dollars” for his company.But while Netflix has positioned itself as a friend of studios, cable and broadcast networks, it continues to be viewed as a disruptive threat – and a potential competitor – to the pay-TV industry.It is increasingly competing with pay-TV operations such as Time Warner’s HBO in the race for premium programming and recently acquired exclusive rights to show the US remake of the hit BBC series House of Cards in a deal that could eventually be worth $100m.Netflix has upended the US home entertainment market. The popularity of its DVD subscription service was a big factor in the decline of Blockbuster, the DVD rental chain.
887;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-05-05T01:43:56Z;Sports viewers boost TV ad revenues in US;;"Rising audiences for sports events are driving a rebound in advertising revenue across US broadcast networks and cable channels, as they approach the annual “upfront” season where media buyers strike deals for new programming.Comcast, Time Warner, News Corp and CBS each cited the effect of sports programming on first-quarter earnings. Time Warner and CBS were boosted by their NCAA college basketball partnership, while News Corp’s television profits quadrupled thanks to advertising on its Super Bowl broadcast and National Football League playoff games.Comcast, the largest US cable group, said ratings improved for National Hockey League games on its newly acquired NBC network, and for its cable sports channels Versus and the Golf Channel.Executives warned that they were alert to the increasing cost of sports rights, however. Sport was “a double-edged sword”, said Chase Carey; costs were a challenge but sport’s appeal only increased when viewers had more channels to choose from and could skip advertising on non-live programming.Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive, signalled upcoming National Football League and Olympics contracts were in his sights but he was wary of overpaying.First-quarter revenues at Comcast’s cable networks rose 13.3 per cent. It said “extremely strong” rates for last-minute “scatter” advertising augured well for the upfront period.Advertising revenue at Time Warner increased by 20 per cent in the first quarter, driven by a 31 per cent increase at Turner, and it said scatter advertising pricing was up 20-30 per cent from the last upfront period.News Corp said advertising on domestic cable channels had risen 14 per cent, after CBS said on Tuesday that broadcast advertising was up 12 per cent and scatter pricing up 40 per cent.The advertising revival is making media owners more confident about spending on content. Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, said investment in programming such as HBO’s new series, Game of Thrones, was “paying off”. Stephen Burke, chief executive of Comcast’s NBCUniversal division, said it would invest $200m in the core NBC broadcast business this year.Media owners were more confident about digital technologies. Mr Bewkes said subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix would complement rather than replace cable or satellite television, but emphasised Time Warner would supply them mostly with older shows. Mr Carey also said Netflix could boost “under-exploited” content libraries.Time Warner’s film studio Warner Bros announced acquisition of Flixster, a social network for film fans, which Mr Bewkes said it would use “to dramatically improve the consumer proposition of owning digital movies”, in partnership with other studios."
888;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-05-04T00:58:37Z;CBS in no hurry to sell billboard business;;CBS would listen to an offer for its billboard business from JCDecaux, but is in no hurry to sell to its French outdoor advertising competitor, executives said on Tuesday.Announcing surging first-quarter profits across the company’s divisions, Les Moonves, chief executive, confirmed that CBS saw itself primarily as a content company, “but outdoor is a wonderful business”.Jean-Francois Decaux, co-chief executive of the family-led street furniture company, sparked a war of words in March when he said that he expected to have the opportunity to buy the UK operations of either CBS Outdoor or Clear Channel Outdoor this year.“We are here. He has our phone number. If he wants to make an offer, we will always listen to it,” Mr Moonves said, but he added: “We have no great intent to sell it.”CBS Outdoor revenues increased 5 per cent to $413m in the quarter, despite a 6 per cent decline in Europe. Operating income before depreciation and amortisation jumped 53 per cent to $49m.“When [Mr Decaux] does call, I will remind him that the earnings are up 53 per cent. So whatever the offer is, multiply it by plus 53,” said Joe Ianniello, chief financial officer, adding that he expected “real upside” from the company’s London Underground contract during the 2012 Olympic Games.Mr Decaux had no comment.Sumner Redstone, chairman of CBS, said the group’s first-quarter performance showed “extraordinary momentum”. Hailing Mr Moonves as “a genius”, he said he was very confident that the group would reach “even greater heights throughout the rest of the year and beyond”.Strong advertising growth and increases in non-advertising revenues offset the loss of this year’s Super Bowl broadcast rights to Fox, the company said.Mr Moonves announced that a 29 per cent increase in free cash flow would permit it to double its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share. CBS spent $251m buying back its shares in the first quarter.Mr Moonves again said that broadcast television was “still the best game in town,” singling out the core CBS channel as ”by far the most stable network in the business”. Advertising on the network was up 12 per cent excluding the effect of the Super Bowl.The advertising market looked “highly favourable” as the “upfront” season approaches, when broadcasters set out their schedule plans for advertisers, he said, with “scatter” pricing for advertising time bought in the open market “extremely hot”, up 40 per cent from last year’s upfront period.The group’s figures were also skewed by a new deal with Time Warner’s Turner Broadcasting in which the two companies share revenues from NCAA basketball tournament broadcasts. Total revenues were flat at $3.51bn and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortisation rose from $294m to $576m.Mr Moonves had warm words for Netflix, the DVD rental and online video streaming service with which CBS announced a US deal in February for programming that had already aired elsewhere. That deal would generate “hundreds of millions of new dollars,” he said, with “meaningful revenue” starting in the second quarter.CBS was in serious discussions with Netflix about further deals in Latin America and Canada, he added, while competitors such as Amazon.com and Dish Network, the satellite broadcaster that bid $320m last month for Blockbuster, were also eager for its content.
889;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-05-04T00:38:57Z;Comcast continues to lose cable customers;;Comcast lost 39,000 cable television subscribers in the first quarter, a development likely to add fuel to the debate over so-called “cord cutting”, when consumers give up pay television subscriptions in favour of online offerings.Comcast’s video subscriber count slipped to 22.76m, almost exactly matching that of Netflix, the DVD subscription and film streaming service, which has 22.8m US customers. Netflix, however, charges just $8 to $15 per month, compared to an average of $71 per month for Comcast.The 3 per cent dip in overall video subscribers was less than analysts expected and marked the company’s narrowest loss in years. It came as the company gained internet and voice subscribers and benefited from the integration of NBCUniversal for the first full quarter.And Comcast managed to squeeze more revenues out of fewer customers. Video revenues were up 1.7 per cent to $4.9bn.Overall, Comcast, the cable and entertainment conglomerate, reported first-quarter revenues of $12.1bn, a 32 per cent increase from the same time a year earlier. This is the first quarter the company is reporting integrated results after its takeover of NBCUniversal, which closed in January.Net income for the quarter was $943m, up 9 per cent from a year earlier. Earnings per share were 34 cents, beating analyst estimates of 32 cents.In an unusual move, Comcast is to hold its earnings conference call on Wednesday morning, the day after it reported earnings. A company spokesman said this was a one-time occurrence, designed to give investors and analysts more time to examine the integrated results.Comcast gained 418,000 high-speed internet customers, and revenues from this offering were up 8.8 per cent to $2.1bn. Comcast also gained 260,000 voice customers, and revenues from this service were up 6.5 per cent to $860bn.NBCUniversal, which includes the company’s cable television stations, the NBC broadcast network, the Universal Pictures film studio and theme parks, reported overall revenues dipped to $4.35bn from $4.9bn last year when NBC generated $782m from programming around the 2010 Winter Olympics.Excluding the Olympics, NBC broadcast revenues were up 4.3 per cent thanks to stronger advertising revenues. NBC’s cable networks, which include MSNBC and Bravo, saw revenues jump 13.3 per cent to $2bn.“The performance of NBCUniversal was led by our cable networks, which posted strong growth across the board,” said Brian Roberts, Comcast chief executive. “While we’ve only been operating the NBCUniversal businesses for three months, we’re encouraged by a seamless integration and we are working diligently to invest and build value for our shareholders.”Comcast’s takeover of NBCUniversal marks one of the boldest bets in the media and entertainment business in years, combining the biggest cable company in the US with the group behind some of the most influential television and movie programming.
890;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Plunge in DVD sales poses challenge for Hollywood;;Sales of new DVDs have collapsed, falling 20 per cent in a year and presenting a significant challenge for Hollywood film studios, according to figures released on Monday.Worryingly for Hollywood, which has been grappling with many of the same issues that decimated the music industry, the decline of DVD sales, once the film industry’s biggest revenue generator, has not been offset by other areas.Total sales from film-related “packaged goods”, which include DVD and Blu-ray discs, fell from about $2.6bn to $2.1bn in the US, according to the Digital Entertainment Group, which represents film studios and consumer electronics companies. The DEG said the decline was related to the success of films released in the period, with the first quarter of 2010 having a stronger selection of films than the start of 2011.However, the scale of the decline will cause anxiety in Hollywood, where technology continues to wreak havoc on established business models and revenue streams.The DEG figures suggest consumers are shifting their spending away from buying films in favour of streaming them online or watching them via film subscription services such as, Netflix.Spending on renting DVDs in physical stores, such as Blockbuster, also collapsed, falling 36 per cent in the first quarter to $440m, according to the DEG.Blockbuster was recently taken out of bankruptcy protection when its assets were acquired by Dish Network, the satellite TV group.Spending on streaming and subscription services had risen 33 per cent to $523m in the period, the DEG said. “The industry has proved resilient, with modest gains posted in a number of key areas,” the organisation said.“The home entertainment business is morphing, as increased enhancements to technologies like Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D and new digital service offerings are made available.”Total spending on home entertainment, which includes DVD and Blu-ray rentals and sales, together with electronic downloading, fell 10 per cent to $4.7bn.Several studios are signing up to release their films on an on-demand basis in the home just two months after they have been screened in cinemas.The scheme, which is being promoted by DirecTV, the pay-TV group, has caused consternation among cinema chains and some film directors.
891;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-26T20:43:28Z;Industrials lift Wall Street;;The S&P 500 index jumped to a multi-year high after promising consumer confidence data and a range of strong earnings reports from leading industry names, such as Ford Motor, 3M and UPS.Shares in Ford rose 0.8 per cent to $15.66 after the carmaker reported first-quarter net earnings of $2.55bn, its highest profit for the period in 13 years and a 22 per cent advance on a year earlier. Its 61 cents of earnings per share in the quarter, up from 50 cents a year earlier, was also well above the 46 cents estimated by analysts.3M gained after the industrial group reported a 16 per cent jump in first-quarter profit.The stock was up1.9 per cent to $95.94. George Buckley, 3M’s chief executive, said that demand for materials used in the screens for tablet computers was “going up like a rocket ship. And we are the supplier to those folks”. But he added that disruptions from the Japanese earthquake would hit earnings by 10-13 cents per share this year.United Parcel Service also recorded gains after one of the world’s largest package delivery companies managed to shrug off higher fuel prices and bad weather to report a 66 per cent jump in net income for the first quarter. UPS reported net income of $885m, or 88 cents in diluted earnings per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 85 cents a share and sending shares in the company up 0.9 per cent to $74.30. The logistics group, which is often regarded as a bellwether of the global economy, also reported higher margins and raised its full-year earnings forecast.Cummins jumped 7.6 per cent to $116.39 after the maker of truck engines reported that its first-quarter profit had more than doubled. The well-received results left the S&P industrial sector up 1.8 per cent, the best performing sector on the S&P.Caterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.8 per cent to $111.94 while General Electric gained 1.1 per cent to $20.10, as both stocks benefited from the generally higher sentiment in the industrial space.These gains helped the benchmark S&P 500 index close 0.9 per cent higher at 1,347.24, its highest level since June 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.9 per cent to 12,595.45 while the Nasdaq gained 0.8 per cent to 2,847.54, a 3½-year high.Also lifting sentiment in the wider markets was news that the US consumer had become slightly more optimistic in April, according to data from the Conference Board.The research group said that its index of consumer confidence increased to 65.4 in April, up from a revised 63.8 in March as more Americans said they expected their incomes to rise in the near future.On the negative side, the Richmond Federal Reserve reported weaker manufacturing activity and US home prices fell by 3.3 per cent in February from a year earlier, according to the S&P Case-Shiller home price indices. The fall in house prices was not unexpected.Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, said that now “rest period” in the markets was likely over the coming months, with the S&P ending the quarter only very slightly higher from here.Results from Coca-Cola were the only big disappointment of the session, as the company’s first-quarter earnings per share came in a penny short of Wall Street estimates. In spite of this, net income at the world’s largest soft drinks company by revenues rose 18 per cent from the same period last year to $1.9bn, or 82 cents a share.It also reported a rise in sales around the world in spite of rising commodity prices and political turmoil. Still, the earnings miss left the stock down 1.2 per cent at $66.93.Shares in Netflix fell 9 per cent to $228.91 after a disappointing earnings outlook. Investors focused on this, in spite of the company reporting net income at the top end of expectations. The DVD subscription and film streaming service said it added more than 3m subscribers in the quarter.Delta Air Lines jumped 11 per cent to $9.99 after the airline’s first-quarter earnings and revenue beat expectation. The world’s largest airline by market value still reported a loss, however, due to higher fuel costs.Emulex, the chipmaker, fell 6.2 per cent to $9.71 after forecasting disappointing fourth-quarter adjusted earnings.
892;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-26T08:54:13Z;New subscribers help Netflix to double profits;;Netflix added more than 3m subscribers to its DVD subscription and film streaming service and pledged to strike more exclusive content deals as it reported a doubling of first-quarter profits.The company has drawn level with Comcast, the largest cable television operator, with 23.6m subscribers to its video service.Much of its growth will depend on international expansion. Reed Hastings, chief executive, in his quarterly letter to shareholders, said Netflix planned to expand into two new markets, following its recent launch in Canada.Netflix has added 800,000 subscribers in Canada and wants to bring its streaming service to other countries to capitalise on growth in online video viewing.It expects to incur $50m-$70m of operating losses in the second half of the year related to a second international market and will explore launching in a third territory in early 2012 given the “high probability of success” in the second market, it said.Netflix is shifting its spending from posting DVDs to subscribers to acquiring new content for its streaming service. “We believe that DVD will be a fading differentiator, given the explosive growth of streaming,” Mr Hastings wrote.Netflix has struck several deals with US broadcast and cable networks, buying full series of popular TV shows such as Mad Men and Glee.It has also taken its first step into original content with the acquisition of rights to screen the US remake of the BBC’s House of Cards before the series is aired anywhere else. The group, which could spend $100m on the House of Cards deal, said it was on the lookout for more exclusive content.“Ideally, we’ll license two or three similar, but smaller, deals so we can gain confidence that whatever results we achieve are repeatable,” wrote Mr Hastings.The company denied that it was responsible for “cord-cutting”, the term given to people who cancel their cable TV subscriptions in favour of online alternatives.“The data show that Netflix is a supplemental channel” to pay television, Mr Hastings wrote. “While Netflix is likely to show huge growth again this year, we think …cord-cutting will be minimal to non-existent.”Revenues for the three months to March 31 rose from $493.7m a year ago to $718.6m. Net income was at the top end of expectations, increasing from $32.3m to $60.2m. Earnings per share rose from 61 cents to $1.14.The shares fell $12.82, or more than 5 per cent, to $239 in after-market trading on investor concerns over whether growth could be sustained.

894;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-20T17:09:47Z;Advertisers must plan for soap opera’s second act;Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson on the search for a viable economic model in the digital media era;"“Beloved soap star” should rank high on the list of the world’s most dangerous jobs. In few other professions is the risk of being killed off so high. Even by the standards of the genre, however, the body count is starting to look far-fetched.Last week, Disney’s ABC announced plans to cancelAll My Children and One Life To Live, each of which had been highlights of US daytime television for more than four decades. Their demise follows the untimely end of As the World Turns and Guiding Light, two Procter & Gamble-produced CBS soaps dating from the days when soap brands gave the format its name.The list of suspects is long. More women now work, so daytime audiences are dwindling – even Oprah Winfrey, the queen of US daytime talk shows, is leaving for her own 24 hour cable channel. In the UK, there has been speculation about Channel 4’s Hollyoaks. But other British soaps such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, which air in the early evening, have fared better.The distractions of multi-channel TV, primetime hits stacked up on digital video recorders and Facebook all bear some blame, but Sam Ford, author of The Survival of the Soap Opera, adds two other culprits to the list.Soaps’ serial storytelling style has invaded primetime dramas from 24 to Glee, he argues, so the daytime format no longer stands out as it once did. But he places most blame at the feet of the very advertisers that created the genre: brands’ obsession with targeting precise slivers of the population distracted them from the broad audiences that soaps once attracted.As soap opera viewers aged, becoming less Young and Restless and more General Hospital broadcasters’ attempts to win back the younger women advertisers want to reach with racier scripts only alienated the remaining viewers, he argues.That is debatable, but this week, one advertiser saw its chance to exploit fans’ sense of bereavement. Brian Kirkendall, vice-president of marketing for Hoover, issued an open letter to fans of All My Children and One Life to Live, saying that it would stop advertising on the ABC shows. It also promised to “help get your voice heard” by collecting “the mass emotional outpouring of support for our beloved ABC soaps” via an e-mail address, SaveTheSoaps@Hoover.com.Advertisers would do better to forget such stunts and start thinking about whether they can help create a more viable economic model for the soap opera in the digital media era.Just as soap stars have been shot, burnt alive and pulverised in aeroplane crashes and still reappeared years later, there is nothing outlandish about scripting a second act for the soap opera itself.The intellectual property such brands have built up over decades still has value, and some of the 2.5m-plus viewers each show on ABC’s death row pulls in every day would follow them to a new home.As advertisers have tired of soap operas, they have focused instead on what “original branded entertainment” could do for them online. Internet-only shows such as The Thread on Yahoo are the new frontier of professionally-produced product placement. Despite much hype about the ""webisode"" format, from Katemodern on Bebo to the Lexus-sponsored Web Therapy with Lisa Kudrow, however, none has found a large audience. An online All My Children could break that mould.Advertisers such as P&G, which just sold Pringles to Diamond Foods, should realise that “orphan’ brands can be worth a lot to smaller companies even when they are no longer core to their original owners. In television terms, this means that shows that no longer pay their way on broadcast networks could profitably anchor a cable channel’s daytime line-up, with its dual revenue streams of advertising and cable system fees. The Discovery-backed Oprah Winfrey Network, after a sluggish start, could be an ideal home for another daytime TV exile.Even if advertisers have truly given up on the soap opera, the format could still live on under a subscription-only model. As Netflix has transformed itself from a DVD rental business, its success in streaming video has put it on a collision course with traditional media companies which fear that it will undermine their lucrative cable and satellite business.Content owners are now demanding higher prices to license their prime television and film content. Netflix has also bid against the likes of HBO for a $100m new political series, signalling that it has ambitions in original production.Rather than splash such sums on one-off primetime dramas, why not invest in a proved soap opera brand? That would bring in a new audience, and strengthen the appeal of a monthly subscription. Netflix could do with some cliffhangers, other than those about its own business model.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the Financial Times’s media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com"
895;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
896;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-12T01:21:34Z;Level 3 to acquire Global Crossing;;"Level 3 Communications has agreed to acquire Global Crossing in an all-paper deal for $1.9bn that will significantly expand Level 3’s reach and customer base.Level 3 provides the network backbone for online video streaming services such as Netflix, as well as a wide range of long-haul internet-based communications services for business customers and telecoms companies.The deal, just weeks after AT&T announced its $39bn proposed purchase of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA mobile unit, is a further sign of consolidation in the telecoms industry, which analysts said should lead to significant cost savings for the combined company.“The two most competitive segments within telecom have been wireless and long haul,” said Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse in a note to investors.“We have seen consolidation in wireless; with this deal we are now seeing the benefits of consolidation in long haul. The long-haul market should see more stable pricing as a consequence of this deal, which should lead to higher revenue growth, higher margins and improved returns for the industry.”Level 3’s offer values Global Crossing at $23.04 a share, a premium of 56 per cent to the company’s closing price on Friday.Under the terms of the deal, which has been approved by Singapore Technologies Telemedia – Global Crossing’s largest shareholder with a stake of about 60 per cent – Global Crossing shareholders will receive 16 shares of Level 3 common stock for each share held. Level 3 will also assume $1.1bn of Global Crossing’s debt, bringing the deal’s enterprise value to about $3bn. Once the deal closes, ST Telemedia is to nominate directors to the board, relative to the size of its stake.The combined entity will create a company with revenue of $6.26bn and earnings of $1.57bn, after taking into account projected cost savings, and will help Level 3 expand into Latin America and Europe.ST Telemedia funded the rescue of Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy protection in early 2002. Since then a management team led by John Legere, chief executive, has nursed it back to health.Level 3 has reported quarterly losses for the past two years after many businesses put on hold their plans for online-networking services. However, there have been recent signs of business spending on technology and telecoms services picking up. Similarly, Global Crossing’s quarterly results have been improving, although it reported a net loss of $176m last year on revenues of $2.61bn.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley advised Level 3 on the deal.Shares of Global Crossing soared 79 per cent to a four-year high while Level 3’s shares were up 12 per cent in early afternoon trading."
897;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-08T22:03:13Z;YouTube launches live streaming;;YouTube has taken a big step into territory dominated by television networks with the launch of live streaming functionality, which will allow its partners to broadcast live on the web to the video site’s vast global audience.YouTube has been working on adding live streaming for several months and said it would initially make it available to a limited number of its partners “with accounts in good standing”, with the aim of expanding the service later.“The goal is to provide thousands of partners with the capability to live stream from their channels in the months ahead,” the company said in a blog post.The company, which is owned by Google, has experimented with live streaming before, hosting a live interview with Barack Obama, US president, and broadcasting live coverage of a U2 concert, for example.But this is the first time YouTube has made the service available to multiple partner companies. Thomson Reuters is among companies testing the live service, and Stanford University is also experimenting with streaming.Other companies, such as UStream, already offer live streaming. However, none has the vast audience of YouTube, which is the world’s largest online video provider and has more than 2bn views per day.The launch comes as YouTube attempts to get more professionally made content on its site. The company has been in negotiations with Hollywood’s biggest talent agencies about the creation of content channels organised around particular niches, such as fashion, food or video games.Live streaming will be a component of the company’s new channel strategy, although it is unclear whether the site will have enough marquee programming – such as live sport – which can attract the large audiences coveted by advertisers.Josh Siegel, YouTube product manager, told the Financial Times the live launch was “like re-creating YouTube from scratch …could this be analogous to television? Definitely”.The site is also making a push into live sport, he added, although he did not provide any specific information about the sports that might one day be available on YouTube.“We’re going to see a lot of activity in the sports area. We’ve been ramping up a big development team … and we expect to see that content coming on to the site.”YouTube’s live streaming launch comes as the media and technology sectors continue to converge at a rapid rate.Netflix, the largest DVD subscription and movie streaming service, has moved into original programming, spending an estimated $100m to buy the rights to a US remake of the House of Cards series.Facebook has also made a push into online video, striking a deal with Warner Brothers to make the Hollywood studio’s movies available to stream to users of the social network.
898;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-06T21:10:35Z;Tech stocks lift Wall Street higher;;Cisco Systems led the gains in the technology sector after a candid admission of management failures led to hopes of a turnround. But losses in the materials and energy sectors weighed on Wall Street, leaving the wider indices only slightly higher in the session.Shares in the internet equipment company were up 4.9 per cent to $18.07 after John Chambers, chief executive, made a rare admission of failure and signalled a shake-up to refocus Cisco on its most important markets.He said that the company’s strategy was “sound”, but added that they had been slow to make decisions and had “lost the accountability that has been a hallmark of our ability to execute consistently for our customers”.Cisco’s stock has fallen 27 per cent since the start of 2010 at a time when the Nasdaq Composite has risen by 23.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the technology sector, semiconductor stocks saw gains. These were led by Broadcom, the chipmaker, which added 3.9 per cent to $39.95 after Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on the stock from “perform” to “outperform”, citing the growth in wireless markets and networking.This helped related semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices was up 4 per cent to $8.43, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 1.5 per cent, adding to the 2.3 per cent gain in the previous session. Sentiment in the sector continued to be high following Texas Instruments’ agreed $6.5bn deal to acquire National Semiconductor.Overall, the S&P technology sector was up 0.7 per cent, the best performing S&P sub-index. The benchmark S&P 500 was only up 0.2 per cent at 1,335.54.In the energy sector, oilfield service stocks were the worst performing. Cameron International lost 2.5 per cent to $55.30 while Halliburton fell 2.6 per cent to $48.41. The S&P energy sector was 0.9 per cent softer.In the materials sector, it was coal miners that suffered the most as investor confidence in global demand took a turn. Massey Energy fell 3.5 per cent to $67.59 while Peabody Energy declined 3.7 per cent to $69.56.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.3 per cent to 12,427.13 and 2,799.82 respectively.The S&P 500 index has now added 6.2 per cent this year boosted by a sense that the fundamentals of the US economy are improving. “Macro outlook in the US is slightly more positive compared to the past few quarters. Economic sentiment in Europe remains choppy, but trends appear to be stabilising,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.Technical analysts at JPMorgan Securities argued that in the short term the S&P was likely to see highs of 1,344, while in the second quarter the index was likely to trade between 1,353 and 1,367.Over the year the S&P 500 would face a ceiling of between 1,420 and 1,440, they argued, suggesting the S&P could still rise a further 7.8 per cent this year at its peak, on top of the 6.2 per cent added already.In corporate news, shares in Monsanto lost ground after the world’s largest seed company by revenues reported disappointing revenues, sending the shares down 5.7 per cent to $69.16. But the company also beat estimates for its earnings per share and confirmed guidance for the year.American Superconductor tumbled 41.6 per cent to $14.47 after the maker of wind turbine components and transmission lines said it expected to report a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter after Sinovel Wind Group refused to accept shipments.Cephalon was down 0.5 per cent to $77.02 after the drugmaker rejected the $5.7bn bid offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, saying that the offer undervalued the company.Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was fractionally higher at $24.32 after it won an auction to buy the bankrupt Blockbuster film rental chain for $320m. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy protection in September with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn.Transatlantic Holdings added 2.8 per cent to $50.60 after the reinsurer formerly owned by American International Group said that its first-quarter catastrophes cost was $355m, including about $240m from last month’s Japanese earthquake and tsunami.Optical networking stocks saw gains. JDS Uniphase added 2.3 per cent to $19.58 while Oclaro rose 7.6 per cent to $11.72.
899;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-06T12:25:54Z;Dish Network to buy Blockbuster for $320m;;Dish Network, the satellite television provider, will acquire bankrupt video rental chain Blockbuster in a $320m deal that marks the end of an era for home entertainment.Blockbuster once dominated the home video and DVD rental market in the US but has lost ground to mail-order DVD services such as Netflix, online offerings from Apple and others, and on-demand options from cable and satellite providers, including Dish Network.In September it filed for bankruptcy protection with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn. Despite a last-ditch marketing effort that emphasised its own mail-order and streaming options, which have failed to catch on, the company continued to close stores.Dish won the bankruptcy auction with a bid valued at $320m. After closing costs and adjustments for cash and inventory, Dish Network expects to pay about $228m, and said the deal would close in the second quarter.In the bankruptcy auction, which took place on Tuesday in New York, Dish faced competition from activist investor Carl Icahn, who already owns a large block of Blockbuster senior notes. Also bidding was a group of creditors known as Cobalt Video, which included Monarch Alternative Capital, according to the New York Times.In announcing the deal, Dish Network made it sound as if it might seek to preserve the Blockbuster brand.“With its more than 1,700 store locations, a highly recognisable brand and multiple methods of delivery, Blockbuster will complement our existing video offerings while presenting cross-marketing and service extension opportunities for Dish Network,” said Tom Cullen, executive vice president of sales, marketing and programming for Dish Network.“While Blockbuster’s business faces significant challenges, we look forward to working with its employees to re-establish Blockbuster’s brand as a leader in video entertainment.”But given the troubles Blockbuster has faced in recent years, analysts were not certain what Dish Network, led by billionaire founder Charles Ergen, would do with the struggling brand.“It is not yet clear what Ergen might do with Blockbuster,” Credit Suisse analysts Stefan Anninger and Ashton Ngwena wrote in a note last week after Dish’s interest was made public.“But the company does have a well-recognised brand and Ergen could attempt to reorganise the company into a Netflix-like entity which would stream video content while continuing with DVD rentals, [or] offer Blockbuster services for a fee to current and future Dish [subscribers] in his efforts to fight churn and improve his current offering.”
900;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-04-01T19:26:00Z;Icahn makes bid for Blockbuster;;Carl Icahn, the activist investor, has submitted a $300m bid to take Blockbuster out of bankruptcy, according to a person familiar with the situation.The chain used to dominate the video and DVD rental market but has struggled to adjust to the advent of subscription DVD services, such as Netflix, kiosk operators such as Redbox and digital downloads.It sought bankruptcy protection last September when it said that it had gross debt of $1.46bn and assets of $1bn. Since then, more of Blockbuster’s 5,000 stores have closed while its rivals, namely Netflix, have continued to expand.Mr Icahn is likely to face competition for Blockbuster: the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Friday that Charlie Ergen, the billionaire behind Dish Network, the satellite television company, had submitted a bid of about $290m.It also emerged this week that SK Telecom, South Korea’s largest wireless carrier, is considering bidding for the video rental chain, in an effort to strengthen its content development, according to a person close to the company.Mr Icahn amassed a large position in Blockbuster debt during 2010 and owns about a third of the company’s senior notes. The company is one of several film industry investments by Mr Icahn, who also owns large stakes in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment, the company behind the Mad Men seriesHe recently warned that another market downturn could be in the offing, telling the Financial Times that “you’ve got to be myopic if you’re not at least concerned that there might be a major correction”.The warning came as Mr Icahn told outside investors in his Icahn Partners hedge fund that their money was no longer required.However, his bearish views of the market have not deterred him from pursuing Blockbuster.A US federal bankruptcy court judge recently approved the sale of the company so that it could avoid liquidation. The company agreed to sell itself to a group of creditors for about $290m in a so-called “stalking horse” bid as a way of drawing more offers.The stalking horse bid was submitted by a group of hedge funds: Monarch Alternative Capital, Owl Creek Asset Management, Stonehill Capital Management and Värde Partners.The film industry will be watching the progress of the Blockbuster auction with great interest. The chain was formerly one of its biggest customers and still owes money to Summit Entertainment, the company behind the Twilight series of movies.Summit recently filed a legal action against Blockbuster, alleging that it is owned about $10m for Blu-ray and traditional DVDs of its movies including Eclipse and Red.
901;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-30T08:59:25Z;SK Telecom considers bid for Blockbuster;;SK Telecom, South Korea’s largest wireless carrier, is considering bidding for bankrupt US video rental chain Blockbuster, in an effort to strengthen its content development, a person close to the company said.The unexpected move comes as the South Korean company is actively searching for opportunities to expand abroad to make up for stagnant growth at home. The country’s leading telecoms operator, which controls about 50 per cent of the domestic market, has been interested in developing software for mobile phones in recent years.“It is one of many options they are considering as they seek opportunities to expand abroad,” said the person familiar with the company’s situation.In February, a US federal bankruptcy court judge approved the sale of Blockbuster so that it could avoid liquidation. The company agreed to sell itself to a group of creditors for about $290m, as a way to jump-start an auction process that could yield a higher bid.SK Telecom’s interest in Blockbuster came as a surprise to many investors, given the dimming outlook of the movie rental business.“We are slightly perplexed because no immediate synergies come to mind and the required restructuring of the company could be very costly,” David Lee, an analyst at CLSA, said in a report. “A consummated Blockbuster deal would be quite negative due to the large size of the company and its declining business.”SK Telecom declined to comment on why it is interested in the deal. But some analysts said that the company appeared attracted to Blockbuster’s digital content distribution business.“It seems to be part of its efforts to diversify content sourcing as it shifts its focus to data services amid the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets,” said Yang Jong-in, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.Blockbuster, which has 2,500 outlets, filed for bankruptcy in September 2010, after it failed to keep pace with new competitors such as Netflix and Coinstar’s RedBox.Jung Mang-won, SK Telecom’s former chief executive who stepped down at the end of last year, has said mobile carriers must produce an operating platform and software to raise their competitiveness as smartphones take hold. The mobile phone operator, with about 24m subscribers at home, has recently seen its fortunes boosted by increased data services after years of relative stagnation.Last year, it announced a three-year plan to invest Won1,000bn ($907m) in developing applications and software to export its mobile platform to the US, China and southeast Asia.The company has been keen to expand abroad, although its recent ventures in China and the US ended in failure. It attempted to buy into Sprint Nextel in 2008, but the offer was rejected. The company bowed out of its struggling US mobile business, Helio, in 2008, agreeing to combine it into Virgin Mobile, following years of losses.It withdrew from China in 2009 after selling its minority stake in China Unicom for $1.28bn after failing to make inroads into the world’s largest mobile market by subscribers.
902;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-27T21:31:12Z;Hollywood makeover for YouTube;;Google is deepening its ties with Hollywood by enlisting top stars to supply original content for YouTube in a bid to boost profits and user engagement at the company’s online video site.Google has been making the rounds of Hollywood’s biggest talent agencies, outlining plans to create a network of channels based around specific themes or niches, such as fashion, food and video games.It is offering stars cash advances against future advertising revenues in return for lending their name to these channels and overseeing the content, according to people familiar with the plans. It is unclear how many stars or production companies have signed up.Google declined to comment although other people briefed on the situation stressed that YouTube, the world’s biggest online video site with more than 2bn views per day, was not seeking to move away from its roots as the home of user-generated content.YouTube made revenues of $825m in 2010 and is forecast to generate $1.3bn in 2011, according to research by Mark Mahaney, an analyst with Citi.Still, in meetings with Creative Artists Agency, International Creative Management, United Talent Agency, and William Morris Endeavor Entertainment – the agencies which represent Hollywood’s biggest stars – Google has made no secret of its desire to add more professional, original content to YouTube.The aim is to generate better CPMs – the cost per thousand ad impressions – for the advertising on YouTube, said a person familiar with the situation. “Despite the growth in viewership, YouTube is still struggling to monetise in a meaningful way. They are trying to professionalise their content to get the attention of Madison Avenue.”Google recently acquired Next New Networks, which has relationships with many independent online video producers.Google has also hired a new team of executives with Hollywood experience to lead its push into original content. The company last year hired Robert Kyncl, a former Netflix executive, who negotiated a $900m, five-year deal to stream movies made by Paramount Pictures, MGM and Lions Gate Entertainment for the DVD subscription and movie streaming company.Alex Carlos and Malik Ducard, two former executives with Paramount Pictures’ digital unit, have also joined Google and are working with Mr Kyncl from the company’s Los Angeles office.The new team has already made a big impression in Hollywood. “YouTube is more focused and they have a better plan than they have had in the last five years,” said one film executive pitched to by Google.Google’s push into original content comes as Netflix recently struck a $100m deal to stream a new US version of House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey – before it airs on television.Facebook, meanwhile, is also eyeing the online video space and recently agreed a deal with Warner Brothers to make The Dark Knight available to rent online.
903;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-25T00:35:28Z;Showtime and Starz alter Netflix deals;;Two of the Netflix’s biggest content providers have changed their distribution agreements with the company, reflecting increasing anxiety in Hollywood about the pace of growth at the DVD subscription and movie streaming company.Showtime, the pay-TV service owned by CBS, this week said it would remove all of its first-run programming from Netflix’s streaming service, including shows such as Californication and Dexter.It was followed on Thursday by Starz, a subsidiary of John Malone’s Liberty Media group, which has implemented a 90-day window between the first broadcast date of its shows on its channels and their availability on Netflix.Starz said it would implement the change on April 1. The change only affects original programming from Starz, although the company also plans to negotiate new terms for the movies that it provides Netflix through its distribution deals with Walt Disney and Sony Pictures Entertainment.Netflix said that movies provided by Starz would not be affected by the change. The company also said the change would have little impact on its subscribers.“There’s a natural ebb and flow to the titles available to watch instantly on Netflix,” the company said. “There are titles that come in and out of licence …that’s part of the windowing system that’s been in place in Hollywood for years.”With Amazon also trying to make its presence felt in online streaming – it recently launched its own subscription service – Starz, which scored a hit last year with its Spartacus series, wants to standardise its approach to online distribution of its programming.Netflix has become a valuable partner to pay-TV operators and Hollywood studios because of its willingness to pay for streaming rights to film and TV programming.The company caught Hollywood’s attention last year when it agreed a $900m five-year deal with three studios – Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment – for the right to stream their movies. But the company, which has grown to more than 20m subscribers, is increasingly being seen as a competitor to pay-TV services, such as Time Warner’s HBO.Netflix recently struck a $100m deal to acquire the right to stream a new US version of House of Cards – before the series has aired on TV – and has also openly declared its willingness to go head-to-head with pay-TV channels when bidding for exclusive content.This has caused some friction with Time Warner.Last year Jeff Bewkes, the company’s chief executive, dismissed Netflix, saying: “It’s a bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world? I don’t think so.”Still, Netflix’s growth has impressed Wall Street. It was the best performing stock on Nasdaq in 2010.
904;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-22T20:35:09Z;US stocks pause for breath after 3-day rally;;Walgreen tumbled after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets traders paused for breath following three straight sessions of strong gains.Shares in Walgreen, the largest pharmacy chain in the US by sales, lost 6.6 per cent to $39.21 after reporting earnings that only met analysts expectations.Investors had been hoping for better margins and same-store sales growth, but this failed to materialise. The stock suffered its sharpest one-day fall since December 2008 and was the worst performer on the S&P 500 index.CVS Caremark, another pharmacy chain, was down 0.9 per cent to $33.41 while the S&P retail index was down 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 edged 0.4 per cent lower to 1,293.77 in a low-volume session, as traders paused to take stock of the recent rally that has seen the S&P index pare nearly all of the losses sustained following the earthquake in Japan.Fears of a nuclear catastrophe following the natural disaster left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in the first three days of last week. But as these worries subsided traders sought to pick up bargains pushing the S&P close to pre-tsunami levels.“The market wants to climb higher as the data show the US economy is largely on the right track,” said Harvey Neiman, manager of the Neiman Largecap Value Fund. “But every time we get a good run some disaster hits and we see a lot of volatility,” he added.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, spiked up 46.4 per cent early last week following the earthquake and tsunami, but has also calmed down as fears have eased. The index was down 2.4 per cent in the session, adding to the 29.9 per cent decline in the last few days. The measure of fear on Wall Street is back where it was before the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan.US equities have largely recovered from the effects of Japan, but the S&P 500 is still down 3.7 per cent since before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East in February. The Vix is up 22.5 per cent in the same timeframe.The 3.7 per cent loss on the S&P has been the first substantial retreat since Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his speech at Jackson Hole in late August 2010, where he hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The market subsequently gained 28 per cent in 5½ months until the rally was derailed by the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. “The market was in a position where it needed a correction,” said Robert Haber, the chief executive officer of Haber Trilix Advisors. “But there is a pretty good chance we have seen the short-term lows,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,018.63 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,683.87.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Jefferies Group, the investment bank, reported first-quarter earnings up 21 per cent in what the bank said was the second most profitable quarter on record. Shares in the company had added 4.6 per cent in early trading, but ended just 0.2 per cent higher at $24.48.Anadarko Petroleum signed a $1.55bn deal with the Korea National Oil Corporation for one-third of its interest in the Maverick Basin assets in Texas.The deal, which is the second-largest purchase of US oil and natural gasfields this year, will see KNOC pay all of Anadarko’s 2011 capital costs in the basin and then 90 per cent of costs subsequently until the $1.55bn is spent. The news sent shares in Anadarko up 1 per cent to $80.79.Elsewhere in the sector Newfield Exploration, the US oil group, was up 0.5 per cent to $75.58 while EOG Resources added 1.8 per cent to $113.36.Shares of Dollar General, the retailer, rose 1.5 per cent to $30.84 after the retailer reported that fourth-quarter earnings per share had more than doubled to 64 cents from 26 cents in the same period last year.Netflix gained 4 per cent to $221.39 following a note from Credit Suisse entitled “Don’t Stop Believing,” which upgrades the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Sprint Nextel, the number three US wireless carrier, was up 2.3 per cent to $4.47 following a 13.6 per cent loss in the previous session on news that AT&T was buying T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom.
905;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:52:56+0000;Zediva movie service flops on debut;;When Zediva’s founders briefed me pre-launch on their innovative new online DVD rental service last week, my main concern was whether it could “scale” robustly to cope with thousands of users.Despite their assurances, it seems the answer is it can’t, at least for now. The site was closed to new users within a few hours of its launch on Wednesday and existing users like me are having problems accessing the movie rentals.Zediva’s great attraction is that it can stream movies fresh out on DVD to its members for $2 each or as little as $1, in a 10 for $10 package, plus they can watch the same movie again for free within a 14-day period.In comparison, Amazon Instant Video, Blockbuster and iTunes charge around $4 for a movie, which has to be watched within 48 hours. New DVD releases can take months to show up or don’t figure at all on Netflix’s streaming service.It is hard for a small new entrant to strike deals for streaming movies as secure digital files with the major studios, but Zediva appears to have found an ingenious way round having to do that.It goes out and buys the DVD, pops it in a real DVD player in its Silicon Valley data centre and then links an individual user to the DVD player through streaming software on its website. The user can control the DVD player and the movie remotely, accessing items such as directors’ commentaries and language options – something not possible on other services.Venky Srinivasan, founder and chief executive, told me Zediva had combined three concepts of DVD rental that were already well established, meaning it would be difficult for the movie studios to challenge the service on legal grounds.Services like Netflix and Redbox already rent DVDs to consumers, albeit by mail or dispensing machines. Technology like Sling Media’s Slingbox allows users to access movies and other content remotely through a box connected to their cable or satellite receiver. And operators like Cablevision have introduced the concept of network DVRs, where consumers can replace their box at home with one “in the cloud”.“We are fairly confident that the law allows a user to watch a DVD they’ve rented and we’re actually building upon these other ideas to offer a very compelling service,” he said.“We also spend millions of dollars to buy DVDs, so we would like to think that we are a pretty important customer to [the studios].”A spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Association of America declined to comment on the new service.I was concerned the quality of the picture might not be as good as on Netflix or Amazon and that Zediva’s technology would struggle to cope with thousands of DVD players being accessed at once in its data centre.However, Zediva said its patented technology could scale to support millions of customers and, when I went to its site as a beta user and rented The Social Network at the weekend, the quality and streaming seemed fine as I played it back through Google TV on a 55-inch screen (Zediva is currently available through a web browser, with apps to follow).However, within 10 hours of its full launch, its website crashed and Zediva went on to tweet that it was being forced to close registration for now for new users.When I logged in today and tried to re-rent The Social Network, which I had only partially watched, the service said it was already rented out. In fact, over three-quarters of the 49 rentals on its home page were rented out.In its tweets, Zediva blamed too much media attention for the problems rather than any failings in its own technology or business plan.So maybe lots of bad publicity like this about Zediva falling over is the best antidote for its situation?

907;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-16T07:40:23Z;Netflix in talks over political drama;;Netflix, the film and television subscription service, has taken a big step into territory dominated by broadcasters and pay-TV operators after entering exclusive talks to buy US rights to a new political series starring Kevin Spacey. Its bid could reach as high as $100m.House of Cards, a remake of the BBC political drama series of the same name, is directed by The Social Network’s David Fincher and is being auctioned by Media Rights Capital, the media production company backed by investors including Goldman Sachs and WPP.MRC had attracted bids for the series from several companies, including Time Warner’s HBO channel. But Netflix, which plans to add House of Cards to its large library of programming available online, has outbid HBO with its offer for 26 episodes, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal could be worth as much as $100m if additional episodes are commissioned, this person said. Netflix declined to comment and MRC could not be reached for comment.The talks, which were first revealed on the Deadline website, represent a bold statement of intent from Netflix. If the company completes the deal it would be the first time it has licensed such high-profile original programming.The company has become a new outlet for producers making original television series and films, while its growth – it now has more than 20m subscribers – comes amid a big shift in TV viewing habits in the US. A new generation of younger viewers is watching most of its TV online, using services such as Netflix and Hulu, which is owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and NBC Universal.This has sparked fears among cable TV operators that younger viewers are “cutting the cord”, or cancelling their subscriptions in favour of cheaper, online alternatives that offer more programming to watch on demand.Netflix is the clear market leader in subscription streaming and last year agreed a $900m five-year deal for the right to stream films from three studios – Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment – before they were shown on pay-TV.While Netflix has built a leading position, other operators are trying to crack the subscription market. Amazon is stepping up its efforts to compete with Netflix.In January it acquired Lovefilm, the UK DVD subscription service, for £200m ($320m).
908;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-10T20:58:15Z;Perform plans to raise £70m via flotation;;Perform is set to become the first British digital-media company since Moneysupermarket.com in 2007 to float on London’s main market.The company, which is best known for facilitating an online-only broadcast of an England-Ukraine football match in 2009, provides a variety of online sports content to third parties, mainly video for betting and newspaper sites, as well as running its own services such as Goal.com.In total, its content reaches 95m unique users a month, generating £67.4m ($108m) in revenues from advertising, sponsorship and payments from customer sites.Perform plans to raise £70m to expand internationally, including acquisitions.Given its compound annual sales growth rate of more than 50 per cent in the past three years, the relative scarcity of London-listed digital media companies and recent valuations from similar groups such as Netflix and Mail.ru, people close to the company believe it could achieve a value upon flotation in excess of £500m.Paul Walker, formerly chief executive of Sage, will be Perform’s chairman. Oliver Slipper and Simon Denyer, whose companies Premium TV and Inform Group merged to create Perform in 2007, are joint chief executives.Perform’s business model rests on buying online distribution rights to live and archived content from football leagues, tennis tournaments and other sports groups. Many of those rights are for tournaments outside their country of origin, such as Italian football’s Serie A. It rarely bids for top-tier content such as the UK’s Premier League, preferring “niche” sports and events where competition for rights is less intense.This video is then packaged into a feed and sold to websites, such as Betfair and Bet365, who can use it to entice in-line betting, where punters place bets in the middle of a live match. Such arrangements, which provide Perform with a fixed licence-fee revenue, are currently the largest part of its business.However, Mr Slipper believes advertising and sponsorship is likely to become the main source of revenue, via its YouTube-like ePlayer, which newspapers such as the Daily Mail embed in their sites. Revenue is shared with the publisher.Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and UBS are acting as joint bookrunners.
909;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-08T23:14:17Z;Pace drops as big US order is deferred;;Shares in Pace lost a fifth of their value as the set-top box manufacturer admitted that a big US customer had decided to defer a large order until 2012, which would limit revenue growth this year.The company, which overtook last year Motorola and France’s Technicolor to become the world’s biggest maker of television set-top boxes by shipments, said the customer had decided to wait for next generation technology, meaning that sales would not be accounted for in 2011.The shares fell 20 per cent to 176.4p as investors reacted badly to the contract deferral, which only emerged in an analyst conference call after Pace had released full-year results. There was no mention of the deferral in the results statement itself.Analysts were also concerned that growth appeared now to be coming mainly from businesses acquired recently such as 2Wire. The California-based broadband router maker was one of three companies Pace bought last year.Ian Robertson, an analyst at Seymour Pierce, said that while Pace pointed to 2011 revenue growth on a par with last year at about 17 per cent, it was apparent that sales in the core set-top box business would be flat.Neil Gaydon, who took over as chief executive in 2006, said conditions across all the company’s markets were positive and that Pace expected to benefit from the push into hybrid internet-enabled pay-TV where it serves customers such as Comcast and AT&T.Pace, which was fined by the Financial Services Authority in 2005 in part for failing to reveal in its results that a trade credit insurance agreement had been withdrawn, said it was disappointed by the market reaction, adding that it had delivered “clear revenue guidance for 2011” and a strong set of results.Analysts said the share-price reaction was overdone but there were lingering fears that Pace’s customers in the pay-TV market would in time be squeezed as, increasingly, consumers downloaded TV programmes and videos over the internet from companies such as Google and Netflix.Pre-tax profits were up 1.7 per cent at £71.1m on sales that rose 17.7 per cent to £1.3bn. Earnings per share fell from 17.2p to 16.1p.Pace proposed a final dividend of 1.45p, resulting in a full-year pay-out up 45 per cent at 2.175p.Pace – which works with more than 160 operators to create digital, high definition, 3D and hybrid set-top boxes – shipped 22.2m devices over the course of the year, up 29 per cent.Additional reporting Masa Serdarevic
910;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-03-07T22:45:07Z;Wall St gives up gains amid global uncertainty;;Shares in Starbucks ticked higher after a rating upgrade and comments from its chief executive officer about future acquisitions. But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector. Western Digital, the hard drive maker, announced a deal to buy Japanese rival Hitachi’s hard disk drive business for $4.3bn in cash and stock. The news sent shares in Western Digital up 16.2 per cent to $34.87.Accuray, the medical equipment maker, said it would buy TomoTherapy, a radiation treatment company for about $277m, or $4.80 a share in cash and stock. TomoTherapy was up 24.5 per cent to $4.57 while Accuray fell 10.1 per cent to $9.Shares in OCZ Technology Group were up 15.4 per cent to $9.12 after the company announced that it expected to report record fourth-quarter revenue. The company said it expected revenue of approximately $64m, an increase of nearly 100 per cent from the $32.4m reported in last year.Ciena, a maker of network equipment for phone companies, fell 9.8 per cent to $25.98 after reporting first-quarter results and forecasting that second-quarter revenue would come in below estimates.On Sunday, it was two years since the recession lows for the stock market. Since March 6 2009, when the S&P reached an intraday low of 666.79, the market has almost doubled.Since then, financials have added 169 per cent, consumer discretionary stocks are up 148 and industrials have added 143 per cent. One of the biggest gainers has been Netflix, which has gained 452 per cent to $207.40.
911;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Smaller rivals lead big banks in US stocks;;Medium-sized investment banks strode to dominance in the latest FT/StarMine broker rankings in the US, evidence that their aggressive expansion since the financial crisis is bearing fruit.For the first time in five years, the larger “bulge bracket” investment banks, such as Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, were not the most successful at recommending when to buy, sell or hold US stocksInstead, Jefferies & Co, an investment bank based in New York, proved best in the industry. It was followed in second and third place by Wells Fargo Securities and Macquarie Research Equities, both of which also fall just below the bulge.“In the last few years we have been able to add a number of very talented people to our team with deep industry knowledge, which has helped us to provide even greater value for our clients,” says Steven Black, global head of equity research at Jefferies.In predicting company earnings, Goldman Sachs topped the rankings for the second consecutive year. Barclays Capital was second, slightly higher than last year.BMO Capital Markets, a Canada-based investment bank, came third on earnings predictions, beating some of its larger US rivals.Youssef Squali, an analyst at Jefferies, made one of the best calls of the year, putting a “buy” recommendation on Netflix in late January. The stock rose 201 per cent over the next 11 months.Gonzalo Iglesias, director of broker analytics at Thomson Reuters, says: “It was a surprisingly difficult year for stock picking in the S&P 500. Despite the index’s significant rise, most brokers had a hard time predicting which stocks would perform better than others. In fact, only seven brokers were able to do so successfully.”“One explanation might come from the generally bullish stance firms take on the largest of American companies – while a larger amount of the growth last year actually came from the middle of the index, with those names up more than 28 per cent on average.”In developed Europe, Barclays Capital came top for broker recommendations. The broker’s European equities sales, trading and research divisions date back only to 2009, when the bank decided to build out from Lehman Brothers’ strong US equities operation, says Ken Lee, BarCap’s deputy head of equity research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. BarCap’s expertise in other markets helped it lure experienced equities analysts to the new group, says Mr Lee, who left Citigroup to help set up the new division.Two of the group’s best calls came from Lehman alumnus Andrew Gardiner, who kept an “overweight” on chipmakers Infineon Technologies and ARM Holdings throughout the year as the stocks gained 81 per cent and 141 per cent respectively.Mr Gardiner says he saw early on that ARM would gain market share and expand beyond mobile phone chips.Evolution Securities came third for recommendations, helped, in part, by two calls from Stephen Malcolm who was able to time when restructuring at BT Group would kick into the company’s share price.Mr Malcolm, a telecoms analyst for 14 years, kept a reduce on the group from the beginning of the year until February as it fell 12 per cent, and then put a buy on the group at the end of May. From May through December, the group rose 51 per cent. “Restructuring stories like BT are always very difficult. Equity analysis is as much an art as science a lot of the time, and restructuring stories are the most artistic,” he says.Citi and Goldman Sachs retained their top positions in the Asia-Pacific region.Goldman Sachs ranked the highest for accuracy of earnings estimates, with Nomura in second place, while UBS came in third.Keith Hayes, co-director of Asia research at Goldman Sachs, says that having the most accurate and timely estimates is “critical” for the broker’s analysts to be “successful in generating alpha”. He says: “We . . . encourage our analysts to take out-of-consensus positions when it is appropriate, but work closely with them to ensure that estimates that are significantly out of consensus are based on strong fundamental analysis”.Citi was top of the table for the returns generated by its analyst recommendations, with George Choi one of the broker’s analysts in the spotlight for his year-long “buy” on Galaxy Entertainment, a casino operator in Macau. The stock gained 174 per cent and outperformed the developed Asia benchmark for hotels, restaurants and leisure by 127 per cent. Mr Choi says part of his thinking for the recommendation was because it was the only one of six operators with a new casino opening in 2011.Banco Santander took top spot in Latin America ahead of Citi and UBS by sticking with buy recommendations that surged through the year. Boris Molina, banking analyst, says it was a “spectacular” year for the region’s banks. “In the end, the countries were not bankrupt, the banks were not bankrupt and the consumers were not bankrupt,” he says. “We had to identify which banks to go for.” He says BCI, which more than doubled in price during the year, was very quick to reduce its exposure to inflation-linked assets as deflation set in, closing positions before the cycle turned.Reporting by Michael Stothard, Sarah Mishkin, Lindsay Whipp and Jonathan Wheatley
912;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-28T21:54:38Z;Wall St rises on strong economic data;;"US stocks extended their recovery from last week’s losses, helped by strong
economic data, positive comments from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and deal activity in the healthcare real estate investment trust sector.The markets were given an early lift by comments from William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, that the outlook for the US economy was “considerably brighter”, but not bright enough for the central bank to withdraw stimulus help.Also helping sentiment was a strong number from the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which measures the number of purchasing managers that are reporting better business conditions.Elsewhere, Ventas, the second-biggest US health-care real estate investment trust by market value, said it would acquire its rival Nationwide Health Properties in an all-stock deal valued at $5.79bn.This sent shares in Nationwide Health up 9.7 per cent to $42.74 while Ventas lost 3.1 per cent to $55.42.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher to 1,327.22, building on the 1.1 per cent rally on Friday.This followed a 2.8 per cent loss earlier last week as the unrest in north Africa and the Middle East led to concerns over the oil supply.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 12,226.34 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,782.27.Many traders used the recent sell-off as an opportunity to re-enter the markets. “The markets are supported by the decent economic data and so many bulls are using the recent correction as an opportunity to add to their positions,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.The rally was broad based, with all of the S&P sectors rising. The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains as global risk appetite edged higher.US Steeladded 1.3 per cent to $57.49 while Nucor rose 2.2 per cent to $47.96. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.Limiting the gains, however, were figures from the Commerce Department showing that consumer spending had risen by less than expected in January. Spending rose 0.2 per cent, less than the 0.5 per cent rise in December and short of the 0.4 per cent expected.However, the figures are likely to have been dented by bad weather. “Looking ahead, assuming that energy prices do not continue to spiral upward, the key determinant of consumer spending growth will be the pace of the recovery in the labour market and hence the path of wage and salary income,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Amazon fell 2.2 per cent to $173.29 after UBS downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, citing concerns that margins will be hit by the company’s new video streaming service.Amazon launched the service last week to compete with Netflix, the film subscription company.Shares in Netflix were down 2.7 per cent to $206.67 and have now fallen 6.7 per cent since last Wednesday.Humana, a health insurance company, was up 3.9 per cent to $65.01 after it was awarded a lucrative contract by the US defence department late on Friday night. The contract had been awarded to UnitedHealth Group in 2009 but Humana successfully challenged the decision.Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company controlled by Warren Buffett, added 2.8 per cent to $87.28 after Mr Buffett said he was prepared for “more major acquisitions” in his annual letter to shareholders.Looking at the month of February, the S&P 500 hasrisen 3.2 per cent, the Dow 2.8 per cent and the Nasdaq 3 per cent. The S&P has seen its third consecutive monthly gain and has risen 26.5 per cent since the start of September. On February 16 the index reached a point where it had doubled from its 2009 lows.The energy sector has been one of the strongest sectors of the month. The S&P oil and gas drilling index saw particular gains, rising 15.5 per cent in a month that has seen oil spike as high as $120 a barrel. The overall energy index was 6.8 per cent higher, up 14.6 per cent over the year. The index has now put on 52.6 per cent since the start of September.The biggest gainer on the S&P in February was JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, which was up 45.4 per cent to $24.67 while Big Lots, a discount retailer, had risen 29.1 per cent to $41.03."
913;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-23T20:26:00Z;Apple risks sowing the seeds of its own downfall;Rivals could gain from 30% subscriptions rule, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson;"His desirable devices get more attention, but Steve Jobs has had as transformative an impact on content as on hardware. No one has done more than Apple’s chief to persuade consumers to part with their cash for media content in digital forms. Yet in the past week Apple has begun to look like the bad guy of digital content.Since Apple’s iTunes store launched in 2003 as a simple, legal download option for a music industry ravaged by consumers’ idea that online content must be free, it has sold more than 10bn songs, shifted 10bn app downloads, moved into films, TV and books, and accumulated the credit card details of 160m people.Media executives spent much of that period reassuring themselves with the cliché that, however much they struggled to work out their digital futures, they had at least learnt the lessons of the music business. Apple’s latest proposal for content, however, raises the question of whether they are making the same errors.Media companies have been entranced by Apple’s iPad. They were reassured when Mr Jobs showcased how good the New York Times looked on its big screen; signed up five of the six biggest book publishers on better terms than Amazon was offering on its Kindle e-reader; and championed Rupert Murdoch’s tablet-tailored The Daily. (Full disclosure: The Financial Times, and its owner, Pearson, have an interest in this issue).Last week, Apple said it would enable subscriptions to magazines, news apps, and streaming media services for iPads, iPhones and iPods, seemingly addressing one of content owners’ few qualms.Yet at the same time it said it would take 30 per cent of subscriptions it processed. For good measure it dispelled media companies’ hopes that it might share meaningful data on apps customers’ identities and behaviour.The prospect has alarmed content owners. Big conglomerates, with fragile but still profitable old business models, may decide they can live with this fee if Apple’s devices expand their markets rather than cannibalising them. But start-ups currently making little or no profit could be crushed by such a toll.Apple needs to tread carefully. If it uses the data it withholds from content owners to favour its iAds advertising platform, for example, media companies would – and should – seize on the chance to have regulators rein it in. Competition authorities move slowly, though, especially in such fast-changing markets.Apple may also yet win the argument that 30 per cent is a fair toll given the phenomenal success its risk-taking has created and the fact that this is already the standard rate in music, books and games (although Google’s announcement of a subscription service for its Android store which would take a 10 per cent cut has set up a tough debate on that point).The bigger risk is that Apple forces media owners into rivals’ hands, filling their devices with more attractive content. “These are the formative and critical moments in the development of the app internet market – the winners could become dominant for decades. And Apple is blowing it,” George Colony of Forrester Research argued last week. If it is not “reasonable and accommodating” now, he said, “we’ll look back at this moment and call it the top for Apple”.Apple has given rivals – notably Google, which has spent years trying to persuade content owners that it is more friend than enemy – a rare opportunity. They and media owners must now seize it.Record labels tried in vain to create a counterweight to Apple with MySpaceMusic, Amazon and the like, but left it too late to challenge iTunes’ dominance. Media groups have a better chance now, as the tablet market and subscription apps are at an earlier stage and competitively priced rival devices flood on to the market.Apple’s acting chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed such concerns last month, citing Apple’s “huge first-mover advantage”. It is evidence of Apple’s market power that it would be a brave media chief executive who turned his back altogether on 160m iTunes customers.Media owners are getting used to being the junior partners to technology groups such as Apple, Google and Amazon. “It’s their world and we’re just living in it,” one publisher said last week. Yet they should remember what happened in music. Apple’s pricing upset labels from the start, but it took them years to extract even small concessions and iTunes did not stop music revenues from halving.Content owners may not get a second chance to improve their digital economics. Cracks are already showing in Apple’s resolve, as it seems to have exempted some popular apps such as Netflix from its new rules. Others with must-have content should now push for their own carve-outs.Having spent a year infatuated with the iPad, holding back from accepting Apple’s terms and backing Android instead for a while looks like a risk worth taking.andrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com"
914;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-23T19:24:03Z;HP results drag US technology sector;;Wall Street saw another day of sharp losses as disappointing results from Hewlett-Packard weighed on the technology sector and investors looked uneasily towards the continuing unrest in the Middle East and north Africa.The technology group surprised traders by reporting weaker-than-expected quarterly revenues, dragged down by lower personal computer sales. The company also lowered its revenue guidance for the current year by $2bn. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $43.36.The earnings news weighed on the sector. EMC, the world’s largest data-storage company by revenue, was down 1.2 per cent to $26.27 and the S&P technology index lost 1.6 per cent.That helped drag the S&P 500 down 0.9 per cent to 1,303.46 by mid-session on Wall Street.In the previous session the index lost 2.1 per cent on the geopolitical tensions and escalating violence in Libya, the sharpest one-day fall on the index in six months. The second consecutive day of losses has prompted commentators to ask whether this is the beginning of the widely prophesised pull-back in the US markets.“This situation has some similarities with the eurozone crisis nearly a year ago which led to a temporary correction in the markets,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “But upwards momentum in the economy looks a lot stronger now than a year ago,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 12,118.45 and the Nasdaq was down 1.7 per cent to 2,710.82. The S&P 500 is still up 2.6 per cent this year. Energy stocks saw some of the few gains in the session as oil prices surpassed $110 a barrel for the first time since before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Industry executives’ estimated that at least half of Libya’s oil production has been shut down due to the violence.Marathon Oil, a leading US oil and gas company, was up 4.2 per cent to $49.69 while Chevron added 3.3 per cent to $103.58. The S&P energy index rose 2.2 per cent to a 2½-year high.Elsewhere in the sector Cabot Oil & Gas was up 12 per cent to $44.59 after the natural gas producer reported strong fourth-quarter results. Range Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production company, rose 8.6 per cent to $52.82.Sentiment in the energy sector was also aided by more deal activity. Enterprise Products Partners, an oil and gas energy partnership, made an offer to acquire Duncan Energy Partners for about $2.41bn.Duncan Energy was up 24.1 per cent to $40.40 on the news while Enterprise Products was down 0.6 per cent to $43.42.This week, Holly and Frontier Oil announced a merger that will create a $7bn oil refining company while BHP Billiton agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy’s shale gas business for $4.7bn.The global energy and power sector has seen the strongest start to the year in terms of mergers and acquisitions activity on record, according Thompson Reuters data.The value of energy and power mergers and acquisitions now totals $93.7bn, a 40 per cent increase over this time last year. Half of this activity has been in the US.Looking at economic data, investors were given some small cause for celebration as data showed that the number of existing home sales rose unexpectedly in January. Home sales were up 2.7 per cent from the previous month, according to the National Association of Realtors, slightly ahead of estimates.But data in the previous session showed that house prices had continued to fall in December, limiting investor optimism about the troubled US housing market.Lowe’s saw losses after the home improvement retailer projected flat comparable store sales and slightly decreasing margins.The company also reported that fourth-quarter profits had jumped thanks to greater demand for house renovation projects, which helped to limit the losses on the stock. The shares were still down 2 per cent to $25.46, however.The results come the day after larger rival Home Depot reported strong quarterly results and raised its profit forecast for the year.Netflix continued to lose ground after news earlier this week that Amazon.com was launching a rival video streaming service. Shares were down 4.8 per cent to $211.02. Amazon slid 3.2 per cent to $174.73.
915;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-23T02:16:46Z;Amazon launches web film service;;Amazon is to compete directly with Netflix, the film subscription company, with the launch of its own film service that will offer 5,000 films and television programmes to stream online.The service will form part of Amazon Prime, the retailer’s premium shipping service which gives customers unlimited shipping for a $79 annual fee. Amazon said many of its customers had already signed up for the shipping service.“They’re going to be able to watch movies without leaving [the site] or going somewhere else,” said Cameron Janes, Amazon’s director of Instant Video.Amazon Prime will be a smaller service than Netflix, which has more films and TV programmes available but Mr Janes said the retailer planned to increase the content available to stream over time.The launch comes as Amazon is stepping up its efforts to compete with Netflix. It has acquired Lovefilm, the UK DVD subscription service, for £200m ($323m). With Netflix looking at expanding into new markets, including the UK and Canada, the tussle between the two companies is likely to extend beyond the US.Netflix has in 10 years signed up more than 20m subscribers to its DVD-by-mail service. But it has also invested heavily in a digital service, striking a range of deals with Hollywood studios and TV networks.Hours after Amazon unveiled Amazon Prime, Netflix announced a two-year deal with CBS, which will see older programmes such as Frasier and Cheers join the Netflix service.The deal comes a year after Netflix agreed a five-year deal worth $900m for the right to stream films from three studios – Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment.Although Netflix is the clear leader in film subscription, technology companies and retailers are competing with Apple in electronic sales and rentals.Walmart is trying to erode Apple’s lead in the digital delivery of films. The retailer is a relatively new entrant in digital film distribution and last year acquired Vudu, a US online film service.But it has quickly become a significant participant alongside Amazon, Microsoft and Sony, which all offer digital versions of Hollywood films to rent or buy online.
916;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-17T00:00:08Z;CBS boosted by local advertising;;Strong local advertising helped CBS Corporation boost revenues 11 per cent to $3.9bn in the fourth quarter, as television, radio and billboards proved popular with advertisers rebounding from the recession.Adjusted net earnings in the quarter rose 78 per cent to $319.4m and adjusted net earnings for the full year more than doubled to $772.7m.Local US broadcasting revenues were up 21 per cent in the quarter from the previous year to $821m, and outdoor advertising revenues were up 6 per cent to $511m.“The resurgence of local advertising is the story here,” said Leslie Moonves, chief executive. “Momentum in outdoor advertising continues as well.”CBS owns its namesake broadcast network, the Showtime premium cable channel, the Simon & Schuster publishing house, a film studio and a large network of billboards. Its broadcast network, the highest rated in the US, saw international syndication fees grow.“TV has a tremendous amount of momentum and advertising dollars are coming in the door,” said Anthony DiClemente of Barclay’s Capital.Ad revenues at the CBS network were up 8 per cent, thanks largely to primetime hits including Hawaii Five-O and sports programming. “There is going to be very little change necessary in our schedule,” said Mr Moonves.Sports ratings were “significantly higher” said Mr Moonves. National Football League ratings were up 10 per cent with the AFC Championship game between the New York Jets and the Pittsburgh Steelers drawing 55m viewers, the most in the game’s history.The Grammy awards on Sunday received its highest ratings in 10 years. “Just like in sports, big ticket events continue to show ratings growth, proving once again that broadcast television is the best game in town,” said Mr Moonves.Affiliate fees from local channels licensing CBS content and subscription fees from Showtime, grew 9 per cent.CBS has been slow to make its content available to online video providers such as Netflix, Hulu and Apple TV. “We’ve been very judicious about the way we grow this new revenue stream,” said Mr Moonves, adding that CBS was looking to do non-exclusive deals while pursuing an aggressive digital strategy on its own sites, including TV.com.Mr Moonves said CBS’s new film unit’s latest release, The Mechanic, would be profitable. Simon & Schuster saw e-book sales rise 160 per cent in the year. “Great content endures and we can monetise it forever,” said Mr Moonves.CBS reduced its debt by $1.4bn during the year and made $167m in contributions to its pension plans during the year, reducing free cash flow.Full year revenue for CBS was up 8 per cent to $14bn, and Mr Moonves said margins would remain high for the years to come. “We’re looking at 2011 and 2012 with great relish,” he said.
917;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-15T22:16:15Z;Weak economic data weigh on Wall Street;;NYSE Euronext lost ground after unveiling formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange, while the wider markets fell away from 30-month highs on disappointing economic data.Shares in NYSE were down 3.4 per cent to $38.12 after it emerged that the German exchange will own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 14 per cent since merger talks were announced, however.The wider markets were lower following data from the Commerce Department showing that US retail sales had risen by their slowest pace since last June . Sales were up only 0.3 per cent in January against the 0.6 per cent forecast by economists.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,328.01, the biggest one-day fall in a month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,226.64 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,804.35.In the previous session, the S&P 500 index crept to within two points of 1,333.58, which is the point where the index will have doubled since its March 2009 low.The S&P has risen more than 23 per cent in the last six months. Given this strong run, many commentators have been forecasting a short-term fall for the few weeks. “The markets are poised for a sell-off, it just needs a trigger,” said Dick Del Bello, senior partner at Conifer Group.Energy stocks saw the sharpest losses as oil prices softened. ExxonMobil was 2.3 per cent lower at $82.97 while Marathon Oil was down 2 per cent at $48.07. The S&P energy index lost 1.1 per cent. ExxonMobil lost ground in spite of reporting that it had added 3.5bn barrels of oil equivalent to its proved reserves last year.There was also an element of profit-taking in the sector following a run that has seen energy stocks put on 45 per cent since the start of September.Elsewhere in the sector, an Ecuadorian court ordered Chevron to pay up to $8.6bn in damages for environmental damage dating back 40 years but the markets seemed largely unruffled by the news. Chevron was only 0.6 per cent lower at $96.34.The wider markets were also weighed down by news that homebuilder sentiment had remained unchanged at its low levels in February, according to the housing market index from the National Association of Homebuilders.“Unfortunately for builders, there is a massive supply overhang of existing homes, which will present brutal competition to the new home market in the foreseeable future,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.In more positive economic news, data from the Bank of New York’s Empire State Manufacturing Survey showed that manufacturing activity had expanded in February.Also, the Empire State’s business conditions index rose to 15.43, which was ahead of the 11.92 reading last month and the 15 expected by economists.FedEx cut its earnings forecast for the third quarter of 2011 by at least 22 per cent, blaming the move on bad weather and volatile fuel prices that have increased expenses and reduced revenues. But this failed to drag down its shares, as the forecast was largely expected. FedEx rose 2.1 per cent to $95.98.The delivery company now expects adjusted earnings to be between 70-90 cents per share for the three months to the end of February, down from previous forecasts of between 95 cents and $1.15.A series of ratings downgrades hurt individual stocks. JDS Uniphase, a maker of optical communications, fell 10.2 per cent to $25.05 after Sanford C Bernstein & Co cut its rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”.Netflix was down 2.7 per cent to $240.79 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the video rental and streaming company to “equal weight” from “overweight”.Qwest Communications International was down 3 per cent to $7.20 after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss caused by a series of one-time charges.Dell, the PC maker, was up 0.2 per cent to $13.92 in anticipation of its quarterly results. After the closing bell, earnings came in at 53 cents a share ahead of estimates of 37 cent per share.Sirius XM Radio, the satellite radio company, was down 7.9 per cent to $1.69 after reporting a fourth-quarter loss, although the number of subscribers grew. Sirius reported a fourth-quarter loss of $81.4m from a profit of $11.9m in the same period a year earlier.
918;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-15T19:17:53Z;Apple clarifies rules for ‘Jesus tablet’;;"A year ago, as publishers awaited the coming of Apple’s iPad, some were talking of it as “the Jesus tablet”, a device that would lead the media industry to digital salvation.A few expressed reservations about what cut Apple would take; whether it would allow recurring subscriptions; and how much customer data it would share.None of those questions were resolved when Steve Jobs’ “magical and revolutionary” product hit the market in April 2010. Now that Mr Jobs has clarified the rules, he has left many content owners concerned.Tuesday’s announcement of a subscription service for iPads and iPhones will save magazine publishers from having to coax another payment out of customers for each new issue. But, said Alan Mutter, a US news industry analyst, “the devil is in the detail”.Apple’s rules – applying to any news, magazine, video or music app that wants to charge subscriptions – will affect the digital revenues of brands as diverse as the New York Times, Elle, Hulu and Spotify. They could also give Mr Jobs’ company a significant share of the booming revenues companies such as Netflix and Amazon.com expect to come via tablet computers.In essence, Apple has told content owners that any subscription deal they want to offer online or inside their apps must also be offered through Apple’s App Store, where Apple will take 30 per cent.Publishers and analysts admitted to lingering confusion, with Ken Doctor, author of Newsonomics, describing the policy as “Byzantine”. But it could have far-reaching effects on Apple’s tablet competition with Google, publishers’ wider digital payment models, and their future balance between advertising and content revenues.Google is not taking a cut of subscriptions through its Android content market, and when Time Inc last week announced a new digital subscription package for Android devices, it hinted that a tough line on revenue sharing from Apple could drive publishers into the arms of rivals.“If stores lock us out, it just means that the other stores will benefit,” said Randall Rothenberg, Time’s chief digital officer.Apple’s move has come as more content owners are debating whether to charge for their content online, as a few titles such as the Financial Times already do. The New York Times will start charging frequent website users next month.Some have charged for mobile and tablet apps while keeping their websites free, but it is unclear whether Apple would continue to allow this.Gordon Crovitz, co-founder of Press+, which implements digital pay models for publishers, said before Apple’s announcement that its subscription plans had “given new momentum to the pay debate.” He added: “People who charge for an iPad app will have quite a hard time doing that if their websites are free.”Ned May, lead analyst at Outsell, cautions, however, that digital subscribers will be worth less to media groups if Apple refuses to share full customer information. The new rules state that customers can choose to give publishers their name, e-mail address and zip code, but offer publishers no details about what customers do in their apps.Publishers will struggle to implement higher-yielding targeted adverts without data on customer behaviour. If only Apple has that information, it will enhance the value of iAds.In practice, most content owners are unlikely to shun the iPad or the iPhone just because of these new rules. “Some [publishers] feel like it’s too steep a price to pay,” said Noah Elkin, principal analyst at eMarketer, but Apple’s clout is such that “it is a necessity in order to compete on digital platforms”.“From a publisher perspective it may be painful, but it may benefit them because of the scale Apple brings,” in the way Apple’s iTunes helped digital music sales a decade ago, Mr Elkin said. iTunes, however, proved to be a mixed blessing for music companies, as Apple both created the legal digital music market and dictated its terms."
919;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-14T21:45:42Z;Wall Street edges higher on deal activity;;General Electric’s announcement that it was making an energy acquisition worth $2.8bn lifted oil services stocks and helped the wider markets rise to new 30-month highs.The biggest US industrial group by market capitalisation said it was buying the well support arm of John Wood Group, the UK oil services company.The news sent shares in GE up 0.8 per cent to $21.50 and helped lift oilfield services stocks. Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure control equipment, was up 4.1 per cent to $58.84 while Schlumberger was up 2.3 per cent to $92.22. The S&P oilfield services sector added 2.1 per cent.The wider energy sector also gained as energy prices ticked up on news that China’s trade surplus had fallen to its lowest level in nine months, indicating strong domestic demand.EOG Resources, a natural gas company, was up 1.6 per cent to $104.90 while Denbury Resources, an oil and gas company, added 5.4 per cent to $22.52. The S&P energy index was up 2.1 per cent.Materials stocks saw strong gains as metal prices also rose. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was up 4.9 per cent to $56.14 while Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, added 5.9 per cent to $92.67. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.This helped the S&P 500 close 0.2 per cent higher to 1,332.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,268.19 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,817.18.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was up 6.7 per cent to $46.35 on rumours that it was in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Starbucks was up 0.8 per cent to $33.60.In more concrete deal news, EchoStar, one of the largest satellite television companies in the US, agreed to buy Hughes Communications, a broadband satellite services provider, for about $2bn including assumed debt.Hughes Communications lost 3.7 per cent to $59.47 while EchoStar was up 3.2 per cent to $30.84.Elsewhere Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the US private equity group, said it was buying Emergency Medical Services at a sharp discount to its current share price. Shares in Emergency Medical Services were down 11 per cent to $62.92 following an offer that, at $64 a share, was a 9.4 per cent discount to Friday’s closing price.The offer price, however, is still 19 per cent above the share price in early December, before EMS said it was looking at strategic alternatives.This string of mergers and acquisition news follows on from heavy deal activity in the previous week. Last Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced last week that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.Retail stocks lost ground in the session after JPMorgan Chase cut its recommendation on Walmart Stores from “overweight” to “neutral”. The world’s largest retailer by sales was down 1.6 per cent to $54.80.That weighed on related stocks. Macy’s was down 3.1 per cent to $23.87 while Sears fell 2.1 per cent to $89.29. The S&P consumer services index was 0.5 per cent lower.Equities across the S&P 500 index fell slightly after President Barack Obama announced $1,100bn in deficit reductions over a 10-year period in his 2012 budget.Netflix, the video rental and streaming service, was up 7.1 per cent to $247.55 after strong data from Nielsen, the media measurement group.MGM Resorts International was down 3 per cent to $15.07 after reporting lower fourth-quarter earnings at most of its Las Vegas resorts and declining casino revenue.Seahawk Drilling was down 41.1 per cent to $4.65 after announcing late on Friday that it was filing for bankruptcy protection.The company said it would sell its fleet of offshore drilling rigs to Hercules Offshore for $105m. Hercules was up 18 per cent to $4.27.Investors continued to react negatively to news that Nokia had entered into a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft. Nokia, which fell 14 per cent on Friday, was down 6 per cent to $8.84 while Microsoft was down 0.1 per cent to $27.23.
920;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-06T21:02:11Z;Epic film battle on the home front;;A drive around the palm tree-lined streets of Los Angeles provides ample evidence that Hollywood’s traditional business model is in a state of flux.Blockbuster, the DVD rental store which used to pay movie studios hundreds of millions of dollars a year for their movies, once had outlets scattered across the film industry capital. But most have closed and are empty and boarded up since the chain sought bankruptcy protection last year.The company found itself struggling to adapt to technological change and the advent of DVD subscriptions, where consumers pay a flat monthly fee for as many DVDs as they can watch. Blockbuster is working on a restructuring that would see it close most of its 3,000 stores but as its fortunes have declined, other companies have taken its place, offering consumers different ways to rent or buy movies to watch in their homes.Two different models have emerged, each holding promise for anxious Hollywood executives concerned about where the film industry’s future revenues will come from. One is a new generation of subscription services such as Netflix, which has in 10 years signed up more than 20m subscribers to its DVD-by-mail service.Netflix has also invested heavily in a digital service and last year struck a five-year deal worth $900m for the right to stream movies from three studios – Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment.The Netflix streaming service has grown quickly, fuelling a fourfold increase in its share price in 2010. It includes new movies such as Shutter Island alongside thousands of older titles and television programmes.A different model is being pursued by DVD kiosk operators such as Redbox, which offer DVDs of new releases for as little as $1 a day, and companies from the technology and retail sectors such as Apple and Walmart, which are offering digital copies of films to buy or rent, charging the consumer for each individual transaction.Apple is the biggest player in individual digital film transactions, with more than 60 per cent of total transactions, according to IHS Screen Digest, the media research firm. It now generates more money for Hollywood studios than many traditional cable television operators – including Time Warner Cable – and is on course to eclipse Comcast, the cable operator which recently acquired NBC Universal, as the largest provider of video-on-demand by 2014.Meanwhile, Walmart is trying to erode Apple’s lead in the digital delivery of films. The retailer also spends $3.5bn a year buying DVDs to sell in its stores, according to industry estimates. As demand for DVDs falls, it is unclear how much longer this will continue.“With consumer behaviour increasingly shifting from movie purchasing to rental, we wonder how long can DVDs continue to command such a visible presence at Walmart,” wrote Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research, in a recent note.Yet despite the competition between Apple, Walmart and others, the size of the digital film rental and online sales business is still relatively small, says Arash Amel, research director, digital media, at IHS Screen Digest.“You’ve got the largest companies in the media business and the world’s biggest retailer competing for share of a business that generated less than $400m in 2010. We expect it will barely double by 2015.”This may explain why Amazon is building its own subscription service to compete with Netflix. Amazon continues to offer one-off digital movie rentals and purchases but inadvertently revealed its plans for a subscription service recently when it published a screen shot promoting it.The company is planning to bundle access to the digital film subscription service with Amazon Prime, which gives customers unlimited free shipping on items for an initial fee.But while Netflix, Apple, Amazon and the others jockey to control the future of home entertainment, Blockbuster can only watch from the sidelines.Summit Entertainment, the company behind the hit Twilight series, last week asked a federal judge to make Blockbuster pay $6.8m it owes for unpaid DVDs or force it into liquidation.Stephen Nickerson, Summit’s president, said the unpaid bills were a “significant hardship” for the studio, according to court filings. It is a far cry from Blockbuster’s heyday but technology and shifting consumer behaviour have changed the game in Hollywood.
921;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-02T18:36:33Z;Amazon primes movie streaming service;;"Amazon is developing a film streaming service that would compete directly with Netflix in a move that could have a big impact on the fortunes of Hollywood studios struggling to cope with declining DVD sales.The company is planning to bundle access to the service with Amazon Prime, which gives customers unlimited free shipping on items for an initial fee.Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. But it may have inadvertently revealed its plans by publishing a screen shot promoting the service.The shot, which appeared briefly before being removed, was revealed by the Engadget technology blog.It contained text saying: “Your Amazon Prime membership now includes unlimited, commercial-free, instant streaming of 5,000 movies and TV shows at no additional cost.”A person familiar with Amazon’s plans told the Financial Times that the group had been working on the streaming service.The news comes as Amazon is stepping up its efforts to compete with Netflix. It recently acquired Lovefilm, the UK DVD subscription service, for £200m.Amazon already offers online movies to rent or buy. However, Arash Amel, research director for digital media at IHS Screen Digest, a media consultancy, said the company had more
to gain from digital subscriptions.“Amazon is switching focus away from the rental business in favour of the subscription model which connects far better with its core online-retailing profit centre,” the person said.“This is about keeping consumers in the Amazon environment while providing extra value …Providing subscription video is a far better way to do that than by selling [one-off] digital downloads.”However, Amazon faces an uphill struggle if it is to overhaul Netflix in subscription video. Netflix shares have risen almost fourfold in the past 12 months as the company has built a dominant position in online film viewing, giving Netflix a market capitalisation of $11.2bn.The California-based group has 20m subscribers to its postal DVD subscription service but has succeeded in migrating many of those viewers to the online service.The growth of Netflix has changed the home entertainment landscape in the US. Blockbuster, the once-dominant DVD rental chain, filed for bankruptcy protection last year after finding itself unable to compete with the company.Netflix has also begun to pay large sums for rights to Hollywood movies and last year agreed a five-year online streaming deal worth $900m with Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate Entertainment."
922;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-02-02T15:23:31Z;Time Warner profits and revenues rise;;Time Warner said that fourth quarter revenue and profit rose thanks to the continued strength of its film studio and television properties, which include CNN, HBO and TNT.Revenue rose 8 per cent to $7.8bn in the quarter, and net income was up 22 per cent to $769m. Revenue rose 6 per cent to $26.9bn for the full year.This was the first full year of operation for Time Warner since it spun off Time Warner Cable and AOL in 2009. The company responded by boosting its dividend by 11 per cent and extending its share buyback programme by another $4bn. A full year forecast was higher than analyst expectations.“Results were largely ahead of expectations, as the revenue at each segment beat our forecasts,” said Benjamin Swinburne, Morgan Stanley analyst .Turner Broadcasting and HBO, the company’s main TV assets, saw higher revenues from subscriptions, advertising and content fees. Better subscriptions fees came from higher rates mainly from HBO Central Europe, the company said.A 14 per cent jump in advertising revenues “reflected strong domestic demand”. And home video sales and syndication of HBO programmes such as The Pacific and Entourage resulted in higher content revenues.TNT and TBS, two basic cable channels, also performed well, the company said. TNT carries games from the National Basketball Association, and TBS is the new home to Conan O’Brien, the talkshow host who was ousted from NBC last year.The strong showing from Time Warner’s television units come as a debate over the risks of “cord cutting” – when customers cancel their cable subscriptions in favour of online options such as Netflix – is gripping the industry.While Netflix is growing fast and now has more than 20m paying customers, media executives have played down the near term risks and analysts are increasingly bullish on the TV business.Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner chief executive, said the company would continue to “increase our investments in programming, production and marketing even more than we did last year”.The company’s diverse media holdings also include the Warner Brothers movie studio and Time Inc, the publisher. Several strong theatrical releases including the latest Harry Potter film, Best Picture nominee Inception, and Clash of the Titans, helped Warner Brothers increase full-year revenues 5 per cent to $11.6bn.Home video sales continued to decline. Its publishing division was the only unit to post a loss. Revenues for the year decreased 2 per cent to $3.7bn. While advertising sales grew 3 per cent, or $57m, this was more than offset by declines in subscriptions and other revenue.“Our positive outlook on Time Warner is driven by our expectations for continued advertising growth at the company’s cable networks, continued investment in high quality content at the cable networks, a multiple blockbuster strategy at Warner Bros. that diversifies risk, and a management that appears committed to the responsible return of excess capital,” said Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.
923;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-28T20:19:14Z;Netflix on a roll as streaming catches on;;Netflix has the wind in its sails. Since reporting earnings for the fourth quarter ahead of expectations on Wednesday, the DVD rental and video streaming service has seen its shares jump 15 per cent to $209, valuing it at $11bn, almost as much as CBS.Net revenue and new subscribers both beat expectations, and the company passed 20m customers.Doug Anmuth, analyst at Barclays Capital, said Net­flix was “firing on all cylinders” and raised his price target for the shares to $215.Netflix is shifting its focus from posting DVDs to customers to streaming programming to computers, televisions and tablet devices such as the Apple iPad.Fuelling optimism for the company’s prospects is the proof that its streaming business is catching on. In November it introduced a streaming-only option for $7.99 per month. That plan now accounts for more than a third of all new subscriptions, as consumers phase out use of DVDs.Taking the long view, analysts see Netflix emerging as a partial alternative to cable subscriptions as it acquires the rights to stream more content. It announced a deal with Disney’s ABC in December to stream hit shows such as Grey’s Anatomy.But the same analysts point to vulnerabilities at the centre of the business model. The first has to do with who picks up the bill for delivering increasing amounts of video digitally, the rules about which are changing.Netflix already accounts for 20 per cent of all downstream broadband internet traffic during peak hours in the US, according to Sandvine, a company that works with internet service providers. As the strain on broadband networks grows, ISPs are looking for ways to charge users based on how much they download.This so-called “usage-based pricing” is not yet in effect in the US, Netflix’s biggest market. But in December the federal communications commission voted for “net neutrality” rules that would leave the door open to usage-based pricing.“There is a cost to streaming content, and who bears that cost has yet to be determined,” said Benjamin Swinburne, analyst at Morgan Stanley.In a recent note, Credit Suisse analysts said it was unlikely that American ISPs would rush to roll out usage-based pricing. A test case of this scenario is playing out in Canada, where Netflix launched late last year.There, ISPs can charge per gigabyte downloaded. After testing the service for a month, Credit Suisse concluded that moderate use of Netflix streaming would increase a typical broadband bill by $12 per month.Asked about the impact of usage-based pricing in Canada on Wednesday’s investor call, Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, acknowledged that it was “potentially a significant negative for Netflix”.Credit Suisse came to a similar conclusion if American ISPs were to adopt such measures.“Should [usage-based pricing] evolve similar to the Canadian experience with similar tiers and pricing, this could limit growth of online video in the US,” it said.The other concern for Netflix is the growing cost of content. The company has so far done a good job of securing content from the big TV and movie studios, and has been pursuing additional deals as its subscriber base grows. “More subscribers means more money to license content with, which drives more subscriber growth,” Mr Hastings said in a letter to shareholders.Most of its content deals are short term and set to expire in a year or two, however. Analysts expect those costs to rise significantly as content owners demand a larger cut of Net­flix’s growing profits.Among the risks Mr Hastings cited in his letter was the threat “that content pricing uniformly rises so sharply that we can afford fewer titles, thus our service becomes less amazing to consumers, and our growth is slowed”.Such stagnation looks unlikely for now. In spite of the looming threats to the Netflix model of usage-based pricing and higher content fees, analysts are bullish on the stock. Credit Suisse estimates that Netflix will double its subscriber base this year to more than 30m users.There is also the threat of competition from the likes of Amazon, the online retailer, and Apple.“But unless someone else does it reasonably quickly it’s going to be hard,” said Mr Anmuth.

The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 2,755.28.The indices were weighed on by news that the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims in the US had increased by 51,000 to 454,000 last week.This jump was unexpected with economists forecasting 405,000 claims. The number of continuing claims was also up, rising by 94,000 in the week to 3.99m.Also disappointing the markets were figures showing that durable goods orders had fallen by 2.5 per cent in December, well short of the 1.5 per cent rise in orders forecast by economists.“This is a surprise. We expected a rebound in aircraft orders to lead the way but they dropped by $5bn,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.But some commentators argued that the figures were not as bad as they looked. The jobless claims data were skewed by snow in some southern states last week which prevented people from filing claims and created a backlog.But researchers at Goldman Sachs said: “The durable goods report looked awful at first glance but improves considerably on inspection,” noting that, with transportation figures removed from the durable good orders, the index actually went up by 0.5 per cent.Separate economic data showed that pending home sales was up 2 per cent for December, a positive signal indicating recovery in the US housing market.Sentiment was also supported by confirmation from the US Federal Reserve in the previous session that it would continue with its $600bn bond purchase programme to aid the economy.The consumer goods sector saw some of the strongest losses of the session after two industry bellwethers, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, reported disappointing earnings figures.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker, reported that second-quarter profit had fallen by 28 per cent and its margins had declined due to higher commodity costs.Sales, however, were up slightly in the quarter and the fall in profit was exaggerated due to one-off gains last year in discontinued operations. But investors took the news negatively with its shares falling 2.9 per cent to $64.18.Colgate-Palmolive, which competes with P&G in toothpaste and other products, was down 3.3 per cent to $77.39 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings down 1.1 per cent due to higher materials costs and lower-than-expected revenue.The S&P consumer staples index was down 0.9 per cent to 302.67.AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, was down 2.1 per cent to $28.13 in spite of posting earnings in line with expectations. The company reported a decline in the number of new long-term service contracts that it had signed on in the quarter.The S&P telecoms index was 0.9 per cent lower at 126.34.Microsoft reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of 0.77 cents a share shortly before the markets closed.Shares in the technology giant were up 0.3 per cent to $28.87.Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings per share after the closing bell but also posted worse-than-expected revenue. The online retailer was up 5.2 per cent to $184.45 in anticipation of the results but lost ground in after-hours trading.Netflix, a video streaming and rental service, rose 15.2 per cent to $210.87 after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as the number of its subscribers rose 63 per cent.Starbucks reported a 44 per cent increase in first-quarter profit but gave a downbeat forecast for the coming quarter due to rising coffee costs. The stock was down 0.1 per cent to $33.03.DR Horton, the second-biggest US home builder, fell 3.3 per cent to $12.81 after posting a first-quarter loss that was sharper than expected due to weaker home sale revenues.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the biopharmaceutical company, was up 1.6 per cent to $26.35 as investors reacted positively to fourth-quarter earnings.Eli Lilly, another drugmaker, was up 1.5 per cent to $35.47 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 28 per cent.Cypress Semiconductor, a semiconductor design and manufacturing company rose 8 per cent to $22.04 after agreeing to sell its image sensor business unit to ON Semiconductor in an all-cash transaction. Shares in ON Semiconductor were up 0.5 per cent to $11.36.
925;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-26T20:23:15Z;TV economics rests on Super Bowl’s shoulders;Football drives ad revenues for networks, writes William Wallis;It is a truism about the Super Bowl that what happens on the field is not always the most memorable thing about the crowning game of the American football season. Many people watch instead to see what marketing’s wildest creative directors come up with in the ad breaks. When the Pittsburgh Steelers face the Green Bay Packers on Fox on February 6, however, the sporting action should be centre stage for anyone looking to understand US television’s remarkable comeback.In spite of high unemployment and the rise of Netflix, Hulu and other alternatives to cable and satellite, broadcast networks and top cable channels saw booming audiences and advertising revenues in 2010. Dig into the numbers, though, and you find two big drivers of this rebound: football (the American variety) and football (World Cup flavour). In spite of unprecedented US ratings for international soccer last summer, the National Football League should take most of the credit.Football games accounted for eight of last year’s top 10 US TV audiences, Nielsen reports. The New Orleans Saints’ Super Bowl victory drew 106.5m viewers to CBS, beating the record set at the 2009 Super Bowl to become the most watched broadcast in US history.The phenomenon is not constrained to professional football. College football and NBA basketball saw similar viewing surges. Nor is it confined to the US. But with two big teams on the field, the Super Bowl audience record could be beaten once more. Last Sunday’s NFL games attracted audiences not seen since 1982.It is little wonder then that President Barack Obama has agreed to a Super Bowl pre-game interview: the audience will dwarf that for his State of the Union address. The point is not lost on advertisers, either, but ads are sold in advance, so unexpected ratings have little impact on the network airing the game (rights rotate between CBS, Fox and NBC).A larger point matters a great deal, however: as audiences fragment and high definition screens proliferate, live sport has become broadcasters’ greatest weapon not just in the fight for the affluent male viewers that advertisers crave but in the battle to change their revenue model. US broadcast networks are pushing cable and satellite operators to pay hefty “affiliate fees” for programming, prompting clashes that have sometimes caused channels to go dark, as when Cablevision tussled with Fox during the baseball World Series.“Sports programming is the negotiation axe to wield when threatening to black out a signal,” Michael Nathanson, media analyst at Nomura, pointed out in a recent note. That makes it pivotal to securing higher affiliate fees, the biggest driver of broadcast revenues in the coming years.Cable and satellite operators face rising programming costs, but also know that live sport is the main thing stopping customers from “cutting the cord” for online alternatives. Just try watching your favourite team without cable or satellite.Pay-TV operators’ need for premium sporting content explains why ESPN, Disney’s sports franchise, commands a fifth of all affiliate fees with just 5 per cent of US cable viewers. SNL Kagan analysts estimate that ESPN charges cable and satellite operators $4.40 a month per subscriber, a multiple of what any rival earns, making it a huge contributor to Disney’s profits. Comcast and DirecTV may not end up paying ESPN-level sums to CBS or Fox, but something has to give. Smaller cable network owners without sports rights will probably feel the pain.As it takes control of NBC Universal, Comcast finds itself on both sides, and it is notable that one of its first moves has been to create an NBC sports group that analysts believe it wants to build into a challenger to ESPN. Time Warner has also been expanding in sports, with a 14-year, $10.8bn deal to share college basketball rights between Turner and CBS.More competition from more bidders with the business models to support higher fees can mean only one thing: steep inflation in the cost of rights. “The most important driver of the next two to 10 years is that leagues now have a multitude of options,” says Joel Hollander, a former CBS Network Radio head who led many negotiations with the NFL.Lots of league agreements are locked up for years, but already ESPN has agreed to a reported 40 per cent rise in fees to the NFL. The next big test will be this year’s bidding for US rights to the 2014 and 2016 Olympics. NBC lost money on the 2010 Winter Olympics and the risk of overpaying will be strong.Before then, the NFL has to negotiate a new labour contract and the real threat of a strike hangs over next year’s season. Player salaries are calculated on a share of league revenues so players will expect a big pay rise. Don’t be surprised if the spotlight of envy shifts from pinstriped bankers to the padded shoulders of the Super Bowl stars.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s Media Editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com
926;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-25T20:57:10Z;The man with the golden plan;;When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer unexpectedly revealed this month that it was ready to begin the production of its latest James Bond movie, Hollywood breathed a collective sigh of relief.The film had been postponed indefinitely because of financial woes at MGM. But with the studio recently emerging from bankruptcy protection without a crippling $4bn debt burden, work on what is Hollywood’s most bankable film franchise could resume.For Harry Sloan, the return of Bond continues a process that he started.“I put the film into development,” he says in his first interview since he stepped down as MGM chief executive in the summer of 2009, when a restructuring team took the reins at the company. “It’s good for MGM that [Bond] is back. The new guys running the studio are very experienced …I think they’ll do very well.”Mr Sloan has other fish to fry. A seasoned dealmaker, he is after investment opportunities in international markets, including China, Brazil and Turkey, where he is advising TPG, the private equity group, on its pursuit of Dogan Yayin, Turkey’s biggest media group. Aydin Dogan, who controls the group, has put most of his company’s assets on the block, including its TV networks, as he tries to resolve multibillion-dollar tax fines imposed by the Turkish government. The auction has attracted interest from, among others KKR, another private equity group, and Time Warner.“I’m a little sceptical because the process has dragged on for so long,” says Mr Sloan.“It is always possible the sale may not happen if the seller were to resolve its tax issues. But from an investor point of view, having the opportunity to acquire the number one TV network in a country like Turkey has drawn a lot of interest.”Turkey and Brazil are “completely different” in their approach to media investment, he says. “Turkey is very open towards international investors.” In Brazil, where Mr Sloan had discussions about investing in the fourth and fifth largest television networks alongside Jim McNamara, the former head of Telemundo, the Spanish-language US channel, the welcome has been decidedly cooler. “Brazil is largely more protectionist …media laws there are very stringent to protect local operators.”Mr Sloan was a participant on the international media scene long before joining MGM in 2005. In 1990, he founded SBS Broadcasting, the European media group, in which he invested $5m.He sold it for $2.6bn in 2005 to KKR and Permira. More recently, he joined the board of Prisa, which publishes El País, working alongside Nicolas Berggruen, the German billionaire, and Martin Franklin, who control the Spanish media company.His biggest interest is the international scene, where he intends to create new business models for companies ripe for change. He had a taste of this at MGM when he helped structure a landmark deal with Netflix, the DVD and online streaming subscription service.Netflix acquired the digital rights of Epix, a premium TV channel owned by the three studios MGM, Paramount and Lions Gate Entertainment, in a five-year contract worth $900m.The deal upset Hollywood’s status quo because studios have traditionally struck their biggest deals with pay-TV channels such as HBO and Showtime.The studios created Epix after less valuable offers from pay-TV channels. “With less money on offer from pay-TV, we had to secure a large portion of our revenues from digital distribution.”What looked like a gamble paid off when Netflix entered the fray. “The movie business is challenged because it had become so reliant on home entertainment and DVDs and those revenues were not being replaced,” says Mr Sloan.“We created a new business model in an industry which had the same model for 20 years.”The question is whether Mr Sloan can create other new models in global markets. He thinks he can.“A lot of the success I’ve had was transferring what I learnt in the US to other markets. Exploiting digital distribution is a great example and will translate internationally.”
927;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-21T19:31:00Z;Lovefilm;Europe’s internet infrastructure may not be able to cope with streaming;Lovefilm is a nipper next to Netflix but the companies do the same thing: rent films by post (old fashioned) or stream them to customers’ computers and televisions (the future). Amazon, which bought UK-based Lovefilm this week, should strengthen the company in Europe just as US-based Netflix looks to expand there.But the fight in Europe may not be two-way. European telcos, which own the internet plumbing through which online videos flow, say their pipes are full already. Research they commissioned from AT Kearney estimated it will cost an extra $21bn to make sure networks can deal with rising video-driven traffic between 2010 and 2014. The telcos have no intention of bearing that cost alone. Netflix and Lovefilm could well find themselves facing a common foe.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
928;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-20T19:32:11Z;Amazon acquires Lovefilm for £200m;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, has acquired Lovefilm, the web-based DVD rental service, for close to £200m ($317m), completing a long-rumoured deal that sees another leading UK dotcom company sold to an American suitor.Lovefilm, which has 1.6m subscribers in Europe, had been considering listing on the stock market while striving to expand its business from mailing DVDs into online delivery.The deal comes as Netflix, the US business whose model Lovefilm has emulated, is preparing to use its rapidly growing digital subscription business as a platform for expansion into Europe and other international markets.Amazon plans to retain the Lovefilm brand and says it has no immediate plans to launch it in the US. It will use its main website and IMDB, its movie portal, to promote Lovefilm.The e-commerce site sells digital downloads of films, and there has been speculation that it wants to enter the live-streaming subscription business in a potential challenge to Netflix as it expands its digital media business.Simon Calver, Lovefilm chief executive, said Amazon would “turbocharge” its growth across Europe. “Their resources scale and expertise will help us across many different areas, but our strategy won’t fundamentally change. Our initial focus is very much going to be on Europe.”Lovefilm built its business around the model pioneered by Netflix, offering unlimited DVD rentals by mail for a monthly subscription fee of £9.99 in the UK, creating a stable, recurring revenue stream.Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, but people close to the company said the deal valued Lovefilm at a little less than £200m.Amazon has held a 42 per cent stake in the company since 2008, when Lovefilm acquired its own fledgling European DVD rental business.It had also received venture funding from Index Ventures, Balderton Capital, Arts Alliance Media and DFJ Esprit since its creation in 2004.Lovefilm reported revenues of £97.2m and pre-tax losses of £934,000 in 2009. It operates services in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway and Denmark and brings its digital streaming service to internet-connected TVs from Sony and Samsung, as well as the PlayStation3.Investors in Lovefilm welcomed the deal.
929;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-19T22:48:29Z;Comcast hedges against weakening in core business;;When Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal was conceived at the 2009 Allen & Company media conference in Sun Valley, the television industry was undergoing a period of great uncertainty.General Electric, the industrial conglomerate that owned NBCU, had just watched the TV business endure a gruelling advertising recession. NBCU’s chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was struggling to reorder the broadcast arm’s primetime line-up – an effort that dragged over into last year’s scheduling feud between comedy hosts Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien.The problems at NBCU – the group behind NBC News, Bravo and Universal Studios – made the long-running question of why GE continued to own a media business more pressing, and provided perfect conditions for Comcast, the US cable company, to strike, five years after it had been frustrated in an unsolicited $54bn bid for Disney.The deal, announced in December 2009 and approved by the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday, has Comcast buying 51 per cent of NBCU for $6.4bn in cash, and injecting cable channels into the venture. GE will sell its remaining 49 per cent stake to Comcast over seven years, and Vivendi will reap $5.8bn for its 20 per cent. The new joint venture is valued at $30bn.Yet, from the outset, many analysts questioned the logic of combining NBCU’s content with the distribution might of Comcast, the largest US cable and internet service provider. Time Warner had just done the opposite, abandoning past efforts to add distribution properties to its core content business by spinning off AOL and Time Warner Cable.Critics also wondered if the businessmen from Philadelphia, where Comcast is based, were ready for the scrutiny that would come from owning a broadcast network and news outlets such as MSNBC.Comcast contends that the deal makes good business sense. For one, it can make more of its own cable networks, such as the Golf Channel and E!, when they are paired with bigger NBCU cable channels such as Bravo, USA and CNBC.Comcast’s bid also seems a hedge against the prospect of a slowdown in its core cable business. Cable companies around the country lost subscribers for two quarters of last year, raising concerns about “cord cutting”, where consumers drop cable for online alternatives.By acquiring NBCU, Comcast has diversified its risk in case cable weakens further. It has also instantly made itself a major player in the developments shaping the emerging market for online video.With the rights to NBC’s content, particularly the backlog of Universal Studios movies, Comcast will have significant weight in negotiations with online rivals. Films still help drive each new video distribution platform, as Netflix, the DVD and online video rental service, in particular has shown most recently.US regulators approved the deal with conditions designed to prevent Comcast from using its new might to harm competitors. But on Tuesday afternoon two very different accounts were on offer as to what the deal creates.Most analysts said the conditions were generally unobtrusive. “I think the FCC was quite lenient on them,” said Shahid Khan, chairman at MediaMorph, the software-as-a-service provider. “It looks like a joke. I was expecting them to be much stricter.”This view was echoed by FCC commissioner Michael Copps, the lone dissenter in a 4-1 vote in favour of the deal, who said the new entity would have too much power. “This Comcast-NBCU joint venture grievously fails the public interest,” he said.Comcast also seemed pleased with the outcome. “I don’t think any of the conditions are particularly restrictive,” said Comcast executive vice-president David Cohen. But some Republicans said the FCC over-reached, placing too many onerous terms on Comcast.Comcast shares were flat on Tuesday and rose early on Wednesday, suggesting investors were surprised neither by the approval, nor by regulators’ demands.Shares are up nearly 40 per cent in the past year, broadly in line with competitors, and this media rebound has silenced some of the strategic doubters.“It is now clear in retrospect that, in buying media assets at a price struck in late 2009, Comcast bought NBCU very well indeed,” said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “What the deal lacks strategically, it more than makes up for in sheer market timing.”Questions remain as to how Comcast will handle some of NBCU’s less compatible assets, such as its Universal Studios theme parks, and whether it will feel compelled to dispose of overlapping cable channels.Still, Comcast-NBCU will have unparalleled influence over the rapidly evolving media landscape. In the nascent online video market, the new venture will have particular leverage to shape deals and determine access rights, in spite of the government’s conditions.It will also retain substantial cash balances. Although analysts doubt that Comcast will pursue further substantial deals for now, these should allow it to step up its share buy-back programme, Mr Moffett said.On Tuesday, regulators signed off on the deal with a whiff of trepidation, setting in motion events that will invariably reshape the media industry.
930;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2011-01-09T21:37:08Z;The big beast of non-fiction TV;;"“Vladimir Putin’s right on brand with the Discovery Channel,” David Zaslav jokes as he discloses that the Russian prime minister is a fan of the country’s biggest television network for men.The 50-year-old Discovery Communications chief executive has not (yet) tried to recruit Mr Putin, whose fondness for riding horses bare-chested and shooting tigers with tranquillisers would seem a perfect fit with shows such as Man vs Wild.But the man who made Sarah Palin a reality TV star and coaxed Oprah Winfrey from network to cable television is spending more time in places like Moscow as one of US media’s few recent success stories looks to acquisitions, launches and technology to extend its position as the world’s leading non-fiction television company.Luck took Mr Zaslav into the cable business. As a tennis-playing law student at Binghamton University, he found placements at two Los Angeles law firms with entertainment practices, then a job in 1985 at a New York firm, where a partner represented MTV and the Discovery Channel.He met John Hendricks, Discovery’s founder, and when Judith McHale, its general counsel, took six months maternity leave, the 25-year-old Mr Zaslav stepped in to cover. Mr Hendricks became a mentor and two decades later, Mr Zaslav replaced Ms McHale as the head of Discovery.He spent the intervening years at NBC Universal’s cable arm. Having written to NBC’s chief executive asking for a job, he helped launch CNBC in 1989, and the business channel still plays silently in his midtown Manhattan office, where a stuffed toy lion sits by the window, flanked by posters of hit shows.“There’s never been a better time in media to be in quality content,” he starts, as he outlines his strategy to “spend more money on content, spend less on everything else”.Mr Zaslav sees his company in two halves: “On the right half is better content, better shows, better characters: Sarah Palin, Deadliest Catch, Oprah. The left side is everything else. If we can take $2 out of the left side and invest $1 or $1.50 more in our content and brands, that gives the trajectory of our growth a push.”The analysis sounds simplistic, but it describes what Discovery’s results show. Domestic operating margins have risen from 50 per cent to a remarkable 59 per cent during three years, and international margins are up from 25 per cent to 43 per cent.Revenues are also rising: up 10 per cent in the first three quarters of 2010, thanks to bigger audiences and an advertising rebound. Discovery’s shares have responded, bouncing a sector-beating 23 per cent in the past year.Some analysts worry that Discovery has been, well, discovered. But Mr Zaslav sees scope to expand revenues and margins further, even in the US. “If you could position the best platform media company around the world with the best content, we could get explosive growth,” he argues.His quest to improve its content began early. He made his audacious pitch to the queen of US talk shows six months after rejoining Discovery in 2007, but the Oprah Winfrey Network only hit US screens two weeks ago after setbacks, management changes and $189m of investment.After OWN’s New Year’s day launch, which drew ratings five times those of the Discovery channel it replaced, Discovery disclosed that it expected the network to make a profit in its first year.Mr Zaslav has built Discovery to a market value of more than $11bn, but the man is seen by his peers as a future leader for larger media groups.So far, he has not been tempted away, and he displays little of the bombast of some of his industry’s moguls, making his points with purposeful seriousness. As he lists Discovery’s advances, rarely breaking eye contact, he also admits to weaknesses: “In some areas, it’s choppy.”Many recent launches have been re-branding efforts for struggling channels. OWN moved into a spot occupied by Discovery Health; The Hub – its venture with Hasbro, the toymaker – took over from Discovery Kids; ID replaced Discovery Times; and TLC is elbowing out the weakest channels in each non-US market it is now entering. The flipside of investing more in its biggest brands, he says frankly, is a more brutal approach to those that do not shape up. To date, the rebranding efforts have worked strikingly well. ID’s ratings were up 52 per cent year on year in the third quarter, and TLC has gone from the number 10 US network in 2008 to number six.Mr Zaslav attributes such gains to a policy – which again sounds almost trite – of putting “a creative leader, not a business leader” in charge of each channel. “Their number one priority is to build the brands, build the audience and get great content on the air. That’s how we reward them.”Creative businesses are volatile, and he admits that the failure rate will inevitably be high, but he has tried to bring a more rigorous approach to evaluating talent.Executives pore over “data packs”, analysing how well each producer’s past shows have performed before signing them up. It is part of a strategy of becoming “undemocratic” in its investments, favouring “the channels and brands we believe in, and [spending] a lot less on the brands we don’t”.Discovery is spending more on content than ever, though, because it can make bigger returns than before from international markets and digital media. Two decades after Mr Hendricks made international distribution a priority, it is in 180 markets (in Moscow, Mr Putin can enjoy 13 channels).Mr Zaslav concedes that Discovery is lucky that its content travels well; shark attacks, storms and wildebeest migrations work in any language. But its global growth also reflects aggressive management. TLC, the latest network to get the international treatment, will expand from 50m homes to 100m within six months.He has also tried to design Discovery’s content business to make its global appeal more than a happy accident. Rather than just “developing US content and pushing it around the world”, global committees now ask how well a show will travel before it reaches even US screens.For Mr Zaslav, it has also meant more time in hotels from Latin America to India. He spends a third of his time outside the US and says this will rise to “more than half”. Discovery dropped out of the auction for channels being sold by Turkey’s Dogan Yayin group but bought the BBC out of a joint venture and was looking for more deals outside the US.The international push is underpinned by a strategy of producing more programming in-house. Owning shows simplifies the business of exploiting them globally and, crucially, on emerging digital platforms. Where some content owners have flirted with each new digital distributor, from Apple’s iTunes to Hulu, Netflix and Google TV, Mr Zaslav has resisted showing full programmes online. “We’ll put our content anywhere there’s a strong economic model [but] the web doesn’t provide that,” he says starkly.Instead, it teases viewers with clips and features to get its brands talked about on social networks and satisfy audiences’ curiosity. “They want to learn about survival or quicksand or sharks and we’ve been able to serve that,” he says, bringing Discovery more than 44m unique users a month and 23m Facebook fans.The heart of Discovery’s business remains cable TV, which Mr Zaslav claims is “as healthy as it has ever been”, brushing off fears that economic hardships and new competition for viewers’ eyeballs are eroding its lucrative model. “The core cable business in the US is slowing down, no doubt about it,” he concedes, but many other markets are 15 years behind the US; consumers are still upgrading to high definition; and 3net, Discovery’s 3D TV partnership with Sony and Imax to be launched soon, should make its content “closer to real” and more compelling.Likening his content strategy to a nine-inning baseball game, he says Discovery is still “in the third inning”. The analogy may not resonate outside the US, but Mr Zaslav’s challenge is to ensure that the programming will."

Materials stocks were also buoyed by this demand, rising 19.9 per cent over the year.The markets looked set to close the year without a single sector falling into negative territory but the S&P 500 healthcare index was the worst performer, rising just 0.7 per cent.Worries about the implementation of Obama’s healthcare reforms, on top of concerns about the effects of some key patents expiring for pharmaceutical companies, kept the shares underperforming the indices.Utilities and technology also climbed less than the wider market, with the utilities index up just 0.9 per cent and technology adding 9.1 per cent in spite of a surge towards the end of the year.On Friday, some of the biggest gainers of the year edged lower as investors took their profits.Netflix, the online and home delivery movie rental company, was the biggest riser in the S&P 500 over the last year, gaining 219 per cent. The stock lost 2.3 per cent to $175.70 on Friday.Also in technology, F5 networks soared 145.7 per cent over the last year. But the company, which makes devices and systems to ensure the security and performance of networks, edged lower by 1.7 per cent to $130.16 during the final session.SanDisk, which has risen 71 per cent this year, lost 1 per cent to $49.86, while Red Hat, which has soared 48 per cent this year, gave up 1.3 per cent to $45.64.Monster Worldwide, the online jobs advertisement company which has done well because of investor hopes for a recovery in recruitment, adding 36.9 per cent, was down 2 per cent to $23.63.In contrast, the biggest faller of the year, Dean Foods, added 2.1 per cent to $8.84. The food and beverage company has lost more than half its market capitalisation this year.There was some last minute deal activity with CVS, the pharmacy chain, was lower by 0.7 per cent to $34.77 after it said it would buy Universal American Corp’s Medicare prescription drug business for about $1.25bn. Universal American shares soared 40 per cent to $20.45.The deal will more than double the size of its Medicare programme after sales in pharmacy benefits management fell for the last two quarters.IMAX Corp jumped as much as 13 per cent but retreated to finish the day up 4.5 per cent at $28.07 when the operator of large screen cinemas denied a report that Sony Corp could be preparing an offer for the company.But Borders lost 21.6 per cent to 91 cents after the book retailer delayed payments to some publishers as it tries to refinance its credit agreements.Rival Barnes & Noble also fell, down 1.3 per cent to $14.15.

As a sector, oil and gas saw the most $1bn or larger deals in 2010, with 65 deals for $220bn globally, according to Dealogic.The market is expected to continue to expand, with some $90bn of oil and gas assets said to be for sale in 2011. Reliance Industries, the Indian energy conglomerate, said it is still seeking expansion in the US.Other independent US shale exploration groups were mixed. Cabot Oil & Gas was up 0.9 per cent, to $37.69, but Denbury Resources was down 1.4 per cent to $19.Energy shares overall were up fractionally at the end of the session, as US indices slipped back from their highest levels since September 2008 in extremely light end-of-year trading volumes.The S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,257.88. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 0.1 to 11,569.71, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.2 per cent to 2,662.98.Sentiment was softer in spite of a sharp decrease in weekly US jobless claims. Claims fell by 8 per cent, with 388,000 unemployment insurance claims filed for the week ending December 25. The figures were adjusted for the typical jump in holiday hiring.“We would advise taking the result reported today with a very large grain of salt. The holiday season normally creates volatility in these figures that doesn’t shake out until late January,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, saw shares rise 2.1 per cent to $24.12, at one point seeing their highest since June 2008.The Chicago region purchasing managers’ index also improved, rising from 62.5 in November to 68.6 for this month. A reading over 60 indicates expansion.Materials groups, closely tied to economic growth, were down only slightly. Alcoa led the Dow, rising 0.5 per cent to $15.21, though AK Steel fell 1 per cent to $16.11. CF Industries, which produces fertiliser, was up 1.4 per cent to $136.67.The financial sector lagged, falling 0.3 per cent. Asset managers were lower on weaker fund sales. Janus Capital Group was down 1.2 per cent to $12.91, and Legg Mason fell 1.7 per cent to $36.17.US investors pulled almost $8bn from municipal bond funds in November, the Investment Company Institute said on Thursday.Consumer credit groups were lower after US mortgage foreclosures were revealed to have risen sharply in the third quarter, up 31 per cent, according to US regulators. That hurts consumers’ willingness to take on debt. American Express was down 0.8 per cent to $42.51, and Discover Financial fell 2.2 per cent to $18.17.Expedia, the travel website, dropped 1.2 per cent to $25.28. The group has been locked in a dispute with American Airlines over whether the carrier will continue to advertise its flights on the site.Sears Holdings was down 0.5 per cent to $74.15 a day, Its shares rose more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after it said it would launch an online film service.

933;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-29T22:23:19Z;Seven bets for a better year for business in 2011;Despite all the uncertainty, business should be optimistic about what next year holds;With a new year – and the third anniversary of the 2008 financial crisis – coming, should business be optimistic about what lies in store? Despite all the uncertainty – the weakness in housing, the unsolved crisis over the euro and rising long-term interest rates – I believe so.There are signs of confidence returning among consumers and willingness among businesses to invest. The Standard and Poor’s 500 index is up 13 per cent in 2010. Meanwhile, emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil are taking the lead in global growth.So Keynes’ animal spirits are returning and, with that in mind, here are seven predictions for the business world in 2011. They are intended to be adventurous enough to be interesting – even if I turn out to be wrong, they should at least be things to watch.A big film will win the Oscar for best picture. By that, I mean a big-budget film of the sort Hollywood depends on, rather than a low-budget, high-culture piece of “Oscar bait” such as last year’s The Hurt Locker. The last such film to win was The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King seven years ago – and that was adapted from a J.R.R. Tolkien book by New Line Cinema, Warner Brothers’ “independent” arm.The Oscar bait this year is The King’s Speech, stuffed with British character actors and distributed by The Weinstein Company, old hands at making small films into winners. But “the Academy” will show that its bread and butter can be intelligent by rewarding Inception, the science-fiction thriller, or Toy Story 3, a Pixar film with adult appeal.Private stock exchanges will be hit by a scandal. Investors in US stock exchanges did fine this year but the most exciting run-ups in share prices were on private exchanges such as SecondMarket and SharesPost. They provide a way for investors to buy stakes in non-public companies, including Silicon Valley enterprises such as Facebook and Twitter.Daring wealthy investors have been drawn to private exchanges, often through investment funds. But they lack the listing and disclosure requirements of public exchanges, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the phenomenon. Expect a scandal from the bubble in pre-IPO shares.A drugs company will drop early-stage research. Big Pharma has struggled for a decade with a dearth of potential blockbusters. Companies such as GlaxoSmithKline have restructured and slimmed down their research arms but the sector remains troubled, as the departure of Jeff Kindler, Pfizer’s former chief executive, on the grounds of “exhaustion” indicates.The obvious course with something that is not working is to drop it. Shire Pharmaceuticals pioneered a strategy of outsourcing early-stage research to smaller companies and focusing on developing and trialling promising drugs. This will be the year when one of the industry’s biggest takes a similar tack.Media streaming will come of age. Technology buffs envisage the era of “ cloud computing”, with all digital content stored on remote servers instead of hard discs on computers. Google has been trying to implement that vision for applications such as e-mail and word processing.With the likely launch of Spotify in the US, Apple readying to launch a streamed version of iTunes, and Netflix moving rapidly towards streaming rather than DVD rental, this technology is advancing. This will be the year when consumers start to adopt it widely.China will overtake Silicon Valley in green energy. China is known for copying DVDs and software and for producing high-speed trains that are suspiciously similar to those in the west and Japan. But it shows every sign of being determined to forge an original path in energy, spending public money on research to support private investment.As China tries to make itself a hub for environmental innovation, the US is retreating. Silicon Valley venture capital groups that identified green energy as a big opportunity are playing it down and turning to social media. China has the market, the cash and the science to stick with it.The Guardian will change its mind about charging online. The UK paper has been a leader in digital innovation and created a global brand by staying free online. But it is losing too much to carry on indefinitely, and there is no sign that advertisements alone can support its expensive editorial model.The New York Times, a bellwether of general newspapers, will try a “metered” approach to charging online in 2011 and the Guardian will signal a change of course late in the year (leaving implementation until 2012). The unpalatable alternative is to follow the Daily Mail by chasing page views and advertising with celebrity and crime stories.The US will make a profit from AIG. In the 2008 financial crisis, there was no worse basket case than American International Group, which had insured the risk of collateralised debt obligations from banks and had to be bailed out at a total cost of $182bn. Yet the Treasury’s 92 per cent stake in the insurance group will be sold at a profit.In policy terms, the AIG fiasco left the US and other countries with the problem of declaring some financial institutions “too big to fail”. But in terms of equity investment (the government and the Federal Reserve also provided other kinds of financial backstops) saving Wall Street turned out cheap for the US taxpayer.That is a welcome prediction with which to start 2011, and we shall find out whether it and others come true (the first test is likely to be at the Oscars in February). We must hope that the global economy is in a sound enough shape for businesses to make bets of their own.john.gapper@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/johngapper
934;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-29T21:47:16Z;US stocks edge up on deal speculation;;Rumours of more buy-out activity in the retail sector and a boost to shares in rare earth companies helped US stocks nudge up.BJ’s Wholesale Club surged 7.1 per cent to $47.62 after it was reported that private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners could make a hostile bid for the warehouse store operator if an auction was not started soon. There has been a spate of buy-out activity in the retail sector with Leonard Green playing a leading role.Last week, Leonard Green bought Jo-Ann Stores, a fabric and crafts retailer, for about $1.6bn in cash, and the month before it participated in a buy-out of clothing chain J Crew.The S&P 500 retail index edged up 0.3 per cent after slipping in recent days, as investors took profits with stocks reaching three-year highs during the holiday shopping season.Elsewhere, it was reported that another private equity company, Blackstone, had joined the bidding for Centro Properties, an Australian shopping centre owner, which also owns malls in the US. Blackstone advanced 1.6 per cent to $14.36.Shares in rare earth companies continued to climb after China cut its export quotas. The minerals, which are increasingly used in technological devices, are in tight supply and the world is dependent on China, which makes up 97 per cent of production.Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, surged 6.8 per cent to $49.32 while Rare Element Resources soared 13.5 per cent to $14.69 and Arafura Resources jumped 11.1 per cent to $1.36.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,259.69, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,585.38.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher, at 2,666.93, hitting a three-year high that it has been edging towards throughout the month.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, forecast a “middle of the road” 2011 after recent years of extreme market movements, but added that the stock market could be in line for a modest decline.“History tells us that when there are too many bulls, the market may be due for a pullback,” he said.He said that, according to the American Association of Individual Investors, those bullish on US equities increased to 63.3 per cent last week, and that the last time the percentage of bulls was 55 per cent or higher was October 2007, when the market peaked.Stephen Lewis, an analyst at Monument Securities, said: “For the moment at least, [investors] are prepared to overlook negative elements in the investment picture.“Among these are the increasingly tight fiscal restraint in some European countries, financial turmoil afflicting the eurozone despite that restraint, the likelihood that bond yields will go on rising and the risks of a slowdown in China’s growth.”Energy stocks led the market higher with the S&P 500 energy index climbing 0.8 per cent.In financials, AIG, which has gained 91 per cent this year, lost 2.8 per cent to $57.27 after the Pennsylvania regulator said it failed to report $18.7bn of policyholder guarantees at two subsidiaries in 2008.An AIG spokesman said they had adopted a remediation plan to ensure disclosures were more accurate in the future.BlackRockgained 0.7 per cent to $190.82 after the world’s largest money manager said it would launch an internal trading platform next year, making it less dependent on Wall Street banks.Some investment banks edged lower, with the S&P 500 investment banking index down 1 per cent and Morgan Stanley slipping 1.4 per cent to $27.28.Elsewhere in retail, Ebay was almost flat at $28.36 after it said its PayPal business would set up an international commerce hub in Chongqing, China to help the online payment service connect local companies with global customers.Shares in Sears Holdings, the department store owner, soared 6.4 per cent to $74.49 after the retailer said it was launching an online film download service, Alphaline entertainment. Netflix, which dominates the market, fell 1.9 per cent to $180.27.
935;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-22T02:03:25Z;Tablets, smartphones and net TVs top gift lists;;Early sales from top technology companies suggest that smartphones, tablets and internet-connected televisions will prove among the year’s most popular holiday gifts as Apple, Microsoft and Google push new products that bring the web further into pockets, briefcases and living rooms.Apple on Tuesday said that by the end of the week it would sell 1m units of Apple TV, its $99 device that consolidates a user’s video and movie content, and allows streaming from Netflix and other services.Microsoft also said it had shipped more than 1.5m phones running the new Windows Phone 7 software, which it launched last month. That number beats previous estimates, providing a rare bit of good news for Microsoft’s beleaguered smartphone division. But critics emphasised that the figure represented shipments and not sales to customers.Google TV, the search giant’s offering for the “digital living room”, however, has come up short. After poor reviews, it has asked partners that were planning to unveil Google TV sets next month to delay launches in order to give Google an opportunity to improve the software.The strong showing from Apple TV comes as a surprise to some. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster previously said that Apple might sell a total of 1.4m total up to end of 2012, and had based his prediction on a device that had more features than the current version. Apple, however, cut the price when it relaunched its TV product in the autumn.“Reaching 1m units in just under three months is . . . a testament to Apple’s ever-growing mind share with consumers across the company’s ever-expanding portfolio,” said Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White. “In our view, the biggest competitor to Apple TV will be Google TV. However, the overall consumer reception to Google TV has been chilly, at best.”Roku, a digital video player that competes with Apple TV and allows streaming from Netflix and Amazon, is also on track to sell 1m units by the end of the year, chief executive Anthony Wood told Business Insider. Mr Wood said greater consumer awareness about the category, thanks to efforts by Apple and Google, had boosted sales of his own device.Apple sold 4.2m iPads in the previous quarter, missing the most bullish estimates but maintaining its large lead in the nascent category. That lead could be challenged next year, however, as a range of new tablets go on sale.The video games industry is getting a boost from several late-year hits including Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops, which has generated more than $1bn in sales since its November release.

Verdict: ()In the era of mail-order DVDs and streaming movies, the film rental store has become an antiquated phenomenon. Facing the rise of Netflix, which pioneered the North American mail-order movie business and has an early lead in the streaming market, the once dominant Blockbuster has been hit hard by falling sales. The company was crippled by debt and declared bankrupt in September.Now the company is attempting to reinvent itself by touting its own mail-order and streaming services which, thanks to long-standing agreements with film studios, offer new releases 28 days earlier than its rival. A new television campaign, “Less Waiting, More Watching”, seeks to drive home these points, playing to customers’ perceived impatience in the age of instant gratification.The ads highlight the irritation of waiting. The most entertaining features a man who is attacked by a raccoon. He drives to hospital with the animal clinging to his arm, only to be told the doctor will be with him in 28 days.The ads are amusing, but trumpeting these services is a marketing direction Blockbuster has used before to little effect. Moreover, it might have waited too long to take Netflix head on – and a cute marketing campaign may not be enough to counter that fact."
937;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-10T23:38:38Z;Equity X factor often spells exasperation;X doesn't often mark the spot;Investors should be wary when companies show more flair for marketing their shares than their products. In his 1989 bestseller One Up on Wall Street, investing legend Peter Lynch warns that “a flashy name in a mediocre company attracts investors and gives them a false sense of security”, and he specifically cautions against buying stocks that have an x in their name.Though I am inclined to give a man who generated average annual returns of 29 per cent for Magellan, the world’s largest mutual fund, the benefit of the doubt, Mr Lynch’s acolytes have no way of knowing whether his warning was the investing equivalent of an old wives’ tale. Until now, that is.There are 109 stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index, among the broadest measures of US equities, that either begin or end with an x, and a few that do both. One obvious measure of how speculative such “x stocks” are is their price-to-earnings ratios but, in the first hint that Mr Lynch was on to something, only 49 of them made a profit in the past year. A way around this is to aggregate the market value and net earnings of the entire group. The results are not pretty. “X Inc” trades at a steep 29 times trailing earnings versus 18 for the entire index. On price-to- book, a measure that cannot be negative, the average “x stock” trades at 4.9 times, nearly, more than double the index. They are also twice as volatile on average.Unsurprisingly, the list is packed with futuristic-sounding names like GigOptix, Cytrix, Keryx Biopharma, Affymetrix and Oncogenex that offer technological promise but scant profits. Some that are profitable like Netflix must keep growing rapidly to justify current multiples. Partially making up for this are some large, profitable companies in the relatively dowdy logistics and retail industries such as FedEx, CSX and TJX. And then there are those like Idexx and Xilinx that break the stereotype by adding a gratuitous second x while sporting pedestrian valuations. The company that blazed the trail for double-x stocks was Xerox, a blue-chip that appreciated by 5,000 per cent during the 1960s after changing its name from Haloid. Inventing the photocopier probably helped too.Still, an x can often spell even worse trouble than a frothy valuation. A disproportionate number of “x stocks” have been embroiled in scandal, with Canada’s Bre-X being perhaps the largest. The company was on the verge of being bought by Freeport-McMoRan after supposedly discovering the world’s largest gold mine in Indonesia. When it emerged that ore samples had been infused with jewellery shavings, Bre-X’s lead geologist became the fall guy – literally – plunging to his death from a company helicopter.Another “x stock,” the futuristic-sounding YBM Magnex, lured investors with purportedly surging industrial magnet sales. After being valued at $1bn in 1998, it was exposed as a money-laundering front for Russia’s leading mafia kingpin.Weirdest of all was Solv-Ex. The company, which claimed to have developed a novel way to extract Canadian oil sands, so impressed British fund manager Peter Young that he set up unauthorised offshore accounts to magnify his exposure to the firm. When it emerged that its plant and technology were a sham, it cost his employer Morgan Grenfell an estimated £400m. Mr Young became a tabloid sensation by coming to court in a dress, pleading insanity.One does not have to be a Scrabble star to grasp how rare the letter x is in the English language – Samuel Morse did so when developing his code – so modern-day telegraph operators would surely notice that listed companies with an x in their name show up about 17 times more than common words.Lynch retired a decade before the dotcom bubble burst. It would have been interesting to see how he steered the billions at his disposal when confronted with glamour stocks such as Pets.com. Retiring in the prime of his career, he avoided the dilemma of ignoring his instincts or facing outflows to rivals claiming he “just didn’t get it”. His seemingly throwaway comment about x stocks is yet more evidence that he most certainly did.
938;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-09T00:32:53Z;Netflix challenge to traditional TV;;Netflix announced a deal with Disney’s ABC on Wednesday to stream hit television shows such as Grey’s Anatomy – but its latest content coup came as a backlash is building against chief executive Reed Hastings’ video rental business for the digital era.Netflix has emerged as a leading contender in the fight to be the American consumer’s gateway to the universe of movies and television shows, pitching itself as an alternative to cable and satellite television operators’ channel bundles.Its shares have tripled this year as it shifted focus from mailing DVDs to streaming programming to televisions and iPads.During peak times, Netflix now accounts for a fifth of downstream traffic on US broadband networks.This success has made Netflix a symbol for the growth of “over the top” services, which offer video online without a set-top box, as Apple, Amazon and others do.It is also turning Netflix into a target for traditional distributors anxious about “cord-cutting”– people giving up their cable and satellite contracts.At a UBS media conference in New York this week, the message emerged that traditional content owners and distributors will not give up their old economics without a fight.“I know certain CEOs think of Netflix as the antichrist, and others embrace it as a second coming,” said Les Moonves, chief executive of CBS. He said his company was “somewhere in the middle”, holding back from rushing into digital agreements until a clearer picture emerged.Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner’s chief executive, said that the $8 monthly streaming subscription Netflix charges was not enough to fund the acquisition of premium content.Netflix is offering $50,000-$100,000 to stream current television shows, Mr Bewkes said, but traditional channels still pay “millions of dollars” per episode. New online entrants, he said, would have to pay the same as traditional channels.That could have a profound impact on the finances of companies such as Netflix, which said on Wednesday that Barry McCarthy, its chief financial officer, was leaving.Executives also played down the consumer appeal of the likes of Netflix and Google TV, which aims to aggregate such services, saying viewers wanted a wider array of programming and looked to trusted brands to guide them through it.“The idea of people trying to figure out hundreds of channels one by one is just not practical,” said Glenn Britt, chief executive of Time Warner Cable. “The reality is the content isn’t that great. It’s not a substitute for [watching] 7 or 8 hours a day of TV, which is how people use our service.”Several executives cited a Nielsen study commissioned by Disney’s ESPN sports network, saying just 0.28 per cent of US households had given up their pay-TV subscriptions for online alternatives in the last quarter.Patrick Doyle, chief financial officer of DirectTV, a satellite operator, echoed Mr Britt in saying that he did not believe cord-cutting would disrupt his business soon. “We see it as marginal at best,” he said.Mark Cuban, chief executive of HDNet, said the likes of Netflix could be “a nice complementary service” but cable companies held the upper hand. “There is nothing Netflix can do that cable and satellite companies can’t do,” he added.Comcast, the largest US cable company, sought to prove as much by demonstrating its Xfinity application, streaming anything from HBO hits to Avatar, to subscribers’ iPads.The day when over-the-top user interfaces match cable electronic programme guides will still take time to arrive, said Rob Wiesenthal, chief financial officer of Sony’s US operations and a Google TV partner.

Lincoln National Corp jumped 7.5 per cent to $27.24, Hartford Financial Services added 3.5 per cent to $25 and MetLife gained 3.9 per cent to $42.79. AIG sunk 3.9 per cent to $42.23 before trading was halted just before the closing bell.Investors feared dilution when the US Treasury said it plans to sell about one-fifth of the insurer.

940;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-04T00:42:00Z;Early adopters are young, savvy – or forced to be thrifty;;From Ms Amanda Orson.Sir, Lex (“ US cable companies”, November 27) makes a faulty assumption that “early adopters of technology …are generally rich”. Having cancelled my Comcast Cable subscription more than four years ago, at a time when I was making a modest salary as a paralegal with a law firm ($55,000), I feel uniquely qualified to comment on this.Early adoption, in my experience, is led by the young and technology enthusiasts. At the time I was 25 years old and realised that the cost of a cable subscription relative to the value of entertainment was simply bad return on investment.There was already an abundance of programming available to stream on the internet that did not include endless, redundant commercials. Further, because I could select not only the programming but also my viewing time, I was not constricted by time slot to withstand the horrors of reality television.In contrast to earlier years when cable subscriptions were abandoned by the young internet entrepreneurs I knew, the latest flock of cord-cutters in my life are family members distressed by the recession. Their salaries have been stymied or, worse, have been lost to lay-offs while their cost of living has increased. Cutting out their cable bill in favour of subscribing to Netflix for $15 a month simply makes financial sense.Therefore, I would argue, early adopters are not rich. They are simply young, technologically savvy, or forced to find thrifty solutions in a poor economy.Amanda Orson,Philadelphia, PA, US
941;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-03T23:42:21Z;Google courts media with Widevine buy;;Google is stepping up its efforts to persuade media companies to provide content to its video services with the purchase of Widevine Technologies, a privately held company which protects streaming of digital entertainment.The deal came as Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures, MTV Networks and Comedy Central, revived a $1bn lawsuit against YouTube with an appeal against a June verdict that the Google video site had not infringed Viacom’s copyright.The verdict, hinging on who should carry the burden of policing such infringements, “would radically transform the functioning of the copyright system and severely impair, if not completely destroy, the value of many copyrighted creations”, Viacom argued.Google said it would “strongly defend” the decision of the district court, which it said had “correctly ruled” that online services such as YouTube were protected if they removed unauthorised content when notified by copyright holders.Buying Widevine, whose technology has been blessed by several media companies as an acceptable form of encryption, could help the internet company as it attempts to win over more content producers to YouTube and the nascent Google TV business.Widevine, based in Seattle, provides digital rights management systems designed to protect the digital streaming of content for customers including NBC.com, Netflix, AT&T and Best Buy – but not Viacom.A move into digital rights management, a method of controlling access to copyrighted material, is a departure for Google, which has traditionally been associated with the free distribution of content online. Widevine’s largest competitor is Microsoft’s DRM business.Google has been courting media owners to build support for its streaming services. This week it revealed moves to make copyrighted content easier to find through its search engine, while suppressing pirated content material in its results.Google has agreed terms with music companies to launch its own music streaming service, and has faced challenges in convincing television networks to provide enhanced versions of their channels to its TV-meets-the-web product, Google TV, which it unveiled in the US earlier this year.Google did not disclose how much it was paying for Widevine, which has raised almost $45m in venture capital and institutional funding over its 11-year history from investors that include Constellation Ventures.Samsung and John Malone’s Liberty Global and were among the investors to back Widevine’s latest $15m funding round in December 2009. The company was founded in 1999 by Brian Baker.
942;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;US cable groups win ground on net neutrality rules;;"The US cable and mobile communications industries have won important concessions from regulators over proposed “net neutrality” rules, as part of a broader retreat by Barack Obama’s administration from the tougher rules it had argued were needed to protect the openness of the internet.The plan, endorsed by Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, would remove uncertainty about the ability of cable companies to charge internet users and content providers for the amount of network capacity they use, which some analysts call “broadband rationing”.It would also allow mobile operators more freedom than regulators had originally proposed to favour some types of traffic on their networks over others, although it would prevent them from blocking services outright.The relaxation of the FCC’s proposals follows political opposition to stricter regulation that some feared would result in price controls, as well as a protracted battle with network companies who claimed it would discourage investment.Mr Genachowski said a ­proposal he announced at midnight on Tuesday to institute new regulations that would ­protect internet companies such as Google from being blocked had already received support from leading technology and internet companies, as well as broadband and consumer groups.Although the exact details of the plan have yet to be unveiled, analysts said the FCC had made two big concessions to US cable companies; freeing them from the threat of being regulated more closely in the way that telecommunications concerns are, and approval for the tiering practices that are already in place.While the cable companies would not be able to discriminate against certain types of traffic on their networks, such as video, they might be able to charge companies like Walt Disney or ­Netflix extra in return for guaranteeing quality, said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.“This was a key concern for the cable industry,” she said. “I think it is a good win for them.”The plans gained cautious backing from cable and communications companies. Verizon applauded Mr Genachowski’s change in direction, while warning that his plan might be subject to legal challenge.Mr Genachowski’s proposals will be put to the FCC’s board of commissioners at a meeting on December 21. He is expected to win the support of two other Democratic commissioners at the five-member FCC even though both supported the adoption of more onerous restrictions on cable companies and other high speed internet providers."
943;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-12-01T18:35:36Z;Groupon’s runaway success with coupons;;Groupon’s rapid ascent began some four years ago in Chicago, when Andrew Mason, its chief executive, became frustrated with a $175 cell-phone contract termination fee.Mr Mason, who had just started at the University of Chicago after winning a scholarship to study public policy and the internet, became convinced that social networks could provide a network to enable similarly disgruntled customers.“I thought that if there is a way that all the people that hate this could come together, and say ‘no, we won’t do this’, if we join together, we would become so large that no one could stop us,” he told the FT in a recent interview on the meteoric expansion of his online group coupon site.With backing from Eric Lefkofsky, a Chicago-based serial entrepreneur, Mr Mason dropped out of graduate school and set up ThePoint.com, a social action networking site, whose early projects included enabling workplace union organising, and joint fundraising efforts for ideas such as painting murals on abandoned buildings. ThePoint, launched in September 2007, also included a joint discount buying capacity, which proved the site's most lucrative feature.“It seemed like a good idea, so we decided to launch Groupon sort of as a side project,” recalls Mr Mason, an accomplished classical piano player who initially studied music and technology at college. “I was always a geek, playing around with computers.”Groupon’s first deal of the day, in late 2008, was a two-for-one pizza deal at the bar and restaurant on the ground floor of their office building – the former warehouse of the Montgomery Ward, the now defunct catalogue retailer that was one of the retail giants of the early 20th century. Groupon’s seven staff used printed post cards and signs in the elevators to drum up the required number of customers for the pizza deal. Mr Mason recalls that about 20 people signed up, “Most of the people who bought them were people in our building whom we went and stood behind,” he recalls.Groupon spent six months expanding with local merchants in Chicago, then moved into Boston in early 2009 and into New York in May 2009. Its business model of taking a share from each completed sale brought it to early profitability, while merchants responded to the fact that they only paid for customers who came through their doors, which makes Groupon more cost effective than either advertising or conventional coupons.It is now in 300 cities internationally, 130 of them in the US, and 2,700 employees, just under 1,000 in the US. Its acquisitions have included similar sites in Berlin, Japan, Russia and Latin America. Mr Mason says the company has sought to retain a relaxed and open culture – reflected in his own relaxed manner – which includes having no vacation limits, an idea picked up from Netflix, the video rental company.Groupon is also unusual in having been created in Chicago rather than in Silicon Valley or the East Coast, with Mr Mason, a native of Pittsburgh, saying he had no awareness of venture funds of angel investors until he through “happenstance” met Mr Lefkofsky.Mr Mason, who celebrated his company’s initial success by buying himself a Steinway grand piano, argues that the site’s deep discounts have also reached people who would not have used coupons in the past driven in part by bringing in participants such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum and award-winning restaurants.“There is a demographic of people using coupons that would never be caught dead using a coupon,” he says. “Time will tell, but I think we’ve succeeded in making coupons cool.”In recent weeks it has also run its first national, rather than local, promotions for both Gap and American Apparel, the US clothing stores. But Mr Mason argues that Groupon’s differentiates itself with its focus on local neighbourhoods and local merchants, rather than entire cities or national merchants.“There isn’t a really great market place for local businesses to deal with imbalances of supply and demand, and I think that’s what Groupon can become. I think we can change the way that people buy from local businesses in the way that Amazon changed the way people buy products.”
944;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
945;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Comcast at the centre of ‘net neutrality’ row;;Comcast has found itself at the centre of a fresh row over alleged discrimination in the way it handles video traffic on the internet, as US regulators prepare to issue “net neutrality” rules aimed at preventing internet service providers from favouring selective content online.The US cable giant was accused late on Monday of demanding fees for the first time in return for carrying internet movies and other traffic for Level 3, an internet backbone network operator.Level 3 accused Comcast of “effectively putting up a toll booth” on its broadband networks so that it could unilaterally set the price for online content that competes with its own services.The Colorado-based company recently won a contract to carry video on behalf of Netflix, whose inroads into streaming movies pose a long-term challenge to Comcast’s own cable television business.Network operators normally abide by the internet’s “peering” arrangements which were originally intended to allow competing networks to carry each other’s traffic without charge on the assumption that costs would roughly balance out.Comcast said that there had been a doubling in the amount of traffic it was being asked to handle on behalf of Level 3, with the Netflix deal believed to account for the jump. It added that it was being asked to carry five times as much traffic for Level 3 as it sent in the other direction, which it said justified the imposition of fees.Comcast claimed that Level 3 had “inaccurately portrayed” a normal commercial negotiation between the two companies. It also accused it of being “simply duplicitous” in trying to turn the dispute into a row about net neutrality.The disagreement has spilled over into a public row at a sensitive time for Comcast. It is still awaiting regulatory approval for its planned acquisition of NBC Universal, which has been held up over concerns about Comcast’s outsized role in shaping the future of the video business.Also, the US Federal Communications Commission is expected to issue net neutrality rules before Christmas that seek to prevent the sort of discrimination of which Level 3 has accused Comcast. The action has been prompted partly by a court ruling earlier this year that upheld Comcast’s right to restrict access to BitTorrent, a service often used to carry pirated movies.Comcast moved quickly to limit the potential damage from Level 3’s accusations late on Monday, contacting regulators and Congressional representatives involved in the NBC Universal review to put forward its side of the case.In a blog post, the cable company said that it already charged other internet backbone companies the same fees that it was seeking to apply to Level 3. It added that the fees were justified by an imbalance between the amount of internet traffic it delivered to its subscribers on behalf of Level 3, compared to the amount of traffic that passed in the other direction.
946;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-11-28T17:33:32Z;Cable groups suffer as viewers switch to video streaming;;"Netflix, the DVD subscription service that also offers movies to be streamed online, has a share performance chart most companies would kill for.A year ago the stock was trading at $58; last week, after 12 months in which the company began to attract attention for its willingness to buy digital rights to Hollywood movies, the shares were hovering around $187.The company launched a $7.99 streaming-only subscription service last week, which fuelled a further jump in the shares. Yet its expansion, and the growth of rival online video services, such as Hulu, has come at a cost.Debate is raging in the US media industry about television viewers “cutting the cord” – abandoning traditional cable TV in favour of new, cheaper online video services.Recent data appear to support the theory that consumers are shifting online. Although the number of people subscribing to TV services offered by satellite or telecoms groups is growing, cable TV subscriptions have suffered their biggest drop in 30 years, according to figures compiled by SNL Kagan, the research firm.It is unclear how much of this decline can be attributed to online alternatives, although the high cost of TV services is clearly an issue, according to Spencer Wang, a media analyst with Credit Suisse.“We think we are now at the point where the pay-TV bundle exceeds what the market needs,” he wrote in a recent research note. “In 2009, the average US home received 128 channels, but watches only 38 in a week.”The cost of bundled services has risen above the rate of inflation, he says. “There is an increasing gap between the average price per channel received [versus what is] actually viewed.”But while cable companies such as Comcast and Time Warner Cable may be concerned by the rise of so-called “over the top” online alternatives, such as Hulu and Netflix, the growth of these services has yet to hit them in the pocket.This is partly because the larger cable groups diversified their businesses several years ago and now offer high-speed data and telephony services alongside their traditional video businesses.The ability of Comcast and its peers to “bundle” telephony and data services with video has, to date, protected them from swings in the number of people subscribing to pay TV. In fact, telephony and data services are more profitable than video, with a new generation of higher-margin subscribers fuelling cable earnings.“The point that is being missed here is that cable companies don’t just offer video,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. “Cable companies are very focused on driving revenues and profits – and if that means sacrificing some low-end video subscribers, that’s a price worth paying.”All of the big cable operators are taking steps to stem the exodus of subscribers: Time Warner Cable last week launched a cut-price service with fewer bundled channels aimed at cost-conscious customers. Meanwhile, Comcast is taking steps to ensure that its subscribers can go online and get access to the programming and channels that are usually only available through their television sets.The company is also close to completing its protracted takeover of NBC Universal, a $30bn deal that will allow it to exploit NBC’s TV and film content on a range of platforms and distribution systems – not just over Comcast’s traditional cable business.Yet despite these initiatives, the streaming video providers are continuing to grow and court new customers. Netflix recently agreed a deal worth as much as $900m with three Hollywood studios – Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lions Gate Entertainment – to add their films to its streaming service. Hulu, which is owned by a consortium of companies including three owners of broadcast networks – Walt Disney, News Corp and, NBC Universal – is preparing an initial public offering to fund further expansion.Netflix has “all the hallmarks of a disruptive technology”, says Mr Wang.The response of the cable companies – and whether they succeed in retaining subscribers – will ultimately determine how much more disruptive it becomes."
947;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-11-20T00:49:13Z;FCC moves to ensure ‘net neutrality’;;The Federal Communications Commission is expected to announce plans next week for regulations that would forbid internet service providers from blocking or favouring content online.The so-called “net neutrality” rules could be passed by the commission as early as December 15. The move would fulfil a campaign promise by President Barack Obama and infuriate the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill, which has said it would oppose the plan, but would have little power to stop it.The FCC called the talk “speculative”, but industry executives familiar with its plan said they expected regulations to be launched to ensure ISPs could not hinder content delivery.The rules are expected to be modelled after legislation hammered out earlier this year by Congressman Henry Waxman, the outgoing Democratic chairman of the House energy and commerce committee.That legislation, which had won support from most big telecom and cable companies but not from Republicans in Congress, would have prohibited wireless carriers from blocking websites and prevented phone and cable groups from “unjustly or unreasonably” discriminating against lawful internet traffic.Although most telecom and cable companies initially resisted the push by Mr Genachowski and some Democrats to set net neutrality standards, the move could be begrudgingly welcomed by some of them.If the FCC passes such regulations it would likely defer – at least temporarily – a separate plan endorsed by Mr Genachowski for broadband providers to be subjected to a tighter regulatory regime known as “Title II”, which would open the door to price controls and other tough new rules.The FCC’s expected move could also benefit Comcast, the largest US cable operator, as it had feared that it alone would be subject to net neutrality regulations as part of its proposed $30bn takeover of NBC Universal.Should the FCC instead design an industry-wide policy, that might also speed regulators’ review of the NBCU deal, which hinges on how to regulate the fast-growing online video market.Regulators have focused on whether Comcast could use its network to favour NBC Universal content, or protect cable revenues by hobbling emerging services such as Hulu, the online video site, or Netflix’s streamed films.Disputes between cable system operators and broadcasters over fees for the carriage of their channels have also sparked a debate about whether similar rules should apply to online video sites as to cable and satellite operators.Opponents argue that this would amount to the FCC regulating the rapidly-evolving online video industry.Republicans on Capitol Hill responded to Mr Genachowski’s expected move with anger. In a letter, 18 members from the House energy committee asked him not to move forward with the plan.“Reigniting the network neutrality debate will only distract us from [other] work [at the FCC] and further jeopardise investment, innovation, and jobs,” they wrote.
948;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-11-17T22:01:23Z;Another form of creative thinking;;Open innovation is one of those terms that is harder to explain the more you try. At first, it seems obvious: the phrase suggests the antithesis of buttoned-up research and development units or the “not invented here” mentality of big corporations.It resonates with the barrierless world of internet-based communication and information sharing. For some, it im­plies Wikipedia and Linux, the open-source software platform, vast bodies of knowledge assembled by armies of distributed innovators and creators – all driven by their own particular set of incentives.Henry Chesbrough, the Haas Business School professor who coined the term in 2003, is more specific. He says open innovation is a process that starts with looking outside the organisation as you think about things to do inside. It is about “using other people’s wheels” to get you moving. Or, to quote Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, it is a way of dealing with the fact that “not all the smart people in the world work for you”.Seven years after he came up with the idea, Prof Chesbrough says open innovation has gone through three significant phases. The first was the simplest, and involved bringing external ideas into a company’s own innovation process. This has become fairly widespread. Examples include Apple’s App Store, which allows developers to work on the iPhone and iPad platforms and thereby increase their value to users.Last year, Netflix of­fered $1m to anyone who could im­prove the quality of its film recommendations to users. The X Prize Foundation is running similar contests to stimulate advances in genomics, private space travel and alternative energy. Both contests try to draw the best minds in the world to problems they might otherwise ignore.During the past decade, Procter & Gamble has involved and acquired innovative products and processes from outside the company. It boasts that it has moved from “not invented here” defensiveness to an enthusiasm for “proudly found elsewhere”.The most glaring challenge to the open innovation model has been the development of Boeing’s Dreamliner 787 passenger aircraft. To cut costs, Boeing syndicated much of the design to outside companies, whose R&D spending would be recoup­ed as they became subcontractors to Boeing.Unfortunately, Prof Chesbrough says, “there were a lot of technical risks in the plane. When they put it all together, the plane didn’t fly. It wasn’t just a matter of control but of complexity.” Trying to be too open with such a complex project led to unforeseen integration problems.The second phase in open innovation involved companies making their unused ideas and technologies available to others. John Willbanks, who runs the Science Commons project at Creative Commons, a non-profit group that aims to make it easier to share and build on other people’s work, consistent with copyright laws, says: “In traditional innovation systems, big university departments or industrial R&D units generate research, then there is a systematic process to assess what to do with it.”But what happens in the majority of cases where the research fails to lead to commercialisation or even publication?“Big companies have so many worthwhile products that don’t go forward because they don’t move the needle financially,” he says. And moving these products out to a broader audience often seems more effort than it is worth as it involves lawyers, confidentiality and even the unpicking of patent law.Sage Bionetworks, a Seattle-based non-profit outfit, was spun out of Merck to try to do just this. Merck had spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars running data-driven models on disease and drug responses. When it realised no single company could either generate or make sense of all the data, it created Sage to take advantage of the best of open innovation.Sage in­vited groups of biologists to share its data in order to speed up the discovery process and produce more accurate forecasts. Companies can commission research from Sage but on condition that the results of that research go into the public domain after a year.The idea is that you take an area as rule-bound and difficult as pharmaceuticals research and speed it up by allowing people to share their research in the hope of one day maximising its financial and social return.Nike is pursuing a similar strategy with GreenXChange, which shares some of its technological innovations with others who might find uses for it. If Nike comes up with a marvellous new rubber for shoes, for example, it wants them to use it to make other life-enhancing products, without the usual contractual and IP hurdles.Hannah Jones, vice-president of sustainable innovation at Nike, says open innovation makes sense for the company as it tries to “solve complex issues that go way beyond our footprint”.Ten years ago, Nike found that some solvents used in making its shoes were toxic enough to require factory workers to wear protective gear. But not all did. To guarantee their safety, Nike could either in­­crease monitoring or make a harmless solvent. It did the latter and shared the recipe for the new solvent across its industry. “We’ve found there is a huge benefit to collaboration around clear, systemic issues,” she says. “We can compete in different ways. There has been a shift in the architecture of where we compete and where we collaborate.”Ms Jones admits that managing open innovation remains a work in pro­gress, a balancing act between the rigour required in any big corporation and the looseness inherent in open innovation.How do you ignite mash-ups and swarms around particular problems, and then make sense of the results? How do you decide where to invest when innovations are popping up everywhere?“All this is nascent,” says Ms Jones. “We shall embrace the failures and experiment wholeheartedly.”Gerald Barnett, director of the research technology enterprise initiative at the University of Washington, says managing open innovation is like “the Zen thing of holding fast or letting go. It is easy to hold on with white knuckles to your own process, and it’s also easy to just chuck it all over the fence to see what others can do with your work. But it’s in between that you have to use your judgment, and find out how you build a community of practitioners that finds value in what you have done and will give back.”Nike, he says, is “putting in play inventions it doesn’t have to”, in the hope that people can improve on them and that, one day, the company may reap some benefit, tangible or intangible. This, he adds, is exactly the right attitude.The final phase in open innovation, according to Prof Chesbrough, is new business models arising from opening up the process. He cites Bharti Airtel, the Indian mobile operator, which rather than building its own network of communication towers, shares those of its rivals. This model allowed it to build a bigger network with lower fixed-cost investment.Threadless is an American T-shirt company that invites people to design their own shirts and allows visitors to its website to vote on their favourites, which are then made and sold. Prof Chesbrough says investors have put a $100m valuation on the business. This model of customer communities driving a business is an example of what happens to business models when you open up innovation.Imagine the kinds of business that would emerge, says Mr Willbanks, if everyone had access to accurate data on biotech research around the world – or, say, energy consumption? If we could gather all the data on just the loss of energy in transmission lines, then make it freely available, hundreds of small service companies could enter the market providing energy-efficient solutions.

That helped drive a 32.9 per cent rise in revenues from £73.1m to £97.2m, according to documents filed at Companies House.Pre-tax losses narrowed from £7.4m to £934,000, while on an adjusted basis the company made an operating profit of £8.9m, up from £3.5m in 2008. Group net debt fell to £2.2m, from £7.6m in 2008.Lovefilm, created in 2004 by Arts Alliance, an investment group, found success as a mail-order DVD rental company.Customers sign up for subscriptions that allow them to rent a number of films each month, the DVD’s of which are posted to them and can be returned in an envelope.The company is now focused on becoming a hybrid business, offering both physical DVD rentals and online films, as it adapts to the growing number of people who want to stream content on to their computers or televisions.To that end, Lovefilm launched an on-demand streaming video service in May and has joined with Sony and Samsung to offer movies on their internet-connected TVs. It has also been announced that Lovefilm will become available on PlayStation 3 consoles.“The more people who have Lovefilm available directly through their devices or on their TV, the more we’ll accelerate our sign-up rate,” said Mr Calver. “I’m expecting that our rate of customer growth will increase, not decrease.”Last week, Netflix, the US film subscription company, said it planned to expand beyond North America, prompting fears that Lovefilm could face more competition as it begins to expand its foothold in Europe.However, Mr Calver said he believed Netflix would launch a digital-only offer. “We’d believe we’d still be the best place to offer a hybrid service,” he said.As well as Arts Alliance, Lovefilm’s investors include Amazon, the online retailer, Index Ventures, Balderton Capital and DFJ Esprit.

By next quarter the group anticipates the majority of its content will be beamed direct to TVs over the internet, rather than watched on DVD. Meanwhile Apple – which sells one-in-five consumer PCs in the US – unveiled its view of the future for laptops. Within the sleek aluminium frame of its new Macbooks there is no room for a spinning disk drive. Instead the machines’ operating system comes loaded on a USB stick, with software to be dowloaded through an app store.DVDs will linger on for a while. There is still a (shrinking) market for music CDs, after all, and Sony has invested too much to win its pyrrhic victory in the format wars with Blu-Ray to abandon physical disks just yet. The battle for consumer attention has moved on though, and as with other changes in product distribution seems likely to shrink the profits available.Indeed, Netflix faces a challenging future. The company dominates the US DVD-by-post market, its early lead giving it a cost advantage as subscriber numbers rose rapidly. But online it faces competition for rentals from aggressive competitors such as Amazon and Apple’s iTunes.More crucially, Netflix must buy films and programming from media companies enjoying a profitable staus quo, with little reason to encourage disruption of the existing system of cable and satellite TV distribution by supplying Netflix cheaply. Analysts still forecast sales roaring upwards in the years ahead, but profitability is expected to plateau soon. With the stock valued at over 50 times prospective earnings, investors may be dancing prematurely on DVD’s grave.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
951;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-10-21T21:25:02Z;Caterpillar helps lift investor confidence;Caterpillar profits up 96% on same period last year;Companies from Caterpillar to Ebay raised earnings forecasts, lifting investor confidence and helping US stocks rise.“Profits are exploding,” said Jeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James. “Earnings are driving the market because, as of Wednesday’s close, 78 per cent of companies that have reported had beaten earnings estimates. More important, fourth-quarter guidance has been very strong.”The gains were pared in the afternoon as the dollar strengthened and equities trod a path that has become familiar, moving in the opposite direction to the dollar. The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,180.26, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to 11,146.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,459.67.Increased demand for construction equipment in emerging markets helped Caterpillar beat expectations. Sales rose 53 per cent and profits were up 96 per cent from the same period a year earlier. Caterpillar, which is seen as a barometer for global construction, also raised its 2010 revenue forecast. Its shares, up 38.4 per cent this year, fell 1.2 per cent to $78.89.Investors also looked to United Parcel Services for signs of a strengthening global economic recovery. The world’s largest package shipping company can be seen as a bellwether for international trade.UPS beat expectations in the third quarter as net income jumped 69 per cent.It also raised its full-year outlook, saying it expected modest growth in demand during the holiday season. Its shares, which have added 21.3 per cent this year, nudged down 0.1 per cent to $69.59.Auction website operator Ebay surged 6 per cent to $27.19 after its third-quarter earnings beat expectations. It is halfway through a three-year plan to revive growth. Ebay also owns PayPal, the payment service used across the internet, which benefited from more consumers shopping online and using it to settle bills.Ebay raised its outlook for the fourth quarter above analysts’ estimates.Netflix soared 12.8 per cent to $172.69 after the film rental company said it was expanding its online-streaming offer and would use this to expand outside the US. Reed Hastings, chief executive, said the company was now primarily an online streaming company that also offered DVDs by post. Earnings were in line with forecasts but the company’s subscriber base expanded faster than expected in the third quarter.Fidelity National Financial introduced a new dividend policy that could see its 2011 pay-out halved. Bill Foley, chairman at the title insurer, said that the retained cash could be used to buy back stock. The company’s shares fell 11.9 per cent to $12.98.
952;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-10-21T14:22:40Z;Neflix aims to expand beyond North America;;Netflix, the US video subscription company, has said it would expand beyond North America next year in a bid to become a “global broadband entertainment firm”, ahead of digital competitors such as Amazon and Apple.Reed Hastings, chief executive, indicated that the fast-expanding company would be prepared to sacrifice operating margin in pursuit of “a competitive window that will be open only temporarily”, and would try to build on the lead it has established in subscription digital streaming in its home market.“By every measure, we are now primarily a streaming company that also offers DVD-by-mail,” Mr Hastings said, as the company reported that it had added another 1.9m subscribers during its third quarter, to reach a total of 16.9m.Mr Hastings noted that in the technologically advanced San Francisco market it had shipped fewer DVDs than a year ago. Its total DVD shipments grew by only 10 per cent during the quarter, while total revenue increased by 30 per cent to $553.2m.The company, he said, would also continue testing “streaming only” subscriptions in the US that it already offers in Canada, and would divert savings on lower postage costs into its streaming business.He also noted the possibility of growing competition from Amazon.Amazon is the largest shareholder in the UK’s Lovefilm, which operates both DVD by mail service and digital streaming. Amazon’s e-commerce business also covers France, Germany, Canada, Japan and China.Netflix’s global ambitions come against the background of an increasingly international e-commerce market, with leading retailers now operating the kind of multi-currency systems that it would need to create to support its expansion. By going abroad as a streaming company, rather than a DVD-by-mail business, it would also reduce the investment needed in physical infrastructure.Netflix also reported that its subscribers had increased 52 per cent against a year ago, and were up 13 per cent on the end of the second quarter.It said it was the fourth successive quarter in which it had gained more than 1m new subscribers.It reported net income of $38m, or 70 cents per diluted share, up 26 per cent against the same period last year.Netflix shares were up over 12 per cent in morning trading in New York on Thursday at $172.
953;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-10-13T15:30:38Z;Venture capitalists in ‘greenest home’ race;;Clean technology is among the hottest sectors in Silicon Valley, with venture capitalists pouring billions of dollars into companies they hope will upend the carbon economy.This year is on track to produce a record number of venture deals in the industry, with direct investments of more than $2.7bn in green businesses internationally, according to the Cleantech Group and Deloitte.The partners at many venture capital firms are using their fortunes to build the most ecologically friendly homes they can conceive of, vying with each other for the title of ”greenest house in America.”Paul Holland, a partner at Foundation Capital, is putting the finishing touches on his earthy palace in Portola Valley, an upscale hamlet off Sand Hill Road, with his wife Linda Yates.A sprawling compound on 2.7 acres of gentle hillside, the house will produce more energy than it consumes. The steel roof is sheathed in solar panels and the three-car garage is fitted with electric car charging stations.Foundation Capital has invested $200m in clean tech companies, and Mr Holland is using products from five of them in his house.Serious Materials made the energy-efficient windows. Silver Spring Networks made the smart meters. Control4 made the home automation system, operated through an Apple iPad. CalStar made the bricks and blocks out of fly ash. SunRun made the solar panels.“Energy efficiency is part of Foundation’s investment thesis,” said Mr Holland. “We’re trying to help create this market for green goods.”These products will help make the house among the most ecologically friendly possible, according to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification system.Two of Foundation’s investments, CalStar and Serious Materials, came about as a result of research Mr Holland was doing for the house.But Mr Holland has competition. Partners from Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers and Draper Fisher Jurvetson, two pre-eminent VC firms, are also jockeying to erect houses that show off eco-friendly wares from their portfolio companies. And other technology luminaries, including Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings, are also focusing on sustainability as they build new homes.Jen Fonstad, managing director at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, recently completed construction of a four-bedroom, 5,000 square feet Spanish Mediterranean style house on two acres not far from Mr Holland’s home.Ms Fonstad and her husband Diego built a more traditional home among mansions built with fortunes made during the dotcom boom. It features a tennis court and private vineyards. “The idea is to demonstrate that you can build a comparably priced home without compromising on design,” said Ms Fonstad. “You don’t want to change the way people live their lives.”To build the house, the Fonstads turned to a well-regarded contractor that specialises in eco-friendly projects. “Showing a green builder how to do a luxury home is easier than showing a luxury builder how to do a green home,” said Mr Fonstad. The Fonstads’ house also incorporated products from DFJ portfolio companies, including LED lights from Intematix.Building such eco-temples with the newest technology costs more than the average home. But Mr Holland argues that much of the costs will be recouped over time in the form of reduced energy bills.There may also be less tangible benefits. Both couples hope their projects will inspire more residential green building. Mr Holland and Ms Yates are “open-sourcing” their project, posting their research, successes and stumbles on a website about the house.“We want to build the greenest home in the country and try to inspire people,” said Ms Yates. “Our house is not going to fix the problem, but we can be a pebble in the pond.”The Fonstads, too, are using their home as a teaching instrument. In the living room a large whiteboard diagrams the lengthy LEED certification and highlights a number of green features in the house.Peter Yost, a partner at Building Green and a consultant on the Holland project, said venture capitalists were uniquely positioned to spread the gospel of green. “They have the odd combination of an altruistic approach, and a belief that they can make money as they go along,” he said. “Their attitude is, ‘If this is what the industry needs, then we’ll do it.’”Mr Yost was also surprised at the amount of collaboration he saw between the various families who, in spite of working at rival venture capital firms, are friends and share knowledge about their building projects. “It’s uniquely Silicon Valley,” he said. “You can’t hold your cards too close to you chest there, because you’re going to need those contacts on deals in the future.”
954;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-10-07T21:06:24Z;Apple takes a second bite at TV;Gadget may become a force in the living room;"The living room has always seemed a lounge too far for Silicon Valley companies trying to break into consumer electronics and those big-screen televisions that occupy pride of place.Until now, that is. With 28m TVs with built-in web connectivity expect­ed to ship this year, the internet has once again become a bridgehead for technology companies to pour into a new sector.Google TV, with Intel chips inside a Logitech set-top box, was unveiled in its final form this week and the relaunched Apple TV has also gone on sale.Google and Apple have very different strategies. Google has grand ambitions to reshape TV by merging it with the web. Using Google’s Universal Search capabilities and a browser interface, searching for a programme such as Desperate Housewives can bring up relevant live and DVR-recorded TV programmes, mixed with website reviews and web video excerpts.Apple is scaling back the size and cost of Apple TV and is also being uncharacteristically modest in its ambitions. At its launch in September, Steve Jobs, chief executive, said this was still a hobby for Apple and the original Apple TV, unveiled in September 2006, had “never been a huge hit”.The second-generation version is a quarter of the original’s size and weight, and sells for $99 in the US (£99 in the UK, €119 in Europe) rather than $229. It has only 8Gb of storage, compared with 160Gb in the previous version.For now at least, Apple TV is being pitched as a streaming media player – the most crowded category of all in the scramble to feed content to the TV. In this area, it jostles with games consoles, laptops that can wirelessly transmit what is on their screen to the TV, and similar media players from start-ups, network equipment providers and hard-drive makers Seagate and Western Digital.The $99 price tag marks a recognition of the stiff competition it faces and also distances it from the Mac Mini, a small-box computer that some Apple fans saw as a better value alternative at $499, compared with the old Apple TV, given its full functionality for computing through the TV.The Apple TV is simplicity itself to install. Just connect a power cable, an HDMI cable to link to the TV and allow the box to find your Wi-Fi network in the set-up process.I set mine up by plugging into the hard-wire Ethernet connection in­stead, and enabled home-sharing in iTunes on my PC to share its content with Apple TV.A slim aluminium remote allows navigation through a stylish interface as film posters, TV shows, photos and album art slide by. Recently released to DVD films cost $4.99 to rent from the iTunes store and TV shows are 99 cents an episode, although Apple has only struck deals with ABC and Fox to date.Internet content available in the US includes the Netflix streaming film service, YouTube, Flickr photos and internet radio.Being able to access a computer on a home network means anything stored in iTunes can be played or watched on the big screen and piped through a home-theatre hi-fi set-up. Photos stored in any folder can be chosen for slideshows with music in styles similar to those available on the iPad.Many set-top boxes and Blu-ray players in the US offer Netflix streaming but the Apple TV interface for the service is the best I have seen. It has been made to match the iTunes interface on Apple TV, where more information, reviews and suggestions on similar films are available.Picture quality is excellent and, while there are sometimes slight delays in loading content, video did not stutter or pause once it began playing.I have also tested Western Digital’s WD TV Live Plus HD media player, which, as the suffixes suggest, has gone through a number of iterations. The latest version now available in the US can be bought for about $120. It also offers Netflix and other services, and its main differences are the ability to attach an external hard drive and to play virtually any file residing on a home PC, and not just those in Apple’s iTunes format.The closest competitor to Apple TV in functionality is Roku’s box. This small Valley company seized the initiative among media players when it was the first to offer the Net­­flix service in a rudimentary $100 box in 2008.I have been trying out a second-generation $100 box, the XDS, launched just before the new Apple TV. It has more hardware features and content available than Apple TV.The hardware has a better version of Wi-Fi – dual-band wireless N; higher quality HD – 1080p rather than 720p; and more ways than an HDMI cable to connect to the TV. There is also a USB slot for “sideloading” to play content off a USB memory stick.In terms of content, Roku may lack YouTube but it has more than 85 “channels” of internet content, including Netflix, Amazon’s video-on-demand service, Pandora internet radio, the MOG music streaming service, live sport and news, weather and Facebook updates.Apple TV’s narrower content is its biggest weakness. But that could change and its interface and looks are much more integrated and impressive than Roku’s assembly of third-party content. Apple TV will also have more appeal beyond the US, with content available on iTunes in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK.In addition, it has synergies with other Apple devices – a Remote app allows control with touch gestures on an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. An AirPlay feature to be added in November will allow anything being watched on one of those other devices to be transferred to the TV screen at the touch of a virtual button.Inside Apple TV is the same A4 processor and operating system as the other members of the Apple family, which means the functionality of this $99 box could expand to have the same kind of apps as an iPhone or iPad in the future.So the new Apple TV’s modest appearance may be deceptive. This could turn out to be a hobby that becomes just as influential in the living room as Google’s television powerplay.chris.nuttall@ft.com"
955;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-27T23:13:21Z;No end in sight for TV’s golden age;;An hour with Jeff Bewkes, the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, feels like a lecture from an unusually animated professor.In an interview with the Financial Times before he flew to address a television conference in London on Tuesday, he dismisses suggestions that digital competition could threaten companies such as his with an impassioned tour of three decades of media history and combative confidence in his argument.After another summer of analysts’ hand-wringing about traditional media business models, prompted this time by expansionary online video announcements from Apple TV, Google TV and Netflix, Mr Bewkes echoes the view expressed by peers such as Les Moonves of CBS, that US television is enjoying a golden age that is not about to end soon.“We’re in the second or third year of a planetary global readjustment,” he says, yet TV subscription revenues, programming budgets and time spent watching TV rose through the recession. “Why? People love their TV. They love it on their TV screen and they love it on their new screens,” he argues.TV’s golden age is no accident of history, he continues, but a consequence of a business model dating to the early days of HBO, the Time Warner-owned subscription channels operator where he made his name, and of previous waves of digital upheaval. “People act like it’s new. People say, ‘What’s going to happen when the digital world gets here?’ There’s this inappropriate comparison to the music business, where something happened to them when digital technology arrived on their shores that was akin to the Vikings landing,” he says.Yet CNN and HBO were conceived about 30 years ago, where digital transmission and compression technologies first enabled multiple channels to be sent to millions of homes across the country for little cost.Those advances led to the “vitality” of shows such as The Wire, Entourage or Curb Your Enthusiasm, he argues. “Back when you had the tyranny of free TV” – he repeats the phrase for emphasis – “The tyranny of free TV led to a monopoly of expression [and] the lowest common denominator of shows that could appeal to a mass audience.”As investors debate how many people will pay for video online, Mr Bewkes mocks those “grasping for some hazily conceived idea that somehow free TV on the internet will bring some sort of paradise to the people,” saying: “Well, it didn’t before.”The relative changes in technology and media companies’ market valuations suggest that investors are betting that value will shift from media owners to technology groups, but Mr Bewkes likens this “false premise” to arguments made in the dotcom bubble.“There’s no reason why their interests and growth should come at the expense of the content industry,” he says, but the trick will be to marry TV’s “very happy business model” with the capabilities of new devices.That is what he hopes to do with TV Everywhere, a cable industry initiative also known as accreditation to offer existing subscribers their full line-up of channels on any internet-connected device. The hour up, Mr Bewkes briskly wraps up his argument: “Why wouldn’t that be a huge new dawn for the TV industry?”
956;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-24T16:52:32Z;TV networks signal new golden age for content;;Apple and Amazon are renting television shows, Netflix is streaming films, Google is launching a TV product, and millions of people are tuning into the iPad. Suddenly, it seems, technology companies are charting a new course for the media business.Yet the captains of big television networks are expressing confidence that they still have the upper hand.At the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference in New York this week, executives from CBS, NBC Universal, News Corp, Time Warner, Viacom and Walt Disney fired shots across the bows of the technology companies seeking inroads into their territory.In an unusual display of solidarity among competitors, the unanimous message was that they would be judicious about making their programming available online, and seek to extract full value from their TV shows and films. Content, it seems, is confident again.“I feel better today than I did probably at any point in the past about the NBC broadcast network’s ability to survive,” said NBCU chief executive Jeff Zucker.“This is really the golden age,” said CBS chief executive Les Moonves. “All the networks and cable have extraordinary shows, and the numbers are pretty extraordinary.”Such confidence might seem out of place for an industry that is facing incursions from online video upstarts and saw US cable and satellite subscriber numbers fall in the second quarter of the year for the first time on record.But the moguls said there was little evidence of widespread “cord-cutting”, the shorthand for consumers choosing to live without cable or satellite services. Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, said he remained “bullish” on the television channel business “even in the face of aggregators like Apple, Netflix, Hulu, whoever”.The renewed buoyancy is largely the result of an uptick in revenues after two years that saw consumer and advertising spending hit hard by the economic downturn.Scatter pricing – the rates for last-minute TV advertising – is up 15-17 per cent year-on-year, Mr Moonves said, while broadcast network owners are revelling in the new “retransmission fees” cable operators are beginning to pay for their channels.Meanwhile, networks are looking to play the digital platforms off against each other, in part by offering different content to different distributors in different time “windows”. While each of the networks has made salvos online, they seem in no rush to make all their content available on any one platform.“I don’t think an early entry is necessarily the greatest thing,” said Mr Moonves.In their measured approach, the networks are seeking to avoid mistakes made by the record labels, which 10 years ago allowed Apple disproportionate influence over music pricing through iTunes.“Our content is a scarce resource and we need to manage it intelligently,” said Chase Carey, chief operating officer of News Corp, which owns the Fox network.All the big studios are dabbling in digital. News Corp and ABC have partnered with Apple to offer 99 cent rentals of TV shows, while CBS and NBCU have withheld their content for the time being. But even these positions are provisional. Mr Moonves said CBS would “accept their phone call” if Apple asked again next year, while Mr Carey called Fox’s Apple deal “a short-term test”.Mr Moonves, who had kept CBS content off Hulu, an advertising-supported site financed by and populated with content from NBC, Fox and Disney’s ABC network, also indicated that its new subscription service, Hulu Plus, “makes a lot more sense to us”.With no dominant online platform having emerged, content for now is fragmented online, and may remain so for three to five years, executives estimated.“The digital space isn’t going to get all shaken out and defined by Christmas,” Mr Carey noted.In the meantime, Disney’s Mr Iger said that no one digital platform seems likely to amass enough power to dictate terms to content owners. “It’s a much more complicated world,” said Mr Zucker.
957;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Blockbuster files for court protection;Stores will remain open during its restructuring;Blockbuster, the US movie rental chain, has filed for bankruptcy protection after struggling to compete with the proliferation of streaming online video services and companies that rent films by post.The company, which operates 3,000 stores in the US, said on Thursday it had reached an agreement with its bondholders to secure $125m in debtor-in-possession financing to meet its immediate debt obligations. The stores will remain open during its restructuring.“After a careful and thorough analysis, we determined that the process announced today provides the optimal path for recapitalising our balance sheet and positioning Blockbuster for the future as we continue to transform our business model to meet the evolving preferences of our customers,” said Jim Keyes, chief executive.Blockbuster, based in Dallas, boasts a library of more than 125,000 films and said it would use its brand name and its “multiple delivery channels” to revive its business. It currently offers movie rentals in stores, online, at kiosks and through the post.In 2005 Blockbuster was spun off from Viacom, which left it with debt of $900m. The company said in its bankruptcy filing that it had about $1bn in assets and $1.46bn in gross debt.Blockbuster’s debt burden continued to swell after companies such as Netflix and Coinstar’s RedBox, which offered rentals by post and at kiosks, became more popular than driving to local movie shops. The increasing popularity of “on-demand” programming from cable companies compounded Blockbuster’s problems and caused its market share to plunge.This year, Blockbuster lost its listing on the New York Stock Exchange after announcing that it would close many of its stores and signalling that bankruptcy was a possibility. Shares of Netflix, which has become Blockbuster’s biggest rival, rose by 2.9 per cent to $161.48 in midday trading on Thursday.“Blockbuster believes that its digital initiatives are integral to the transformation of its business, and that the digital channel will play a principal role in the success of the restructured entity upon exit from Chapter 11,” Jeffery Stegenga, Blockbuster’s chief restructuring officer, said in a court filing.The company will also receive guidance from Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor who stepped down as a Blockbuster director this year and later acquired about a third of its senior notes.
958;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Blockbuster files for bankruptcy;;Blockbuster, the lossmaking film and games rental chain, filed for bankruptcy on Thursday as part of a “prepackaged” deal with senior debt holders – including Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor.The company, which operates 5,500 rental stores in the US and Europe, filed for court bankruptcy protection to allow it to remain in business and continue a drive to expand its digital and kiosk-based rental unit.It would accelerate a programme of store closures in the US that has already resulted in more than 500 outlets being shut this year, leaving it with about 3,500 stores in the US and 2,000 other locations elsewhere, including more than 600 in the UK.“Currently, all 3,000 of the company’s stores in the United States will remain open,” the company said on Thursday.Blockbuster said it would no longer provide funding to support its operations in Argentina, which have experienced continued shortfalls in operating cash flow.The company has been in talks aimed at reducing its $900m debt load, a legacy of its spin-off from Viacom in 2005. A restructuring agreement with holders of its $670m in senior debt would see them convert the notes into shares, and provide a $125m loan to finance continuing operations during the period of bankruptcy protection.Mr Icahn, who stepped down as a director of Blockbuster this year, subsequently acquired about a third of Blockbuster’s senior notes, giving him a leading role in the talks.Holders of about $300m in junior notes would see their holdings wiped out.The company has been steadily losing money and has missed two interest payments on its debt since July. A forbearance agreement with its senior bondholders is due to expire on September 30.Blockbuster’s competitors include Netflix, which has built a subscription-based digital downloading business on top of its original DVD-by-mail offering. It has also lost ground to the rise of Coinstar’s RedBox low-cost DVD rental kiosks.In a separate statement, Blockbuster Canada said it was not included in the Chapter 11 filing and all its operations were conducting business as usual.
959;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-22T19:10:41Z;Unappetising truths about à la carte media grazing;New video options threaten traditional pay-TV platforms, says Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson;Barry Diller minted a new phrase on Tuesday when he told a Goldman Sachs media conference in New York that “the à la carteing of life has become possible for the first time”. The IAC chairman was referring to the sudden explosion of options in the US for picking and choosing from the traditional prix-fixe cable or satellite menu.The death of the monthly pay-TV subscription, which offered a smorgasbord ranging from American Idol and Jersey Shore to niche skateboarding shows, has often been foretold. Such predictions have always been premature, to put it politely.So what has changed? The steady expansion of broadband access is one thing, but this summer has also seen a flurry of significant announcements including Google TV’s launch plan, Netflix’s five-year digital streaming deal with three Hollywood studios, and the new $99 Apple TV device whose 99 cent-per-show pricing was quickly matched by Amazon.These new options for “over-the-top” internet-delivered video represent a sufficiently heightened risk to traditional pay-TV platforms for Credit Suisse to have downgraded the US entertainment industry last week.The summer’s other ominous news for the traditional model was that cable, satellite and telecom companies’ combined video subscriber numbers fell in the second quarter, the first quarter of net losses on record. The pressure of a weak economy was probably the main reason, as households reviewed pay-TV bills that are high in comparison with many more competitive international markets.Disney’s Bob Iger says he has seen no evidence for widespread ‘cord-cutting’, but the notion of living without the set top box is clearly becoming more than a theory. Credit Suisse estimates that 17 per cent of Netflix subscribers already use its subscription streaming service instead of pay-TV. The idea that such services could become “good enough” for cash-strapped consumers or people who watch little TV should concern the cable and satellite industry.The rise of the digital video recorder, used in 1 per cent of US homes in 2006 and 37 per cent now, is a reminder of how quickly consumers can adopt new technology, and any disruption to the traditional model carries huge risks for content owners and distributors alike.Such changes also feed into the fear that the big media companies’ fate is increasingly in the hands of bigger technology companies, notably Apple, Google and Amazon. (Somehow a compelling content offer still eludes Sony, whose assets should make it a leader in combining technology and content. Nor do Samsung, LG or Nokia seem likely to come up with content stores that will catch the consumer imagination.)But the scramble for content by companies from Apple to Netflix shows how much power traditional media owners still have. The average American watches 35 hours of television a week, and no alternative platform can yet match the diversity of content to satisfy viewers for five hours a day. A limited line-up of ABC and Fox shows will not satisfy Apple TV or Amazon viewers for long.By comparison with the iTunes-dependent music industry, digital video models are healthily diversified, notes Shahid Khan, of MediaMorph, a consultancy. Mr Iger argued this week that it was hard to see any single digital disrupter striking enough exclusive deals to stand out with consumers and thus have real power over the content companies.It is of course easier for Mr Iger, with Disney’s library of hit programmes, to sound relaxed than for owners of shows that rank lower in the ratings. Owners of prime content, whether it be HBO’s new Boardwalk Empire or a broadcast network hit like Glee, should have little to fear. But how many of us will really pay 99 cents for anything but a handful of our favourite shows each week?US media groups have the chance to shape the world’s leading TV market, while tech companies’ domestic focus, the complexity of international licensing and homegrown initiatives such as YouView in the UK may mean that international markets develop along different lines.Equally, they still have time on their side: Mr Diller estimates it will take about three years for à la carteing to become a meaningful phenomenon.Meanwhile, there is one disruptive ‘killer app’ we are still waiting for: the full line-up of pay-television content, available digitally on any device. That is the promise cable companies have held out – albeit only to cable subscribers – with the TV Everywhere concept. The industry had better start showing consumers some progress on TV Everywhere before too many of them learn to live with two courses instead of three.Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson is the FT’s media editorandrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com
960;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-03T18:22:30Z;TV watchers spoilt for choice by internet services;;The choice television viewers have to enjoy programming, on-demand movies and internet services is expanding rapidly in the age of the connected TV.Where once viewers just had to pick between cable, satellite and terrestrial TV, the internet has created a large variety of new interfaces and ways to connect with content.Take the Netflix, for example. This popular online film-streaming service for subscribers in the US was made available on a $100 set-top box made by Roku that plugged into a TV input.Roku also offered other channels of content and services such as internet radio and online photos. It has just dropped the price of its box to as low as $60 in the face of snowballing competition.Netflix had also done a deal with Microsoft to put it on the TV through its Xbox 360 console. Deals with Sony and Nintendo for piping it to the TV through the PlayStation 3 and the Wii followed.Boxes from hard-drive makers Seagate and Western Digital, known as media players, added Netflix as well, before Apple said this week that it would include the Netflix service on its new $99 Apple TV set-top box.There are seven different boxes to choose from to get Netflix, not counting a number of Netflix-capable Blu-ray players, and many more boxes offering other internet-based content services.The big TV makers are responding by integrating similar services into their sets and with their own interfaces, obviating the need for a separate box.Sony has linked up with Google to offer a Google TV service and interface from this autumn. Google thinks its search expertise will prove popular as it helps consumers find the content they want wherever it lies, whether in their regular programming, stored media or content available online.Given the surfeit of choice out there, it may get a good reception from the armchair surfer.
961;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-02T19:34:29Z;Lex: Internet TV;;Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Hulu and Sony are all providing a way for viewers to purchase video content online. However today’s Lex writes that content providers might not be fully on board just yet: “While renting out old shows and films individually or on subscription generates some extra cash, there is little incentive to encourage a full à la carte system.”Continue reading “Internet TV”
962;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-02T00:03:42Z;Apple ups the ante in digital TV battle;;Apple did not make the dramatic re-entry into the market for set-top television boxes on Wednesday that some had expected, but it did make a better case for its Apple TV service, setting the stage for bigger things to come.There are already many boxes that relay streamed content from providers such as Netflix to the living room screen, but consumer adoption of such devices has been slow.What Apple is doing, analysts said after the company’s presentation in San Francisco, is offering the consumer a device that will draw them into a new way of watching television and movie content, in the same way that the iPhone developed the perception of the mobile phone.“This is to TV what the iPhone was to phones – they started by teaching people that there was more to a phone than making calls,” said analyst Michael Gartenberg, of Altimeter Group.More sophisticated applications came with later versions of the iPhone and there will be similar improvements in Apple TV, Mr Gartenberg said. Apple has taken more tangible steps in anticipation that competition in the area will intensify. It has dropped the price of Apple TV from more than $200 to a more accessible $99 and made the machine 80 per cent smaller.Perhaps most shrewd is its decision not to try to replace the cable TV box, at least for now. Apple’s tech rival Google has outlined its vision of a connected box, presaging a direct assault on cable TV by putting the internet directly on the television. “Google is trying to do an end run around the cable box,” Mr Gartenberg said. “It’s like attacking the Russian front in the middle of winter.”Apple’s initial aim is more modest. It wants to be the second broadcast input but once it establishes a presence, it can go after a plan that would connect the television screen to the world of applications that has propelled sales of the iPhone and iPod touch. Billions of such apps have been downloaded and some, in particular gaming apps, would be suited to the living room.“Expect Apple to gradually push more and more in that direction”, said James McQuivey, a Forrester analyst.Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, is guiding consumers in this direction with a free app that turns the iPhone into a remote control for the Apple TV and plans to allow content to be streamed from other Apple devices on to the screen.If the television box runs iOS in the future, the same way that iPhone and the iPad do, gestures on the small screen could translate the multi-touch functionality to the bigger screen.Apple declined to comment, but close partners in the app universe said that the company’s executives had made the iOS ambition clear in private.In the longer term, Apple will have to do something dramatic to leverage its advantage. Otherwise, it will be caught between the entrenched structure of the cable TV business and those who have greater connections to the consumer through the sale of existing televisions, especially Sony.
963;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-01T19:07:54Z;Internet TV;Expect consumers to move at couch potato speed for smart TVs;Inertia is a defining characteristic of the medium that produced the couch potato. One simple reason for the BBC’s long-term UK ratings dominance is that for most of its history the state-owned broadcaster’s flagship channel was the first thing viewers saw when they turned on the set: if a programme is good enough, the channel does not change. For all the companies vying to provide a way for viewers to buy video content online – among them Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Hulu and Sony – shifting the weight of the existing system is one of the greatest challenges.In the US, where households pay about $90bn a year for TV, mostly through cable subscriptions, the average pair of eyeballs is glued to the screen for three hours every day. Internet video, by comparison, gets just a couple of minutes, notes Bernstein Research. That relationship will change, particularly as viewing evolves from a communal, family activity to one of more personal consumption on individual devices. Tablet computers may ultimately have a similar effect to the introduction of Sony’s Walkman, favouring personal earphones over sitting around the radio. Yet it is important to remember who controls the content – media companies in no hurry to change the status quo.While renting out old shows and films individually or on subscription generates some extra cash, there is little incentive to encourage a full à la carte system. Content providers generate more revenues by selling ads across a full day’s programming. Bundles also remain an effective way to sell customers more than they really want to pay for.A halo effect from internet TV might shift more Apple hardware or devices using Google’s Android software but expect consumers to move at couch potato speed.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
964;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-09-01T00:08:08Z;Amazon considers foray into online TV;;"Amazon.com has discussed starting a broadband subscription television service with programme owners, aiming to wade into the burgeoning online TV business occupied by Netflix and Hulu, people familiar with the matter said.The talks are at an early stage and no timeframe or pricing has been finalised, these people said.Amazon has approached Viacom, owner of MTV Networks; Time Warner, whose Warner Bros studios is among the largest programme producers in Hollywood; and NBC Universal, people familiar with the talks said.The US television business has emerged as the next big battleground in digital media, where Apple and Netflix have aggressively courted pay TV and free-to-air programme owners for shows to rent or offered as on a subscription basis.The web’s largest retailer, which already sells films and TV shows on DVDs and operates one of the biggest online film and TV sales businesses outside of Apple, is hoping to blunt the impact of fast-rising Netflix, which has quickly built a popular subscription online video service off the back of its DVD rentals business.Amazon is also seeking to outflank Apple, which had failed to convince TV owners to participate in a best-of-TV subscription service ahead of the launch of the iPad. TV companies, which are paid fees by pay-TV services operators, were unwilling to jeopardise the lucrative but fragile economic model.Amazon, whose Kindle e-books reader is its best selling product, hopes that its existing agreements to sell movies and TV DVDs will give it the additional flexibility to negotiate rights to offer an online TV service, one person close to the talks said.In one scenario Amazon would potentially pay more for DVD inventory in return for rights to distribute shows on a subscription basis. The news of the talks, which come ahead of a scheduled Apple conference on Wednesday when it is expected to unveil an update to its Apple TV device, was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Google has also aggressively courted Hollywood studios to bulk up its pay-per-view online movies service.Viacom, Time Warner and NBC Universal declined to comment. Amazon was not immediately reachable."
965;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-08-29T21:01:09Z;Google plans pay-per-view films;;Google’s YouTube video site is in negotiations with Hollywood’s leading movie studios to launch a global pay-per-view video service by the end of 2010, putting it head-to-head with Apple in the race to dominate the digital distribution of film and television content.Google has been pitching to the studios on the international appeal of a streaming, on-demand movie service pegged to the world’s most popular search engine and YouTube, according to several people with knowledge of the situation.Google will use its search technology and YouTube to direct viewers to the new service, which is likely to launch first in the US, with other countries added over time, the people added.“Google and YouTube are a global phenomenon with a hell of a lot of eyeballs – more than any cable or satellite service,” said one executive with knowledge of the plans. “They’ve talked about how many people they could steer to this . . . it’s a huge number.”Negotiations have been ongoing for several months, but have taken on greater urgency in recent weeks, amid intensifying competition between media and technology companies over the digital delivery of film and TV programming. Apple is this week expected to unveil improvements to its TV device, which connects living-room sets to the internet, and eventually hopes to open the device up to “apps” developers.Netflix, the film subscription company, is aggressively acquiring digital rights to movies for its streaming service, while Hulu, the online video site owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and NBC Universal, is planning a $2bn initial public offering.The Google project has caused excitement in Hollywood because film studios are searching for new revenues to replace DVD sales, which are in steep decline.Viewers will stream rather than download the films and pay about $5 for newer titles. The movies would be available at the same time as their release on DVD and on Apple’s iTunes store and Amazon.com, meaning Google could count on recent box-office hits to power the service.YouTube said it had been beta-testing a film rental service since January.Google has been searching for a breakthrough with YouTube since acquiring the video site for $1.65bn in 2006.YouTube attracts millions of users but continues to be best known for its user-generated content. Yet it has struck several content deals and in April launched a free movie service.
966;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-08-29T17:24:11Z;Television goes smart in dramatic makeover;;The traditional big-box TV is being transformed in a technology makeover far more dramatic than seen on any reality show.Already whittled down to a wafer-thin flat-panel display, its innards are now being replaced with silicon – LED lighting, networking and computer chips – while the on-screen content is being supplemented by web connectivity.The choices being presented during this work in progress are confusing, with the options for delivering programmes ranging from digital and internet-connected set-top boxes to games consoles.Hardware makers and technology companies are in a mad dash for market share. A new Apple TV device is expected to be launched in September, joining a bevy of internet-enabled boxes that compete for the TV’s input sockets. The coming months, which will also see the launch of Google TV, could signify showtime for the era of a reborn “smart TV”.“We are right in the centre of a maelstrom, there’s a massive amount of change going on at a very rapid pace,” says Naveen Chopra, head of corporate development at TiVo, the digital video recorders company.The anticipated offerings from Apple and Google are putting internet-connected TV in the spotlight. Cable and satellite operators’ set-top boxes face competition from a range of “over-the-top” services from internet and telecoms companies. OTT services offer films, TV and web content over broadband-connected TVs, leapfrogging cable and broadcast channels and undermining existing subscription business models.Web TV has failed to catch on in the past, but the growth of online video content, such as on the Hulu website, and the ability to stream in HD quality has transformed the offering.As other sectors try to get a piece of the TV, its manufacturers face the option of either making just “dumb” monitors in future or competing with one another in producing sets with integrated internet connectivity and feeding it with their own content and services.Retailers are looking to increase their margins and gain some control by selling digital services alongside TVs. Best Buy, the world’s largest consumer electronics retailer, said this year it was re-engineering its stores to sell higher-value digital services.Media companies, too, are spreading their bets, allowing their content to be used in a wide range of formats and platforms. Netflix, the DVD home rental service, has struck a digital streaming deal with Epix, a new pay-TV service, owned by three Hollywood studios.Technology companies aim to serve all sides in the battle. Chipmaker Intel is embedding its Atom chips in TVs and set-top boxes, and Google its Android software. Sonic Solutions, which specialises in mastering and digitising content for Hollywood studios, is digitising content for Best Buy and Sears services. And network equipment makers are offering new ways of pushing content through the digital home and fighting among themselves over standards.New partnerships and merger activity indicate the frantic strategic positioning taking place: Walmart bought the Vudu digital media service this year, and Sonic Solutions acquired DivX to enhance its digital storefronts. Pace, the world’s biggest set-top box maker, is buying 2Wire to serve telcos as well as its satellite and TV customers.The convergence of interest in smart TV was graphically illustrated in May at Google’s developer conference when the chief executives of Google, Intel, Sony, Logitech, Adobe, Dish Networks and Best Buy appeared on stage together to launch Google TV. Up until then, the movement lacked serious momentum and was mired in experimentation. TV makers at the Consumer Electronics Show in January showed TVs and Blu-ray players with internet connectivity and content services, sometimes offering competing services on the same device.Netflix and Vudu streaming movies and Yahoo Widgets – small applets on screen with information such as tweets and stock prices – were common offerings.Executives admitted it was confusing for consumers but compared it with offering a choice of web browsers on a PC.“For a period of time, it’s going to be messy, you are going to see all these crap little apps on devices,” predicted one senior executive. “But then major retailers like Best Buy will say: ‘If you want us to sell your TVs, we don’t want you confusing consumers with all this other stuff, so you’ll use my [programme guide and services]’.”In the same way, Google TV represents Google and Intel trying to simplify and spur mass adoption with their own content combinations, operating system and interface, just as Google has helped to popularise smartphones with its Android operating system.“We view Google TV as a unifying solution that will allow app developers to target a Google TV platform and end up on multiple devices,” says Wilfred Martis, general manager of retail consumer electronics at Intel.The Google TV concept allows viewers to find the content they want through search, with results that mix regular broadcast programming with web content, recorded TV and personal media such as photos and music.Google’s Chrome browser is the interface to the web and there is a big-screen version of YouTube and other TV-sized web applications. Keyboards will be incorporated in remote controls.But sceptics argue that Google and Intel are trying to impose tech-style standards on an industry that does not need them.“Google TV is not designed for local TV needs,” says Neil Gaydon, chief executive of set-top box maker Pace.“Different markets around the world have different requirements, we make 160 different platforms for 120 different customers because every operator has a proprietary network and customers in different regions consume content in different ways.”Even Apple, which has created huge markets from its iPod, iPhone and iPad concepts, has expressed its doubts about an iTV.Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple, told the D8 conference in June that the sector remained just a hobby for the company.“The problem with innovation in the TV industry is the go-to-market strategy,” he said.“The TV industry has a subsidised model that gives everyone a set-top box for free. So no one wants to buy a box. Ask TiVo… ask us… ask Google in a few months.”Nevertheless, the Apple chief is expected to compete with a stripped-down $99 version of Apple TV that can stream TV shows rented by its iTunes users, showing the value of any box or integrated TV is in the services it enables.The challenge, for those promoting smart TV, lies in them persuading consumers and advertisers that such services are something worth paying for.
967;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-08-29T16:31:51Z;Delivery is key to keeping viewers connected;;In the age of connected TV, “don’t touch that dial!” has become “don’t change that input!”. Whereas broadcasters were once concerned over viewers changing channels during ad breaks, they are now worried that the public will desert regular television altogether for internet-based content.About a quarter of TVs sold in the US this year will be able to connect to the internet and bypass regular programming, according to research by Parks Associates, while WiFi and Ethernet connections are becoming standard on set-top boxes.It is getting just as crowded under the TV. Where there was once just a satellite or cable box feeding it programming, a games console or a Blu-ray player can now supply movies, information services and even live TV over their own internet connections.In the US, set-top box maker Roku is offering a sub-$100 box that offers movies from Netflix and Amazon as well as sports events and internet radio.Similar offerings have emerged on “media players” from hard-drive makers Seagate and Western Digital and Netgear, which also sells equipment to transfer content from a laptop to a TV screen.There are also challenges from Apple and its Apple TV and from TV makers such as Sony integrating content offerings into their sets.Telecoms operators – such as AT&T and Verizon in the US and BT, France Telecom and Telecom Italia in Europe – are also offering content over broadband.On top of all this, Google TV arrives in the autumn in the US. The internet company has said the service would bring together live and recorded media and what’s available over the web.Similarly, Clicker.com, a search engine that aims to be the “TV Guide for the web”, says it is talking to set-top box manufacturers and TV companies about becoming an alternative interface to web content.“The problem is no longer when things are on – in terms of how first-generation TV guides handled this – the problem is what’s available and where it is,” says Jim Lanzone, chief executive.The challenge for satellite and cable groups is to ensure they are not rendered outdated by the new “over-the-top” services.They already have powerful allies in their hardware and software suppliers, who are facing fresh competition themselves from technology companies more attuned to the internet.News Corp’s NDS has developed an interface code-named Oona for cable and satellite operators that enables close web tie-ins with content being watched – for example, a show featuring the chef Gordon Ramsey could bring up a video “widget” showing recipes.This contextual awareness is an advantage for the operators, says Nigel Smith, NDS chief marketing officer.“The thing about Yahoo Widgets for example is they are not related to what’s being transmitted and are therefore very limited in what they can do.”TiVo, which pioneered the digital video recorder, is selling its software to cable and satellite operators, helping them combine internet content with TV programming – so viewers can stick with a single source and remote control.“Without this, you are stuck playing the input one, input two, input three game where you change the TV input and pick up a different remote depending on what content you are trying to get,” says Naveen Chopra, head of strategy at TiVo.Other weapons at the incumbents’ disposal include subsidised equipment that locks viewers into long contracts and high-definition TV, and features such as HD programming.But a growing number of US consumers, frustrated at the failure of operators to offer à la carte choices, might turn to getting their content over the internet from services such as Net-flix. Those not ready to give up their TVs can also mix this with free digital over-the-air content.Sezmi, a Silicon Valley start-up, is offering an internet-connected set-top box with a digital aerial. It combines free over-the-air channels with net content and uses spare bandwidth on the digital broadcasts to provide popular cable channels. Packages cost $5-$20 a month – much less than the average cable bill.“I think price is going to be really important in winning market share,” says Dave Allred, head of marketing at Sezmi.“The number-one point of frustration consumers have today is that they feel that they are paying way too much and they’re really not getting the value out of what they’re paying for.”For all the advantages of cable and satellite, the prospect of TV that is either free or costs next to nothing remains a compelling option for the consumer.
968;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
969;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-08-24T18:58:37Z;Entertainment: A pointer to profits;Legal ‘streaming’ services offer studios fresh ways to use the web;Maddy Cross likes to watch television but like many American teenagers she does not bother to use a television set. The 18-year-old drama student will shortly leave her home in Santa Monica, California, to study at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. There was a time when a TV was an essential fixture in any student’s room but Maddy has no plans to take one with her.“I’m moving into a dorm and we decided there wasn’t any point in getting one,” she explains. “We can watch everything we want on our laptops using Netflix and Hulu, which means we don’t have to buy a TV or pay for cable.”With digital piracy costing millions of dollars in lost revenue every year, Hollywood used to be frightened of the internet. While those fears still exist, the growth and expansion of legal online subscription services such as Netflix and Hulu, which deliver or “stream” TV programmes and films on demand over the web, is upending business models that have survived intact for decades, and causing both excitement and anxiety in the entertainment industry.For the first time large sums are being spent on streaming rights, creating new profits for an industry beset by soaring talent and marketing costs and slumping DVD sales.“We’re here to show Hollywood that it can make money online,” says Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer.The stakes are about to rise further in the sector. Apple, according to people familiar with the situation, is considering a significant price cut and reconfiguration of its much-maligned Apple TV device, launched amid great fanfare three years ago promising to connect the living room set with the internet. Google also wants to move into TV, and is working on software that will be integrated into new TV sets, allowing viewers to search for programmes much as they search the web.Meanwhile, Hulu, an online video site owned by the TV networks NBC Universal, News Corporation’s Fox, Walt Disney’s ABC and Providence Equity Partners, has recently launched a subscription service. It is also exploring an initial public offering that could value it at $2bn. Any proceeds will be spent on content deals – buying the rights to show films and programmes, bolstering a line-up that includes hit shows such as Modern Family, 30 Rock and The Office.The fact that Ms Cross and her generation consume media differently from their predecessors – they have grown up streaming video and will pay for the convenience of watching an unlimited amount of what they want when they want – is good news for the likes of Netflix and Hulu. But it is a challenge for the cable and satellite TV operators that deliver programming into the home, such as US-based Comcast and DirecTV, which have for years relied on customers’ willingness to pay for large bundles of channels.The cash-strapped young are leading those shunning cable subscription. The sector lost more than 700,000 subscribers in the US in the second quarter of the year – its worst loss ever, according to SNL Kagan, a research company. This was partly because of competition from satellite operators and telecommunications groups such as Verizon. But new streaming or “over the top” services such as Hulu were also a factor, says Mariam Rondeli of SNL Kagan. “There’s definitely some substitution taking place.”For Netflix, the pay-TV industry is as ripe for revolution as the DVD rental market was a decade ago. “DVD rental used to require the customer to drive to the store,” says Mr Sarandos, adding that this was inefficient. So Netflix launched a by-mail service – Lovefilm provides a similar service in the UK – and in the process brought Blockbuster, the former market leader in rentals, to its knees.Netflix’s DVD service has amassed 15m subscribers in the past 10 years, who have access to both the by-mail and streaming services. It spends $600m a year posting DVDs to US customers but wants to shift them to online streaming. It says 60 per cent have already tried the service, using internet-connected Blu-ray disc players, or web-enabled TV sets and games consoles, such as Microsoft’s Xbox. Netflix is available only in the US but the company hopes to launch a streaming-only service in Canada in the next few months and, next year, in the UK, according to a person familiar with the situation.The internet “thrives on inefficiency”, says Mr Sarandos, adding that with cable TV, “the inefficiency is in the cost – you may have to pay $100-$150 a month for your cable subscription and there may only be a few channels that you want to watch”.…Netflix, by contrast, costs $9 a month and subscribers have access to thousands of hours of on-demand film and TV programmes. Mr Sarandos says he is prepared to “write big cheques” to strike fresh content deals with studios, producers and pay-TV companies, using the money saved on postage as customers shift from its DVD subscription service to streaming.This is music to the ears of Hollywood studio executives worried about the decline of DVD sales, once the most profitable revenue stream but now in steep decline, falling from $14bn at its peak in the US in 2004 to $10.87bn in 2009, according to Screen Digest, a research company.For Netflix, the aim is to amass as much content as possible. It recently struck a five-year deal worth an estimated $900m with Epix, a new cable TV channel owned by Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.This deal will give it the right to show movies ranging from the blockbuster 2009 remake of Star Trek to Oscar-nominated critical hits such as last year’s Precious. “Phones have been ringing around town with studio chairmen demanding to know why they aren’t getting that kind of money for their streaming rights,” says one studio executive.Starz, the pay-TV channel owned by John Malone’s Liberty Media – which licenses films from Walt Disney and Sony Pictures – also has a streaming deal with Netflix. But pay-TV channel HBO, the market leader that makes its own premium programmes such as The Sopranos, The Wire and True Blood as well as showing the latest Hollywood films, is unwilling to share content with a potential competitor. “We believe the bedrock of the pay-TV business is exclusivity,” says Eric Kessler, HBO co-president.HBO has close to 30m US subscribers and a similar number again worldwide paying to watch its content. It has vowed to keep its films and TV shows off the Netflix streaming service. “Every year we spend $1.5bn on content, whether it’s content we acquire from Hollywood or content we make ourselves,” says Mr Kessler. “We believe it makes no sense to take that investment and allow someone else to build their own business by giving it to their customers.” It is a business model that has served HBO well so far: the company generated operating profits of $1.2bn from revenues of $3.9bn in its last fiscal year.HBO is about to launch HBO Go, a streaming service, which will allow its subscribers to watch its films and TV shows on web-connected devices, such as iPads or smartphones. “If you want to watch Avatar, then the only place you’ll be able to stream it will be on HBO Go,” says Mr Kessler.In a bid to retain subscribers, cable operators that distribute HBO, such as Comcast, have also created streaming services that allow their viewers to watch programming for which they have already paid on mobile devices.Mr Sarandos says he would rather work with HBO and its rivals than compete against them directly with the studios and producers that make films for streaming rights. “But if we don’t work together then we have no other choice than to be a head-to-head competitor …and will have to buy product out from underneath them.” It has already struck a deal with US-based production company Relativity Media, which has financed or produced more than 200 films and which will shortly release The Fighter, starring Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. The deal gives Netflix the right to stream Relativity films before they are aired on pay-TV channels. Netflix also recently streamed the adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when it was released on DVD and before it was broadcast on pay-TV.The rivalry between Netflix and HBO has not affected the pay-TV channel’s subscriber base – at least, not yet. If anything, the two services seem to be complementary. In San Francisco, Netflix’s strongest market, HBO subscriptions have risen in the past four years.But that could change if Netflix and HBO find themselves bidding for the same film deals – or if Netflix decides to start making its own programming. The jury is also out on what effect Netflix, Hulu and new TV services from Apple and Google will have on cable and satellite operators that carry channels such as HBO. “Cable will go the way of the landline phone industry,” predicts Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “It is nothing more than an empty pipe which the internet will replace.”…Others disagree. “People like watching cable TV – they like choice,” says Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research. Big live events that draw millions of views, including news as well as entertainment, are not suited to streaming. “If you want to watch live sport or American Idol then you have to have pay-TV.”The bigger question, he says, is what the new streaming services mean for the future of DVDs, the great Hollywood cash cow. “It’s a big question for the studios – they [should] spend less on making movies because the DVD is beginning to die.”Still, since Netflix set a high bar with the Epix deal, studios can expect to receive more for streaming rights to their content. And if Hulu completes an IPO and expands, as anticipated, into the UK and Japan, among other countries, there will be more money in the marketplace to buy digital rights for TV programming.This is good news for makers of films and TV shows because, after years of failing to live up to expectations, digital delivery is at last yielding decent returns. This will not have gone unnoticed at Comcast, the biggest US cable group: it has agreed to buy NBC Universal, one of Hulu’s founding shareholders, in a deal that values the network at $30bn. The acquisition is awaiting regulatory approval but, assuming it is passed, will leave the cable operator with a vast array of film and TV programming to exploit online.“Netflix has the most expansive strategy that we’ve seen and is leading the pack,” says Arash Amel, an analyst with Screen Digest. “But anybody who can assemble enough content can now become a distributor of content over the web into the home. The rules of the game have changed.”
970;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-08-16T18:10:04Z;Online video group Hulu tests appetite for IPO;;Hulu is considering plans for an initial public offering as early as this autumn, which could value the US online video company at about $2bn, people familiar with the plan said.The joint venture between News Corp, NBC Universal, Walt Disney and Providence Equity Partners is hoping to raise cash to buy in content from a wider range of partners as rivals such as Netflix race to add more shows, these people said.Hulu would not comment on Monday and one person familiar with the discussions said any IPO would depend on market appetite this year or in early 2011.A Hulu IPO would be the largest offering for an online content company after Demand Media, which creates text and online videos by sifting through search engine data on consumer interests, filed IPO plans this month.Hulu, led by Jason Kilar, is the second-largest online video site by traffic in the US after Google’s YouTube and has set itself apart with its offering of recently broadcast television programmes such as Glee and The Office.The company generated about $100m in advertising revenue in 2009 but has given little detail on profitability, which could be a critical issue should investor appetite for new issues remain cautious.Mr Kilar told Bloomberg TV this month that it was “net income positive”. However, Arash Amel, analyst with Screen Digest said he doubted it would make a profit this year, when he forecasts its advertising revenues will reach $210m to $220m, compared with about $600m from US broadcast networks’ websites.Providence injected $100m into Hulu at its inception, of which it has about $50m left, but raising fresh capital is seen by Hulu’s backers as a more attractive method to bolster its video offerings than giving further equity stakes to new partners.Hulu faces growing competition from Netflix, the DVD rental and online video company which last week struck a deal with Epix, a pay-TV joint venture between Viacom, Lions Gate and Metro Goldwyn Mayer, to increase its range of movies. Long-time holdouts such as CBS have shown some willingness to offer programmes to Hulu after it test-launched Hulu Plus, a subscription service for $9.99 a month.The success of Hulu Plus would be key to investors’ interest, said Tuna Amobi, Standard & Poor’s analyst, who said a $2bn price tag looked “lofty” but not far-fetched. Fresh capital could accelerate plans for expansion in international markets, Mr Amel added.
971;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Netflix in streaming deal with pay-TV;Online delivery of movies finally appears meaningful for Hollywood;Netflix, the DVD home rental service, has struck a digital streaming deal with Epix, a new pay-TV service, in a sign that the online delivery of movies is finally becoming a meaningful revenue stream for Hollywood studios.Epix is owned by three studios: Paramount Pictures, Lions Gate Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The channel has agreed to make films released by those studios available to Netflix’s 15m subscribers in the US three months after they have aired on pay-TV channels.“Adding Epix to our growing library of streaming content …marks the continued emergence of Netflix as a leader in entertainment delivered over the web,” said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer.Netflix’s DVD home delivery system has upended the US home entertainment market, putting pressure on retailers, such as Blockbuster, which has closed many of its stores as consumers have moved to subscription services.Digital streaming direct to the home via internet-connected TV sets and Blu-ray players is seen as Hollywood’s next area of growth.Yet by building its digital streaming business Netflix could find itself in conflict with pay-TV operators, such as Time Warner’s HBO and Liberty Media’s Starz channel, which are among the biggest customers of Hollywood studios.Pay-TV channels strike lucrative deals to show films on an exclusive basis – after those films have been shown in cinemas and released on DVD.The pay-TV channels have been keen to protect their release window, which can often last several years, before the films are shown on other platforms, such as free-to-air TV. But the emergence of digital delivery to the home has triggered a rethink in Hollywood, with studios seeking new revenues at a time when DVD sales – one of the industry’s biggest revenue streams – are in steep decline.Under the Netflix-Epix deal, the pay-TV window will narrow to three months, after which films will be available to stream digitally via Netflix.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, Netflix has assembled a war chest to strengthen the number of films in its library and recently struck a similar agreement with Relativity Media, which has financed and produced more than 200 movies.As in the Epix deal, the Relativity films, which include the upcoming The Fighter, starring Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, will be available to stream months after their release on DVD.
972;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-07-08T21:04:07Z;Best of the internet on your TV;Set-top boxes that stream the web direct to your TV;The living room has become a technology battleground for a growing list of companies offering set-top boxes that stream internet-based services such as Netflix and YouTube video clips directly to a television set.Most, such as the new FreeAgent GoFlex TV HD media player, from Seagate, support high-definition and multimedia content. This unit also enables users to view digital photographs or video content stored on a home network or on a plug-in USB (universal serial bus) device on the TV, and includes a drop-down docking bay for the FreeAgent GoFlex portable hard drives – an interesting feature that Seagate hopes will help differentiate its product from the competition (and sell more portable drives).Rivals in the emerging market for media-streaming set-top boxes include Apple, Roku, Vudu, Boxee, Western Digital – another hard drive-maker – and, later this year, Google with the Logitech-manufactured Google TV box.The Seagate unit, which costs $115 or £88, is one of the smallest. It measures 4.3 x 5.9 x 1.6 inches, so won’t take up much space next to your TV even with a GoFlex drive plugged into the docking bay (which also avoids the clutter of another set of cables).On the back of the black plastic case there is one HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface) port – the easiest and highest quality connection to an HD television. The unit supports 1080p “full” HD video as well as Dolby Digital and DTS audio. It also comes with component and composite audio-visual ports, a digital audio port and two USB ports for connecting extra hard drives or flash memory sticks.There is also an Ethernet port to connect the unit to a home network but, rather disappointingly, no Wi-Fi, although Seagate does sell a USB Wi-Fi adaptor for $50. In contrast, the rival $99 Roku digital video player comes with built-in Wi-Fi.The unit, which comes with a small remote control, supports my favourite subscription film-streaming service from Netflix and a slew of other internet services, including YouTube, Flickr, Picasa, Mediafly, vTuner, RSS feeds, finance and weather widgets. Because it works with an exceptionally wide range of formats you can enjoy all of your entertainment on your television or in your home theatre – from Flip videos to photos to DVDs – regardless of resolution.It is easy to set up and you do not need a Windows PC or Mac to take advantage of most of its features. However, if you install the Media Synch software on a Windows or Mac machine, it will automatically synchronise media files on your PC with a GoFlex drive or with a USB storage device connected to the GoFlex TV unit.So how does Seagate’s GoFlex TV unit stack up against the competition? Controlling the GoFlex using its built-in user interface and the remote control is straightforward, though the menu can be confusing. For the money, I would also like to see built-in Wi-Fi.I have also been testing the Roku HD XR digital media player, which is cheaper, supports both 802.11g and 802.11n Wi-Fi networking and features support for a wide range of streaming internet content, including Netflix, Amazon, Pandora radio, Major League Baseball games in the US and Media­fly podcasts, but not YouTube.All of the free and paid-for programming on the Roku player is available for streaming via the online Roku channel store. Most important, the Roku streamer – a third-generation player from the US-based company – can be upgraded over the internet, enabling the company to add new content “channels” to more than a dozen already available.Physically, the Roku HD XR looks similar to Seagate’s GoFlex unit but is a little wider and lacks the drive docking bay. Like the GoFlex, it comes with a wide range of connection options, including an HDMI port and it features an aspect ratio (standard or widescreen) toggle, which lets the Netflix player connect to any television, not only HD sets.Unfortunately, however, the Roku player’s HD support is limited to lower resolution 720p rather than 1080p as on the Seagate player. Most viewers probably will not notice the difference unless their television lacks 720p signal support, in which case content will be stepped down to standard definition.Once again, set-up is easy, adding one step to the GoFlex set-up – to enable the user to choose between a wired or Wi-Fi connection. Once online, you will need to set up a Roku account and register the player. After that, the Roku channel store functions much like a smartphone app store, enabling owners to add and remove content channels as required.Like Seagate’s Go-Flex unit, online video content begins streaming almost immediately after selection. On both players, I found video quality was generally good using my home cable broadband connection, though not up to Blu-ray standards, and video quality does vary considerably depending on the source. Netflix and Amazon films looked best, while YouTube video clips (on the Seagate unit) and Mediafly video podcasts were often of much lower resolution.One final thought. While dedicated media-streaming boxes such as these provide an easy way to access internet-based streaming media services, you may already own a device capable of accessing some of these services.For example, Tivo digital video recorders, Xbox 360 video games consoles and many Blu-ray players now provide access to Netflix, and Amazon video-on-demand is similarly available on a growing number of devices. Consumers who already own one of these devices – or are considering purchasing one – may want to think twice before buying a dedicated media-streaming box.paul.taylor@ft.com

Because of this, today’s trading may be a key bellwether for markets heading into earnings season,” he added.The non-manufacturing ISM index unexpectedly fell to 53.8 last month from 55.4 in May. A reading over 50 indicates expansion.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,028.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 9,743.62 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,093.88.US-listed shares in BP added 8.7 per cent to $31.91 after the company said it could meet the costs of its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico without issuing new shares, rejecting recent speculation that it was seeking a bail-out from a strategic investor.The company has launched an appeal for support to Middle Eastern and other international investors, arguing that its shares are good value after their near-50 per cent fall since the Deepwater Horizon disaster on April 20.Chipmakers were higher after the Semiconductor Industry Association said global sales climbed 4.5 per cent in May from the previous month.Micron Technology was up 1.6 per cent to $8.35 and SanDisk added 0.7 per cent to $41.77.Goldman Sachs gained 0.9 per cent to $132.26 as the financial services giant was upgraded to “overweight” at JP Morgan.

Regions Financial climbed 2.7 per cent to $6.41, Fifth Third Bancorp was 1.9 per cent higher at $12.04 and PNC Financial gained 1.9 per cent to $56.74.Cliffs Natural Resources was down 5.1 per cent to $44.49 after North America’s largest iron ore producer agreed to buy the coal operations of privately held INR Energy for $757m.The energy sector was one of the strongest performers on Tuesday. Peabody Energy, the largest US coal company, added 3.3 per cent to $40.26, Massey Energy advanced 2.7 per cent to $27.02.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed maker by market value, was one of the session’s worst performers as it dropped 3.1 per cent to $45.12. The European Union’s highest court on Tuesday said the company cannot use the European patent on its Roundup Ready soyabeans variety to block Argentine soy meal imports into the EU. The decision is binding across the region and cannot be appealed.Oshkosh was up 1.3 per cent to $30.38 as the maker of speciality vehicles won contracts worth $691m to supply the US army with tactical trucks and trailers, the US defence department said late last Friday.Consumer staples stocks struggled to participate in the rally.

It said it expected to earn $8 to $10 per share during 2012.Talbots, an apparel retailer, lost 9.5 per cent to $12.20 in spite of reporting better-than-expected second-quarter profit. It forecast full-year earnings that beat average analyst estimates.Dollar General gained 2.1 per cent to $29.83 after the discount retailer reported its first-quarter results and raised its profit forecast for the full year. It expects to earn as much as $1.69 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share.Fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s pushed 2.4 per cent higher to $68.38 as it reported better-than-expected May sales. Established restaurant sales were up 4.8 per cent globally.But the company said a weak euro was expected to lower full-year profit. About 41 per cent of McDonald’s revenues were recorded in Europe last year.Rival Burger King said on Monday it was also expecting unfavourable currency conversion effects to hurt its full-year results.

975;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-05-24T18:42:34Z;Pace takes top spot in set-top box market;;Pace has provided the UK technology sector with a fillip after becoming the world’s largest maker of TV set-top boxes, overtaking US rival Motorola and Technicolor of France.The group, based in Saltaire, Yorkshire, leapt from third place to first, according to industry analysts IMS Research, after it increased shipments of its set-top boxes by 31 per cent to 17m in 2009, to customers such as Comcast, DirecTV and Canal+.Pace’s success contrasts with the early part of the decade, when it was largely dependent on one contract from BSkyB and repeated profit warnings put it close to bankruptcy.IMS said Pace had taken market share from rivals, as the number of set-top boxes sold around the world rose 15.2 per cent year on year.In the past year, the company has been rushing to meet increased demand for high- definition TV services. It also benefited from ongoing problems at Motorola and Technicolor (formerly known as Thomson), which saw first-quarter sales declines of 18 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively.But Pace shares have fallen more than 15 per cent in the past four weeks on concern that its position could be short-lived.In particular, investors are worried that internet-based TV, such as the newly launched Google TV, could encourage households to by-pass the set-top box in favour of online video services such as Hulu and Netflix.However, Arun George, an analyst at Noble Securities, said Pace was forecast to ship more than 21m boxes this year, and IMS expects the increase will be enough to hold the top-ranking position in 2010 for the group.New business this year included contracts from a Malaysian pay-TV operator and BT Vision. Mr Gaydon said recent shipments had also been driven by the forthcoming football World Cup.Three years ago, Pace sat in eighth place globally in terms of shipments, but sprang into the top three with its £68m acquisition of Philips’ set-top box division . Within a year the lossmaking division made a profit. Pace shares rose 0.8p to close at 161.9p.
976;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-05-16T17:07:11Z;Google and Intel in web TV launch;;Google and Intel are expected to announce a significant breakthrough into consumer electronics and the broadcast industry this week with the launch of a “Smart TV” platform.Top executives from the Silicon Valley companies are reported to be ready to reveal a deal with Sony, bringing web services to its televisions, during Google’s annual developer conference in San Francisco.Intel’s Atom microprocessor and Google’s Android operating system are spearheading their assault on set-top boxes and TVs featuring integrated internet services.The technology companies have had little success penetrating the TV industry to date but both are now seeking to take advantage of service providers and TV manufacturers scrambling to add web capabilities and content.“The revolution we’re about to go through is the biggest single change in television since it went colour,” Paul Otellini, Intel chief executive, told analysts last week.At the Consumer Electronics Show, Las Vegas, in January, manufacturers showed off televisions, Blu-ray players and set-top boxes with internet connectivity and services ranging from movies provided by Netflix, CinemaNow and Vudu to channels playing internet radio, connecting to online photo services and adding social networking features such as Twitter and Facebook.Intel pioneered internet “widgets” on TV screens with Yahoo in 2008 but while many other players have entered the market since, it remains fragmented and has been slow to take off.“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said no way Intel and Google could make an impression,” said Kurt Scherf, principal analyst at research firm Parks Associates. “But Intel looks to have gained some traction and the operating system space is so wide open that it’s a case of why not Google at this point.”Intel said its latest Atom chip offers better audio and video performance, wider and open software support and is cheaper than the competition.It currently has an order backlog of 1m units for the chip. France Telecom and Telecom Italia are among a number of customers lined up to put the chips in set-top boxes.“We’re seeing the beginning of explosive growth,” Eric Kim, head of Intel’s Digital Home group, told analysts. “Right now, we’re gearing up for a massive retail launch of [connected devices] this year.”Google is expected to call on its Android developer community this week to create applications for TVs and its software could prove popular if it also promises advertising revenues for TV manufacturers.“Consumer electronics manufacturers want a piece of this [advertising] pie and Google is the player in this very crowded space that can immediately offer them revenue share,” said Mr Scherf.

Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.John Stoltzfus, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “Markets that had
rallied earlier this week have been paring those gains as consideration of the ramifications of austerity programmes tied to the bail-out on regional and even global growth are being weighed.”At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was 1.9 per cent lower at 1,135.68 but 2.2 per cent up on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.5 per cent to 10,620.16, leaving it 2.3 per cent higher on the week, while the Nasdaq Composite had dropped

ConocoPhillips was one of the worst performers on Friday, losing 1.9 per cent to $55.84.Chevron fell 1.4 per cent to $77.83 and ExxonMobil was down 1.8 per cent to $63.60.Sybase was up 0.7 per cent to $64.65 over the week after Germany’s SAP, the world’s largest enterprise software maker, said on Wednesday that it would acquire the company for $5.8bn.The price, $65 a share, represents a 44 per cent premium to Sybase’s three-month average stock price.Online film rental company Netflix fell 8.6 per cent to $100.56 as the stock was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” at Citigroup and cut from “buy” to “neutral” at Merriman Curhan Ford.Shares of aluminium refiner Noranda Aluminum rallied 6 per cent to $8.80 on their market debut on Friday but JinkoSolar, a China-based maker of solar cells, was flat at $11.01 on their first trading day.Wave2Wave Communications postponed its initial public offering due to poor market conditions."
978;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-05-05T07:09:51Z;Seagate media player gets flexible with Netflix;;UPDATED - with Roku Netflix announcement.Netflix has made its official movie debut on a media player device with the launch of Seagate’s GoFlex TV HD media player on Tuesday.The player is part of a complete refresh of Seagate’s FreeAgent Go line of products, which Paul Taylor will look at in depth in his Friday personal technology column.The Netflix movie-streaming service is featured on Blu-ray players, TVs, the three major games consoles and set-top boxes such as the Roku streaming-media player.But Seagate says this is the first time Netflix has allowed its service on a media player such as the GoFlex TV – giving it a feature lacking in rival products from Western Digital, Netgear and Iomega.The GoFlex TV is a new version of the Free Agent Theater +, which itself received a firmware upgrade to enable Netflix in recent weeks.The GoFlex is a slimmer, more portable package with the same functionality – it allows users to slot in an external hard drive and move digital media content for display on a connected TV or stream content from their PCs or from the internet, with YouTube videos, Flickr photos, podcasts and radio stations available as well as Netflix.Consumers may also find the GoFlex TV an ideal option for watching movies through Seagate’s recent deal with Paramount.A 500Gb version of one of its external drives comes with a free copy of the Star Trek movie and 20 others that can be unlocked for ownership and playing, at prices from $10-$15.It’s these kind of content deals that are key in lifting and differentiating media players, as the choice of internet-connected boxes under the TV set grows.UPDATE – On Wednesday, Roku announced new functionality for its Netflix service. Up to now, Netflix users on non-PC devices have only been able to choose from movies on the instant-play lists created through a PC’s web browser. With the free Roku upgrade in June, they will be able to search the entire Netflix library of instant-play content from the set-top box and stream whatever movies or TV shows are in that library.
979;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-05-03T19:56:34Z;Apple shifts 1m iPads in first month;;Apple has sold 1m units of the iPad in the four weeks since it went on sale in the US, suggesting that demand for the touchscreen tablet computer is higher than anticipated.However, the company faced criticism from users who complained that the 3G iPad, released at the weekend, was delivering poor video performance over AT&T’s network.By hitting the 1m sales mark in 28 days, Apple can point to the iPad as one of its most successful product launches.When the iPhone was released in 2007, it took 74 days for Apple to move 1m units. It sold 300,000 iPads on the first day the device went on sale, April 3.Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, said “demand continues to exceed supply’’ and that the company was working to catch up.Apple said last month it would delay the international roll-out of the iPad as it struggled to keep up with demand. International pre-orders will begin next week.Before the launch, critics wondered whether users would have room for a third device between a smartphone and a personal computer.“It’s too early to say for sure, but it’s off to a good start,” said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “It looks like this is a category that is going to be around.”Since its launch, iPad users have downloaded more than 12m apps from the App Store. Developers have created at least 5,000 apps unique to the iPad.Apple also said customers have downloaded 1.5m eBooks from Apple’s new iBookstore, suggesting that many early users were using their iPads as an e-reader.The company is positioning the iPad as a direct challenger to Amazon’s Kindle device, the market leader in e-readers. Mr Jobs has pledged that the iPad would “go a little further” than the Kindle.Amazon does not release sales figures, but analysts estimate there are about 3m Kindles in use.The rosy debut of the iPad has been marred by complaints from users who say the 3G service, which is provided by AT&T, compromises the quality of video and does not allow some apps to work.In particular, users have complained that when YouTube is played over the 3G network, the quality is reduced from high definition to a lower-resolution version, and that the ABC Player does not work unless it is connected to Wi-Fi.The Netflix app, however, was reported to be working on the 3G network.“It’s annoying for people who went out and bought an iPad and thought they would watch video on the bus ride home,” Mr Munster said. “But I don’t think it’s a deal breaker.”Apple shares rose $5.36, or 2 per cent, to $266.45 in late New York trade on Monday.

He said Paramount and Universal were also continuing to provide Blockbuster with normal industry payment terms.The new agreements also maintain Blockbuster’s ability to immediately rent out new films released on DVD, to customers of both its stores and its by-mail subscription service.In contrast, the studios have imposed a 28-day rental release delay on its rivals Netflix, the DVD-by-mail subscription service, and on Coinstar’s Redbox automated rental kiosk service.Last year, Blockbuster secured 89 per cent of its US films under revenue-sharing arrangements with the studios rather than purchases, up from 85 per cent in 2008, as it sought to conserve cash.With about 4,000 physical rental stores in the US, Blockbuster is an important distribution channel for the studios, as they seek to prevent any single distributor achieving the kind of dominance in the emerging digital film market achieved by Apple and its iTunes service in the music download business.Blockbuster said in February that its auditors had warned it might be unable to continue as a going concern if it did not carry out steps aimed at improving its liquidity, and strengthen its capital structure.The moves are part of efforts to persuade bondholders to convert all or part of its $300m in senior subordinated notes into stock, in a restructuring that it said could be linked to a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing.It could also seek to alter terms on $637m in senior secured notes that it issued in September last year.Blockbuster has been hard hit in North America by the rise of Netflix and Coinstar’s Redbox subsidiary.

982;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-04-03T01:16:19Z;Icahn prunes stake in video rental;;Carl Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, has sharply reduced his stake in Blockbuster, the largest US video rental chain, as the retailer seeks an injection of capital to avoid a potential bankruptcy filing.Mr Icahn sold more than 14m of the retailer’s Class A and B shares over the past week, according to a regulatory filing on Friday, leaving him with control of about 5 per cent of its shareholder votes, down from about 11 per cent he reported in January.The pull-back follows his announcement in January that he was stepping down from Blockbuster’s board.The company’s financial position has become increasingly fragile since it announced in February that it had suffered bigger than expected losses in the vital fourth quarter of last year.Its store-based business has been struggling to adjust to shifts in consumer behaviour over the past five years, as it has lost customers both to Netflix’s DVD by mail rental service, and to low-cost DVD rental kiosks operated by Coinstar’s Redbox.The scaling down of Mr Icahn’s position at Blockbuster, which he had maintained since the middle of the decade, has been offset by the recent emergence of Mark Wattles, another billionaire investor, as Blockbuster’s dominant shareholder.A regulatory filing by Mr Wattles in February showed that he had built up a stake giving him about 11.5 per cent of the company’s shareholder votes with 5.1 per cent of its Class A shares, and 18.2 per cent of its double voting Class B shares.Mr Wattles, a veteran of the video rental industry, founded Hollywood Entertainment, which was sold to Movie Gallery in 2005 after it outbid Blockbuster. Mr Wattles had previously sought to take his company private in a buy-out supported by Leonard Green, the private equity group.Mr Icahn first acquired a substantial stake in Blockbuster in 2004, and went on to launch a bitter proxy battle against its then chief executive, John Antioco. Mr Icahn subsequently joined the board, and Mr Antioco resigned abruptly in 2007 after continued friction.He was replaced by Jim Keyes, the current chief executive, who had previously spearheaded a turnround at the 7-Eleven convenience chain.Mr Keyes told investors in February that Blockbuster was continuing to explore alternatives to raise new capital, working with Rothschilds, the investment bank.“We have a number of alternatives that we are exploring that will allow us to in some combination recapitalise the balance sheet and give us a good solid strategic partner to move forward [on new initiatives],” he said.Blockbuster’s shares closed on Thursday at 25 cents. They were trading above $10 when Mr Icahn started building his stake in 2004.

984;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Blockbuster;Decline should give fellow retailers pause for thought;Blockbuster is not yet dead, but time is running out. From a market capitalisation of $2bn in 2005, the company’s shares are today worth $50m. The international video rental store chain is even struggling to fund inventory– negotiating with film studios to post Canadian stores as collateral against new DVD supplies due to a lack of bank credit. Blockbuster’s decline should give debt investors and fellow retailers pause for thought.The severity of the company’s deterioration is a warning to retailers battling obsolescence – such as the UK’s CD and DVD seller HMV, US bookstore chains Barnes & Noble and Borders, and even, ultimately, GameStop. Blockbuster’s sales dropped 16 per cent in the fourth quarter, while old rival Netflix added 1m customers to its subscription-based rental business. Pressure has also built in the past two years thanks to the proliferation of Coinstar’s Redbox vending machines offering $1 rentals, to which Blockbuster has been slow to respond.Meanwhile, the effective 15 per cent yield on $637m of senior secured notes issued by Blockbuster in September no longer appears quite so attractive. Last year there was a record $132bn of high-yield debt issued in the US, according to Standard & Poor’s, $9bn of which received the lowest CCC rating. The open question is whether this cash provided cures or mere palliatives.Without a strong economic recovery, the latter seems more likely. A speculative grade default rate of 11 per cent in 2009 was at least lower than had been feared, but investors’ thirst for decent yields has simply put off the reckoning. In 2012 $198bn of high-yield debt matures, followed by $277bn in 2013, and $380bn in 2014. It is not hard to guess in which direction bond yields must go.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
985;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-03-16T23:49:02Z;Blockbuster threatened by DVD supply drama;;Blockbuster, the troubled US video rental chain, is facing growing challenges in securing a continued supply of DVD releases from Hollywood studios, underlining questions about its ability to continue as a going concern.In its annual regulatory 10-K filing, the company said it was discussing with the studios the possibility of using its Canadian stores as collateral because it could not access bank credit. “If the studios tighten their credit terms or if studios eliminate their provision of credit to us altogether, this could result in up-front cash commitments that we may be unable to sustain on a long-term basis,” it said.The company listed the threat of being unable to acquire new inventory as one of a number of factors that could lead it to a filing for bankruptcy protection, saying it was also considering raising funds for inventory by borrowing against its Canadian assets.Blockbuster has been hard hit in North America by the rise of both the DVD-by-mail subscription service of Netflix and the expansion of low-cost automated rental kiosks run by Coinstar’s Redbox subsidiary.Under Jim Keyes, its chief executive, it has closed hundreds of stores while seeking to create its own kiosk business, and to position itself in the emerging business of digital downloads.But its business stumbled badly during the fourth quarter after a planned investment in inventory failed to stem a 16 per cent fall in US same-store sales.The company said on Tuesday that it was now expecting mid to high-single digit percentage declines in same store sales this year.It said last month that its auditors had warned it may be unable to continue as a going concern if it were unable to carry out steps aimed at improving its liquidity and strengthen its capital structure.The moves include a continuing effort to find buyers for its businesses in Europe, including the UK.The main focus of its effort is aimed at persuading bond holders to convert all or part of its $300m in senior subordinated notes into stock, in a restructuring that it said could be linked to a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing.It may also seek to alter terms on $637m in senior secured notes that it issued in September last year.The company was able to nearly double the size of the sale thanks to the insatiable demand for yield among investors faced with near-zero official rates.The senior secured bonds yielded above 15 per cent at issue. They were priced at a discount, 94 cents on the dollar, but they are now quoted in the low 70s, according to investors.
986;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T05:00:57+0000;Blockbuster to cut US advertising;;Blockbuster, the struggling US video store chain, said it would cut US advertising and further reduce expenses by $200m in the coming year as it fights to keep its business afloat amid a drastic shift by customers away from traditional video stores.The retailer said its US same-store sales fell 15.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, while its rival Netflix added an additional 1m members to its DVD-by-mail subscription service during the same period. Its revenues fell 18 per cent to $1.08bn.Jim Keyes, chief executive officer, said the company was working with Rothschild, its financial advisors, on ways to increase its liquidity, including a possible recapitalisation.Under Mr Keyes, Blockbuster is seeking to establish its brand in rapidly emerging new channels such as digital downloads and vending kiosks, while maintaining a conventional store network that, it argues, will remain an important outlet for distributing movies.Blockbuster ended the fiscal year with $188.7m in cash and cash equivalents, and $963m of debt, including capital leases.The retailer reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of $434.9m, or $2.24 per share, which included the non-cash writedown of $369.2m related to impaired goodwill. Excluding charges, its loss of 35 cents per share was more than double Wall Street’s consensus forecast.The retailer said it planned to reduce its expenses by an additional $200m in 2010, as it moved ahead with plans to close 500 underperforming US stores. It is also continuing negotiations for a possible sale of its European store network.However, it plans to add another 7,000 DVD rental kiosks to retail locations around the US in a partnership with NCR, as it seeks to regain ground lost to Coinstar’s Redbox rental kiosks.Mr Keyes also expressed optimism that store closures by Blockbuster’s rival Movie Gallery, which filed for bankruptcy last month, would eventually support sales at its store network. Blockbuster and NCR, he said, were also looking at international expansion of the kiosk system.The retailer also warned that its regulatory filing for 2009 would include a comment from its auditors saying “that substantial doubt exists with respect to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”.Mr Keyes said he was also pleased by Walmart’s entry into the internet video-on-demand market through its acquisition this week of Vudu, saying the move would support the broad development of the category through sales of new internet-connected televisions.“We don’t think they will go exclusive …it’s likely that they’ll have their private label, but they’ll also have the leading brands in their consumer electronics devices.”
987;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-02-23T00:40:42Z;Walmart to buy film download provider;;Walmart, the largest US seller of DVDs, said on Monday it was buying Vudu, an internet-based film download service, joining an increasingly competitive struggle for position in the rapidly developing market.Vudu is one of a number of internet video software systems now being built into high-definition televisions and Blu-ray disc players made by leading electronics manufacturers, including LG and Mitsubishi.The systems allow users to download material from the internet without the use of either a personal computer or cable or satellite service.The deal brings Walmart into competition with similar internet-based services such as Netflix’s Watch Instantly, Amazon’s Video on Demand, and Cinema Now, a service backed by Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, as well as with Apple’s iTunes service.Vudu charges $19.99 to own recently released films, and $3.99 to rent.Walmart said in a statement that it had a definitive deal to acquire Vudu that it expected to close within a few weeks. It did not give a price.The deal marks the first time that Walmart has acquired a digital service provider, rather than developing a relationship with a third-party supplier, reflecting the importance of the entertainment business to its broader business strategy.While it sells about 40 per cent of the DVDs sold in the US, giving it considerable bargaining power with Hollywood studios, the retailer has been struggling to position itself successfully to transfer its dominance of the physical retail market into emergent digital technology.Walmart briefly tested a movie downloads service with Hewlett-Packard in 2007, but abandoned the project soon afterwards, as HP ended its efforts to establish itself in the emerging business. It also abandoned a DVD-by-mail rental service after two years and transferred its customers to Netflix.The retailer has operated an MP3 music download service since 2007 on its Walmart.com website, but remains a fringe participant behind Apple’s iTunes and Amazon’s MP3 service.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s US stores, said that the combination of Vudu’s digital technology and Walmart’s retail expertise and scale would “provide customers with unprecedented access to home entertainment options as they migrate to a digital environment”.Vudu has licensing agreements with almost every significant movie studio and dozens of independents to offer about 16,000 films.Its service also has applications linking it to platforms including Facebook, Flickr and Twitter.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson
988;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Warner strikes DVD release deal with Redbox;;Warner Brothers has taken a step towards protecting sales of its DVDs at a time when the home entertainment format is in decline after striking a deal with Redbox, the DVD kiosk operator that rents discs for $1 a day.Redbox is Hollywood’s bête noir. It buys DVDs and rents them at a steep discount in kiosks outside supermarkets and shopping centres across the US.The studios have claimed these rentals hit sales of DVDs, a much higher margin transaction for them. Some, including Warner Bros, refused to supply discs to Redbox.But Warner has created a “release window” for kiosk DVDs in its deal with Redbox. It will supply the discs to the kiosk operator 28 days after they have first gone on sale.The studio has the largest home entertainment business and DVD library in Hollywood. Its deal with Redbox is likely to be followed by other agreements between the kiosk operator and Hollywood studios.Kevin Tsujihara, president of Warner’s home entertainment group, told the Financial Times that the deal was likely to bolster higher margin transactions, such as video on demand and digital downloading.Consumers who were keen to see a film as soon as possible after its theatrical run could buy it on DVD, watch it on video on demand, rent the DVD from a chain such as Blockbuster – which generates better margins for the studio than Redbox – or wait 28 days to rent it from the kiosk operator, he said.“We have to address the economics of home entertainment. This creates a window that favours the activities – video on demand, digital distribution – that we prefer.”Warner will supply more copies of its DVDs and Blu-ray discs to Redbox.“By agreeing to a delayed release date, Redbox can now acquire Warner titles at a reduced product cost, preserving value for our consumers and increasing access to Warner titles at Redbox locations nationwide,” Mitch Stewart, Redbox president, said.Redbox has come under pressure amid reports that Walmart and Target have been working to prevent the kiosk operator from buying DVDs in bulk from their stores.Warner’s agreement with Redbox follows a similar deal struck with Netflix, the DVD subscription service.Netflix, which has grown in popularity at the expense of rental chains such as Blockbuster, agreed to delay releasing copies of Warner titles for 28 days in return for more disc copies.
989;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-02-03T22:25:31Z;Movie Gallery files for bankruptcy again;;Movie Gallery, the US video rental chain, has filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time since 2007, highlighting the continued decline of the video store format in the face of growing online and digital competition.The company, which is privately held, plans to rapidly close almost 800 of its remaining 2,600 Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video stores, leaving it with less than half the store base it operated when it first filed for bankruptcy in 2007.It said in its latest filing that more than half of its stores had been operating at a loss, and that it would continue to evaluate its remaining locations, with further closures possible during the proceedings.The move comes just weeks after Blockbuster, its larger rival, warned of significantly higher losses for its 2009 full year, after a marketing push in December failed to pay off.In contrast, Netflix, the web-based service that offers both a DVDs-by-mail subscription service and digital movie downloads, reported last month that it had gained an additional 2.8m subscribers over the previous year, to reach 12.8m.Steve Moore, Movie Gallery’s chief restructuring officer, cited intense competition from Netflix as well as cable and other view-on-demand services as having contributed to the pressures on Movie Gallery both before and after its initial bankruptcy filing in 2007.But he singled out the subsequent rise of Redbox, a service owned by Coinstar that now has more than 19,000 DVD kiosks located in chemists, supermarkets and discount stores, offering recently released films for $1 a night.“One of the most significant industry-wide factors affecting the company …has been cannibalisation of video rentals by DVD rental kiosks operated by Redbox which offer low priced rentals and convenience,” he said, also noting the growing challenge from internet services such as Google’s You Tube and Apple’s iTunes service.He noted that Redbox’s revenues had almost doubled from $390m in 2008 to an estimated $760m in 2009.Movie Gallery’s own revenues fell 30 per cent over the same two years, from $2bn in 2008 to $1.4bn in 2007.Its fourth quarter operating loss increased by more than 50 per cent last year to $129.3m, from $84.8m the year before.Movie Gallery listed debt of between $500m and $1bn, and estimated assets of $50m. It currently employs just over 19,000 people, almost 4,000 of them on a full-time basis.It owes more than $41m to five leading Hollywood studios.Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, said last month he expected further video store closures to support growth of the company’s subscription service, forecasting that it could add another 2.2m to 3.5m new subscribers during the current year.
990;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-01-28T00:18:05Z;Netflix shares leap 10%;;Netflix, the video rental service, saw its shares jump over 10 per cent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after it reported adding over one million new subscribers during its fourth quarter.Netflix said it had 12.3m subscribers to its mail subscription and download services at the end of December, a net gain of 1.16m on the previous quarter, and 2.8m more than a year ago.It said it expects to end 2010 with between 15.5 million and 16.3 million subscribers, with demand fueled in part by continuing closures of video rental stores.Reed Hastings, chief executive officer, said what he called the “phenomenal” annual growth of over 30 per cent was also being supported by the growth of demand for downloads to video game players, including Sony’s Playstation 3 and Microsoft’s Xbox 360.About half of Netflix subscribers download material digitally, as well as using the subscription mail services for DVDs.The results contrasted sharply with the troubles facing rival Blockbuster and its network of physical stores. Blockbuster warned earlier this month that it would face a significantly larger losses for 2009, after increased investments in stock and advertising during the quarter failed to pay off.Netflix’s net earnings increased 36 per cent to $30.9m on a 24 per cent increase in revenues to $444.5m against the same period last year.It also forecast full-year earnings for 2010 of $2.28 to $2.50 a share on sales of up to $2.11bn, ahead of Wall Street’s current forecasts.Netflix, which built its reputation over the past decade with its innovative DVD-by-mail subscription service, is now seeking to position itself as a leading brands in the emerging download business, in the face of competition from Apple, Amazon, Blockbuster and others.Its mail-based service is also facing new competition from DVD rental kiosks operated by Coinstar’s Redbox, which offer films for as little as $1 a night from 19,000 kiosks located in drugstores, supermarkets and discount stores.

Blu-ray is finally starting to make significant advances,” says Michelle Abraham, In-Stat analyst.Blu-ray’s extra features may be enough to persuade consumers to choose its players over DVD ones at these kinds of prices.Watching a Blu-ray movie on Saturday night on a PlayStation 3, I was also able to see extra content updated over the internet. The picture quality is obviously better and services such as Netflix movie and YouTube streaming are becoming common on even the cheapest units.

That will create a new platform of millions of devices for content providers and application developers.Apple has proved that the success of “App Stores” depends on growing a developer community. Yahoo is announcing on Thursday that it is opening up its pioneering Widget platform for the TV.TVs from Sony, LG, Samsung and Vizio have begun integrating its widget programmes over the past year and more than 4,000 developers have requested software development kits.CEA research suggests that 65 per cent of US consumers have not yet linked their TV to the net, only 12 per cent have looked at their digital photos on the bigger screen and 8 per cent have watched content downloaded from the net on their TVs.“Lots of consumers own computers and TVs, but not many of them are combining the two, so this is going to be a really growing area,” says Ben Arnold, CEA senior research analyst.

However, sales of DVDs – Hollywood’s biggest cash generator – are in decline across the entertainment industry.With most consumers buying new DVDs in the first four weeks on release, Warner has negotiated a 28-day delay between the DVDs going on sale and their availability to rent from Netflix. This is likely to boost sales from consumers who might otherwise rent the titles.In return, Warner is making more copies of its titles available to Netflix and will provide more movies for the company’s new streaming service, which allows Netflix customers to stream movies directly to their television sets.Kevin Tsujihara, president of Warner’s home entertainment group, said the deal was “good for the industry”.“It works for Netflix because they’re able to buy more copies and have more availability [of titles],” he said. “From our perspective it gives us a new window for sales and other higher margin transactions.”The deal likely to be followed by negotiations involving other big studios.
994;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
995;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2010-01-06T00:26:43Z;Disney and rivals square up in format war;;Hollywood loves a format war. First VHS saw off Betamax in the great home video battle of the 1980s. More recently, Blu-ray won the right to succeed the DVD when it was preferred by film studios to rival HD-DVD technology.However, as Hollywood looks to the digital era, the industry is split on how to manage the distribution of movies to TVs, computers and hand-held devices, setting the stage for its next great technological tussle.In one corner is Walt Disney and its Keychest product, which it describes as “enabling technology” that allows consumers to buy or rent a film and then view it on any device they choose.In the opposing corner is Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem, a coalition of retailers, hardware makers and film companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Netflix and Sony.Although DECE has taken a slightly different approach to Disney, the two sides essentially have the same goal: to thwart piracy at a time when DVD sales are in decline, and to boost digital sales of movies.Each camp has publicly played down talk of rivalry. “We’re trying to solve two different problems,” says Kelly Summers, vice-president of digital distribution at Walt Disney Studios. “DECE wants to create a new format … Keychest isn’t a format. It’s an enabling technology that helps different platforms communicate with each other.”However, analysts and rival studio executives say the absence of Apple from DECE is a telling indication of the fight that may lie ahead. Apple’s iTunes store is the dominant online retailer, responsible for more than 80 per cent of all film download sales, while Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, is Disney’s biggest individual shareholder.Disney’s decision to go it alone raised eyebrows in Hollywood although the company insists it wanted to move as quickly as possible at a time when digital sales were being held back by online piracy.In a demonstration for the Financial Times, Arnaud Robert, senior vice-president of distribution technology – and the inventor of the Keychest concept – showed how the “rights locker” concept would work: a consumer could buy a movie via an online retailer and then watch it, within seconds, on a mobile phone or television set.Disney is in discussion with online retailers and cable TV companies about adopting Keychest. “We need a critical mass to make this work,” said Ms Summers. “There’s a competitive reason [for these companies] to be part of this because it increases the utility of devices that are already out there.”Keychest uses all existing digital rights management technologies. DECE, by contrast, has approved five different formats and also agreed on a “common file format” which will be used by all of its members.Mitch Singer, president of DECE, told the FT that the absence of Apple from the consortium, which also includes Microsoft, Toshiba, Samsung and Intel, would not hold it back. “The digital market is very young and very small … change is inevitable. I don’t think any one player controls it in a way that’s going to be [relevant] tomorrow.”Opening up online access so that a single copy of a film could be stored remotely and streamed, regardless of the device, would benefit hardware makers, as well as retailers and film studios, he added.Disney and DECE will both be at the Consumer Electronics Show, which starts on Thursday in Las Vegas, where the two approaches will face further scrutiny from possible partners. “The Keychest-DECE battle is going to be the definitive format war for the digital era,” says Arash Amel, senior analyst with Screen Digest, the research firm. “Forget about Blu-ray and DVDs … this is about who controls digital formats of the next 15-20 years.”
996;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-12-22T23:11:34Z;Warner launches video-on-demand in Europe;;Hollywood studios are considering significant changes to the way they make their films available to rent in Europe after Warner Brothers launched a continent-wide video-on-demand (VoD) push.The studio behind the Harry Potter series and recent hits such as Gran Torino has started making its films available to cable television subscribers in the UK, Germany and France on the same day the titles are released on DVD.The studio is keen to promote VoD because it generates better returns than DVD rentals at a time when people are buying fewer DVDs – Hollywood’s cash engine for the past decade.Total consumer spending on DVDs and Blu-ray discs in western Europe is forecast to fall from €9.95bn in 2008 to €9.48bn in 2009, according to Screen Digest, a research group.Warner Bros’ VoD push in Europe – with partners that include Virgin and Deutsche Telekom – follows a US trial. It led the studio and its rivals to make titles available on VoD and DVD at the same time.Other studios, including Sony Pictures Entertainment, which had one of the year’s biggest hits with 2012, are also considering such a move in Europe.Warner Bros is releasing films in South Korea via VoD two weeks before they appear on DVD and is on track to score a record year in the country. It is planning a similar trial in the US.While DVD sales are down in the US, rental revenues are up, thanks to subscription services such as Netflix and kiosk services such as Redbox. Yet VoD generates significantly better returns – about $0.65 per film for the studio versus $0.25 from a DVD rental. Hollywood has shied from releasing movies on other platforms at the same time as the DVD to stem the erosion of revenues. This means there are often lengthy gaps between a film’s cinematic release, its appearance on DVD and its broadcast on pay-TV.Jim Wuthrich, president, international home video and digital distribution at Warner Bros, said simultaneous VoD and DVD release in the US had actually boosted DVD sales in some cases because of the marketing effort of the company’s cable TV partners.Other studios were “leaving money on the table” by not simultaneously releasing VoD and DVDs in Europe, he added.“It’s hard to build a long-term product with just one studio’s productions. We want more studios to come in on it, which would make it easier for cable and satellite companies to offer video-on-demand.”Rival studios are exploring new ways of delivering films to consumers to revive DVD sales.Walt Disney is about to begin offering a code to buyers of its DVDs which will allow them to stream the film to a handheld device or computer – without having to download a copy.
997;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-10-06T19:04:56Z;RIP DVDs;;Heads are rolling at the movie studios. This week NBC Universal pushed out the co-chairmen of its film business after a string of flops. Disney announced a new studio head. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount (owned by Viacom) have removed film executives in recent months. The reshuffles bear worrying similarities to those undertaken by the music labels as they faced decline – promotion from within of industry veterans at a time when fresh thinking is required.Indeed, the problem faced by film makers – declining DVD revenues and uncertainty over what will replace them – has been worsened by the recession. Tight budgets prompt consumers to reassess spending on full-priced discs, a market that has been shrinking since 2005, but prices for rentals (a third of the home entertainment market) are tumbling. All-you-can-watch postal rental services such as Netflix have now been joined in the US by Redbox vending machines – there are now over 15,000 of its kiosks offering movies for $1 per night, typically in supermarket locations where DVDs are also sold.Unfortunately, Bernstein estimates that home video sales represented 57 per cent of the $16bn of gross profits made by film studios in the US last year. A shift away from purchases to rentals threatens to reverse the margin expansion enjoyed for most of the past decade. Yet like the transition to high-definition TV, and the development of online content, the industry response has been inconsistent and short-sighted. Some studios are fighting Redbox while others strike deals. With adoption of DVD’s successor format Blu-Ray still slow, and internet video lacking a viable business model, the demise of DVD may take others with it.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
998;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;Netflix’s Geek Super Bowl;;"This is a guest post from the FT’s media correspondent, Kenneth LiFinding a good movie is generally a hit or miss proposition, Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, explained on Monday.That’s a problem for Mr Hastings, whose billion dollar mail order movies rental business hinges on subscribers being progressively happier about what they watch next or risk dumping the service.Netflix, which discovered early on that movies that were recommended generally pleased customers more than even new releases, spent a decade struggling to take the guesswork out of what to watch next and were unable to boost accuracy by 10 per cent.Mr Hastings turned that challenge — telling customers what they want before they want it –- into a million dollar global challenge. The winners were announced today.
Recommendation engines underpin everything from consumer retail services such as Amazon.com to the “people you may know feature” on social networks such as Facebook and MySpace.Three years ago, inspired by the British government’s 18th century challenge to solve a “vexing and dangerous aspects of transoceanic travel” in accurately plotting a ship’s longitude, Mr Hastings launched a million dollar challenge to see if smarter people from the world of engineering and computer science scientists could do better. (The movie Longitude is available on Netflix, Neil Hunt, chief product officer, cheerfully volunteered.)“We’re trying to move it where nearly every movie you watch you love,” Mr Hastings told us shortly after announcing the winners of what has turned into the Super Bowl of the geeks.Some 40,000 teams in 186 countries submitted solutions since 2006. Netflix provided 100m anonymous movie ratings with personal information stripped from the data set.The winners, BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos, was formed from the merging of three teams from Austria, Canada, Israel and the United States that combined their work to seal the prize. Sitting on stage in New York to accept the million dollar cheque was the first time they ever met.Like the movies, this battle has a sequel. Netflix announced a second million dollar challenge on Tuesday. The latest contest challenges researchers to come up with a better service by sifting through more granular data including subscriber age, gender, zip code, but from a pool of customers who rarely submit ratings. The information will be provided anonymously and untraceable to actual customers."
999;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-09-02T23:26:17Z;YouTube in talks to offer film rentals;;YouTube is in talks with leading movie studios about introducing a rental service for films that would be streamed from its site, according to people close to the negotiations.The move would put Google, YouTube’s owner, in direct competition with a host of other companies providing movies online, including Amazon, Apple, Blockbuster, Hulu, Netflix, Microsoft, through its Xbox console, and Sony, through the PlayStation 3.Rental fees could provide the lossmaking unit, which at present relies on advertising, with an important new revenue stream.YouTube is in discussions with Lions Gate Entertainment, Sony Pictures and Warner Brothers about introducing some of their new titles to the site, according to those close to the talks, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal website.Full-length movies can already be found on YouTube but tend to be older back-catalogue offerings.The pricing structure being discussed is understood to be on the same lines as renting a film on iTunes, although Apple’s service consists of a download rather than streaming of the movie. It charges about $3.99 a movie.Chris Dale, a YouTube spokesman, said the company did not comment on rumour or speculation, but added: “We hope to expand on both our great relationship with movie studios and on the selection and types of videos we offer our community.”Sony and Warner Brothers declined to comment while Lions Gate did not return calls on Wednesday.Google last month took steps to improve YouTube’s ability to provide video with the acquisition of On2, a company that makes sophisticated video compression technology, for $106.5m.YouTube mainly offers short-form videos uploaded by users, which are often subject to “caching” delays. The movie studios are likely to have concerns about the site’s ability to provide long-form movie content in acceptable quality without interruptions, although it does now offer high-definition video.Google’s previous effort at a video service which charged for downloads and rentals was closed.Google executives said in July that YouTube was finally on track to turn a profit after heavy losses since its acquisition for $1.65bn in October 2006.The turnround is being driven by revenues from banner adverts on the home page and “pre-rolls” that oblige visitors to watch an advert before a video.“We’ve been doing the business reviews and something fundamental has changed,” said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times. “That is new, even compared to three months ago.”Hulu, owned by News Corp, Walt Disney and NBC Universal, has led the way in attracting high-quality video content online – streaming full-length television shows and older movies. Google has been trying to extend YouTube’s appeal for some time beyond user-generated videos.

1001;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-06-29T20:45:40Z;Wall Street rally boosted by upgrades;;US equities rallied on Monday as upgrades in the consumer sector and improving energy stocks helped lift stocks after an early droop.Homebuilders were especially strong after Credit Suisse upgraded shares in KB Home, citing a rebound in orders, KB’s shares climbed 5.1 per cent to $14.11 and its rivals also saw some upside. Lennar gained 5.8 per cent to $9.71 and Pulte Homes rose 2.4 per cent to $8.97.Meanwhile retailers also did well, with JC Penney standing out after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company’s shares, saying it is the most likely department store to outperform margin expectations with its second-quarter results.Shares in the retailer rose 1.8 per cent to $28.89.Consumer stocks were joined by the energy sector in providing support as the price of oil rose back above $71 per barrel. Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.88 and ExxonMobil rose 2.2 per cent to $70.58.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Teppco rose 5 per cent to $30.12 after Enterprise Partners said it would buy the pipeline company for $3.3bn, equivalent to $31.36 per share.The S&P finished 0.9 per cent up at 927.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,529.38 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,844.06.Volumes were low, however, and the markets were more sensitive to the relatively few trades.“Volumes are light ahead of the extended weekend, and many investors are watching out for the unemployment numbers out later this week” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.The reversal came after early weakness from healthcare stocks, led by Biogen Idec, which ended lower after it said a 10th patient had developed a potentially deadly brain disease after taking its multiple sclerosis drug. The shares lost 5.5 per cent to $47.23.There were some positive signs for banks, which reports suggest have made strong profits this quarter on the back of booming equity and debt issuance.Morgan Stanley rose 1.7 per cent to $29.10 and Goldman Sachs picked up 1.8 per cent to $149.36, with just one more session until the end of the quarter.Sentiment was also boosted by words from Christina Romer, chairman of the president’s council of economic advisers.She told the Financial Times the US economy would feel a substantial boost from the Obama administration’s emergency spending package over the next few months.These rises came in spite of negative economic data from two regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Chicago Fed said US economic activity remained at very low levels in May, while the Dallas Fed said manufacturing activity in that area has fallen more than expected during June.“Many of the data points recently have been mixed,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “But after the S&P hit 890, investors started to put in some of the cash they’ve been sitting on.”Alcoa, the aluminium maker, underperformed other materials stocks after analysts at FBR said the aluminium market was over-supplied, and downgraded the company’s shares. The stock lost 3 per cent to $10.44.Technology stocks made gains, with Microsoft picking up 2.2 per cent to $23.86 on news that the company is looking for a buyer for Razorfish, its digital agency, which one analyst valued at up to $700m.Investors also seemed reassured about the status of Oracle‘s deal to buy Sun Microsystems, even though the US Justice Department has asked Sun for more details about its flagship Java software before approving the takeover.A lawyer for Oracle said last week he does not expect the deal to be delayed, and shares in Sun rose 1.9 per cent to $9.18 on Monday, while Oracle gained 1.2 per cent to $21.50.Meanwhile the annual rebalancing of the Russell indices created some turbulence, with companies that moved up from the small- to mid-sized 2000 index to the large-cap 1000 index faring particularly well.Netflix, the online dvd rental company, gained 2.1 per cent to $41.20 while Interactive Brokers rose 1.6 per cent to $15.49.
1002;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T06:41:18+0000;Lovefilm focuses on buy-out talks;;Lovefilm, the DVD mail-order rental company, is in talks with private equity firms including KKR and Silver Lake Partners about buying out existing shareholders and providing support for expansion, people with direct knowledge of its strategy said on Sunday.The talks, which are understood to centre on a valuation of the privately-held company at about £200m ($328m) are being co-ordinated by Jefferies, the investment bank.Lovefilm’s investors include Amazon, which took a 32 per cent stake when it sold its DVD rental business to Lovefilm last year. The management owns 7 per cent.Four venture capital firms, Arts Alliance Media, Index Ventures, Balderton Capital and DFJ Esprit are on the shareholder register, and some were said to be seeking an exit.Discussions are focusing on new investors acquiring a majority stake rather than a full buy-out of existing shareholders, the people involved in the process told the Financial Times.Lovefilm accounts for more than half of all the DVDs that are rented in the UK, but has only 4 per cent of households as subscribers.It now wants to grow and the board believes that it can achieve double-digit percentage point subscriber levels for households in the UK as well as expanding in Germany and Scandinavia.US private equity firms are interested in Lovefilm because of the success of Netflix, a similar company across the Atlantic, one of the people close to Lovefilm’s board told the FT.
1003;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-04-24T21:17:39Z;Ford jumps after posting narrow loss;;"Wall Street stocks rallied on Friday following good earnings news, but the benchmark S&P 500 index finished the week lower for the first week in seven.A late rally added to early gains made after the embattled carmaker Ford announced a surprisingly narrow loss and a slower rate of cash consumption than during the previous quarter. With the company having recently been added to Goldman Sachs’ “conviction buy” list, the shares jumped 11.4 per cent to $5.Equities initially dived after the government released the parameters of its stress tests on banks’ capital positions, with some analysts saying they wanted to see more detail on how much capital banks would be required to hold.But many investors were reassured by the fact the parameters seemed to match those set by Citigroup in what the bank said was an “internal stress test” and shares quickly rallied.“Citi said it would pass those parameters weeks ago, and they are considered to be one of the worst of the worst,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 1.7 per cent higher at 866.23 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.5 per cent up at 8,076.29. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 2.6 per cent to 1,694.29.The S&P finished 0.4 per cent lower for the week, while the Dow lost 0.7 per cent. The Nasdaq made a weekly gain of 1.3 per cent, however – the first time it has completed seven straight weeks of gains since 2005.The week started on a negative note as earnings from Bank of America triggered fears over increasing loan losses at financial companies on Monday and the market saw its biggest one-day fall since the rally began.A series of better earnings announcements after that helped restore confidence, but equities remained within a range without moving decisively either way.American Expresswas the latest major financial company to report its results. Its earnings beat expectations, which helped the shares leap 20.7 per cent to $25.30 yesterday morning.Elsewhere in the sector, Prudential rose after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company from a “sell” to a “buy”. Goldman said the sector could find cheap capital from the government. Prudential’s shares gained 10.8 per cent to $28.33.Goldman also increased its price target on MetLife, which rose 3.7 per cent to $29.25.Microsoft also rose after reporting results that were marginally ahead of consensus expectations. Its shares advanced 10.5 per cent to $20.91 having been given a further boost by Goldman Sachs, which upgraded the company to “overweight”, saying it was “ahead of plan on cost controls”.Amazon, the online re-tailer, rose after sales of its Kindle electronic book reader helped revenues rise 18 per cent, defying the consumer downturn. Its shares gained 4.8 per cent to $84.46.The sector was hampered, however, by Netflix. The online DVD rental company reported strong profits as customers continued to use the service as an inexpensive form of entertainment.But the shares lost 5.7 per cent to $42.73 as it warned about increasing competition from DVD rental kiosks.Figures showing orders for durable goods fell less than expected during March and helped the materials sector perform better than any other on the S&P. This also helped industrial stocks in spite of poor results.3M, the industrial company, reported disappointing earnings and revised its full-year profit forecasts downwards. But its shares still gained 5.2 per cent to
$57 as positive sentiment dominated the sector.But some analysts warned the market may be reacting too positively to the economic data.“Leading indicators like initial jobless claims continue to get worse,” said Doug Roberts. “Investors are reacting to what they want to see, not what is actually out there.”"
1004;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-03-04T02:23:40Z;Blockbuster in battle to secure new financing;;Blockbuster, the film rental chain, said on Tuesday that it was working to replace expiring credit facilities but did not plan to file for bankruptcy, in spite of hiring a law firm to aid in its restructuring effort.“We have hired Kirkland & Ellis for assistance with our ongoing financing and capital raising initiatives,” said Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen Raskopf. “We do not intend to file for bankruptcy.”A lack of available credit has pushed many well-known companies into treacherous territory in recent months, as they struggle to secure new financing or convince lenders to waive debt covenants that could trigger a default.Blockbuster, which owns more than 7,600 stores worldwide, has a $28m term loan and a revolving credit facility that are due in August. It aims to put another bank credit facility in place this year, but has said that if necessary, it could fund its own business through 2009. Ms Raskopf said Blockbuster would update investors on the progress of its debt restructuring efforts during its March 19 earnings call. “We have a revolver that’s maturing, but this company generates a lot of cash,” she said.Blockbuster, owned by media conglomerate Viacom prior to its complex spin-off in 2004, narrowly avoided filing for bankruptcy in 2005 and 2006 as it struggled against cut-throat competition in DVD sales from diverse retailers including Wal-Mart and in DVD rentals from NetFlix, the online film rental group.The company obtained waivers on its bank loans, shut stores and laid off workers to focus on improving profitability.Movie Gallery, one of Dallas-based Blockbuster’s competitors, filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2007 after acquiring rival Hollywood Entertainment in 2005.Thomas Casey, Blockbuster’s chief financial officer, said in a November earnings call that if the company needed to self-fund through the end of the year, it could put some strategies on hold and maximise cash flow by adjusting retail inventories or postponing store remodelling projects.The value of the company’s shares sank 77 per cent on Tuesday to just 22 cents, before the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in them over reports that the company was considering bankruptcy. Shares of NetFlix, which has taken a substantial amount of Blockbuster’s market share, rose nearly 6 per cent.
1005;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-03-03T23:53:03Z;Not another VODdy TV service!?;;Amazon has found itself another route to the television and Roku another use for its set-top box under a partnership announced today.The internet retailer has been exploring ways to widen access to its Video on Demand service beyond the computer and has already made it available through Tivo digital video recorders and Sony Bravia TVs.Roku, based in Silicon Valley, partnered with Netflix last May with its $99 box, allowing the DVD rental service to stream movies direct to televisions.Now it has increased the appeal of the box by adding Amazon’s service.“It’s a great complement to Netflix. It will be the first time that our customers can get access to new-release movies the day they come out on DVD,” said Tim Twerdahl, head of consumer products at Roku.Netflix’s free streaming service mainly relies on back-catalogue DVD releases, while Amazon rents or sells digital copies of the latest releases and TV shows as soon as they are broadcast.Roku’s business model is to make money purely from hardware sales and Mr Twerdahl said sales of the units were now well into the six figures. The sales channel had been confined to Roku’s website but the boxes will now be available through Amazon.com as well.The internet-connected boxes will be seamlessly upgraded over the next few days with the added Amazon interface. Unlike the Netflix service, where users have to use a computer’s web browser to select and order a playlist of movies, the Amazon interface allows users to interact with the Roku box to choose from the service’s 40,000 movie and TV titles.“Initially, our service was mainly available on the PC, but we’ve seen over the past year, and particularly at [the Consumer Electronics Show in January] that connecting to TVs is really opening up the video-on-demand market,” said Roy Price, director of Amazon Video On Demand.The new partnership adds to a dizzying array of choices for consumers in receiving content on demand. Cable and satellite operator’s services in the US are facing competition from movies and TV shows available through the Xbox and PlayStation games consoles and a variety of boxed services from Roku’s to Blockbuster’s MediaPoint, Vudu and Verismo.
1006;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2009-02-19T20:14:21Z;And the loser is ...;;"When a tuxedo-clad Hugh Jackman strolls on to the stage of the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday evening, the Australian host of the 81st Academy Awards will be working harder than his predecessors. In a departure from the Oscars’ usual format, the X-Men star will perform song and dance routines with celebrity guests beneath an arced curtain of Swarovski crystals.Behind the glitz and glamour of Hollywood’s big night, the executives who run the entertainment industry – worried for reasons that go beyond whether their films pick up a statuette or two – are also having to put in some extra effort. They are battling twin forces that look every bit as powerful as Jackman’s mutant Wolverine.Time Warner, News Corporation, Walt Disney and the other media conglomerates have been hit hard by the global economic downturn in recent months. Perhaps more disturbingly for their longer-term prospects, the studios have also begun to witness the slow death of one of their most profitable revenue streams – DVDs. Unfortunately for them, there seems little that they can do to reverse its decline.The DVD is the unsung hero of Hollywood. When it launched 11 years ago there was widespread scepticism about whether consumers would replace their video collections with a new format. But it quickly took off, propelled by special effects-laden titles such as The Matrix. Five years after they were unleashed on the market, DVD rentals and sales were worth more than $10bn (£7bn, €7.9bn) a year to the industry.The DVD was cheaper and easier to produce than a video cassette and generated significantly better profit margins for the studios. Its rocketing success and the easy availability of cheap financing from Wall Street fuelled an industry boom and changed the economics of film. With international distribution pipelines to serve and consumers building vast DVD libraries, studios were able to ramp up their production slates knowing that most titles would make money – even if they were panned by critics or performed poorly at the box office.But a decade of DVD growth appears to be over. Sales of new, high-margin titles fell more than 20 per cent in the last quarter of 2008, according to Nielsen, the industry monitor. Figures compiled by Digital Entertainment Group show that shipments to retailers in the US and Canada fell 32 per cent in the same period – the biggest decline recorded since the birth of the format.Blu-ray, the format identified by Hollywood as the successor to the DVD, has grown in popularity but is not close to making up the ground left by the decline of its predecessor: consumers spent $750m on Blu-ray discs in 2008 compared with $21.6bn on DVDs. The Dark Knight is the best-selling Blu-ray title, with about 2m copies, but sales of other titles are being held back because too few Blu-ray players have been sold. “People don’t have the money to buy players and they’re not looking to spend as much on building a Blu-ray library,” says Wade Holden, an analyst with SNL Kagan, which tracks studios’ finances.This is a horror movie for Hollywood, which depends on income from DVDs. When deciding how much to spend on a film, a studio will use an “ultimate” – a calculation based on the earnings potential over its lifetime at the box office, on DVD and its eventual screening on television. The contribution from DVD has typically represented more than half of the profits generated by a film. But the slide in demand for the format is forcing studio executives to overhaul financial projections. “The deterioration in the performance of new release [DVD] titles will likely force a re-evaluation of film ultimates, which may lead to write-downs as estimated DVD sales don’t materialise,” wrote Michael Nathanson of Bernstein Research in a recent note. The ailing DVD market would have “negative near-term implications on media conglomerate earnings”.Time Warner, which owns Warner Brothers Entertainment; Viacom, owner of Paramount Pictures; News Corp, which owns 20th Century Fox; and Walt Disney are already feeling the effects of the slowdown. The recent quarterly earnings of all four companies were marred by the retreat in DVD sales: not even the storming box-office performance of Warner’s The Dark Knight could prevent filmed entertainment revenues from falling at Time Warner.But while the first three made only passing reference to the DVD decline, blaming it on weaker economic conditions, Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, has warned that the bedrock of media earnings has shifted. “We believe that it’s likely that there are secular things going on here that are not related to the economy,” he told the FT recently.There is plenty of evidence to support this argument: most people who have a DVD player also have shelves groaning under the weight of old DVDs and are unwilling to buy more. Meanwhile, video games, online video and social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are all vying for the attention of consumers. “There’s more competition for people’s time and it’s extraordinary how that has increased,” said Mr Iger. With such a significant revenue stream in decline, he suggested Hollywood needed to take a close look at its expenditure. “It is imperative for us to manage our expenses more carefully and create value for the consumer.”He has advocated trimming the extras that accompany a film on a disc and reducing costs in production, distribution and marketing. No one else in Hollywood has taken such a public position on what is, in the entertainment industry at least, a sensitive subject. But in six months, if DVD sales continue to fall, there more in Hollywood will agree with Mr Iger.Others in the industry argue that the economy on its own explains the DVD sales downturn. Jim Gianopulos, who heads Fox Filmed Entertainment, News Corp’s film division, says the decline accelerated in October, just after the banking crisis reached fever pitch. “It was a moment in time when people were putting their cards into the ATM machine and not knowing if any money would come out. They were not buying anything at that time, never mind DVDs.”He also says the performance of “genre” films, which appeal to particular audiences, has held up on DVD. He points to two Fox releases – Max Payne and Babylon AD – released recently on DVD. Both were oriented towards young males and had performed in the mid-range at the box office. “The conversion rate of DVD sales from box office was consistent with past experience,” Mr Gianopulos adds.Richard Greenfield at Pali Research also regards it as premature to say the DVD is in long-term decline. “The extreme change is clearly the economy. Consumers are crushed …and the DVD business was simply not positioned to weather an economic meltdown like the world is experiencing.”But whether the DVD is doomed or poised to stage a stirring comeback before Blu-ray takes over, Hollywood has a problem it cannot afford to ignore. Analysts say the severe fall in home entertainment revenues will continue throughout 2009. Also, thanks to the credit crunch, there is less third-party money available for studios to offset the risk of film productions. So the companies have a choice: put the cost of more productions on to their own balance sheets, or make fewer films and cut costs.Most have opted for the latter route. Time Warner merged its New Line Cinema label with Warner Bros Entertainment last year and recently closed two niche labels that specialise in edgier films – Warner Independent Pictures and Picturehouse. The company also cut the number of films it releases from a peak of about 40 a year to 25 in 2008.With rivals such as Viacom’s Paramount Pictures also releasing fewer films, the industry appears to be contracting. Arthur Sarkissian, producer of the Rush Hour trilogy, says a shake-up will be good for Hollywood. “Studios have spent the last few years green-lighting everything …They weren’t paying attention to the script, the characters or the story.” This led to a decline in quality that “has hurt the industry more than anything”.The DVD decline is having other repercussions. The pay of film stars is being curtailed by studios desperate to cut expenditure. Gone are the days of the so-called “first-dollar gross”, which entitled the star to a percentage of a film’s revenues before the studio has made its money back. “They’re really clamping down on talent pay and they’re not making as many movies,” says one Hollywood agent.Such concerns will be set aside for Sunday night, when the stars begin their walk down the red carpet at the Kodak Theatre. A night of tension and tearful speeches awaits. But when eyes have dried and all have gone home, the studios will still have a problem that all the Oscar statues in the world will be unable to solve.BLU-RAY: DVDs PROVE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOWThe birth of home video in the early 1980s transformed the economics of filmmaking. Its success and that of DVD, the format that followed, turbo-charged studio income and extended the lifespan and earning potential of film franchises. But with DVD apparently on the wane it is unclear whether Blu-ray, the format identified by the studios to succeed it, is ready to pick up the slack.Warner Bros Entertainment has the biggest film library in Hollywood and the largest share of the Blu-ray market. But, as at rival studios, home entertainment revenues are down on last year because of the decline in DVD sales.The group hopes Blu-ray will help restore growth at its packaged goods business by 2010. But Kevin Tsujihara, head of its home entertainment unit, says the economic slump and the slowdown in consumer spending might make achieving that difficult. “Blu-ray had a really good quarter but, depending on how bad the economy gets, it’s tough to predict [whether the target will be met].”Nevertheless, the studio is upbeat about the prospects for home entertainment. “Even if the consumer dollars aren’t growing we can improve profits in different ways,” Mr Tsujihara adds. “Margins are greatly improved with Blu-ray and digital distribution.” The studio has also invested in video games and has been cheered by the resilience of the sector, with sales up 18 per cent despite the tough economy.Blu-ray may be a long way from supplanting DVDs but there is no doubting Hollywood’s enthusiasm for it. “Audiences will always seek out films on new formats – provided those films are of high quality,” says Arthur Sarkissian, producer of the Rush Hour trilogy."

1008;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-12-09T18:29:30Z;Clerk Dogs fetch movie matches;;As a fan of film, I would have loved to have visited a certain video rental store in Manhattan Beach, California in the mid 80s.It was there that the director Quentin Tarantino started out, as a video clerk discussing and recommending movies to film buffs all day.It’s not quite the same, but San Francisco-based Clerk Dogs, a people-powered movie recommendation service launching today, is trying to recreate this personal service online.Type in the name of a film you love and Clerk Dogs will recommend a list of movies you should also like.So Reservoir Dogs produces the highlighted suggestion Pulp Fiction, and also similar movies such as The Departed and Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.If users don’t find the suggestions helpful, they can “mash” their own list, adjusting sliders for characteristics such as black humour, violence and character depth.Netflix, the online DVD rental service, has a similar recommendation service, which is machine-powered and refined by its users as they award stars to movies they have ordered and viewed.However, its Cinematch system is imperfect enough for Netflix to have offered a $1m prize to programmers who can increase its performance by 10 per cent.Clerk Dogs would not qualify as its database engine is supplemented by 22 site writers, most of them former video clerks.Their analysis of films makes the service more comparable to Pandora, the human-powered music recommendation service.Clerk Dogs’ founder is 60-year-old Stuart Skorman, who opened his own video rental store in the mid 80s. He founded the Reel.com online video store ten years later and sold it for $100m in 1998.His film classification experts, including five writers from Reel.com he reunited in 2006, are steadily working their way through the movie libraries. Crime and suspense are done, with other genres due to be added in the near future.
1009;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-11-25T22:55:21Z;Blockbuster v Netflix in box bout;;A battle of the boxes began today between Blockbuster and Netflix, the principal online DVD rental services in the US.Blockbuster announced its MediaPoint digital media player to serve movies to TVs over the internet. Its response to Netflix’s Roku box, launched six months ago, differs in some important respects.The Netflix box costs $99 and allows monthly subscribers to its postal service to stream the content of more than 10,000 DVDs to their televisions at no extra charge. The same capability is being built into certain high-end DVD players and the Netflix service also launched last week as part of the new interface for the Xbox 360.The MediaPoint player, made by San Jose’s 2Wire, is being offered free to Blockbuster subscribers willing to pre-pay $99 for the first 25 DVDs served on it. DVDs rented after the 25 are used up will cost $1.99 to $3.99, but there is no monthly subscription fee.The player has a more sophisticated interface – users can search through Blockbuster’s library to choose what they want to watch, while the Netflix system requires queues of movies to be set up on a computer.The boxes have similar capabilities, but the MediaPoint is prettier and has a USB connection, currently disabled, for external storage. Crucially, it also has internal storage for up to five standard definition movies or two high-definition ones at a time. The Roku box has no storage capability.Blockbuster movies have to be watched within 24 hours once started, while Netflix allows its selection of movies, mainly older titles, to be watched and watched again over any length of time for free.While Netflix streams its movies, making quality dependent on the robustness of the broadband connection – flakey at times, in my own experience – Blockbuster does “progressive playback”, which means the movie is downloaded to the device and can be started and played in consistently good quality while the data is still being downloaded.Blockbuster says it is offering 2,500 “of the best, biggest and most current movies available” – so a smaller choice than Netflix but more recent material, with new DVDs available on the service within 30 days of release.Blockbuster may have come out six months later with this device, but it is arriving in time for the big holiday buying season. It should appeal to those who want a quality picture but have a less than stellar broadband connection and who also prefer to pay one-at-a-time for recent releases rather than choose from a larger back catalogue of free (monthly postal subscription apart) movies and TV shows.Netflix should be concerned…although, it already has to worry about a plethora of competitors vying for space under the TV such as Tivo, Vudu and Verismo.
1010;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:09:18+0000;NXE upgrade brings Netflix to the Xbox 360;;I am not a big video gamer, but one of the new features that will be introduced on November 19 by Microsoft’s Xbox team as part of a user interface redesign dubbed the ‘New Xbox Experience’ (NXE) could help bolster the consol’s claim to a place in the living room.The software upgrade, which the Xbox team has been working on for the past nine months and which will be automatically downloaded like any other system update, will bring streaming Netflix movies to the Xbox 360 instantly transforming the device from ‘simply’ a games machine into a new distribution platform for the movies-by-mail pioneer.That means Xbox Live members will have instant access to the Netflix catalogue of more that 12,000 movie and TV shows. Once selected, movies begin playing in about 30 seconds and Xbox Live members can browse and rate movies, fast-forward, pause and rewind using either an Xbox 360 controller or universal remote.Other enhancements included in the NXE overhaul include a new and much more modern looking UI which replaces the rather tired looking blade interface, a cleaner, more intuitive Marketplace channel where users can buy games-related items and the ability to set up virtual parties involving up to eight participants who can play a game together or share content like photos.I am much less enthusiastic about another new feature – the ability to create a personal avatar – but then I was never a big Second Life enthusiast either.
1011;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-09-16T17:58:23Z;A new way to get people to pay;;Alex Rampell sits with a Starbucks coffee in front of him and ponders the strange contradictions in what people are willing to pay for, and what they are not. “Here I am prepared to spend $3.50 on a cup of coffee. But somehow, I don’t want to pay 99 cents for a music download…People don’t like paying for digital products.”Mr Rampell, a 27-year-old entrepreneur, has built a business on this insight. He co-founded his company, TrialPay, two years ago on the suspicion that customers who do not want to pay for a product such as software might still be prepared to pay for something else – and get the software for free.WinZip, for example, currently asks customers to pay $29.95 at its online store to download one of its file readers. But those who balk at paying can get the software for free by using TrialPay’s system to opt for over 150 alternative transactions from a range of companies. They might, for instance, spend $50 on clothes at Gap.com, or sign up for an American Express credit card.The successful advertiser then pays WinZip a fee for delivering a new customer, while TrialPay receives a small payment for its intermediary role along the way.Since 2006, more than 6,000 merchants have used TrialPay’s online customer acquisition system and more than 10m people have made purchases through the system, up from 5m at the start of this year.In February, the company secured $12.7m in second-round funding from Index Ventures and other investors, after raising $3.1m last year from a group led by Battery Ventures, with angel investors Bob Pittman, a former AOL executive, and Ron Conway, an early investor in Google and PayPal.The idea for TrialPay originated from Mr Rampell’s own experiences as a software retailer, which began at an alarmingly early age. In 1991, when he was just 10 years old, he launched a screensaver product into the world of shareware (software that is freely available on the web, with suggested payments made to the originator under an honour code).“I uploaded it to CompuServe and AOL and I got a cheque in the mail a few days later for $5. I thought this was the best thing ever. And I kept doing that throughout high school and college,” he says.His big early success came when he created his “Always Online” shareware in 1996 – a program that allowed frustrated AOL subscribers to acquire and hold on to overloaded dial-in lines. He created the product for his own use in about four hours, but then decided to sell it initially for $8 a copy.“It sold about 100,000 copies in a very short period of time. I was only 15,” he says. “Then AOL banned the product, and that was great for me. It was, like, big bad AOL is going after this little kid.”Since he was still at boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, the need to attend a summer school programme forced Mr Rampell to subcontract handling of the payments. He also used the business as the basis for a school essay on price elasticity. At Harvard, aged 19, he was featured in a New York Times article on dorm-room internet business operators.After leaving college in 2003, Mr Rampell continued his software business, now called Rampell Software and employing several college friends. Its main products were a site-security application called SiteAdvisor and SureType, a keyboard shortcuts product.However, as the internet boomed the shareware market began to stagnate, since fewer and fewer users were willing to make the voluntary payments. “A lot of people don’t like paying for digital goods, and I found this out first-hand,” Mr Rampell says. “The question is how do you convert that 99.7 per cent who try but don’t buy, or browse but don’t buy? That’s where the initial concept of TrialPay came from.”Rampell Software formed its first relationship with NetFlix, the online DVD-rental service, offering customers SiteAdvisor for free if they signed up with NetFlix, and making his money from NetFlix rather than his customer. Other deals followed.“We made a lot more money on a unit basis by referring our customers to third-party, blue-chip advertisers like Discover, and Experian, Gap and NetFlix than we did from selling our products directly,” he says.The experience convinced him that the future of his business lay in the system, rather than the site software. Mr Rampell sold Site-Advisor to McAfee in 2006, and SureType to Research in Motion, which now uses it in its BlackBerry mobile devices.TrialPay’s range of products is now extending into other “transactional advertising” such as online coupons, or cross-selling discount offers. These can include offers of special discounts at other retailers if a customer spends above a target amount, or offers of deals at other retailers if he or she spends anything at all.Its latest development is a series of time-limited offers from other online merchants after the conclusion of a purchase. It is partly a recognition of the fact that, while TrialPay’s “pay in lieu” solution works well with lower-cost products, it is harder to find someone prepared to cover the costs of giving away bigger-ticket items, such as television sets.“If you think about transactional advertising, it works for pretty much anything,” he says. “Say you are buying software. You have entered you credit card details so we know where you live. Do you want a $10 coupon off the restaurant downstairs?”Mr Rampell argues that TrialPay is driving inefficiencies out of the web to the benefit of the consumer. He says his service is a way of turning some of the money that a retailer is willing to pay to acquire a customer into savings for that customer – unlike paid search, where the money goes to the search engine company.“The whole idea of customer acquisition right now doesn’t benefit anyone – except maybe Google,” he says.“It should benefit the customer if you can come up for a better way to acquire him or her.”He warmly cites the example of Amazon, which boosts the value of transactions by promoting cross-selling between categories and offering free delivery to those who spend more than $25. Mr Rampell argues that TrialPay can do the same, with products such as post-transaction coupons and a multitude of cross-selling opportunities between smaller online retailers.“There are hundreds of thousands of small sellers out there…What we’re trying to do is turn anybody into Amazon.”
1012;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-07-14T22:39:55Z;Microsoft remodels the Xbox experience;;The next-generation games console war turned into a social networking battle on Monday as Microsoft unveiled a new interface for the Xbox 360.On the eve of the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles, Microsoft showed off a Windows Vista-style 3D interface and said players could create their own character or avatar for the console.The avatars demonstrated by Microsoft appeared more sophisticated than the popular Wii Miis of Nintendo’s console but less ambitious than the characters possible in the much delayed Home virtual world planned for Sony’s PlayStation3.Google, Microsoft’s internet rival also launched lively.com last week, a service that allows its users to create avatars and rooms in its first venture in combining virtual worlds with social networking.Both Microsoft and Sony will use avatars to make online gameplay and socialising more appealing on their consoles as they move into the next phase of development of their consoles.“It used to be that you had to launch hardware to bring new experiences to users, what we’re going to prove is that software can actually change the experience overnight,” said David Hufford, a senior director at Xbox, in a Financial Times interview.The new look for the Xbox and avatars will be made possible by a software update, available as a free download in the autumn.Mr Hufford claimed Xbox’s approach would have wider appeal than Sony’s Home: “Home is only for the hard core frankly, we think we’re taking a much fresher approach, offering much more social experiences,” he said.At its press conference, Microsoft stressed the increasing revenues being generated from its Xbox Live online service. It announced that consumers had now spent more than $1bn on Xbox Live since the launch of the 360 and 500m items of content had been downloaded.New content deals were unveiled including the availability of TV shows from NBC Universal and the Sci-Fi channel domestically and movies from the Constantin and MGM studios overseas.Microsoft also announced it would make available the streaming movie service of Netflix, the DVD rental company.Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, said this would be a third outlet for the service – it is already available through a dedicated set-top box supplied by Roku and LG will incorporate it into some of its consumer electronics products. “It’s a big step forward for us in terms of the installed base,” Mr Hastings said in an FT interview.
1013;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-05-20T22:16:50Z;Netflix and Roku stream ahead with online movies;;Netflix has taken a second step towards weaning its customers off the red-envelope delivery of their DVDs with its introduction of the Netflix Player by Roku.The first step was its “instant watching” capability over a PC introduced in January last year. Subscribers could watch an hour’s worth of online video for every dollar they paid in their monthly subscription for at-home DVDs.This January, instant watching became unlimited, with access to 6,000 movies and TV shows.With the launch of the Roku set-top box today, the equivalent of around 10,000 DVDs are now available online for no extra charge and can be delivered direct to the TV.It seems like a great deal for the one-time $100 cost of the box, although analysts are adamant that Netflix will have to introduce charges at some point for internet-delivered movies.That would depend on how fast its customers migrate to the new form of delivery. It is a pace Netflix needs to see quicken to combat the threat from cable, telcos and the likes of Apple, who can achieve greater efficiencies and undercut it through digital delivery.Netflix currently ships around 2m DVDs a day to its 8m members using 50 distribution centres around the US.A delicate balancing act is required to prevent its revenues being cannibalised. As a Netflix subscriber, I could cut my three-dvds-at-a-time $16.99 monthly plan to one-at-a-time at $8.99 and still be able to watch as many movies as I wanted through the box.Netflix discourages this by limiting choice – 10,000 is only around 10 per cent of its total library of more than 100,000 titles and most newly-released DVDs are not available through the box.Netflix is slowly easing up on those limits to make online delivery more appealing and encourage a gradual switch – a few more recent movies are now being added such as The Orphanage, La Vie En Rose and Before The Devil Knows You’re Dead to the online list.The other flaw in Netflix’s offering is the lack of high-definition. Its DVD rental service suffers similar problems with Blu-ray movie requests usually listed as “long wait”. The Roku box is HD-ready though for when Netflix is ready to upgrade and match some of its competitors.That could come soon, with Netflix-enabled players expected from LG and other manufacturers in the second half of the year.
1014;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-05-20T19:55:46Z;Netflix launches $100 set-top box;;Netflix, the online movie rental service, has joined the fiercely contested battle to stream media directly to tele­visions, with the introduction of a $100 set-top box.Netflix’s box will compete with Apple TV and start-ups such as Vudu and Sezmi.Streaming abilities in the latest game consoles and the Tivo digital video recorder, along with video-on-demand offerings from cable and telecoms companies, have given US consumers more direct ways of accessing movies than the red-envelope postal deliveries of Netflix’s DVDs.Blockbuster, its biggest rival, is also reported to be about to announce set-top box services, increasing the pressure on Netflix to win market share in the streaming of content or face being marginalised.The Silicon Valley company said its Netflix Player was being made by its near neighbour Roku, best known for its wireless internet radio devices.The paperback-book-sized box is available immediately and can be connected to a TV using standard cables including high-definition HDMI, although movies will initially be delivered in standard definition. It lacks a hard drive for storage but the company says content will be streamed over a wired or wireless internet connection and be ready to play in as little as 30 seconds.Netflix already offers a service where members can watch movies instantly on their PC over the internet. More than 8,000 movies and TV episodes are available at no extra charge to members’ monthly subscription.Analysts speculated recently that Netflix would have to begin charging for the service soon, but the company said yesterday 10,000 movies and episodes would be freely available with the new device under existing subscriptions.Netflix says it is working with makers of TVs, Blu-ray DVD players and game consoles to enable streaming of its content to their devices.At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January, Netflix announced a deal with LG, the South Korean consumer electronics company, to include Netflix in some of its products in the second half of this year.At the time, chief executive Reed Hastings predicted Netflix would eventually be viewed as a movie channel that could be integrated with any internet-connected device.Netflix shares rose to $34.35 at one point on Tuesday on the news, closing at $31.63 or 2 per cent up .
1015;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:58+0000;Cash for answers;;"In 1737, John Harrison, a self-taught clockmaker from Yorkshire, stunned London’s scientific establishment by presenting an idiosyncratic solution to the most important and notorious technological problem of the 18th century. He was hoping to win a then-fabulous prize of £20,000 (about £5m today) for anyone who could devise a way for a ship’s navigator to determine its longitude and therefore its position at sea. Harrison’s approach was to build a clock that would keep Greenwich time faithfully; by comparing local time (measured using the position of the sun) with the time in London, the navigator would know how far east or west the ship had sailed. The theory was sound, but given the rolling of ships and changing temperature and humidity, the leading scientists of the day – including Sir Isaac Newton – reckoned that a sufficiently accurate clock would be impossible to build. Harrison proved otherwise.The longitude prize, sponsored by the British government, was not unique. Prizes were also offered in France for a functional water turbine, and for a method of preserving food for Napoleon’s armies. The latter prize quickly inspired the tin can, more of a blessing than food snobs might acknowledge.But such prizes then fell out of fashion. For commercial innovations, we now rely on patents to encourage and protect innovators. Basic research is funded not by prizes but by grants.And yet two centuries after tinned fish hit the market, the way we look for solutions has come full circle. Governments, private foundations and even corporations are rediscovering the value of offering prizes for good ideas. Rather than paying for scientific and engineering effort as they have done for the past 200 years, idea-hungry patrons are returning to the 18th century, and paying for results.The most famous innovation prize of this century, the $10m Ansari X Prize, was designed to promote private space flight. The pot went to Mojave Aerospace Ventures in 2004, after the successful flights of SpaceShipOne. And even the Ansari X Prize is dwarfed by a quasi-prize of up to $1.5bn that is about to be offered by five national governments and the Gates Foundation to the developers and suppliers of a more effective vaccine against pneumococcal diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and bronchitis. The prize, called an “advanced market commitment’’ or “advanced purchase commitment’’, takes the form of an agreement to subsidise heavily the first big orders of a successful vaccine. Given that the top companies in the UK’s powerful pharmaceutical industry spent little more than £5bn in 2006 on research and development, a $1.5bn prize should be taken seriously on hard-nosed commercial grounds alone.And if formidable obstacles to setting the prize conditions can be overcome, the pneumococcal diseases contest could be followed by a malaria vaccine prize twice as big and an Aids vaccine prize that would be bigger still.Prizes need not have such lofty ambitions. They can simply be a way of turning a solution into a commodity. One company, Innocentive, provides an exchange where “seekers’’ can offer cash to “solvers’’. Both sides are anonymous, which is one of the selling points of innovation prizes: they reward neither connections nor seniority, but solutions alone. Innocentive’s problems read a little like the small ads on the world’s least romantic lonely-hearts website. “A technology is desired that produces a pleasant scent upon stretching of an elastomer film’’ ($50,000). “Surface chemistry for optical biosensor with high binding capacity and specificity is required’’ ($60,000).Netflix, a film rental website which offers recommendations based on what you looked at, bought, rented or reviewed in previous visits, has skipped middlemen like Innocentive. In March 2006, the chief executive of Netflix, Reed Hastings, met some colleagues to discuss how they might improve the recommendation system, Cinematch. Hastings, inspired by the story of John Harrison, suggested offering a prize of $1m to anyone who could do better.The Netflix prize, announced in October 2006, struck a chord with the Web 2.0 generation. Within days of the prize announcement, some of the best minds in the relevant fields of computer science were on the case. Within a year, the leading entries had reduced Cinematch’s recommendation errors by more than 8 per cent – close to the million-dollar hurdle of 10 per cent. And it has cost Netflix very little to mobilise all this effort. The company has had to pay out a mere $50,000 progress award, to a team of three AT&T data analysts.Even Netflix is surprised at how well it’s been going. “We just didn’t think the relevant research community was so big,’’ says Steve Swasey, vice-president.More than 2,500 teams from 161 countries and comprising 27,000 competitors have entered the contest. Teams from California, Budapest and Toronto have been battling away at the top. Clearly, the million-dollar prize has mobilised far more than a million dollars worth of research effort.The Netflix prize has been helped by the ease of transmitting data around the world and the affordability of the computing power necessary to have a go. The fun of the challenge alone is one of the biggest attractions to participants. So, too, is access to Netflix’s huge database of recommendations – a dream for statisticians and computer scientists. And the competition has also been fanned by the fact that all improvements are incremental and the company is able to publish listings of the current leaders, meaning the race is verging on a spectator sport.The X Prize and Netflix prize have managed to generate a tremendous amount of interest. That means more than free publicity for the organisers; it also means that the prize catalyses far more effort than one might expect on cold financial grounds. “One of the goals of the prize is to transform the way people think,’’ says Bob Weiss, vice-chairman of the X Prize Foundation. “We were trying to create a sea-change.’’Weiss says that the founders of the X Prize foundation wanted to revive their childhood dreams of a day when ordinary people would be able to travel into space – expectations formed in the heady 1950s and 1960s. They may get their wish. To Weiss’s delight, Virgin Galactic claims it will soon be in a position to offer private space flights. It will be using the technology that won the X Prize.Future X Prizes, each one funded by corporate sponsors and philanthropic donors, aim to kick-start other new industries. The Archon X Prize for genomics will be awarded to the team that can sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days, at a cost of $10,000 per genome. That is unimaginably quicker and cheaper than the first private genomic sequencing in 2000, which, according to the X Prize foundation, took nine months and cost $100m for a single human genome. (Craig Venter, the director of that effort, is one of the backers of the new prize.) It is the kind of leap forward that would be necessary to usher in an era of personalised medicine, in which doctors could prescribe drugs and give advice in full knowledge of each patient’s genetic susceptibilities.Another prize will be awarded to the manufacturer of a popular mass-production car that has a fuel efficiency of 100 miles per gallon. The model is the same each time. The X Prize foundation identifies a goal and finds sponsors; it announces a prize and whips up the maximum possible enthusiasm, with the aim of generating far more investment than the prize itself; the prize achieved, it hands out the award with great fanfare and moves on to set other challenges. The prize winner is left with intellectual property intact, and may capitalise on the commercial value of that intellectual property, if any commercial value exists.The X Prize foundation claims that the Ansari X Prize directly stimulated $100m of spending on research and development, 10 times the value of the prize itself. That is clever, and for a handful of sexy challenges it is likely to be a trick that can be repeated.But the X Prize and the Netflix prize may give too flattering a picture of what might be possible if prizes catch on. Rather, prizes could become humdrum. For the problems listed on Innocentive’s website – “The challenge is to produce a specific citric acid ester in a faster cycle under current specifications’’ ($40,000) – the day of the humdrum has already arrived.In other cases, for example the advanced market commitment for a pneumococcal virus, the sums of money being invested in the research are so huge already that it is hard to imagine the mere glamour of the $1.5bn “prize’’ weighing heavily on the minds of scientists and inventors.For both the uninspiring innovation and the billion-dollar research programme, it is the prize money itself that has to do the talking. If that is not the case, the prizes will not multiply research efforts, as the Ansari X Prize and the Netflix prize have done, but will increasingly need to compete with alternative methods of funding innovation – that is, grants and patents – on a level playing field. To become a significant alternative to grants and patents, prizes will have to become very large indeed – large enough to cover, on average, all of the likely research expenditures of all those hoping to win. Is that desirable?Champions of prizes see them as a component of a wider system to promote innovation, rather than as an outright replacement either for grants or patents. Instead, the hope is that prizes will help to compensate for the specific weaknesses of those alternatives.The downside of a patent is fundamental to its design: in order to reward an innovator, the patent confers a monopoly. Economists view this as, at best, a necessary evil since monopolies distort prices. In the hope of raising profits from some customers, they will price others out of a market. The most obvious victims are consumers in poor countries.In an ideal world, prizes could replace patents. Instead of offering a patent for an innovation, the government could offer a prize. The inventor would pocket the prize but would not be allowed to exploit any monopoly power, so the innovation would be freely available to use in products for poor consumers – cheap drugs for Africa, for instance – and, importantly, in further innovations. But to explain that idea is to see its limitations. How could the government know enough about the costs and benefits – and even the very possibility – of an innovation to put a price tag on it and write the terms of reference for a prize competition? For this reason it is hard to see prizes replacing patents in most cases. But it is not impossible.The modern heir to 18th-century prizes for canning, water turbines and finding longitude at sea is the advanced market commitment for vaccines for the poor: the goal is clear, the costs and benefits can be guessed at, and the quasi-prize nudges the patent system to one side with a prize contract that respects the patent but, in exchange for a large subsidy, radically constricts the holder’s right to exploit it.Prizes can also, in principle, supplement grants for basic research, paying scientists for results as well as for effort. There is, for example, an “Mprize’’ for creating long-lived mice. The eventual aim is to lengthen human life spans. And the Clay Mathematics Institute, a non-profit body set up 10 years ago by a Boston businessman, is offering million-dollar prizes for the solution of seven “Millennium’’ problems in mathematics.These prizes are exceptions; but prizes were once the standard way of encouraging basic research. According to Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University, more than twice as many 18th-century scientific societies paid for results using prizes or medals than paid for effort with grants. As that changed, scientific societies sometimes ignored the wishes of donors, or even had the wills of deceased donors voided, in order to hand out grants rather than the prizes specified.The standard historian’s explanation of this trend is that once science became a profession rather than the province of rich amateurs, prizes were no longer a suitable way of funding innovation. Hanson is not convinced. “Most academics who study the issue of prizes have focused on what a prize does to the behaviour of researchers, versus a grant,’’ he says. “But there’s another aspect: what does the person giving the prize or the grant get out of it?’’He argues that grants are more appealing than prizes to bureaucracies for many reasons, not all admirable: “With grants, there’s all sorts of possible patronage and corruption.’’ Even leaving aside outright graft, there is plenty of opportunity for cosiness and cliques. Then there is the mundane fact that grants are easier to account for in an annual budget than a multi-million prize that could be paid tomorrow, in a year, or never. For Hanson, it was for these reasons, rather than any intrinsic merits, that grants elbowed aside prizes in the 19th century.Prizes may be making a comeback because of all the money now available from private foundations – which demand results. Not only the X Prizes and the Millennium problems prize, but even the pneumococcal vaccine prize is part-funded by private money. Yet governments are getting in on the act. The US space and defence research agencies Nasa and Darpa both use innovation prizes, and other government agencies look likely to follow with, for example, an “H prize’’ for advances in hydrogen fuel technology.If Hanson is right, this new trend is a welcome swing of the pendulum towards a modest use of prizes. But not everyone is convinced that prizes will live up to the hype.“The literature has pushed them as a silver bullet; more recently there’s been a bit more sobriety in the debate,’’ warns Andrew Farlow, an expert in the economics of vaccines at Oxford University. “How much genuine risk-taking can it pull along?’’The problem is not the principle, he argues, but the details. A vaccine for HIV is a distant and costly prospect, and might require a $10bn or $20bn prize. Inevitably, companies and their shareholders will question whether the prize would be honoured in full. The triggers for releasing some of the prize money are difficult to define: early vaccines would probably be expensive, fallible and risky, but better than nothing. Donors would not want all the money to go to those efforts and leave none to encourage superior successors. Try framing “good enough’’ in legalese, when billions are at stake.Donors might pay a lot more than they needed to for a substandard product, or the prize might be too restrictive and too small to generate any interest at all. That would drain attention, enthusiasm and political will. “It all sounds like good economics, but whether you could ever set a prize big enough or correct enough to work in those cases is doubtful,’’ Farlow concludes.But the proponents of advanced market commitments (AMCs) believe the problems can be overcome. “There’s no question that there’s going to be a way to deal with these challenges in a sensible, analytically based way,’’ argues Ruth Levine, vice-president of the Center for Global Development, a think-tank based in Washington, DC, which has been a leading force in evaluating and advocating AMCs. “By that I mean that a proposal or contract will be written that makes sense and is based on good empirical work.’’The pilot is the pneumococcal vaccine pledge, made in principle back in February 2007, and now being hammered out. It is a big deal – a lot of money is on the table, with the potential to save many millions of lives at a low cost. Yet compared with other possible AMCs, the pneumococcal problem is relatively simple: two credible vaccines are in the late stages of development. Levine acknowledges that this example is as close to a procurement contract as to a pure innovation prize, but believes there is much to be learned from the exercise about whether donors can make a commitment together and handle the legal and accounting challenges. “What this won’t be is a pure test of whether putting a market-like offer out a long distance into the future will give firms an incentive to do early-stage R&D,’’ she says.That is the dream of AMC proponents, but the true test – a malaria or HIV prize – is some way off yet. Only then will we see whether private companies will take the bait, and the public purse will get value for money. We can be sure that big Pharma will be checking the small print: John Harrison, master clockmaker, was eventually rewarded for his brilliant, accurate maritime clock only by appealing direct to King George III. Neither he nor anyone else was ever judged to have satisfied the conditions necessary to receive the longitude prize.Tim Harford’s new book, ‘The Logic of Life’, is published next week"
1016;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2008-01-20T18:55:21Z;Digital delivery breaks out of periphery;;In the great hierarchy that rules Hollywood, studio executives working in digital distribution used to be marginal figures, their obsession with new technology keeping them on the periphery of industry decision-making.But after the video-on-demand deal struck last week between Apple and the film industry’s biggest players, the executives running digital distribution have moved to centre stage.The Apple rental deal, which allows consumers to rent films digitally, is particularly significant because it has received rare, across the board backing from the biggest studios. Walt Disney, Universal, Sony, Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount and Warner Brothers have all signed up.However, they are not restricting themselves to one digital platform and have also struck download deals with Microsoft’s Xbox Live service and Amazon, which offer film downloads.“There is room in the market place for a number of different platforms,” says Thomas Gewecke, president of Warner Bros digital distribution. He expects more deals this year.The studios’ enthusiasm for digital distribution stems from the slowdown in the DVD market, where sales fell last year for the first time in a decade.While the Apple deal benefits consumers who want to watch movies on computer or iPod, doubts remain about online video in the living room, where most films are watched.Consumers will have to pay $229 for an Apple TV set-top box to get Apple rentals to play on their TV sets, in addition to renting the film. By contrast, Cable companies such as Comcast can distribute films directly to the set-top boxes included in customers’ cable subscriptions.“I don’t think it’s fair to say that Apple will win in the [on-demand] market,” said Bobby Tulsiani, an analyst at Jupiter Research. “I would always bet on cable and anybody else with direct access to homes.”Apple’s move into on-demand video is likely to affect video rental services. Shares in Blockbuster and Netflix fell sharply when Apple’s Steve Jobs unveiled the deal at the Macworld show.However, Hollywood has been keen to maintain relationships with its distribution partners. “Choosing a favourite among Apple, Netflix and cable is great news for the studios,” says Mr Tulsiani. “They don’t want to have one bully to deal with, which is the situation the music industry is faced with.”
1017;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2007-12-05T19:45:12Z;Ashdown to the rescue?;;As leader of the Liberal Democrats – the UK’s third party – Paddy Ashdown never stood much chance of running Britain. But since quitting domestic politics, the former Royal Marine has had a lot more luck helping to run other countries.Lord Ashdown (as he is now) effectively ran Bosnia as a personal fiefdom on behalf of the international community and now the rugged former soldier is being tipped as a UN “super envoy” to Afghanistan.Ashdown, 66, is not your typical liberal. While his party colleagues are often derided as “lentil munchers”, he is the only British political leader in recent times to be able to kill with his bare hands (apart from Margaret Thatcher, of course).His experience of international affairs has been widely recognised, although he denies this expertise arises partly from having been a spy for MI6, the UK’s secret intelligence service. It also helps, perhaps, that he comes highly recommended by Tony Blair, who once toyed with the idea of including Ashdown’s party in a Liberal-Labour coalition.While Ashdown bestrides the world’s trouble spots, the Lib Dems are embroiled in their latest leadership contest at home. Nick Clegg, a boyish former member of the European Parliament, looks likely to win when the votes are counted on December 18.In the interim, the party is being led by Vincent Cable, an amiable 60-something former economist with Shell, who last week came up with the funniest line heard in the House of Commons for years. Cable said Gordon Brown, Britain’s embattled prime minister, had “gone from Stalin to Mr Bean” in a matter of weeks.Loyal fanAnother piece of British political theatre happened on Wednesday during the knockabout fun of the weekly prime minister’s question time in the House of Commons.David Cameron, leader of the Conservative opposition, had an ace up his sleeve: a confidential note from a member of the ruling Labour party to his colleagues detailing the disarray in its ranks over the funding scandal.The author, member of the European parliament and former actor Michael Cashman, blushed at Cameron’s tactics. “I am staggered at the audacity of Cameron to refer to a confidential note which was made available to MPs and MEPs as their NEC [National Executive Committee] representative,” he told Observer.Noting that Cameron referred to his past on the London-based TV soap opera, EastEnders, Cashman added that he was surprised to find how big a fan the youthful Tory leader was.Cashman said he was still awaiting a reply to his letter to Cameron demanding an explanation why the Tory leader makes much of his own multicultural views, yet “his MEPs have failed to vote in favour of equality issues in the European Parliament as well as failing to condemn homophobic and xenophobic violence”. Perhaps Cameron just kept the autograph.Bleeding edgeA piece of floppy plastic on the packages used by Netflix customers to return the DVDs they rent has been causing a bit of a stir over at the US Postal Service.It seems that all those well-worn copies of Rocky V and Sleepless in Seattle are gumming up the works.Netflix customers watch roughly 8m DVDs a week. When they’ve finished, they pop them back in the packages they arrived in, seal them up with a strip of plastic and drop them in a mail box.That strip of malleable plastic turns out to be a fly in the ointment for the US Postal Service’s automatic mail sorters, and could end up causing a headache for Netflix’s customers. It is softer than the hard “leading edge” of the packages when they were first sent out. So the machines reject them and they all end up being sorted by hand.The USPS’s auditor is now on the warpath.His argument: the soft edges of Netflix and smaller rivals are costing the service $21m a year so they should pay the cost, to the tune of an extra 17 cents a package. Add that up, and it would wipe out two-thirds of the company’s profits, says analyst Tony Wible at Citigroup.The Netflix research and development lab is no doubt working overtime to stiffen up those edges.Not prettyAs if Merrill Lynch’s new chief executive, John Thain, did not have enough to worry about, there is also Merrill’s financial exposure to the bankrupt art gallery, Salander-O’Reilly.The exposure came courtesy of Merrill’s acquisition of First Republic a few months ago. It turns out First Republic is one of the biggest creditors of Lawrence Salander and his gallery, and is owed more than $40m.The Salander-O’Reilly Galleries opened in 1976 and was considered a blue chip among the world’s art galleries.The swish Upper East Side gallery was closed by court order last month, just before a huge sale that Salander said would have brought in up to $500m. He had held out hopes that the sale of one painting by Caravaggio, “Apollo and the Lute Player”, would help put the problems behind him. Salander blamed the closure for his bankruptcy. The move to a new location appears to have been part of his undoing. The monthly rent on the place, on East 71st Street, was more than $150,000.At least First Republic is in good company. The gallery is facing a hail of lawsuits from a range of artists, dealers, collectors and lenders, including tennis champion John McEnroe, actor Robert De Niro, Sotheby’s and various hedge fund managers.observer@ft.com
1018;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2007-05-20T16:48:31Z;A bid to reprint the pricing rule book;;"Like solar eclipses, challenges to classic pricing strategies do not come along often. When they do, it is a moment to pause and savour.A warm welcome, therefore, to the Kodak Easyshare printer. It is not much of a surprise in itself – it is a standard-looking home printer for documents and photographs – but it is priced in an unusual way. You pay more than normal for the printer itself but the refill ink cartridges are relatively cheap: $9.99 for black ones and $14.99 for colour.It is enough to send flutters through a thousand business schools, where the printer and ink market is renowned as a textbook example of the “razor and blades” strategy pioneered by Gillette. A company sells the product – the printer or the razor – at below cost and makes its profits on supplies that customers must keep buying to make it work.This leads to the curious – and potentially risky for Hewlett-Packard, the leading printer manufacturer – outcome that printer ink is one of the most expensive liquids on the planet. Kodak estimates that it can cost $4,000 a gallon or more, more than a thousand times the unit price for petrol that provokes outrage from American drivers.On the face of it, this leaves a barn door-sized target for competitors to aim at, which is the weakness in razor and blades business models. If a company can break into the profitable after-market without having to provide subsidies on the sale of the equipment, it can afford to sell supplies more cheaply than the original manufacturer.An example is the jet engine market, where companies such as Rolls-Royce and General Electric sell engines cheaply and make their money by servicing them and supplying expensive spare parts. Pratt & Whitney has been trying to disrupt this by selling parts for a GE/Snecma engine on the Boeing 737 more cheaply than GE/Snecma itself.But equipment manufacturers have advantages. They can design and patent products in ways that makes them hard to imitate. They also have brands on their side: many companies sell refilled ink cartridges more cheaply than HP or Canon ones but consumers still believe that branded ones will work better.And so Kodak has decided to challenge the entire business model.
It reasons that heavy users of home printers want an alternative to the razor and blades model because they subsidise those who buy their printers cheaply and do not use them much. The most devoted customers are the ones who have to buy the most ink.So will it work? Probably not, says Tom Nagle, the head of the Strategic Pricing Group, a consultancy. “It will be an uphill battle against a product that everyone knows is good and that is cheaper or the same up front …While, as a nerdy bargain hunter, I love the Kodak strategy, as a sharp investor, I’ll probably put my money on HP to win this one.”I am more optimistic about Kodak’s chances for two reasons. First, it has resentment to play on. There are some things in life that just feel unfair, and the price of ink cartridges is among them. “How much?” is a question that many people have asked in outrage when they read the price tag on a small plastic box of liquid.Actually, HP’s printer profits are healthy but not outrageous – the operating margin for its printer division in the second quarter was 16 per cent – so the irritation is a little misplaced. Still, latent unhappiness at the way that existing companies make their money can be fruitful ground for a new entrant with a new approach.Take Netflix, the web-based DVD rental company, which challenged Blockbuster in the US by allowing customers to keep DVDs for as long as they wanted. By making money from subscriptions rather than late return fees, Netflix struck clinically at its rival’s weak spot.Second, Kodak is offering a clear and long-term alternative to the status quo. Companies often undercut their rivals’ prices for limited periods only to raise them again later on. Or they claim that their products are much better value than their competitors’ when a quick inspection reveals there is not much in it.Time Warner, which provides my television service in New York, is running an amusing campaign against Verizon, in which it correctly accuses my phone company of padding its bills with obscure charges and taxes. It portrays Verizon as being run by “Sir Charge” – an old British fellow in a bowler hat who needs the money to pay for his pin-striped suits.A jolly good advertisement, but less entertaining to anyone who has received a bill from Time Warner Cable recently. I was so baffled by my own last week that I braved Time Warner’s automated phone service to query it. It turns out that the bill was correct: they do indeed charge me both to rent an extra cable box and to pump something through it.The pessimist would say that Kodak’s challenge to HP will fail for the same reason. Both companies charge for printer and ink and it is hard for the average consumer to calculate a blended price. HP has just attempted to confuse matters further by introducing a new lower-priced cartridge (for which the unit price of ink is actually higher).Still, I reckon that Kodak’s Easyshare has a decent chance. Like Netflix and Time Warner, its rival has prepared the ground with a pricing policy that infuriates lots of people. Unlike Time Warner, it has responded by offering consumers something different, which is the beauty of unfettered capitalism. I might even pop out and buy one myself."
1019;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2007-01-17T00:51:51Z;Joost another step forward for internet video;;"Initial reactions to the Skype founders’ new internet television service seem positive. Nikolaj Nyholm, writing on O’Reilly Radar, dubbed the new service, which on Tuesday dropped its code name ""the Venice Project"" and took on its official name, Joost, ""the iPhone of TV.""Joost bills itself as a ""new way of watching TV on the Internet."" Its software allows users to stream TV content to their computers, surf through ‘channels’ and even chat with other users.Meanwhile, Netflix announced Tuesday that it will begin offering streaming movie downloads to subscribers. Together with Apple’s new Apple TV box – which was unfairly overlooked in the frenzy surrounding the launch of the iPhone – the stars seem to be aligning for internet video to move beyond YouTube towards longer-form content in 2007."
1020;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
1021;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2007-01-07T19:56:59Z;Video rentals;;Entertainment industry titans are in for an interesting year on the DVD front. But so are video rental stores, also hoping for a boost. Once written off, Blockbuster has staged an impressive comeback, not least on the stock market. Though small in itself, last week’s decision to sell its Rhino Video Games chain also suggests it is getting increasingly comfortable with its new strategy.Blockbuster has tried to reinvent itself by linking its brick-and-mortar presence with an online offering. Part of its appeal is that customers can return films ordered online in its stores – and either pick up the next instalment right away or get their online orders more quickly.Blockbuster ended the year with 2m paying subscribers online. It still has a long way to go to catch Netflix, the online pioneer, which had 5.5m paying subscribers at the latest count. Recent trends, however, suggest that having actual stores has its advantages, as well as its costs.Online video downloads, the bête noire of anyone dealing in physical discs, might shift the balance further in surprising ways. This week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas will feature advances in downloading content and burning it directly on DVDs. That could help get around one of the biggest troubles with stores: shelf-space constraints.Add a film industry keen to control downloads to avoid piracy, as well as consumers eager to get their content quickly, and it certainly seems premature to count out rental stores of the brick-and-mortar variety.
1022;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2006-09-07T23:54:01Z;Amazon to offer digital DVD downloads;;Amazon on Thursday announced the launch of a digital video download service that will set the online retailer against other major players including Apple’s iTunes service.Amazon said its new Unbox service would offer customers thousands of television shows, movies and other video content from more than 30 studio and network partners from Hollywood and around the world.The launch seemed designed to pre-empt an expected announcement by apple next week of its own movie download service.Amazon said its service would be the only one to offer DVD-quality pictures. The technology would also allow customers to buy from one PC, such as an office computer, and download the content to another at home.Bill Carr, Amazon vice president of digital media, said customers could now choose between DVDs delivered to their door or DVD-quality downloaded content.“Amazon has built the ultimate solution for anyone who has ever had a friend or coworker tell them that they missed a great TV show last night,” he said.Video over the internet has become a major growth market as broadband penetration has increased, fuelling the success of YouTube and other video-sharing sites.Early movie download sites such as MovieLink and CinemaNow enjoyed limited success but studios have become more cooperative in releasing the latest films and television networks have also begun to view the internet as another channel in which to monetise their shows.Amazon’s move will be seen as a threat to online DVD rental companies such as Netflix and to the smaller video sites.One such site, Guba, said on Thursday it had already established a strong following and expected its movie and TV portfolio to expand to the 1,000s by 2007.But Amazon’s announcement came with endorsements from six major Hollywood studios, including 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros., as well as TV networks such as CBS and Fox, and cable channels such as Comedy Central and E! Entertainment.It said new releases such as V for Vendetta, Inside Man, RV and Walk the Line would be available and all 79 episodes of the original Star Trak TV series would make their digital download debut.Television series episodes will sell for $1.99 per episode, while most movies can be purchased for between $7.99 and $14.99, or rented for $3.99. amazon said the first TV download would be free of charge.
1023;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2020-04-23T04:00:27+0000;How upstarts continue to cause upset;;Many of the best new businesses are launched in response to customer frustration with what the market currently has to offer. Few, however, manage to make such in-roads into the industry they set out to improve as online DVD rental start-ups.The industry owes its creation to the much-hated late fees charged by what are still called video stores years after they replaced VHS cassettes with their less bulky digital successors.A decade since an arthouse cinema fan called Reed Hastings was inspired by a $40 video store fine to launch Netflix in the US, the online upstart’s revenues are expected to reach nearly $1bn this year, which represents 12.5 per cent of the US video rental market or four times what Blockbuster used to earn in late fees.Similar services started in the UK only in 2003 and now account for an estimated 25 per cent of the country’s entire rental market.The consequences for the local video store seem bleak. In the UK, shops are closing at a rate of three or four a week, and one chain – Silverscreen – went into administration in March in spite of backing from Apax Partners, the private equity group.In the US, Blockbuster closed about 4 per cent of its stores in the first half of this year, and Adams Media Research expects the number of video rental stores to shrink by 19 per cent by 2010.The people who bear most responsibility for the shuttered video stores on British high streets are Simon Calver and Simon Morris. Until four months ago, the two worked for rival start-ups, Video Island and Lovefilm.In April, the two venture capital-backed companies merged to create Lovefilm, valued at a reported £80m ($150m). Lovefilm now claims 20 per cent of the total UK video rental market, far ahead of the UK efforts of rivals Blockbuster and Amazon.Last year, Lovefilm’s combined revenues hit £25m. This year, in which it has recorded its first few profitable months, it expects sales to reach £40m, says Mr Calver, the group’s chief executive.Its rapid growth is a lesson in how start-ups with technological change on their side can disrupt established industries, but also a reminder that the disruptive can themselves become disrupted if they fail to keep up with that pace of change.Lovefilm, like other online rental companies, asks customers to pay a monthly subscription of £9.99, £12.99 or £14.99 to receive one, two or three DVDs at a time through the post. When the customer has watched them, they post them back and Lovefilm sends the next DVD or batch of DVDs.There are no limits on the number of films rented each month, no due dates and – crucially – no late fees.More than 400,000 subscribers are currently renting more than 2m DVDs a month from Lovefilm. It owns more than 1.5m DVDs, covering more than 75,000 titles – a stock that illustrates the disadvantage at which high-street video stores operate.“Historically, rental has been a bit of a poor relation, but we’re in the process of turning that on its head,” Mr Calver says. “Could we be more than 50 per cent of all rentals in the UK? You betcha. My personal goal is to have more than 1m subscribers within 18 months.”The business is already demonstrating the power of the “long tail” theory – that there is value in all its inventory, rather than just the big blockbusters on which a high-street video store would focus. In spite of the obscurity of some of its DVDs, more than 90 per cent end up on customers’ “recommended” lists.Directing customers to the further reaches of the long tail can be a challenge, but Lovefilm has built an unusually sophisticated recommendation engine with the help of former Amazon employees, which asks customers not only “did you buy it?” but “did you enjoy it?”.An updated version of the software will be launched this month, yet it has already given Lovefilm powerful data about the preferences of hundreds of thousands of film fans. Mr Morris, Lovefilm’s marketing director, adds that it monitors sudden shifts in rental patterns to check whether customers’ accounts are being misused. “One customer went from one rental a month to five. We called him up to check and he told us ‘my girlfriend’s just dumped me’.”The group is now looking at ways to make more money from that information about its customers. Already, it earns advertising revenue from banner ads and trailers on its website. The 4m envelopes that go to and from its customers’ homes each month also promote upcoming films, making Lovefilm a powerful ally for studios eager to draw its customers into the cinema.Lovefilm asks its customers to rate the films they see at the cinema long before they are available to rent on DVD. “We definitely have a better read on how successful a film is going to be early on than the studios. We have over 400,000 active participants giving us feedback,” Mr Calver says. “We’re beginning to have discussions with studios about how to use this data.”According to Mr Morris, the hundreds of thousands of “film blogs” or customer reviews on its site make Lovefilm a “user-generated content” company in the mould of YouTube. “That’s the money train in our business – the peer-to-peer element of our customers talking to each other.”User feedback can be a double-edged sword. Disgruntled customers tend to give vent on DVD rental comparison websites, rating Lovefilm’s customer service below that of some rivals. Mr Calver admits that the company presents an un­usual “right brain/left brain” challenge. “There’s the attention to detail of getting 4m transactions a month right and then there’s the other side of engaging the customer.”Lovefilm may have changed the market, but its market is changing again, with the introduction of high-definition DVDs and the growth of video download services (see panel).It is pursuing a hybrid strategy, offering its customers everything from cinema ticket sales to download-to-own films. It is investigating whether it can apply its recommendation engine to television listings, Mr Calver says. “If we can combine DVD rental with downloading, cinema and television, you suddenly have the perfect tool for people to decide what they want to watch.”Lovefilm has gained its 20 per cent market share from a core of film fanatics representing just 2 per cent of “active” households. Its biggest task is to expand this base, and it is working on its first advertising campaign in the hope of reaching 6-8 per cent penetration.The next challenges, Mr Calver says, are to increase average revenue per user and expand internationally. Before the merger, both companies had bought businesses in Scandinavia, but the UK accounts for 65 per cent of the European online video rental market, making the rest of continental Europe an opportunity. Mr Calver admits that Lovefilm will start with countries with a reliable postal system, implying that southern Italians may not be able to rent Il Postino just yet.As Lovefilm approaches profitability it is considering its future financing. “We’re a private company, but looking at all options at the moment,” says Mr Calver.Download duelsThe DVD may have seen off VHS, but how will it fare in a world of DVRs, VOD and DTO? Will the idea of waiting for a disc to be sent through the post soon seem archaic when people are setting their digital video recorders to store films and programmes, video-on-demand services proliferate and News Corporation’s Fox studio becomes the latest to offer download-to-own versions of titles such as X-Men?As Frédéric Huet from Greenwich Consulting says, “If you missed Desperate Housewives, you’ve got 25 ways to catch up before the DVD comes out.”Simon Calver, Lovefilm chief executive, says pay- per-view models have been in the market for some time, and predictions that they would be the death of DVD have proved wrong. Lovefilm is hedging its bets, pioneering download- to-rent and download-to- own services in the UK.The announcement by Fox comes as Apple is building up the video side of iTunes service, Amazon is preparing its own video download service, and UK operators such as British Sky Broadcasting and BT Group are rolling out mass-market equivalents.Not all will have the clout to negotiate with studios for content, while studios’ efforts may be limited to their own content. The competition is growing, however. Mr Calver argues the growth of the on-demand market will depend on people being prepared to pay £2, £3 or £4 a time to watch a film. “VOD is only going to take off when subscription VOD takes off.”
1024;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2006-07-25T00:07:32Z;Netflix outlook disappoints;;Fears of a coming onslaught of competition from Blockbuster, with technology giants Apple and Amazon following closely behind, sent shares in Netflix, the pioneering online video rental company, down 20 per cent in late trading on Monday.The stock price tumble was triggered by what appeared to be a more cautious outlook from the company for the rest of this year, as well as evidence in its latest quarterly earnings that the cost of acquiring new subscribers has been rising at the same time that existing customers have become less loyal.A 46 per cent increase in revenues in the latest quarter, to $240m, also fell slightly short of expectations, though earnings of 24 cents a share topped stock market estimates of 18 cents.Wall Street was quick to react on Monday to hints that Netflix may be anticipating tougher times ahead, such as its decision to leave its estimate of total subscriber growth this year unchanged despite a strong second quarter.“I don’t think it’s conservative,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive.However, Barry McCarthy, chief financial officer, said that on at least one measure – its estimate of subscriber “churn”, or the number of customers it would lose each month – Netflix had changed course to be “less aggressive” than in the past.Commenting on Blockbuster’s marketing push to persuade more of its customers to rent online, Mr Hastings said: “They’ve obviously got religion that online is the path to the future.”He added, though, that with only an estimated $1bn of the $8bn US video rental business now online, Netflix should continue to benefit from a shift to online rental.“What it’s doing is growing the total online market,” the Netflix CEO said.
1025;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2006-06-25T23:09:09Z;Cisco, AT&T buy internet video foothold;;Cisco and AT&T, two of the largest US telecoms groups, are investing $15.5m in late-stage funding in Akimbo, an internet video company.The investments, to be announced on Monday, underscore the excitement surrounding young companies offering films, television shows, and other video content over the internet, as the spread of broadband drives big changes in the way people access video content.George Hoyem, managing director at Blueprint Ventures, a venture capital group that is partnered with Cisco and AT&T in the latest round of investment in Akimbo, said the company was well-positioned to capitalise on a “huge shift” towards internet services that allow customers to access an expanding range of video content whenever and wherever they want.“We think Akimbo is an excellent channel,” he said. “They are way out front in terms of the technology.”Television and film studios are scrambling to take advantage of the ongoing shift from traditional television and cable services to internet-enabled services.Part of the urgency stems from fears about a potential decline in cinema and home DVD sales as consumers turn to the internet for their favourite films and shows.Moviebeam, another internet video company, earlier this year launched a service in 29 US cities designed to compete with companies such as Blockbuster and Netflix for a share of the $10bn-a year market for movie rentals. Unlike those companies, whose models rely on distribution of physical copies of films, MovieBeam’s service offers digital broadcasts of films directly to television sets through a specially built set-top box.Other competitors include Vongo, a subscription-based service, and Movielink, a film download service backed by several high-profile Hollywood studios.Joshua Goldman, Akimbo’s chief executive, said the company had struck deals to distribute its video collection on a number of different platforms inside the home, such as Microsoft’s Media Center PC and other devices from Thomson and AT&T. The company is also pursuing a commercial agreement with Cisco, which earlier this year bought Scientific Atlanta, a maker of set-top cable boxes, for $6.9bn in a bid to boost its digital home offerings.“Much like the web changed the way we think about what we access on our computers, this in the same way changes the way people think about what to access on their televisions,” Mr Goldman said.Charles Carmel, a Cisco executive behind the decision to invest in Akimbo, said Cisco was betting on the success of services that offer customers the opportunity to play video on different devices in the home using an internet connection. “The more of that kind of content that flows over networks, the better it is for Cisco,” he said.

The Dow Jones also finished the day 0.5 per cent, or 53.07 points, lower at 11,283.25.Data showing an increase in existing home sales in March and a rise in consumer confidence to a four-year peak stoked fears of higher interest rates and depressed the market.Sun Microsystems, the maker of computer servers, closed slightly higher after it announced a change in management after the close on Monday.Scott McNealy, chief executive, said that he would step down in favour of Jonathan Schwartz, company president. Sun soared earlier in the day on Tuesday, but pulled back to close 0.2 per cent higher at $4.99.Yum! Brands reported first quarter earnings of $170m, or 59 cents a share, up from $153m or 50 cents a share in the previous quarter, and ahead of analyst expectations.Yum!, the owner of the Taco Bell and KFC brands, said the bird flu scare did have a minor impact on earnings in China, but that it expects same-store sales there to increase again in the coming year.Yum! raised its profit forecasts for 2006 by 2 cents to $2.81, pushing its shares up 3.5 per cent to $51.34.Shares in Netflix, the online DVD rentals service jumped, gaining 1.4 per cent to $31.68 following its announcement that it had made a quarterly profit.Net income for the first quarter was $4.4m, or 7 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $8.8m the previous year.The announcement by President George W Bush that he would halt deposits to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help lower the price of crude, dragged oil stocks down.But oilfield services company Weatherford was a gainer, after announcing that first-quarter net income more than doubled from $80.6m to $203.3m, pleasantly surprising investors. Weatherford shares were up 4.6 per cent to $52.17.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell on Tuesday, despite announcing a 29 per cent increase in profit compared with the same quarter last year. Analysts expected slightly higher earnings per share than the $2.61 CME delivered and shares closed down 3.7 per cent to $475.25.Leather-goods company Coach, was also hit by investor antipathy after it reported a quarterly profit of $108.9m, a 35 per cent increase compared with the same period last year.Coach’s revenue forecasts for the coming quarter were slightly lower than analysts expected, pulling shares down 6.7 per cent to $32.86.
1027;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2006-01-04T19:22:56Z;Observer - US;;Jack Abramoff knew how to stir up controversy well before he moved to Washington to become a Republican lobbyist.Abramoff, whose guilty pleas this week on multiple felonies sent Washington into a tizzy, once worked in Hollywood – not a bad place for a future lobbyist to serve his apprenticeship. But his filmmaking practices, like his lobbying practices, came under intense scrutiny.In the late 1980s, Abramoff raised $16m to make a little cold war film called Red Scorpion.The only problem was his choice of shooting location: Namibia. South Africa, then the subject of a broad international boycott due to apartheid, helped the young filmmaker by providing tanks, trucks and other equipment.The discovery that Abramoff had worked with the blessing of the South African government caused some problems for Red Scorpion, which was rejected by US distributors and condemned by the UN and other groups.Still, it managed to find an audience and remains in circulation today. (A sequel, Red Scorpion 2, was also made.)The original, starring Dolph Lundgren, garners plenty of one-star reviews by people who have rented it via Netflix. (The film is “a fine work of fascist propaganda for the home viewer” says a customer from New Jersey, though another enjoyed watching Lundgren’s “big muscles in the desert”.)Abramoff’s professional life in Washington may be coming to a close, but Jack should take heart: careers are revived every day in Hollywood.Hot seatUnlike more overtly political comics on TV, such as Jon Stewart and Bill Maher, Late Show host David Letterman’s partisan affiliation has always been relatively hard to discern. His skewering of government officials has normally been open to all and mostly done with tongue planted firmly in cheek.But on Tuesday night, Letterman let down his guard more than a bit when his guest, Fox News gabber Bill O’Reilly, began criticising Cindy Sheehan, the war protester whose son was killed while serving with the US army in Iraq.O’Reilly chastised Sheehan for calling Iraqi insurgents “freedom fighters”, arguing that she had become an unwitting tool for far-left political groups. “Be very careful what we say,” O’Reilly warned.Letterman then became uncharacteristically serious, retorting that O’Reilly “should be very careful with what you say, also,” adding: “How can you possibly take exception with the motivation and the position of someone like Cindy Sheehan?”Letterman then got O’Reilly to admit he had never lost a family member in combat and criticised the Bush administration for going to war with what it now admits was faulty intelligence. “So why are we there in the first place?” Letterman asked. Adding that he supported US troops in Iraq, he said: “That does not eliminate the legitimate speculation and concern and questioning of why the hell are we there to begin with.”As usual, O’Reilly was able to give as good as he got, particularly after Letterman claimed that about 60 per cent of what O’Reilly said was “crap”. “You’re going to have to give me an example if you’re going to make those claims,” said O’Reilly.Replied Letterman: “Well, I don’t watch your show so that would be impossible.”Cleaning houseThere’s a new broom sweeping through Polish politics, wielded by the conservative Law and Justice party, which won September’s parliamentary elections – and the targets are many senior members of the ousted ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance. Top of the list is ex-prime minister Leszek Miller.The new justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, is launching an investigation into why Miller didn’t sign a contract with Norway for natural gas, which would have loosened Russia’s grip on Poland’s energy market.The foreign minister, Stefan Meller, is preparing to remove as many as 10 ambassadors for being too closely tied to communist-era secret police or – as prime minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz put it in a television interview – of being Communist party apparatchiks.The head of Poland’s military intelligence service, General Marek Dukaczewski, has also been ousted and the service itself is to be slashed in size and revamped. Many regional police chiefs, most with communist- era connections, are being replaced.Law and Justice contends that a lot of Poland’s failings in the last 16 years are down to a less than thorough cleansing of the body politic of old Communists.Observer wonders what the next purge might be. Treasury minister Andrzej Mikosz has offered to resign after his wife’s loan to a stockbroker suspected of improper dealing.Eager beaversBritish prime minister Tony Blair’s has confessed that his long working week probably broke “some directive or other”.Now comes an even more shocking admission: European Commission president José Manuel Barroso is breaking the working time directive. One of Brussels’ proudest achievements, which limits the working week to 48 hours, is being ignored by its titular head.“It is a tricky area,” says Observer’s man with the stop watch. “The directive governs those who work for an employer. Politicians are not strictly self-employed, they are employed by the people.“And you could not do a job such as Mr Blair’s or Mr Barroso’s in a 48-hour week.”French president Jacques Chirac probably does not abide by his country’s 35-hour week either.He is giving half a dozen speeches to mark the new year to different audiences this week alone.
1028;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2005-10-03T17:37:50Z;DVD rentals pass their screen test;;"Ten years ago, Reed Hastings was a frustrated video store renter. As a fan of arthouse filmscinema, he felt he was not getting the range of films he was interested in. In addition, he was sometimes forgetful and on one occasion got a $40 late fee – and hid the fact from his wife. All these considerations, combined with the fact that Mr Hastings was runningran his own California software company and was looking for a new business idea, made him decide it was time to take action.“I had a lot of time to think after my company was taken over and decided it would be interesting to try something new,” says Mr Hastings. in a telephone interview from his California headquarters. ““As an under-served movie fan, I realised no one was focused on online rentals. Amazon.com was in the video market, but they dominated in sales, not rentals.”The reason why no one was offering video rentals online soon became clear: it cost $4 dollars each way to send a video cassette, each way. “Not many people would be willing to rent a film for $12,” says Mr Hastingssaid. He thenThen, Mr Hastings heard about the planned release of DVDs. “I went out, bought a whole bunch of CDs and started mailing them to myself to see how quickly they would come back and what condition they would be in. I waited for two days – and they all arrived in perfect condition. All the pieces started to fall into place after that,” Mr Hastings says.”With his $40 late fee experience still on his mind, and heeding the advice of internet gurus that successful online companies had to do something different to what was already being offered in the bricks and mortar world, a subscription online rental business with no late fees was born in 1999. The company was namedcalled Netflix.Since then, Netflix has become a household name in the US. It is the world’s biggest online film rental service, providing more than 3m subscribers access to over more than 50,000 DVD titles. This year, Netflix broke even and expects $7m of positive earnings. By next year, Netflixit expects 5m subscribers, a year earlier than anticipated. Mr Hastings recently raised his forecast for future growth too – Netflix plans to have 20m subscribers by 2012.This growth comes against a backdrop of sharp declines in overall DVD rentals, which have pushed big video store operators likesuch as Blockbuster into financial difficulties. John Antioco, Blockbuster’s chief executive, has responded by launching his ownthe company’s own online rental service, which has so far captured 1m users.No one was available at Blockbuster to comment on this article, but Mr Antioco said recently the group was continuing to feel pressure from the “overall core rental decline trends . . . driven by the expansion of online alternatives, cheap retail product, aggressive cable offerings, exacerbated by a poor box office”.Reflecting their diverging fortunes, the shares of Blockbuster have more than halved in value in the past year, whereas those of Netflix shares are up overby more than 40 per cent.The Netflix business model has remained basically the same from day one. Users sign up to receive a certain number of simultaneous DVD titles simultaneously rentals and pay a monthly fee. The most popular plan is three DVDs at any one time for $17.99 per month. Customers select films online, and put as many films as they want in their queue (a word introduced by a British Netflix executive). They then receive the films in especiallyspecially designed, lightweight Netflix envelopes, whose characteristic red colour havehas become key to marketing the brand. When the film is no longer wanted, the DVD is returned in the same envelope, prepaid by Netflix. Once it is received back at one of 36 distribution hubs around the US, the Netflix software will automatically sendsends out the next film in your the subscriber’s queue.Despite being hatched as an idea at the height of the internet bubble, Netflix’s operations have little in common with many businesses started back thenduring that period. Indeed, the company is extremely cost-conscious, so much so that one of its hubs, in a warehouse in Long Island, does not even have a sign on the door. Once inside the hub, the operations are surprisingly small. About 40 people wearing Netflix T-shirts work at neon-lit long tables, accompanied by a constant hum of an automatic post sorting machine. This smallmodest number of people process on average 80,000 DVDs pera day.Greg Kinney, director of distribution at Netflix, says he learnt some hard internet lessons in his previous job. At Webvans, a failed web-based delivery service that failed, Mr Kinney at one point presided over a $65m warehouse that never shipped a single item. “After that experience, I liked the approach at Netflix, which is not to do too much too soon if you don’t have the volume to support it,” he says.In charge of the 36 hubs, Mr Kinney is preparing to open at least one more this year. One reason for opening hubs across the US is that Netflix realised a quick turnaround, in which films take a day to send back and a day to be delivered, was essential for the word-of-mouth marketing it relies on.Mr Kinney says Netflix is constantly looking for moregreater efficiency in its operations and logistics. Each hub usually has just one shift of workers, five days pera week. Tuesdays is the busiest day because many people return DVDs after the weekend. Employees open the envelopes, check if DVDs are scratched or broken (any damaged ones are replaced by Netflix at no cost to customers) and then the DVD’s scan the sleeve code is scanned. The code for each DVD is central to the Netflix model – the codeit tells the system a DVD has been returned and releases the next one in the queue.It is also used to offer recommendations on the Netflix website, a key part of Netflixthe company’s strategy to serve film movie fans. Most of the DVDstitles at a hub (Netflix has a central library of DVDs in California) are immediately resent to customers in the same area. Employees are given a DVD player and a Netflix subscription – if their servicesthe service gets sloppy they will themselves will feel the effects.The proprietary software at the centre of Netflix makes it a business which that is hard to replicate. Netflix estimates Blockbuster has spent $300m on developing its own online rental service.The online rental business has also proved attractive in Europe, where market leader Video Island launched in the UK in 2003 by emulating the Netflix model and by providing an outsourced option for other companies seeking to offer a similar service under their own brands.Technology will continue to be keyimportant. Later this year, Netflix will start to offer limited on-demand film downloads via the internet. Mr Hastings says that one day all rentals will be done digitally and that he will be ready when that happens. But he believes DVDs still have a long life span because film studios make so much money from them.Like the film industry, the biggest threat Netflix faces is that of piracy. “If a practical alternative for people becomes free, pirated content, our business and the movie business could come under threat,” Mr Hastings says.In the meantime, Mr Hastings is starting to think about what Netflix can do as its subscriber base increases. Netflix is already playing a significant role in the marketing of small-budget or independent films. “One of our ambitions is to democratise film distribution so that smaller films can get the same distribution as bigger ones,” Mr Hastings says. “The film industry is reasonably efficient at distributing large-budget films but terribly inefficient at small film distribution. As we get closer to 20m subscribers, we are in a stronger position to change that.”NEW WAVE OF FILM RENTALS REACHES EUROPEThe online DVD rental business has also proved attractive in Europe. One of the biggest companies, Video Island, launched in the UK in 2003 by emulating the Netflix model but also provides an outsourced option for other companies. So, as well as its own ScreenSelect.co.uk brand, Video Island operates the rental services offered by brands such as Tesco, the supermarket group; ITV, the commercial broadcaster; MSN in the UK and EasyGroup. Last month, the company bought Brafilm, the largest player in Scandinavia."
1029;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2005-08-09T20:21:21Z;Blockbuster tumbles, hurt by fees;;"Blockbuster, the biggest US video-rental chain, plunged to a net loss of $57.2m in the second quarter, hurt by the elimination of late fees, declining store sales and higher costs to market its online service designed to compete with Netflix.The loss, equivalent to 31 cents a share, compared with net income of $48.6m, or 27 cents, a year ago. Sales at the Dallas-based group slipped by 1.6 per cent to $1.4bn while sales at Blockbuster stores open at least a year fell by 4.7 per cent.The results, which reflect the rapidly changing dynamics of the rental market as well as the slump in the movie industry, sent Blockbuster's shares tumbling. The shares, which have dropped by 35 per cent in the past year, fell another 95 cents, or 11.86 per cent, to close at $7.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.At that price Blockbuster, which was spun off from Viacom in October 2004, is valued at $1.37bn, barely ahead of Netflix which in sharp contrast announced sparkling second quarter results 10 days ago and is on track to report a full year profit this year.Blockbuster's second quarter revenues were cut by $138.1m after the company stopped charging for overdue rentals in January. The company also spent 26 per cent more on advertising, mostly to promote the online service.Separately Blockbuster announced on Tuesday that it will increase the monthly fee for Internet rentals to $17.99 from $14.99 later this month, matching Netflix.Blockbuster, which already has more than 1m online subscribers, expects to meet its goal of 2m subscribers by the end of the first quarter of 2006. Netflix, which is an Internet-only rental service, had 3.1m paid subscribers at the end of June.However Blockbuster said industry weakness will ""adversely impact"" the third quarter, without being more specific. The company said operating results are expected to improve in the fourth quarter, helped by the release of more popular movies on video and DVD.""Clearly there seems to be a…malaise in consumer interest in movies,"" Mr Antioco said on a conference call with analysts and investors. ""Box office is having its worst year, maybe ever, in terms of attendance."""
1030;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2005-05-19T21:40:04Z;Wal-Mart ends DVD rentals to promote Netflix;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is abandoning its two-year foray into online DVD movie rentals and allowing its customers to transfer to Netflix, the sector pioneer that controls about 75 per cent of the market.Netflix played down he financial significance of the deal, saying it would not be material to the company's financial performance. Wal-Mart's rental service is believed to have about 100,000 subscribers.“It's not going to move the needle very much,” said Youseff Squali, an analyst at Jefferies and Company. “But strategically it is very positive.”An announcement on Wal-Mart's website on Thursday informed customers that its existing rental service would end on June 16, and offered to transfer subscribers to Netflix at the lower Wal-Mart subscription rate for one year.However, the move drew an immediate response from Blockbuster, the largest video and DVD rental service, which offered two free months of DVD rentals to Netflix and Wal-Mart customers who switched to its rival online service.Blockbuster, which launched its online rental service in August, said customers who switched would also get a free DVD movie and the opportunity to subscribe to Blockbuster Online at their current Wal-Mart or Netflix price for the next year.Shares in Netflix, which hopes to have about 4m monthly subscribers by the end of the year, initially jumped 14 per cent on the news of the Wal-Mart deal, before falling back sharply after Blockbuster's counter offer, closing up 4 per cent at $16.13.Wal-Mart launched its online DVD rental service nationwide in June 2003, offering a monthly rate that narrowly undercut Netflix, which at the time had just over 1m subscribers.But Wal-Mart, which did not promote the service heavily, offered a more limited selection of titles than Netflix. Wal-Mart's less-sophisticated website did not offer Netflix-style movie recommendations or other innovations.Wal-Mart's retreat leaves Netflix and Blockbuster dominant in the online market. The two rivals have been engaged in a price war that has bloodied both of them. Monthly subscription prices have plunged from about $22 nine months ago to about $9.95. Analysts estimate that Blockbuster has spent as much as $300m to build and operate its online rental business, and management has come under increasing pressure from shareholders.The price war forced Netflix in April to lower revenue guidance for fiscal 2005 and delay profitability for at least six months further. Another wildcard is the possible entry into the US market of Amazon, the online retailer, which launched its DVD rental service in the UK in December.

Elsewhere, energy stocks rose as investors moved back into the sector, which has sold off amid the retreat in crude prices. Exxon Mobil rose 2.2 per cent to $54.83, Transocean gained 1.3 per cent to $45.60 and Marathon Oil added 2 per cent to $46.71.Even some bearish market watchers do not expect the sky to fall, for the next few weeks at least. “I’m long,” said Fred Hickey of the High-Tech Strategist newsletter, adding that he bought long calls on IBM, Dell and other technology stocks on April 20 “when things got oversold”.Mr Hickey said the market would rally once people realised “the world wouldn’t end” on jitters about hedge funds making bad bets on collateralised debt obligations. Mr Hickey is not wavering in his long-term bearish convictions. “As soon as we have the first drop in oil, [the bulls] began to claim that we’re back to 1995 and the goldilocks economy. We still have an economy and market fed by asset inflation with debt- and liquidity-driven gains. When the real-estate bubble blows, it will end.”
1032;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2005-02-03T19:45:55Z;Hollywood Ent. chief resigns after Blockbuster's bid;;Mark Wattles, the founder of Hollywood Entertainment, resigned as chairman and chief executive on Thursday as the video rental chain's board said it would consider a hostile bid from Blockbuster, the market leader.The board, which recently rejected a friendly merger approach from its main rival and accepted a bid from Movie Gallery, asked shareholders not to act on Blockbuster's $14.50-a-share offer until it had considered how to proceed.Shareholders would be informed of the board's position on or before February 17, the company said. No reason was given for the abrupt departure of Mr Wattle, whose title of chief executive was immediately assumed by F. Bruce Giesbrecht, president and chief operating officer. Movie Gallery, which had offered $13.25 a share in cash after Blockbuster's initial bid of $11.50, said its board was meeting on Thursday and had no immediate comment.Blockbuster's new proposal, valued at $1.3bn, added $3-worth of stock.On Thursday, Hollywood's stock price was barely changed, while shares in Blockbuster rose almost 4 per cent and Movie Gallery fell 2 per cent.Hollywood, ranked number two in the US, far behind Blockbuster, with its 9,000 outlets worldwide, came into play last year after negotiations with a Los Angeles investment group to take the company private failed.Blockbuster said this week it was confident it would win regulatory approval for a merger, despite its dominance in the bricks-and-mortar stores sector of the video and games rental trade.Competition has sharpened in the recent past with the emergence of online rental services from companies such as Netflix and Wal-Mart, forcing Blockbuster to adjust its strategies by virtually eliminating late fees and joining the online fray itself.
1033;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2005-02-02T22:46:43Z;Blockbuster launches Hollywood bid;;Blockbuster on Wednesday launched its expected hostile bid for rival home video retailer Hollywood Entertainment with a stock-and-cash exchange offer of $14.50 a share.The move by the world leader in the business topped last month's agreed offer of $13.25 a share in cash from Movie Gallery, valued at the time at $850m.Blockbuster said in a statement that its bid, of $11.50 cash and $3 in shares effective tomorrow was worth more than $1.3bn.The exchange offer was scheduled to expire at midnight EST on March 11.The start of a bidding war for Hollywood, a distant number two with 2,000 outlets compared with Blockbuster's 9,000 worldwide, adds uncertainty to an industry swarming with aggressive new competitors.Online rental services from Netflix and others, including Wal-Mart, the leading distributor of DVDs and video-cassettes for sale, have raised a serious challenge to the dominance of traditional bricks-and-mortar stores.Relatively low prices for DVD discs have undermined the basic trade in rentals.John Antioco, Blockbuster chairman and chief executive, said the transaction would provide “tremendous value” for both companies' shareholders and “should better position Blockbuster to compete in the rapidly changing home entertainment marketplace.”The company statement said it was pressing on with an attempt to obtain approval from anti-trust authorities, and expected to file its Hart-Scott-Rodino compliance statementby the end of the week.Some analysts, expecting a more aggressive approach, had expected Blockbuster to wait to obtain approval from regulators before proceeding.Wednesday's announcement followed a flat refusal by Hollywood to contemplate Blockbuster's offer of $11.50 a share. It refused to open its books for Blockbuster to conduct due diligence unless it agreed not to launch a hostile bid for three years.
1034;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2004-12-09T19:52:28Z;Amazon launches online DVD rentals;;Amazon.com made its first foray into the online DVD rental business on Thursday with the launch of a subscription service in the UK.The likelihood that the internet retailing giant would enter the business has already sent a tremor through the fast-growing market, which was pioneered in the US by Netflix and has quickly been adopted by a number of start-ups in other countries.In October, Netflix slashed its prices in anticipation of Amazon's entry into the business, leading to a collapse in its high-flying share price.The company already faced competition from Blockbuster and Wal-Mart, but it was the expected arrival of Amazon that prompted the company to take drastic action.Netflix's shares were trading yesterday at $11.65,70 per cent below the peak they hit in July.With its 44m customers around the world and established network of distribution centres, Amazon is well-placed to make a big impact in online DVD rentals, according to Jeetil Patel, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in San Francisco.It also has relationships with postal services and movie studios and distributors that should ensure it obtains the sort of volume discounts not available to others, he added.By paying ?9.99 ($19) a month, users of the Amazon service can rent up to six DVDs a month, with a limit of three at any one time.With a ?7.99 subscription, four DVDs a month are available, with a limit of two at a time.
1035;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2004-10-21T22:28:42Z;Amazon disappoints despite leap in profits;;Amazon.com reported higher third-quarter profits but its shares fell almost 8 per cent in after-market trading on Thursday as the biggest internet retailer's earnings and its 2005 sales forecasts were below expectations.Pro-forma net income rose 52 per cent from $48m, or 11 cents per share, to $73m, or 17 cents 1 cent below Thomson First Call consensus forecasts of 18 cents. The pro-forma numbers exclude certain operating costs and the costs of stock-based compensation, but are those which Wall Street analysts forecast.On a US GAAP basis, net income more than tripled from $15.6m, or 4 cents per share, to $54.1m, or 13 cents.Sales increased 29 per cent from $1.13bn to $1.46bn, in line with forecasts. Without a $57m gain from currency movements, sales growth was 24 per cent. But shares of the internet retailer fell almost 8 per cent in after-market trading on the earnings miss and lower-than-expected guidance for 2005.Jeff Bezos, chief executive, said Amazon was continuing to benefit from lowering prices and offering free shipping on orders above a certain size.It is also benefiting from its move to broaden its selection from the books and CDs for which it was originally known, to become an online shopping mall offering a variety of products itself and in conjunction with partners such as Target.Amazon has been at the centre of speculation that it may broaden its services by entering the online DVD rental market. Shares of Netflix, which already offers such services, fell 40 per cent last week after it said it was cutting its monthly fee in expectation of Amazon's entry into the market.Tom Szkutak, chief financial officer, told journalists the company had ?no announcement to make at this time? about any move into DVD rentals.?However, it is a business which we are well-positioned to do,? he added. ?Customers have asked us often for low-priced on-line DVD rentals.?Mr Szkutak added that Amazon would face low customer acquisition costs, given its large existing customer base. He added that Amazon was ?excited? about the coming holiday shopping season, despite downbeat outlooks from toy makers Hasbro and Mattel earlier this week.Amazon raised the lower end of its previous 26-32 per cent sales growth forecast for the full year, saying it now expected sales to grow 27-32 per cent to between $6.67bn and $6.92bn.But its 2005 sales forecast of $7.4bn-$8.15bn came in below Thomson First Call forecasts of $8.27bn.
1036;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2004-10-15T15:23:51Z;Netflix shares dive on strategy shift;;Shares of Netflix sank 40 per cent on Friday after the online DVD rental company said it was cutting prices ahead of the expected entry into the market of Amazon, the biggest online retailer.Netflix said late on Thursday it would lower its monthly fee from $22 to $18 from November. It was also postponing its planned UK launch for a year to deal with the expected upsurge of competition in the US.The announcement came along with a big increase in Netflix's third-quarter profit, from $3.3m, or 5 cents a share, to $18.9m, or 29 cents, on sales that nearly doubled from $72.2m to $141.6m. It also forecast it would end 2005 with 4m subscribers twice as many as now.But Reed Hastings, Netflix's chief executive, told a conference call the company's strategy for 2005 was “to grow as fast as possible while maintaining profitability on an annual basis”.“A year of minimal profits in 2005 is, I'm sure, quite a shock,” he said. “We believe this evolution and strategy is the right step, given the new information on the competitive landscape.”Netflix's shares tumbled 41 per cent in New York on Friday to close at $10.30 after many Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock.The online rental company is already facing competition from Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, and Blockbuster, the rental chain, which have both launched online services. Amazon refused to confirm it was planning to enter the market, but said customers had encouraged it to offer DVD rentals. Mr Hastings told investors Netflix had heard “from several sources” that Amazon was likely to launch a service soon.Netflix is cutting its fee only a few months after increasing it from $20 to $22.Shares of Blockbuster also fell, closing more than 6 per cent lower at $7.46 as analysts forecast that competition from Amazon could hit its already struggling online operations.
1037;NFLX;Netflix Inc;2004-09-07T18:36:48Z;Wall Street climbs after holiday weekend;;"Wall Street climbed on Tuesday as investors returned in buoyant spirits from the Labor Day holiday in the US, cheered by easing crude oil prices and upbeat corporate news.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 0.8 per cent at 10,341.16, while the S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 1,121.30. The Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,858.56.The continuing fall in oil prices lifted the market's mood but led the S&P 500 energy sector to one of the session's weakest performances, flat on the day. It was one of just three sectors not firmly in the black.Market participants said a cocktail of other factors helped the day's performance, including relief that the Republican National Convention finished without a terrorist attack, as well as the return of many money managers who had been on holiday in late August.James Dlugosch, editor of the Rational Investor Newsletter, noted that cash positions had been growing through the sleepy summer season.Additionally, after a week of disappointing corporate news, investors were primed to welcome any profits surprises or climbing earnings forecasts.Hovnanian Enterprises rose 9.3 per cent to $38.50 after the luxury homebuilder topped Wall Street's third quarter profits expectations and boosted its forecast for the full fiscal year.Seagate Technology, which makes computer hard drives, rose 3.8 per cent to $12.32 after forecasting quarterly sales and earnings above Wall Street estimates amid stronger demand.Fleetwood Enterprises, maker of mobile homes and recreational vehicles, added 12.4 per cent at $15 after strong sales drove it to a fiscal first quarter profit of $6.7m, double Wall Street's expectations.However, the day also brought disappointment.Shares in US Airways sank 12.8 per cent to $2.05 after leaders of the airline's pilots union snubbed the company's latest contract proposal, denting the company's efforts to avoid a second bankruptcy filing.But the rest of the airline sector received a slight boost from the sliding oil price. Delta Air Lines rose 9.3 per cent to $4.48, AMR, parent of American Airlines added 0.2 per cent at $8.92, Continental Airlines gained 1 per cent to $9.67 and Southwest Airlines rose 1.4 per cent to $14.45.Insurers saw a mild relief rally as damage caused by Hurricane Frances appeared to be less than was feared. The S&P 500 group added 1.2 per cent. Allstate, the insurer and largest property casualty in Florida, rose 1.9 per cent to $47.91. Other insurers with personal lines in Florida include Chubb, up 1.6 per cent to $69.65; Hartford Financial Services Group, up 1.8 per cent to $62.34; and Safeco, up 1.3 per cent to $48.41.Netflix, the mail order video rental service, leapt 7.3 per cent to $15.41 after Newsweek reported the company had struck an agreement with TiVo, the maker of television recorders, to allow Netflix subscribers to download movies over the Internet to their TiVos. TiVo shares rose 14.9 per cent to $5.08.Tech stocks enjoyed a rebound from last week's sharp losses, triggered in part by a disappointing mid-quarter update from bellwether Intel.Cisco rose 1.6 per cent to $19.05, after it was upgraded by CIBC World Markets. The analysts cited a strong growth outlook, predicting “at least” six quarters of outperformance.But not all of Wall Street was so upbeat about techs. Texas Instruments slid 2.4 per cent to $18.71 after several Wall Street analysts made negative comments ahead of its mid-quarter update today. Rival National Semiconductor dipped 5.7 per cent to $12.42.International Game Technology added 6.1 per cent to $31.89 after a positive story in Barron's over the weekend. The financial weekly said the slot machine maker was poised to hit the jackpot thanks to new casino construction.Halliburton slid 2.2 per cent to $29.47 on reports that the US Army would move to break up its support services contract in Iraq."
