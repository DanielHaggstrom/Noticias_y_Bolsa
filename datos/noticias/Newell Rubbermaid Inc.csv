0;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2019-02-15T15:55:39Z;Graco owner Newell warns of 2019 sales drop;The consumer group has been pressured by the Babies ‘R’ Us bankruptcy;Newell Brands surprised investors with an outlook that calls for a decline in sales this year, sending shares down by the most in more than a year, as the bankruptcy of Babies ‘R’ Us continues to weigh on the Graco owner.The New Jersey-based consumer group, also known for its Rubbermaid food containers, Sharpie pens and Crock-Pots, said it expects to book net sales of $8.2bn to $8.4bn in the current fiscal year. That fell well short of Wall Street’s average estimate of $8.78bn, according to a Refinitiv poll of analysts.In 2018, Newell’s net sales slipped 9.6 per cent year-over-year to $8.6bn, squeezed by softer sales of baby products following the liquidation of retailer Babies ‘R’ Us, a subsidiary of Toys ‘R’ Us. Newell’s learning and development segment saw its sales drop 8.8 per cent on the year.During an earnings call, executives said Newell will not fully lap the Toys ‘R’ Us bankruptcy until the second quarter.Beyond the closure of Babies ‘R’ Us stores, Newell said its top line has come under pressure from foreign currency headwinds, inflation and tariffs, the latter of which the company has sought to alleviate through price increases. Sales in its other business segments also fell last year.“[Newell’s] 4Q results continued to be messy (eg core sales miss, income tax benefit, discontinued ops, etc), which does not inspire confidence,” Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note to clients, noting that the stock had outperformed its peers since the company’s third-quarter report.Shares tumbled 17 per cent to $18.01 after the opening bell and were on track for their biggest one-day drop since January 2018.Newell reported net sales of $2.34bn for the December quarter, a decline of 6 per cent and missing analysts’ forecast of $2.43bn. Core sales, which strip out currency impacts, recent acquisitions and other items, were down 1.2 per cent.Net sales in learning and development were down 3.2 per cent in the period. However, the segment’s core sales improved by 1.7 per cent amid growth for writing products, a portfolio that includes Sharpies and Elmer’s glue, that was offset by weakness in Baby products.Quarterly net sales in food and appliances dipped 7.8 per cent, while the home and outdoor unit’s sales fell 7.2 per cent.Newell earned $208.1m in net income, or 46 cents a share, down from $1.65bn, or $3.38 a share, primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of 71 cents beat the average forecast of 67 cents.

Executives have pointed to a combination of higher freight and labour costs with increased prices for raw materials, some of which has been driven by the Trump administration’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, and by other countries’ retaliatory tariffs on US goods. This was largely offset in the quarter by a robust economy however, boosted by last December’s tax reforms and a strong employment market. “I think there is, overall, very little pushback on price increases,” Michael Larson, chief financial officer of Illinois Tool Works, told a Jefferies conference earlier this month. The price increases stemming from rising raw material costs and tariff effects were “well understood” by customers, he said, and underlying demand remained strong, allowing the company to offset higher costs with increased pricing “dollar for dollar”. Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, also pointed to a strong US economy providing support for price increases at a retailer known for its low-price focus. “Customers tell us that they feel better about the current health of the US economy as well as their personal finances,” he told analysts last week. 2.8%US core producer price rise in year to July 2018Companies that have announced price increases include Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, Stanley Black & Decker and Whirlpool, but not all have yet taken effect. Caterpillar told investors that its price increases came into effect on July and should offset the “material” cost increases and tariff impacts it expects in the second half of the year. Kimberly-Clark said it would raise the price of brands such as Kleenex and Huggies by mid- to high-single digits early next year, to offset higher commodity costs. Newell Brands, the company behind consumer products from Rubbermaid containers to Sharpie pens, announced higher pricing in anticipation of tariffs that could cost it $100m a year, but Michael Polk, its CEO, cautioned: “We don’t know yet how much of the pricing will stick.”The ability to pass on higher costs has allowed companies to protect and in many cases boost their profit margins. “Following the best earnings season since 2010, S&P 500 profit margins have now risen to an all-time high,” Goldman Sachs analysts noted. Second-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 index are on track to increase 24.6 per cent from the same period of last year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Goldman cautioned, however, that margin growth is likely to slow, as the “tailwinds” of tax cuts fade, global growth moderates and wage pressures and interest rates both rise. ADP recorded US wage growth of 3 per cent in the second quarter, and core producer prices rose 0.3 per cent month-on-month in July to stand 2.8 per cent above their level a year earlier.A weak reading on Friday from the University of Michigan’s preliminary consumer sentiment survey for August has raised questions about sensitivity to rising prices, particularly among poorer consumers, with the report’s chief economist saying that the fall-off in favourable price perceptions it found was “much larger than ever before recorded”.

2;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-08-06T17:47:21Z;Newell Brands shares eye worst day since January;Consumer goods company warns of $100m hit from tariffs, lowers outlook;Newell Brands, the maker of Rubbermaid plastic containers and Sharpie markers, was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 on Monday, on track for its worst day since January after lowering its outlook and noting that tariffs could cost it $100m.Shares in the New Jersey-based company fell 14 per cent to $22.91 after it said it now expects full-year sales between $8.7bn to $9bn, sharply lower than its previous outlook for between $14.4bn to $14.8bn. It also expects to earn between $2.45 to $2.65 a share, down from its previous outlook of between $2.65 to $2.85 a share.The bleaker outlook reflected the divestitures of Waddington Group, its plastic packaging brands, and Rawlings Sportings Goods, as well as plans to sell its Pure Fishing and Jostens businesses. The company has been divesting assets as part of its effort to raise $10bn following a proxy battle with Starboard Value and Carl Icahn that ended in April after all parties agreed to put three new independent directors on Newell’s board.Newell also said its ability to meet its guidance could be affected in part by the escalating global trade war.“The third factor that could influence delivery in the second half of the year is the impact of the new US tariffs on China sourced goods and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the EU and Canada in response to the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports,” said chief executive Michael Polk. “As the tariffs currently stand, the annualised impact on Newell Brands could be as much as $100m”.“Virtually, every business has been impacted with the greatest exposure on Baby, appliances and food,” Mr Polk said. He added that Newell is appealing the tariffs and considering alternative sources for materials.Mr Trump has escalated the trade war with China and asked trade representative Robert Lighthizer to consider increasing the proposed tariffs to 25 per cent from the 10 per cent announced last month.Newell’s guidance reflects a 10 per cent tariff. “If the China tariffs are raised to 25%, we will amend our pricing increases upward to reflect the full impact of the tariff,” Mr Polk said.The warning on tariffs and lowered guidance came alongside a 12 per cent year-on-year drop in second-quarter net sales to $2.2bn in what Morgan Stanley analysts dubbed a “noisy quarter”. Core sales, which account for the effect of divestitures, fell 6.2 per cent. The company said sales were impacted by the Toys R Us liquidation, which hurt its baby business, as well as retailers cutting back inventory for its writing products.Net income fell to $131.7m, or 27 cents a share, compared with $223m, or 46 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 82 cents topped analyst estimates of 77 cents, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.“Newell’s second quarter, which was supposed to mark the nadir on core sales as the co worked through negative implications of the Toys R Us bankruptcy, came in worse than expected,” said Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy.Newell Brands shares were down 14 per cent year-to-date as of Friday’s close.
3;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-05-04T11:29:57Z;Newell Brands expands list of possible asset sales;;Newell Brands announced the expansion of the transformation plan it hopes will turn round its myriad portfolio of iconic consumer products, adding two more of its businesses to a list of possible asset sales.The company, whose portfolio stretches from Rubbermaid plastic containers to Sharpie markers and Sunbeam kitchen appliances, has been trying to right itself after a string of profit warnings and only last month saw the end to a fight over board control between billionaire investor Carl Icahn and activist fund Starboard Value.Newell, which today reported first-quarter earnings, said its Pure Fishing and Jostens businesses would be added to a list of possible divestures previously outlined. The company also said today it signed an agreement to sell the Waddington Group, its package manufacturing business, to Novolex Holdings in a deal that should generate after-tax proceeds of $2.3bn.With Jostens, which makes high school memorabilia, and Pure Fishing, added to the list, Newell now expects to generate $10bn in after-tax proceeds from possible asset sales in combination with free cash flow, up from the $6bn earmarked in February. The batch of non-core brands represent about 35 per cent of the company’s net sales.For its fiscal first quarter, Newell reported an adjusted net income of $53.3m, or 11 cents a diluted share, down from $639m in the same period a year ago, which was then boosted by a one-off gain from the sale of the tools business. Analysts expected earnings of 13 cents a share. That was on sales of $3bn, a decline of 7.6 per cent from the prior year, and slightly below the median forecast among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Newell stuck to its full-year guidance of net sales between $14.4bn to $14.8bn and normalised earnings of between $2.65 to $2.85 a share.
4;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-04-23T13:18:30Z;Icahn and Starboard agree to Newell Brands director nominations;;A fight over the board of Newell Brands between billionaire investor Carl Icahn and activist fund Starboard Value drew to a close on Monday, after the two agreed to a deal that would put three new independent directors on the board of the $13bn consumer goods company.The deal between the two activists ends a proxy fight that Starboard had launched earlier this year on the company that makes Yankee Candle, Graco baby strollers and Calphalon pots and pans.The board has agreed to appoint two new independent directors from Starboard’s slate of nominees immediately, including Gerardo Lopez and Robert Steele. The company also said it would nominate Bridget Ryan Berman, who Starboard had pitched for the board. Newell added that Mr Icahn had agreed to Ms Berman’s nomination.As part of the deal, one Icahn-backed director will depart the board, while another candidate nominated by the investor will not stand for election. The company said Andrew Langham, the general counsel of Icahn Enterprises, would step down from its board immediately and that David Atchison would no longer run for a seat.“We have listened to and agreed with our shareholders’ desire to see this campaign reach a constructive resolution,” said Michael Polk, Newell chief executive.He added: “We believe the steps we’ve taken to expand our transformation plan with the support and input of Carl Icahn is the right path to significant value creation and to a simpler, stronger and faster Newell Brands.”Mr Icahn said he had been asked by Newell to give up two board seats to avoid what he characterised as a “potentially disruptive proxy fight, which could have been especially bad at this important time for the company.”“We spoke to Jeff Smith and determined we both have similar goals and objectives to enhance shareholder value, and we therefore agreed to give up two of our seats to avoid a damaging proxy fight,” Mr Icahn added. “I am pleased that we were able to facilitate peace between the Company and Starboard.”Newell shares rose 3 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.
5;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-04-11T15:10:03Z;Starboard nominates four directors to Newell board;;Jeff Smith’s Starboard Value activist fund told Newell Brands shareholders this morning it is nominating four directors to the company’s board and seeking to replace three of Carl Icahn’s five representatives.Newell, the maker of Crock-Pots, Mr Coffee coffeemakers and Rubbermaid Tupperware, allied itself with Mr Icahn after Starboard disclosed it had built a stake in the company and would seek to overhaul its board.The company said last month it had reached an agreement on an accelerated transformation plan, which included adding five Icahn-approved directors to the 11-member board.“In an attempt to stymie our efforts to address Newell’s shortcomings and bring about the right changes, the company entered into a hastily constructed and clearly suboptimal ‘co-operation’ agreement to hand over almost half the board to Carl Icahn,” Mr Smith said in the letter to shareholders today.“Make no mistake — this agreement was clearly a desperate attempt to hand outsized influence to one shareholder in order to entrench management and disenfranchise shareholders,” Mr Smith added.Mr Icahn’s nominees include three of his direct representatives, including his son Brett Icahn, plus two directors, one of whom went to university with the younger Mr Icahn and has no prior board experience, according to Starboard.Starboard’s slate is more diverse than the five men appointed by Mr Icahn: Pauline Brown, Gerardo Lopez, Bridget Ryan Berman and Robert Steele.They are seeking to replace Andrew Langham and Courtney Mather, both employees of Icahn entities, David Atchison, who went to university with Brett Icahn, and Michael Todman, the former chairman of the nominating and governance committee on the Newell board.“We are not seeking to replace Carl Icahn’s son, Brett Icahn, as a director, as we do believe it is appropriate to have a direct shareholder representative in the boardroom, but no shareholder should need three or four direct representatives on the board,” Mr Smith said.The fight will go to a vote at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 15. In order to succeed, it will have to win the support of some of the company’s largest shareholders, which include Capital Group, Vanguard, BlackRock, and Glenview Capital.
6;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-04-04T22:07:42Z;Starboard Value launches proxy fight at Newell Brands;Activist fund’s move sets up showdown with billionaire investor Carl Icahn;Starboard Value, the activist fund, is launching a proxy fight at Newell Brands, the maker of Yankee Candles, Sharpie pens and Crock-Pots, setting up a showdown with billionaire investor Carl Icahn over the future of the company.Starboard said in February it would nominate a slate of directors at Newell in an attempt to throw out its entire board. But those plans appeared to have been shelved after Newell allied itself with Mr Icahn, reaching an agreement on an accelerated transformation plan, which included adding four Icahn-approved directors to the board and shedding some assets.But in a letter to Newell shareholders on Wednesday, Jeff Smith, chief executive of Starboard, said the changes were not “sufficient to address Newell’s subpar operating and financial performance” and that Starboard would nominate eight directors to the board.“Poor execution and a series of operational mis-steps have resulted in severe share price underperformance compared to both industry peers and the broader market,” he wrote. “While the agreement with Mr Icahn gives the appearance of substantial change, and the expanded transformation plan is a step in the right direction, we question the circumstances and motivation that drove such an accord.”We believe the departures of these directors left a void in the boardroom and we are not convinced that the agreement with Mr Icahn . . . will result in the necessary change at NewellNewell declined to comment on the filing.The company’s board sent a letter to Mr Smith last week, saying that it shares “many” of his perspectives and that recent changes at Newell — a board refresh and the transformation plan — would lead to “significant value creation”.Mr Icahn disclosed last month that his funds had taken a 6.9 per cent stake in the company because they thought the shares were undervalued. Mr Icahn said in a regulatory filing announcing the stake that it had spoken to Starboard but had not decided whether to support the activist or the company.The agreement between Newell and Mr Icahn was announced three days later.Newell said its transformation plan would include focusing its portfolio on brands with more attractive margins and growth potential, simplifying operations, improving financial flexibility and improving its ecommerce business. The new Icahn-approved directors include Brett Icahn, Patrick Campbell, Andrew Langham and Courtney Mather.Starboard, which holds a 3.8 per cent stake in the company, said on Wednesday it is also “disturbed” by the turnover on the board after five of its directors resigned earlier this year, with one saying Newell’s direction was not the “optimal path forward” for the company and that change was needed.“We believe that the departures of these directors left a void in the boardroom and we are not convinced that the agreement with Mr Icahn, which included the appointment of three of his direct representatives, will result in the necessary change at Newell,” Mr Smith said.Starboard is nominating eight directors to the board, including Mr Smith, which will go to a vote at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on May 15.Starboard once famously managed to depose the full board of Darden Restaurants, parent of the Olive Garden, in 2014.
7;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-03-19T23:55:19Z;Icahn: What is old is Newell again;Shareholders might finally have a real choice;White knights have less than spotless motives. Not least Carl Icahn, who is intervening in an attempt to overthrow the board of Newell Brands, a $24bn consumer products company.Newell Rubbermaid’s disastrous 2016 takeover of Jarden Corp prompted the effort to unseat the board of the combined group. Leading the revolt is Martin Franklin, the billionaire who sold Jarden to Newell. He and allies at hedge fund Starboard Value believe they can right the ship.On Monday, management’s fightback was given an apparent boost. Mr Icahn, the activist who has accumulated a 7 per cent stake, entered into a support agreement with the company. He has designated four directors to join the Newell board.Before Mr Icahn’s arrival, investors were expected to choose between two equally unappealing options. First, an incumbent chief executive who had presided over $8bn of equity value destruction. Second, Mr Franklin and his allies who, as Newell directors also bear blame for the current mess. Mr Icahn‘s record on long-term value creation is hardly perfect. But at least he may represent a third way.The Newell-Jarden combination is an example of how hubristic dealmaking can turn toxic. Both groups sold a mish-mash of goods ranging from candles to sporting goods. Their management philosophies were dissimilar. But the pair were still smashed together in the quest for “scale”.Mr Icahn’s intervention merits scrutiny. Newell plans to divest $10bn worth of businesses (up from $6bn before). Of his four representatives on the board, three work for his fund. Only one has direct management experience of a Fortune 500 company.Mr Franklin’s group plans to release a detailed plan in coming weeks but have been sceptical of the break-up. Mr Icahn’s arrival is a setback for them. It could prove tricky for the Newell management too. The beneficiaries will probably be other shareholders.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.

He then teamed up with activist hedge fund Starboard Value with the aim of throwing out the entire board.Newell said today it has expanded its accelerated transformation plan, revealed in January, which includes: focusing its portfolio on brands with attractive margins and growth potential, simplifying operations, improving financial flexibility and making gains through e-commerce.Mr Icahn said he was confident Newell would benefit from the “fresh perspectives” of its new directors.He continued:The company is significantly undervalued today, and I believe this new board will help the management team generate significant value for shareholders, first through an expanded transformation plan and then through strengthened underlying performance. Michael Polk and the rest of the management team now have a solid strategy in place which we support and believe will result in strengthened performance over time.Mr Polk, Newell’s chief executive, said: “Our agreement with Carl Icahn reflects our shared understanding of the complexity of our business and our strategy to win in the rapidly changing retail landscape.”

10;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-02-15T14:58:23Z;Newell Brands: omission statements;A merger with little forethought has naturally fallen apart;When two companies offer slightly different slogans to justify combining, it reflects either a lack of imagination or of co-ordination. This was painfully obvious for consumer product titans Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden Corp, which make everything from sporting goods to candles. They announced their $35bn tie-up in 2015 with the catchphrases “Brands that Matter” and “Brands for Everyday Life”. Three years later, the sloppy thinking of that time has resulted in a big proxy fight over an ugly break up at the renamed Newell Brands.Last week, Newell announced the latest in a string of profit warnings, offering to divest assets worth $5bn in revenue. Since the merger closed, its shares have fallen 40 per cent in a bull market, destroying $8bn of value. Three board members have left including Martin Franklin, the billionaire investor who had assembled Jarden through a series of acquisitions. Mr Franklin has since teamed with Starboard Value, the activist fund that owns 4 per cent of Newell, aiming to topple the entire board.At the merger, each side mumbled platitudes about scale, international reach and cross-selling. Two problems have surfaced since. First, the retail sector has undergone a major realignment towards e-commerce. A price war has ensued.The companies also had different management philosophies. Newell — whose leadership runs the combined group — is far more centralised than Jarden, which allowed its divisions the flexibility to run themselves.Add in a balance sheet initially indebted at nearly 5 times cash flow (with the usual adjustments), and the margin for error has been thin. Mr Franklin needs to explain why his vision for Newell is superior and how he can be trusted after agreeing to the disastrous deal. Following the easy homilies at the merger, any new strategic rationales for the group will require greater rigour.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

11;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-02-09T02:25:55Z;Starboard to start proxy fight to throw out Newell Brands board;;If Martin Franklin has his way, he will not be off the Newell Brands board for long.Mr Franklin, the billionaire investor, is teaming up with the activist hedge fund Starboard Value to throw out the entire board of Newell according to two people familiar with the situation. News of the impending proxy fight was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Mr Franklin sold his consumer products roll-up, Jarden Brands to Newell Rubbermaid in 2016 for $15bn. Newell today boasts such brands as Sunbeam, Mr Coffee and CrockPot. Newell last month admitted to a poor integration of the two companies and said it would divest several brands including Waddington, Rawlings and Rubbermaid Commercial Products and shrink by about a third to a company with just $11bn in annual revenue. At the same time, Mr Franklin resigned from the Newell board along with two other members. Newell's shares have fallen more than a third since the deal closed in April 2016. A campaign to replace an entire board of directors is relatively rare as most activists initially aim to get only a handful of seats. However, Starboard famously deposed the full board of Darden Restaurants, parent of the Olive Garden, in 2014.
12;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-01-31T23:18:12Z;Rich pickings for investors seeking diamonds in rough;S&P 500 was up nearly 6% in January but there are some big winners and losers;It is a good time to be a stock picker. With global economic growth accelerating, and the lift-all-ships era of central bank stimulus slowly coming to an end, the environment is improving for investors seeking diamonds in the rough.The S&P 500 has rallied nearly 6 per cent in January. Barring a late-day pullback in Wednesday’s trading session, that would mark the best run since a 6.6 per cent rally in March 2016.A look under the hood, though, shows some big winners and losers across various sectors.The diverse set of returns for members of US’s benchmark stock market index comes as the correlation between individual stocks has sharply declined.Correlations last year hit the lowest level since 2001, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs.Lilia Peytavin, a strategist at the New York-based investment bank, noted earlier this month that “micro-factors”, those which relate to an individual company, are becoming increasingly important relative to “macro” ones.“We find that stockpicking opportunities are highest when equities are in the growth phase of the equity cycle and when the economic cycle extends,” said Ms Peytavin.“This is because in this phase returns are driven by actual earnings growth rather than by expectations of a recovery or a deterioration in the cycle.”Netflix, part of the consumer discretionary sector, has led the way with a 43 per cent gain.Technology issues Seagate Technology, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have also had strong runs, each up more than 25 per cent.The top-10 list also includes a 23 per cent advance by Dr Pepper Snapple Group, the beverage company that agreed to a takeover by JAB Holding earlier this week, and a 21 per cent increase by the department store chain Kohl’s.Newell Brands, the maker of Rubbermaid products and Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands are both at the bottom — down more than 15 per cent.The bottom-10 list also includes Range Resources, an energy company, Alaska Air and carmaker Ford Motor. Incidentally, Italian-listed Fiat Chrysler has surged by a third this year.US mutual fund flows “inflected” last year, according to Morgan Stanley, with bountiful fixed-income inflows and decelerating outflows from equity funds, a sign that investors are no longer fleeing actively managed funds as they have in recent years.The slowing outflows were helped by the dramatic improvement in the stockpicking performance of many US fund managers.About 48 per cent of traditional “active” funds outperformed their benchmark last year, the highest beat rate in eight years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.That helped the S&P 500’s asset manager sub-index to rally more than 26 per cent last year. The gauge has taken a hit over the past week, but is still up 6.3 per cent this year, outpacing the broader market’s gain.
13;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2018-01-25T16:49:57Z;Newell Brands shares come unglued as it looks to shrink its footprint;;"Bigger isn’t always better.

After a bumpy end to 2017 forced Newell Brands to cut its guidance, the company — whose sprawling portfolio of brands runs from Elmer’s glue and Sharpie markers to Rubbermaid containers and Graco baby products — is looking to bounce back by slimming down, a prospect that sent its shares down more than 20 per cent on Thursday.The New Jersey-based company announced that it will be examining ways to speed up a planned transformation, boost its operations and improve shareholder returns. A key aspect of that will be to focus its portfolio on nine consumer-facing brands that comprise about $11bn in net sales and offer “attractive margins” and “growth potential”, the company said.As part of that, it has started exploring “strategic options” for some commercial-facing businesses including Waddington packaging, Mapa protective gloves and Rubbermaid commercial products, as well as smaller consumer-focused brands like Goody hair accessories, Rawlings sporting goods, US playing cards and Rubbermaid outdoor products.The goal is to reduce its global factory and warehouse footprint by about 50 per cent, halve its customer base and consolidate global sales, Newell said. The evaluation process will get underway immediately, with the goal of wrapping up the overhaul and any ensuing transactions by the end of 2019.Newell chief executive Michael Polk said:Today’s announcement is a step toward a significant acceleration in our transformation plan. We believe that exiting non-strategic assets, reducing complexity and focusing on our key consumer-focused brands will make us more effective at unlocking value and responding to the fast-changing retail environment. A stronger, simpler, faster Newell, together with leading brands, brilliant marketing, outstanding innovation and an advantaged e-commerce capability, better positions us to win in these dynamic times. As a result, we have chosen to explore these strategic options.The plan was unveiled alongside a downgraded 2017 forecast, with sales results being impacted by US retailers’ inventory reductions, as well as the bankruptcy of leading baby product stores Toys R Us and its Babies R Us chain.While it had previously forecast core sales growth between 1.5 and 2 per cent for 2017, it scaled that back on Thursday to 0.8 per cent growth. Normalised earnings per share are expected to come in between $2.72 and $2.76, versus previous guidance for $2.80-$2.85.For fiscal year 2018, it is eyeballing an unspecified amount of core sales growth “despite continued retailer inventory reductions”, and normalised earnings per share between $2.65 and $2.85.Newell also announced on Thursday that three board members would depart, including the Martin Franklin, the billionaire investor who had built Jarden, the consumer-product company Newell had acquired a year ago for $15bn.Thursday’s 22 per cent plunge put Newell shares at $24.30, their lowest price since 2013. Its shares were battered falling 30.8 per cent last year on a hurricane-related disruption to its supply chain, the Toys R Us bankruptcy and a challenging environment for US retailers all around."
14;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2017-09-06T17:05:33Z;Newell Brands blames Harvey for profit warning;The maker of Rubbermaid containers said the storm has disrupted its supply chain;Newell Brands, the maker of Rubbermaid containers, Graco car seats and Paper Mate pens, suffered the largest declines on the S&P 500 on Wednesday after the company warned that Hurricane Harvey had disrupted its supply chain.The company said the storm had affected its resin suppliers with facilities in Texas and Louisiana, with some shut down for more than a week and others still not up and running.Newell Brands said it now expected full-year 2017 adjusted earnings of between $2.95 and $3.05 a share, down from a previous forecast as high as $3.20 a share.Wall Street analysts had expected the New Jersey-based company to report adjusted earnings of $3.09 a share for the year. Its shares fell 4 per cent.“The tragic events that have unfolded in Texas and Louisiana related to Hurricane Harvey have resulted in a significant disruption to a large part of the US resin manufacturing supply chain,” said Michael Polk, Newell’s chief executive.“We expect these conditions to persist through the fourth quarter of 2017 and resin inflation to now build, rather than contract as previously forecast.”Meanwhile, internet travel stocks slid after Trivago, which runs a hotel search website, cut its full-year revenue forecast and sent tremors across the industry.Shares of Expedia, TripAdvisor and Priceline all fell after the German-based group said an adjusted measure of its profits would decline from a year earlier and that sales growth would be lower than previously expected.The company projected revenues to rise 40 per cent from a year earlier, down from its projection in late July for sales to climb “around 50 per cent”.Shares of Trivago trading in the US fell 20 per cent to $11.93.The company blamed the weakness in the US dollar, difficult comparisons to 2016 and its inability to pull planned television advertising after traffic slowed, which weighed on its margins.Expedia slipped 3 per cent to $143.12, Priceline declined 1 per cent to $1,827.87 and TripAdvisor dropped 2 per cent to $43.72.Separately, analysts at Credit Suisse warned this month that Priceline was suffering a deceleration in the growth of hotel bookings, citing increased competition in Asia from Traveloka.The investment bank found that data from Google and AppAnnie, a mobile analysis firm, suggested Traveloka had gained momentum in several markets previously dominated by a Priceline subsidiary.Overall, US equities stabilised on Wednesday after a rally in Treasuries on Tuesday undercut the stock market.The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent higher to 2,461.90 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up 0.2 per cent to 21,806.39 in afternoon trading. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 6,376.40.
15;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2015-12-14T19:35:44Z;Newell Rubbermaid shares fall on news to buy Jarden;Markets react to $15.4bn acquisition of rival maker of household goods;Shares in Newell Rubbermaid fell as much as 10 per cent on Monday as the market reacted negatively to its $15.4bn acquisition of Jarden, a rival maker of household goods.The Atlanta-based group, which makes things from Sharpie markers to Rubbermaid tupperware, said it would buy Jarden’s outstanding stock and convertible debt in a move that will boost its revenues to $16bn.The deal is a crowning moment for Jarden’s founder, Martin Franklin, who turned a tiny canning company into a $10bn conglomerate, owning a range of seemingly unrelated branded goods including baseball mitts by Rawlings and scented candles from the Yankee Candle Company.Such is the randomness of Jarden’s portfolio that comedian John Oliver jokingly defined the company on his HBO show as the maker of “anything you would find left behind after a burglary”.The offer values shares in Jarden at $60 a piece and comprises $21 in cash and the remainder in Newell stock.It represents a 25 per cent premium to Jarden’s undisturbed share price, before it emerged that the two companies were in talks about a deal. Jarden has net debt of about $4.8bn, bringing the enterprise value of the deal to $20.2bn.By the close of trading on Monday, Newell shares fell 6.9 per cent to $42.15, while Jarden shares rose 2.7 per cent to $54.08.“Jarden has been my baby for 15 years, there is no way I would have sold it to Newell if I didn’t believe in the new management and opportunities that lay ahead for the combined group,” Mr Franklin told the Financial Times.Mr Franklin, son of Sir Roland Franklin, a long-time lieutenant of the late British corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith, will join the board of the newly combined group, which will be renamed Newell Brands.Michael Polk, the current chief executive of Newell, who first approached the British-born entrepreneur about a potential merger in September at an industry conference in Boston, will take on the reins of the newly combined group.“I will be Mike’s main cheerleader and will remain very involved at the board level in helping the company grow,” said Mr Franklin, who added that he quickly bonded with Mr Polk as they discovered that they both shared a passion for Breckenridge Bourbon.Once the transaction is completed, Newell will add an array of well-known US brands from Jarden’s portfolio, including Crock-Pots, Marmot jackets and Aerobeds, that will nearly triple its revenues.The deal will allow the 51-year-old founder of Jarden to focus on building his recently created Nomad Foods, an investment vehicle that acquired Europe’s largest frozen foods company Iglo for €2.6bn and the continental European operations of Findus for more than £500m. He is expected to expand in the US with fresh deals in the food sector next year.“This is a transformational deal for us that will allow us to double our presence in markets like UK, Mexico, Canada,” said Mr Polk. “Both companies have a lot to be proud of, and we intend to take the best of both and unlock the synergies for growth and margin.”Mr Polk expects that the new combined group will generate about $500m in cost-saving synergies, driven by the new company’s bigger scale to negotiate procurements. Jarden has revenues of about $10bn, and Newell has revenues of nearly $6bn.Newell, which has an investment grade rating that it hopes to retain once the groups are combined, said it hopes to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2016.Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisers to Newell, while Jones Day and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett provided legal counsel. Barclays and UBS advised Jarden, together with Greenberg Traurig and Kane Kessler.*This story has been updated to include the value of Jarden’s convertible debt as part of the equity consideration of the takeover.
16;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2015-12-14T18:54:08Z;Jarden sale awards Martin Franklin more time to revive ventures;Serial dealmaker says he intends to keep growing Platform and Nomad;Until recently, serial dealmaker Martin Franklin appeared to have something of a special talent when it came to using small takeovers to construct companies seemingly out of thin air.With a record that included turning a tiny canning company into a leading household goods conglomerate called Jarden, the 51-year-old had no trouble winning support from outspoken investors such as hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, as he sought to take his buy-and-build approach to new sectors of the economy.But those ventures — Platform Specialty Products, a chemicals company, and Nomad Foods, a frozen-foods group — have struggled in recent months. Some investors say the sheen has come off Mr Franklin, who is the son of Sir Roland Franklin, a favoured lieutenant of the famed British corporate raider James Goldsmith.After a series of acquisitions backed by debt and the issuance of new shares, the stock prices of Platform and Nomad have fallen more than 40 per cent since September. The declines have coincided with escalating concerns among stock market investors about companies that have taken on heavy piles of debt to make acquisitions.It is in that context that Mr Franklin agreed to sell Jarden on Monday — the US household goods company he founded — at a 25 per cent premium, to its larger rival, Newell Rubbermaid. The cash-and-stock deal, worth $20.2bn including debt, will create a company that makes everything from Rubbermaid plastic food containers and Sharpie markers to Rawlings baseball mitts and Breville sandwich toasters.The deal, in which Newell will pay $60 for each Jarden share, will value Mr Franklin’s stake in the company at close to $530m. Mr Franklin owns 7.1m shares in Jarden and he will have another 1.8m shares granted as part of an equity incentive plan that will vest through the transaction.Aside from cementing his own personal fortune, the takeover will allow Mr Franklin — who is joining the Newell board along with two others — to return his attention to reviving the fortunes of Platform and Nomad.Mr Franklin said the decision to sell Jarden was unrelated to his other two main ventures. However, the entrepreneur conceded that he would have more time to concentrate on shepherding Nomad and Platform.I didn’t sell Jarden to focus on my other companies, I did it because I believed it was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders“Look, I didn’t sell Jarden to focus on my other companies, I did it because I believed it was in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. It could have gone either way, but at the end Newell acquired Jarden as it has a bigger market capitalisation. It made more sense,” said Mr Franklin. “As a result of this, I will certainly have a little more time to dedicate to my two other businesses, which I intend to keep on growing.”One person who has worked with Mr Franklin in recent years says: “Martin didn’t anticipate how [Platform and Nomad] were going to trade off but his thesis is still valid. This Jarden-Newell deal signifies he is a shareholder-friendly guy and demonstrates that he is the kind of entrepreneur that is always willing to consider value-creating combinations.”Still, some investors wonder whether he can succeed with Platform and especially Nomad, which is targeting a sector where profit margins are small and growth prospects are poor.Most importantly, Mr Franklin will need additional capital to make further deals to expand those companies. “I like to have large investors with deep pockets and long time horizons. If you want to move quickly, you need the security that you can do it,” Mr Franklin told the FT earlier this year.Mr Franklin will hope Monday’s deal will be a helpful reminder to the market of why they invested with him in the first place.

18;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2015-12-08T12:31:36Z;Newell/Jarden: the thingy and the whatsit;A deal, structured the right way, makes sense;"Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden are the leading makers of the unavoidable miscellany that clogs your closets, attics and kitchen drawers. From Newell (motto: “brands that matter”) comes pens, plastic storage bins, prams, cookware, kitchen gizmos, multipurpose hand tools, blinds and cleaning supplies. Jarden (“the brands of everyday life”) makes contributions to the flotsam of contemporary existence including camping kit, air beds, small appliances, barber’s tools, candles, string, packaging, football helmets, class rings and much else.The two are in merger talks. Consumers may hope that, following a deal, half of the infuriating debris they rummage through while searching for the tape measure will disappear. It will not — but a merger still has logic. Both companies have grown by acquiring small established brands and, to the degree that stock prices are indicative, the model works. Over the past five and 10 years shares in both have beaten the wider market handily. Standard objections to conglomerates — lack of leadership focus and a price discount for inefficient company-level diversification — do not seem to apply. Maybe the competition in thingamabobs is limited. Rolling together the roll-ups makes sense, if the companies use the deal to retrench and cut costs. Both have seen their overheads creep up as a proportion of sales, to almost one-quarter.A merger has to be structured the right way to make sense, though. Since 2013 Newell has spent $1.2bn on acquisitions; Jarden $3.7bn. That has left them with combined net debt of $7.2bn, to go with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $2.3bn. Excessive debt is what ultimately makes roll-ups roll over. The worry is that the slightly smaller but more aggressive of the two, Jarden, will be the buyer, using a chunk of borrowed cash. A better option would be to do the deal in shares — and then take a long break before stuffing anything else in the corporate closet.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
19;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2015-12-07T23:23:22Z;Jarden and Newell Rubbermaid in merger talks;Combination would create consumer brands group worth more than $22bn;Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden are in talks over a merger that would create a company worth more than $22bn with a vast portfolio of consumer brands, people familiar with the matter said.A deal would be the latest in a long series for both companies, which have grown in recent years through aggressive merger and acquisition strategies. Jarden’s brands include Yankee Candle, Crock-Pot, Breville and Josten’s graduation rings. Newell’s top brands include Sharpie markers and Paper Mate pens.Jarden has been transformed by its founder Martin Franklin from a tiny company into a consumer products conglomerate with a market capitalisation of about $10.5bn.The Boca Raton, Florida group sells products as diverse as coffee grinders, kitchen jars, mops, fire alarms, babies’ dummies, fishing rods, candles and little zinc disks used to make US pennies.It is unclear whether Mr Franklin, son of Sir Roland Franklin, a long-time lieutenant of the late British corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith, would continue be part of the combined group or whether he would focus on his other ventures.Mr Franklin recently set up Nomad Foods, an investment vehicle, to buy brands in the food retail sector. It has acquired Europe’s largest frozen foods company Iglo for €2.6bn from UK-based buyout group Permira and the continental European operations of Findus for more than £500m.He also controls Platform Specialty Products, a chemicals focused group, which recently acquired the UK’s Alent for $2.3bn including debt.Atlanta-based Newell has also grown via acquisitions over the years and has a similar business model as Jarden, which aims at taking over companies with solid cash flow and strong management. Newell has a market value of about $12bn.People familiar with the matter said that it was too early to determine whether a deal would be concluded but they stressed that the talks were constructive.After news of the deal was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, shares in Newell closed 7.5 per cent higher, while shares in Jarden rose by 3.5 per cent.
20;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2012-10-26T17:25:54Z;Unilever loses two more top executives;;Unilever has suffered a spate of defections, culminating in the departure of two of the consumer goods company’s top 100 managers, who are ditching Dove shampoo for plastic food containers at Newell Rubbermaid.The US company on Friday said it was appointing Joe Cavaliere, who heads up customer development for Unilever in North America, and Richard Davies, who is head of global consumer insights for the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate.The departures were announced just a day after that of Peter Boone, who worked for Unilever in Australia and was a member of the regional board. He is joining Barry Callebaut, the chocolate company that has a supply partnership with Unilever, as chief innovation officer.The round of musical chairs at consumer goods companies comes as Unilever is on a high. It is lifting sales faster than peers Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive and winning over investors after a decade of stagnation.Unilever has yet to find a replacement for Mr Davies.Unilever sought to put a positive spin on the defections. It likened job moves by its alumni to departures from other big companies whose executives have become as sought-after as Ivy League graduates – such as General Electric, P&G or McKinsey.The latest departures follow the appointment of Mark Tarchetti, former head of global strategy at Unilever, as chief development officer at Newell Rubbermaid.Mr Cavaliere will become global chief customer officer, while Mr Davies becomes chief marketing and insights officer, as part of a restructuring that will slim its business units from nine to six and is intended to streamline the supply chain. As part of the changes, Newell Rubbermaid, which makes Sharpie pens and Calphalon kitchen products, said it would cut more than 10 per cent of its workforce, or about 2,000 employees, in the next two and a half years.The company said its restructuring would “accelerate the release of structural costs that currently constrain the investment capacity in the business for growth”.Investors cheered the changes, as shares in Newell Rubbermaid rose 4.5 per cent to $21 in midday trading.However, Michael Polk, the company’s chief executive and himself a former Unilever employee, warned on a conference call with analysts that Newell Rubbermaid continued to face a difficult consumer environment.He pointed to the looming “fiscal cliff” of US tax increases and government spending cuts scheduled for the end of this year, as well as continuing economic turmoil in Europe.“I look forward to the moment where the wind sort of pivots, but we haven’t see that yet,” Mr Polk said on a conference call with analysts. “Our planning assumption for next year is that we’ve got more of the same.”
21;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2008-12-17T22:17:09Z;Wall St falls as rate cut euphoria fizzles;;"Macy’s helped consumer discretionary stocks find positive territory on Wall Street on Wednesday as the wider market fell from its monthly high after the company quashed fears over its ability to repay debt.The shares soared 18.2 per cent to $10.01 on the back of plans to amend covenant terms on its $2bn credit facility, led by Bank of America and JP Morgan. Nordstrom, another department store chain, bounced 6.5 per cent to $13.98 and the retail sector stood 1.8 per cent higher overall, helping pare the market’s losses.“It’s a good sign for the retailers, that’s for sure,” said John Brady, head of hedge fund sales at MF Global. He said the move could be a sign that banks were “being a little bit less restrictive”.The market overall failed to hold gains enjoyed in the previous session, when the Federal Reserve’s historic move to cut rates to virtually zero spurred a 5.1 per cent rally in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent on Wednesday at 904.42 after drifting between positive and negative territory throughout the day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.1 per cent lower at 8,824.34 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.7 per cent weaker at 1,579.31.Trading was largely muted, however, as investors digested the effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate policy.Financials finished 1.3 per cent lower overall. Shares in Morgan Stanley lost as much as 8.3 per cent in the morning session as the bank reported a fourth-quarter loss that was wider than even the most bearish predictions. The figures prompted Moody’s to downgrade the bank’s senior debt rating.Yet the shares finished 2.3 per cent higher as traders were encouraged by the bank’s attempt to reduce its leveraged capital structure. Richard Bove, analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, lifted his price target on the stock to $18.Goldman Sachs, which jumped 14.4 per cent in the previous session following its fourth-quarter results, added a further 3.7 per cent to $78.78.However, regional banks, off 2.3 per cent overall, underperformed the wider financial sector after Fifth Third’s move to cut its fourth-quarter dividend to 1 cent a share sparked concerns others may be required to take similar action. Fifth Third fell 6 per cent to $7.51 while KeyCorp lost 4 per cent to $8.33.Among other consumer stocks, ConAgra and General Mills jumped 8 per cent to $16.25 and 0.2 per cent to $61.35, respectively, on the back of better-than-expected second-quarter profits.Newell Rubbermaid was the worst performing stock on the S&P 500, pushed 27.3 per cent lower to $9.58 by a profit warning that prompted analysts at BMO Capital Markets to question whether the company would retain its dividend.Investors did not appear reassured by plans from the maker of Sharpie pens, among other products, to cut up to 10 per cent of non-
manufacturing jobs.Meanwhile, the materials sector provided the market with support, up 0.1 per cent overall. Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold advanced 4.5 per cent to $26.01 as gold prices enjoyed strong gains.However, the energy sector came under selling pressure as US crude prices neared $40 in spite of Opec’s production cut.Elsewhere, Apple continued its bad run, down a further 6.6 per cent to $89.16, after the withdrawal of Steve Jobs, chief executive, from the group’s main event of the year prompted Oppenheimer to downgrade its view of the stock to “perform”.“It’s past time for Apple to either disclose the state of his health or elaborate a viable plan for eventually transferring power,” the analysts wrote, removing their price target. “Until such time, we can no longer continue to recommend Apple as a long-term investment.”Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Adobe afforded the technology sector scant comfort.Shares in the software group were dragged 2.8 per cent lower to $21.69 as the wider sector fell 1.7 per cent.Barclays noted the company did not give guidance for next year. “We believe the near-term environment will continue to pressure the top-line,” wrote the analysts, although they maintained their “overweight” stance."
22;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2008-10-21T19:58:26Z;Wal-Mart seeks green in China;;In the Darwinian struggle for global manufacturing orders, the “Wal-Mart price” has generally been short-hand for shaving production costs to the bare minimum.But on Wednesday in Beijing, Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, will tell hundreds of the company’s top Chinese suppliers that the retailer intends to use its market power to get more than just low prices – at a “sustainability summit” devoted to raising standards in its vast supply chain.Attending the gathering will be AG Lafley, chief executive of Procter & Gamble, Fred Smith, head of FedEx, and Yuanqing Yang, chairman of Lenovo, who are keen to adopt a similar approach. Executives from Kimberly-Clark, Coca-Cola and Newell Rubbermaid will also be on hand for the most ambitious private sector drive yet to reduce waste and pollution in China’s export-focused manufacturing industries.Mr Scott will set out a range of objectives for the company’s supply chain and for its Chinese retail operations, which will include targets for the reduction of water and energy usage, reductions in packaging, and commitments to develop more sustainable products.“Our environmental footprint is primarily through our supply chain as a company,” says Matt Kistler, head of Wal-Mart’s global sustainability efforts. “So we have the ability to really build a world-class, better quality, better value supply chain.”In the US alone, Wal-Mart is estimated to sell about $30bn of goods annually that are made by about 30,000 factories in China, or about 10 per cent of all US imports. In categories such as clothing, footwear and toys – worth $64bn last year – Wal-Mart’s share is far higher.The retailer will also be promoting a new “Green Supply Chain Initiative” being led by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a non-profit group that has worked with Wal-Mart on sustainability issues in the US. The project is aimed at working with individual suppliers on energy saving and other issues, and is expected to extend to other US and European retailers, covering another 20,000 factories.“We will leverage the market clout of global retailers to help create a green playing field for China’s exporters,” says EDF.In the US the retailer has embraced a series of environmental initiatives over the past three years, including developing solar power systems and promoting more sustainable products such as low-enegy light bulbs. This year, it introduced a packaging scorecard that evaluates the efforts of suppliers to reduce packaging waste, which is now being translated into Mandarin.Jennifer Turner, head of the China Environment Forum at the Wilson Center in Washington, says that in China similar pressure from international companies could help counter the problems of enforcement that continue to dog central government efforts to enforce existing environmental laws.“Local governments are not interested in enforcing laws, sometimes because they own the factories …I think this initiative from international companies to be crucial because it is a new kind of pressure on local government,” says Ms Turner. But the initiative also represents a shift in Wal-Mart’s traditional focus on securing the lowest possible price, which has helped shape the current supply chain and is blamed by critics for its social and environmental shortcomings.Mr Scott told Wal-Mart managers at their annual meeting in Kansas City this year that “we will favour – and in some cases even pay more – for suppliers that meet our standards”.However, Conrad ­MacKerron, head of supply chain programme at As You Sow, which co-ordinates pressure on companies from ethical investors, questions how the new approach would work in a world where brands and retailers have played suppliers off against each other on price.“If you go to a supplier that is already feeling the squeeze financially, and you say that they need to reduce energy and stop waste water, how do they do that given that Wal-Mart’s business model is basically to pay less year after year?”The focus on raising environmental standards in China’s supply chain comes against the background of broader concerns over regulation of factories there, with a new scandal over the contamination of Chinese milk-products with melamine. Last year saw a crisis over the safety of Chinese-made toys, which was preceded by a massive pet-food recall in the US because of melamine contamination of Chinese made ingredients.Ed Chan, head of Wal-Mart China, says the central government is giving the initiative “very active support”. “Sustainability is a top priority, and they have been encouraging Chinese and multi-national companies to really rethink the business model.”Jeff Macho, the China-based head of Wal-Mart’s global procurement division, insists the company wants to view its supply chain “holistically”, including both environmental and social factors such as labour conditions with product quality. He also said that in keeping with Mr Scott’s professed readiness to pay more the company had recently moved a home fashion contract to a more expensive supplier because of concerns over standards at the original factory.“I would say we are seeing an evolution to a new business model,” he says. “I think we are developing that relationship with suppliers, to look not only at price, but at all of these other elements.”
23;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2008-01-01T21:05:02Z;Writing equipment with a long pedigree;;Most of the world’s well-known pencil makers have one thing in common – longevity. Take the four large pencil suppliers that continue to have their headquarters in the Nuremberg area. While Faber-Castell dates to 1761, Lyra, Staedtler and Schwan-Stabilo were founded in 1806, 1835 and 1855, respectively.Dixon Ticonderoga, the large US pencil producer, has its roots in a business founded by Joseph Dixon, a US entrepreneur who devised an early form of stove polish based on graphite, in 1827. Two years later, Dixon moved into a new field by using graphite as the inner core inside his first pencils.Sanford – another US pencil maker that is part of Newell Rubbermaid, a large consumer products company – has a foundation date 30 years after Dixon Ticonderoga.In Switzerland, Caran D’Ache, an upmarket maker of pencils based in Geneva, dates to 1924. In the UK, US-owned Cumberland Pencil, which concentrates on writing instruments mainly for artists, was founded in 1832.This was about three centuries after natural deposits of graphite were discovered in large quantities in the UK’s Lake District, giving birth to the modern pencil industry.
24;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2005-09-25T19:00:16Z;Analysts fear fragile confidence;;Shares in most of the largest US consumer goods, beverage and retail companies have been hit with downgrades from Banc of America Securities as its analysts believe “increased macro-economic risk” is likely to hit earnings.The move, on Friday, was unusual in that it involved concerted action by 16 analysts. They believed that in spite of low interest rates and a still-strong housing market, “the consumer's resiliency is becoming less certain”.They said consumers might have reached the limit of their ability to absorb the price increases that many consumer goods companies have implemented to help offset rising energy and raw materials prices.April Scee, the company's household and personal care products analyst, covering companies such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Newell Rubbermaid, said: “We have argued that the consumer will not notice the price increases on the shelf, but will notice them when we reach a critical mass of price increases. We think we're approaching that point.” Official figures show prices for gasoline rose 8.2 per cent in August and were 31.3 per cent higher than a year ago. Energy prices for home use rose at a more moderate 1.4 per cent.In the restaurant sector, which includes McDonald's, Yum Brands, Wendy's and Starbucks, analyst Andrew Barish said consumers seemed to be “narrowing their dining-out choices to those executing with great new products/promotions”.“We suspect that most restaurant companies will be very cautious in taking new price increases given the delicate state of the consumer today,” he wrote. Mr Barish said McDonald's was the only large company in the sector where there was “confidence in near-term sales and earnings visibility”.All analysts expressed concern that earnings were at risk given their view that raw material, packaging and transport costs “have risen more than expected and are likely to be sustained longer than we thought”.Bryan Spillane, beverage analyst, said bottlers and beer companies, such as Anheuser Busch, Molson Coors, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, faced the greatest risk to earnings.Last week Cott Corporation, which makes soft drinks for Wal-Mart, issued a profit warning, blaming weak soft drink volumes and rising raw materials costs.
25;NWL;Newell Rubbermaid Inc;2005-09-15T17:18:15Z;Newell Rubbermaid to cut 5,000 jobs;;Newell Rubbermaid on Thursday revealed plans to slash 5,000 jobs and close a third of its 80 manufacturing plants as the plastics maker battles against rising energy costs.The group, which makes a huge range of products including plastic containers, tools, pens and printer cartridges, hoped to extract annual cost savings of $120m following the completion of the three-year investment programme.The restructuring is expected to cost between $350m and $400m, $220-$250m of which will come in the first year.Joseph Galli, chief executive, said the group was increasing investment in more profitable businesses, such as office products, tools and hardware and plastic food containers, and cutting overheads to enable it to be more competitive on price.The investment will fund product innovation and new marketing campaigns. Newell expected its core businesses to generate long-term sales growth of 3-5 per cent.Newell has struggled to integrate Rubbermaid since it bought the group for $6bn in 1999. It has repeatedly tried to restructure the business by closing plants and improving product ranges.But the recent steep rise in oil prices, together with increased competition from lower price stores, have hit profits of Rubbermaid’s plastics products.Newell on Thursday restated its profits forecasts for this year. It also forecast earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.50 and $1.60 in 2006, compared with $1.43-$1.48 this year.The group’s shares rose 5 cents to $22.86 in early afternoon trade in New York.
