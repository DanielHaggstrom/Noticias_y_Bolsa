0;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2018-03-24T11:00:24Z;The week in energy: Fair winds blow offshore;Prospects for offshore projects seem to be improving all the time;The French word for a wind turbine is “éolienne”, from Aeolus, the mythological keeper of the winds in Homer’s Odyssey, who first tries to help and then turns against Odysseus. The word was coined by Ernest Sylvain Bollée, a French inventor who designed an innovative wind turbine, patented in 1868. The turbines used wind energy to pump water rather than to generate electricity — the first person to do that was James Blyth in Scotland in 1887 — but they still fascinate enthusiasts for the history of technology.It is appropriate, then, that France is still in the vanguard of innovation in wind power. General Electric’s offshore wind joint venture with Alstom is developing a huge new turbine, the world’s tallest, which will be built at plants in St Nazaire and Cherbourg on France’s Atlantic coast. It is an important product for GE, which needs to develop other sources of earnings with its traditional gas-fired power generation business in decline. Forecasts from its rival Siemens of the outlook for worldwide sales of large gas turbines make a grim picture for the companies that make them.Prospects for offshore wind, however, seem to be improving all the time. The Netherlands this week awarded a contract to Vattenfall of Sweden for two 350 megawatt offshore wind farms, described as the world’s first to be built without subsidies. Germany awarded “subsidy free” offshore wind contracts last year, but the Dutch projects are expected to be in service first. For the developers, these contracts are predicated on continued technological progress in offshore wind, thanks to products like GE’s new turbine, which they hope will bring down the cost of generation significantly. Describing the contracts as “subsidy free” is also bending the truth a bit: in the Netherlands, as in Germany, the government is covering some of the cost of the projects, including grid connection. The Dutch government has also committed to creating a carbon price floor, similar to the UK system, which will help underpin the revenues of the new wind farms. Even so, the steep decline in the cost of offshore wind has been remarkable. One estimate last year suggested the new German offshore projects were aiming to produce power for about €31 or $38 per megawatt hour, which compares to a forecast from the US Energy Information Administration of an unsubsidised cost of about $157 per MWh.In the US, offshore wind development has lagged well behind Europe, partly because of those cost concerns and partly because of some stiff opposition from coastal property owners. If you have the wide open spaces of Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa available for onshore wind development, there is anyway less need to head out to sea. Offshore wind in the US is starting to pick up, however, particularly for the more crowded northeast of the country. A report this week from Environment America, titled Wind power to spare: The enormous energy potential of Atlantic offshore wind, argued that turbines off the US Atlantic coast could produce enough electricity to supply the needs of the coastal states four times over.Meanwhile, another use of US offshore resources is attracting only limited interest. The latest auction of drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest ever in terms of the area offered, had been hyped up by the interior secretary Ryan Zinke as a “bellwether” for US offshore producers, although industry groups had attempted to play down those expectations. When the auction was held on Wednesday, their caution was vindicated. The sale was not a complete flop, but its results showed only a modest level of enthusiasm for new acreage. Of 14,474 lease tracts available, bids were received on just 148. When oil companies are thinking about where to deploy their investment dollars, the Gulf of Mexico or any other region has to make a very compelling case to seem competitive against onshore shale reserves. The Sierra Club declared the offshore lease sale a “massive dud”. Oil output from the Gulf of Mexico has grown strongly in recent years, and the US administration expects that to continue into the early 2020s, but to level off after that. Sam Ori of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago produced this nice chart showing how bidding for Gulf of Mexico leases has varied with the oil price in recent years.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has been visiting the US this week, following his trip to Britain earlier in the month. One of the crown prince’s principal objectives was to push President Donald Trump to take a harder line on Iran, and subsequent events suggested he might see some progress on that front. On Thursday Mr Trump appointed as his new national security adviser the outspoken hawk John Bolton, who in 2015 urged the US to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, and last year argued that withdrawing from the agreement over Iran’s nuclear programme “should be the administration’s highest diplomatic priority”. The prospect of a resumption of US sanctions on Iran, and generally heightened international tensions, helped drive up oil prices, with Brent crude rising above $70 a barrel on Friday.A countervailing factor working to depress oil prices is the prospect of a trade war, stoked by Mr Trump’s planned new tariffs on US imports from China. His announcement of his plans on Thursday alarmed US businesses and rattled the markets. However, that same morning, the administration also revealed that it was opening some huge loopholes in its planned tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. At least for the time being, imports from the four largest steel suppliers to the US last year — Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and South Korea — will be exempt from the new tariffs, as will the EU. There was bad news for the US steel industry in China’s threats of possible retaliation: steel pipes for the oil and gas industry are among the products listed by the Chinese government as potential targets. The tariffs and the threatened trade war are also a concern for companies seeking to export LNG from the US. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has meanwhile been urging China to buy more US LNG.It was not quite the climate science equivalent of the Scopes trial over teaching evolution, but a US federal judge did hold an interesting hearing on global warming in the district court in San Francisco this week. Hearing a case for climate-related damages brought by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland against the largest western oil companies, Judge William Alsup ordered a “tutorial” on the science. Chevron, which is itself based in California, was conspicuous as the only large oil company that turned up to give evidence, concluding its remarks with: “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” Its evidence leaned on the company’s report on climate change resilience, which I discussed in an earlier Energy Source. The judge pointed out that Chevron and the scientists called by the plaintiff cities largely agreed with each other.Duke Energy, one of the largest US utilities, published its report on climate change this week, observing that the electricity industry “is undergoing extraordinary transformation”. The report concludes that reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C would require “sustained financial support for research, development and scaling of low-carbon technologies”, including the “smart grid”, energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear power, carbon capture and energy storage.Another controversy has blown up over Tesla’s battery installation used for grid support in South Australia. The company says it has not been paid for 30-40 per cent of the power drawn from the battery, because it has been used for frequency regulation, balancing supply and demand over very short intervals, and any use for less than six seconds is not registered by the system operator. The Labor party, which had been in government in South Australia and had been enthusiastic about Tesla, planning further co-operation, was defeated in the state election last weekend. The result could also have implications for Australia’s federal energy policy, smoothing the path for the “national energy guarantee”, which has been backed by businesses but opposed by environmental groups. Moving on after the setback in South Australia, Tesla is working on two more battery installations for grid support in Victoria.Mr Trump sought to cut or abolish energy research and environmental programmes, but in the end the spending bill passed by Congress mostly maintained or increased spending in those areas. He signed the bill on Friday, despite his misgivings.And finally: Vaclav Smil is often described as the energy wonk’s energy wonk, and is championed by Bill Gates. Science Magazine carried a great interview with him, talking about his life and his ideas.Nick Butler — Why I don’t have an electric carJamie Powell — Eighteen years, five wells, output zero: Zion's long quest for oil in IsraelJohn Dizard — A Venezuelan oil embargo would wipe out Maduro & CoRichard Black — The gas 'crisis': A case for state intervention?Bina Hussein — Go Big or Go Home: The Right Diversification Strategy for Saudi Arabia?Joern Huenteler, Tian Tang, Gabriel Chan and Laura Diaz Anadon — Why is China's wind power generation not living up to its potential?Joseph Norman, Rupert Read, Yaneer Bar-Yam and Nassim Nicholas Taleb — Climate models and precautionary measuresMichael O’Boyle and Silvio Marcacci — Wind and solar costs continue to drop below fossil fuels. What barriers remain for a low-carbon grid?Reviewed by me in the FT this week, Varun Sivaram’s Taming the Sun is a well-argued assessment of solar power, warning that the industry will eventually face big problems if its technology is not radically improved.“If you want dividends, you should buy Exxon stock.” — Stephen Chazen, the former chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, rejecting the idea that smaller US oil companies should be paying dividends. He retired in 2016, but is now getting back into the game with a $2.7bn deal to buy drilling rights on 14,000 acres of the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas. He told the Houston Chronicle that when investors asked for dividends from smaller oil companies, their real point was “we don't trust you to hold the money because you'll waste it, so we want it back”.The International Energy Agency this week published its Global Energy and CO2 Status Report 2017, showing that world energy consumption rose by 2.1 per cent last year, while energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose by 1.4 per cent, after having been flat for three consecutive years. Energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, the yellow and blue lines respectively, have been growing slower than global gross domestic product, the green line, but they are still growing. The IEA said the rise in emissions last year was “a strong warning for global efforts to combat climate change, and demonstrates that current efforts are insufficient to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.”
1;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Rising interest rates punish US power sector;Heavily indebted utilities shore up balance sheets as financing costs increase;US utilities, sustained for years in a warm bath of favourable financial conditions, are facing a cold shower.An expected rise in interest rates and the shake-up of the tax system passed into law at the end of last year are threatening to squeeze utilities’ finances. Already, the S&P 500 utility sector index has dropped 13 per cent from its peak in November.Duke Energy, one of the largest US utility groups by market capitalisation, on Tuesday gave an indication of the changing times, saying it planned to raise $2bn from selling shares this year and would cut its five-year capital spending plan by $1bn. Lynn Good, chief executive, said the share sale was needed “to maintain the strength of our balance sheet”.FirstEnergy, another large utility, last month announced a $2.5bn investment in shares and convertible preferred shares, backed by investors including Elliott Management and GIC, to pay off debt, contribute to its pension fund, and “strengthen the company’s investment-grade balance sheet”. The colder financial climate is expected to prompt other utilities to rethink their capital allocation, pushing some of them towards disposals or acquisitions.An immediate impact from expectations of rising interest rates has been to make utilities less attractive investment propositions. Listed utility groups generally make most of their income from regulated assets, which means that their earnings and dividend payments are steadier and more reliable. That makes their shares behave more like bonds.In a note on Wednesday, strategists at JPMorgan listed 50 “bond proxies” that were “stocks to avoid in a rising rate environment”. More than half of them were utilities, including Duke, Exelon, NextEra Energy and American Electric Power.Beyond the “bond proxy” effect, higher interest rates also threaten to disturb the cosy financial equilibrium that has supported US utility companies through a turbulent time for their industry. Demand for electricity in the US is stagnating: total power consumption was slightly lower last year than in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, there has been a dramatic shift in the fuel mix. Since 2010 the proportion of US electricity generated by coal-fired plants has dropped from 45 per cent to 30 per cent, while the proportion from gas rose from 24 per cent to 32 per cent and the proportion from renewables rose from 4 per cent to 10 per cent.But through all that, the US utility industry has been able to prosper. The sector index rose 82 per cent from the start of 2010 to November 2017. The relatively comfortable position of US utilities has been in sharp contrast to their European peers, which have undergone a gruelling decade of financial pressures and forced restructuring.A key reason for that has been the low cost of two of the US industry’s principal inputs: natural gas, and money. Utilities have been able to keep regulators happy with modest increases in rates, while increasing their earnings and dividends. Gas seems set to stay cheap but the cost of money is rising.Although many US utilities are heavily indebted, there is no imminent financing crisis looming. The utilities in the S&P 500 have debt with an average maturity of 14.5 years, JPMorgan calculates, and only 19 per cent of their debt matures by 2020. Over time, however, rising interest rates will put upward pressure on their costs. In their regulated businesses, the utilities should be able to recover those increased costs from their customers. But the more companies try to raise rates, the greater the risk that they will face challenges from regulators.The problem is compounded by the impact of the new corporate tax system. The changes are complex and will affect different companies in different ways, but one common effect of the system is that it squeezes the utilities’ cash flows.The main rate of corporate tax has been cut from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and regulators are expected to insist that customers benefit from that reduction with lower bills. In the long run, companies will be able to recoup the lost income, according to Todd Shipman of S&P Global Ratings. “Rates will be lower today and then higher in the future,” he says. In the short run, however, the loss of revenue means that cash flows will be squeezed. The result is likely to be that some utilities’ credit ratings will be cut, Mr Shipman says. “I don’t expect a lot, but there almost inevitably will be some.”Merger and acquisition activity in US utilities slowed sharply last year after a hectic 2016. This year, rising interest rates could help spur a revival in dealmaking, according to Kenyon Willhoit of PwC, the professional services group. Some companies will be prompted to sell assets to reinforce their balance sheets, while others will see opportunities to buy.“It provides another reason for utilities to look to the merger and acquisition market to supply additional growth,” Mr Willhoit says.
2;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2017-08-18T04:01:55Z;Approaching eclipse sheds light on US solar energy expansion;Need for replacement power sources as skies darken highlights the sector’s growth;A rare eclipse set to traverse the US on Monday has sparked a tourism bonanza, as people flock to towns in its path to see the sun’s corona encircle the moon.The control rooms of the nation’s electric utilities will also be watching.That is because thousands of megawatts of solar energy will disappear as skies darken.In California, the grid operator is lining up additional supply from natural gas power plants and hydroelectric dams to accommodate the drop. PJM Interconnection, the grid spanning from Illinois to New Jersey, expects up to 2,500MW of solar power to be lost and will rely on replacement generation.The contingency plans reflect the expansion of solar energy in the US in the years since 1979, the last time a total solar eclipse awed the country. The rise has been especially dramatic in California, which aims to get half its power from renewable sources by 2030 in a bid to cut greenhouse gas emissions.California lies south of the “path of totality”, where day briefly turns to night, but more than half its sunlight would be obscured between roughly 9am and noon on Monday, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) said.As people flip on lights and solar plants and rooftop photo-voltaic systems lose their fuel source, the California grid operator said it would have to fill a gap of 6,000MW — enough power for 6m homes.“We’ve told the market that we’re going to need extra generation on that morning,” said Steven Greenlee, an ISO spokesman.The grid managed by ISO has added about 2,000MW of solar generation in each of the past four years, bringing installed solar capacity to almost 10,000MW. Solar plants around the state can now meet as much as 30-40 per cent of demand.Solar energy drops off daily when night falls, and unexpectedly when clouds form. “But this is greater in magnitude, and it’s faster,” Mr Greenlee said. Grid managers are drawing lessons from Europe, which in 2015 underwent its first total eclipse of the solar power era without incident.California’s public utilities commission is using the eclipse as a teachable moment. The agency has invited residents to pledge to unplug toasters and phone chargers to diminish the need for fossil fuel power during the solar shortfall. “When you Take the Pledge, you are joining a movement of Californians who are taking action during the eclipse to give the sun a break by saving energy and reducing GHG emissions,” it said on a special eclipse website.In the absence of affordable electricity storage, the use of gas and hydro plants as back-up power sources highlights dependence on a diverse portfolio of energy sources. The challenge of intermittent output from solar and wind power plants could intensify if the California legislature passes a bill requiring 100 per cent of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2045.Elsewhere, carbon emissions will receive a bump from the tailpipes of millions of eclipse enthusiasts driving towards the path of totality, which cuts eastward through 14 states from Oregon to South Carolina. Highway patrols have warned of traffic jams on back roads, motels in obscure hamlets are booked solid and online vendors have exhausted supplies of safety eyewear.Hopkinsville, Kentucky branded itself “Eclipseville” and expects an influx of 100,000 people. It has planned a three-day festival around a celestial event that lasts less than three hours.“We have people coming from 45 different states and 19 different countries. This is definitely going to be the largest event our community has ever hosted,” said Brooke Jung, a consultant to the town.The eclipse will exit the US south-east by late afternoon. Duke Energy, a utility there, plans to host eclipse watchers at a South Carolina nuclear power plant on Monday, serving hot dogs and ice cream and playing songs such as “Blue Moon” and “Here Comes the Sun”.“It’s like a solar eclipse craze,” said Randy Wheeless, Duke spokesman.Duke also manages solar farms in North Carolina, the state with the second-most solar capacity after California. Mr Wheeless said about 2,000MW of solar output may be lost as the eclipse passes.He compared the effects of the eclipse to a thunderstorm, though one that was long predicted and darkens a whole region at once. “It presents a unique challenge because it’s right in the middle of the afternoon, when you could possibly lose a large amount of solar,” he said.
3;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Norwegian oil fund sells shares in Duke Energy;Fund places US utility on list of groups it will not invest in, due to risk of environmental damage;Norway’s $900bn oil fund has underlined its ethical credentials by adding US utility Duke Energy to a list of companies it is barred from investing in due to the risk of “severe environmental damage”. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund put Duke on its list of more than 110 companies that it will not buy shares in, which includes Airbus, Boeing, Philip Morris, Rio Tinto and Wal Mart. The oil fund backed a recommendation from Norway’s council of ethics — an independent body that reviews corporate behaviour — that Duke had “repeatedly discharged harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina”. The Norwegian fund is one of the most influential investors in the world, owning on average 1.3 per cent of every listed company globally, and its decisions on which businesses to exclude are often followed by other shareholders. The fund owned a 0.62 per cent stake in Duke — worth $304m — at the end of last year but sold all its shares before announcing the utility’s exclusion from its investment universe, as it typically does. Duke had been lobbying the fund to avoid being banned under Norway’s attempts to exclude any company deriving more than 30 per cent of its business from coal, according to local press reports from the US. But the council of ethics instead centred in on the ash basins.It said in April it was recommending the fund exclude Duke Energy and three subsidiaries “due to the unacceptable risk of these companies being responsible for severe environmental damage”.“For many years, these companies have among other things repeatedly discharged environmentally harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina,” it added.Several court rulings have ordered Duke and the subsidiaries to remove or seal the ash basins, but the measures would not be completely carried out for 10 to 15 years, said the council.Norway’s oil fund was among the first state-backed investors to name publicly the companies it was excluding.It started more than a decade ago, focusing initially on the makers of arms such as anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions and nuclear weapons.The oil fund added tobacco producers in 2009 and coal companies this year. Duke said: “It is unfortunate that [the oil fund] did not consider Duke Energy’s proactive actions to enhance our environmental stewardship and close ash basins across our jurisdictions.”
4;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2016-09-07T13:11:59Z;Norway oil fund excludes Duke Energy over environmental fears;;Another company bites the dust at Norway’s gargantuan $900bn oil fund.The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday that it would exclude Duke Energy, the US utility, and three subsidiaries from its portfolios due to the risk of severe environmental damage, writes Richard Milne, Nordic Correspondent.Duke had already been lobbying the oil fund to avoid being banned due to its coal-fired power plants, according to local press reports.Instead, the Norwegian fund backed a recommendation from the country’s council of ethics – an independent body that reviews corporate behaviour – that Duke had “repeatedly discharged environmentally harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina”.The council added that, despite several court decisions ordering Duke and its subsidiaries to remove or seal the ash basins, the measures would not be completely implemented for 10-15 years.The oil fund owned 0.62 per cent of Duke at the end of last year, equivalent to $304m. It typically sells its stake before announcing the exclusion decision.Duke joins more than 110 companies that are excluded from the oil fund’s portfolios including producers of tobacco and nuclear weapons as well as companies deriving more than 30 per cent of their business from coal. The companies include Airbus, Boeing, Philip Morris, Rio Tinto and Wal Mart.Duke did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
5;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2016-07-15T20:42:14Z;US utilities prove to be laggards in solid week for markets;Sector still one of Wall Street’s top gainers during 2016;Shares in US utilities groups fell this week as the broader market climbed to new all-time highs on the back of strong economic data and corporate earnings.The utilities sector was down 1.1 per cent on the week, the only big S&P 500 group in the red, denting the performance of what has been one of Wall Street’s top gainers during 2016.That came as the S&P 500 notched a series of record closing highs for the past four sessions through to Thursday.Despite the recent fall, the utilities sector remains 20 per cent higher for the year having been sought by investors for the consistent dividends offered by its member companies. The S&P 500 utilities index offers a dividend yield of 3.2 per cent, compared with 2.1 per cent for the broader index.Investors have also taken to the sector for its perceived haven status as concerns about the global economy and aggressive central bank stimulus have pulled US government bond yields down to record lows.That trend shifted a little this week as investors took a more bullish view on the US economy.Growth may have picked up to a 2.4 per cent pace in the second quarter, according to a running forecast by the Atlanta Fed, from 1.1 per cent in the prior three-month period. Meanwhile, data released recently have shown a rise in hiring, retail sales and factory activity last month.“Economic data has come in a bit stronger than expected . . . renewing the possibility that the Fed may be raising rates at least once this year and thereby allowing investors to rotate back into the more cyclical sectors,” said Sam Stovall, US equity strategist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The more upbeat data have also come as second-quarter corporate earnings have topped more subdued analyst expectations. Results so far from the big US banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, have broadly been better than some analysts feared.Valuations that were seen by some investors as stretched might have also played a role in the move out of utilities, said Mr Stovall. In fact, utilities are 26 per cent more expensive relative to broader market valuation than they have been since 1995, according to Mr Stovall’s calculations.Among the laggards in the utilities sector this week were Eversource Energy, a power provider for the US New England region, which fell 2.9 per cent to $57.87, and Duke Energy, one of the biggest American utilities, which dropped 1.3 per cent to $84.92 over the week.Global government debt, which had staged a powerful rally following last month’s unexpected Brexit vote, was also caught in this week’s flight from havens.The US 10-year Treasury note yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the bond’s price, climbed 19.8 basis points to 1.56 per cent for the week, marking the biggest five-day rise for the benchmark since late March.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 had slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,161.7, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 18,516.6, and the Nasdaq Composite had dipped 0.1 per cent to 5,029.6.
6;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2016-06-20T20:45:42Z;US utilities left behind Brexit relief rally;Equities make gains as investors pivot away from havens;Utilities stocks were left behind as US equities rallied on Monday with investors pivoting away from havens on cooling worries about this week’s British referendum vote on EU membership.The sector was the only one in the red as the S&P 500 rallied 0.6 per cent. Utilities were down by 0.4 per cent.Utilities are favoured during times of financial market turbulence because of their consistent dividend yields and have been in vogue this year as volatility has flared up repeatedly over issues ranging from worries about the US economy, to China, and most recently, the upcoming Brexit referendum.However, a jolt of bullishness swept across global financial markets on Monday as polling pointed to a resurgence in strength for the Remain camp ahead of the UK referendum on Thursday over whether the country should part ways with the EU.Indeed, a Financial Times analysis of polling data suggest the two sides were locked in a dead heat.Duke Energy, a large power utility, was one of the worst performers on the S&P 500 utilities index, declining by 1.2 per cent to $82, while Consolidated Edison fell by 0.9 per cent to $77.16.The two largest US telecommunications groups had a mixed day. AT&T ticked up by 0.1 per cent to $40.78 while Verizon Communications was little-changed at $53.76.Economically sensitive groups moved higher on Monday.US lenders, which have struggled in 2016, climbed, with the S&P 500 banks index rising by 0.6 per cent.Among the advancers were Fifth Third Bancorp, a regional bank, which climbed 1 per cent to $18.40, and heavyweight Citigroup, which rose by 0.8 per cent to $42.80.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.6 per cent to 2,083.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.7 per cent to 17,804.9, and the Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.8 per cent to 4,837.2.The early rally on Monday brought the S&P 500 within less than 2 per cent of the all-time high it struck in May 2015, before it pulled back.Volatility gauges also dropped after surging over the past three weeks. The Vix index, a measure of implied S&P 500 volatility over the next month, fell by 5.4 per cent to 18.4, below its long-term average of 20.Still, market strategists warned that events this week, including Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen’s remarks to the US Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, may still spark ructions in the financial markets.“We’ll all get off one rollercoaster only to get on another,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.Elsewhere, the shares of Murphy Oil jumped 6 per cent to $31.10 after a brokerage upgraded its view on the oil exploration and production company.Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov increased his rating on the stock to “market perform” from “underperform”.He said he had “become convinced” that the company’s dividend was “safe”.Dividends have been an important tool used by energy groups to attract investors in recent years but the fall in crude oil prices has forced them to sharply cut back on spending and also called into question whether companies in the sector will be able to continue to afford these shareholder-friendly programmes.
7;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US discounters rise on robust earnings;Shares in Dollar Tree and Dollar General gain on higher customer traffic;Dollar Tree and Dollar General shares climbed to all-time highs on Thursday after the US discount chains logged better than expected quarterly earnings, suggesting demand held up even as the American economy struggled early in the year.Dollar Tree, which closed its buyout of Family Dollar Stores last July, said its net profits rose to $232.7m in the quarter to the end of April from $69.5m in the same three-month period in the previous year. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items, clocked in at 89 cents a share, topping Wall Street estimates of 81 cents.The group also lifted its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.58-$3.80, from $3.35-$3.65.Dollar Tree added that its like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, increased by 2.3 per cent on a constant currency basis, propelled by increases in customer transactions and average ticket prices, in spite of what chief executive Bob Sasser described as a “challenging economic environment”.Rival Dollar General also benefited from higher customer traffic and sale prices, saying on Thursday that its like-for-like sales in the quarter to April 29 rose 2.2 per cent. Meanwhile, net income climbed 16.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $295.1m. Earnings per share of $1.03 beat analyst expectations of 95 cents.The bullish performance by the dollar stores is in contrast to a tough first quarter for department stores such as Sears, Macy’s and Nordstrom, which have come under pressure from e-commerce groups like Amazon and off-price retailers.Dollar Tree’s shares rallied 12.8 per cent to $88.37, while Dollar General rose 4.6 per cent to $88.01.Elsewhere, US Foods, the private-equity backed food distributor, climbed in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.The group priced 44.4m shares at $23 each late on Wednesday, raising $1.02bn in one of the biggest initial public offerings of the year. US Food’s shares climbed 8.3 per cent to $24.91.The S&P 500 utilities sector, which has struggled in recent days as Federal Reserve commentary has prompted investors to bet that a rate increase may come this summer, climbed by 1.1 per cent on Thursday.Consolidated Edison, a power company, climbed 1.3 per cent to $72.73, while Duke Energy also advanced by 1.3 per cent to $77.96.The broader market was mostly unchanged as investors reassessed their positions after two days of solid gains for US equities. At the close, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,090.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 17,828.3 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 4,901.8.The S&P 500 is back in the black for 2016, but some market strategists have warned that the US economy may need to show more signs of improvement for the rally to be sustainable. Indeed, a report on Thursday showed orders for capital goods excluding certain volatile components, seen as a gauge of business investment, missed expectations in April.“In order to reach a sustainable higher level of growth, business investment will need to increase, taking some of the growth burden off of the consumer. So far there are scant signs of an increase in capex spending,” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.

Indeed, federal funds futures priced in odds of 51 per cent that the central bank increases rates by July, up from just 17.4 per cent a week ago, Bloomberg data show.The banks group on the S&P 500 pushed higher by 3.4 per cent on the week in what was its best five-day run in a month, bringing its year-to-date decline down to 8.3 per cent. Among the gainers were Citizens Financial, which jumped 7.4 per cent on the week to $22.98, and KeyCorp, which rallied 6.9 per cent to $12.48.The largest US banks also performed well: JPMorgan Chase advanced by 3.8 per cent on the week to $63.51, Bank of America rose 4.6 per cent to $14.52 and Wells Fargo climbed 1.1 per cent to $48.75.On the other side of the spectrum were utilities stocks. The S&P 500 utilities sector dropped 2.4 per cent on the week, cutting its year-to-date gain down to about 11 per cent.Utilities, which are favoured by investors as an alternative to bonds because of their consistent dividend streams, have been key beneficiaries of the Fed’s less aggressive rate-rise plans. But the tides changed to some extent as policymakers suggested the central bank may try to get back on course to tighten policy.Duke Energy, a large power company, fell 4.7 per cent on the week to $77, while fellow electric utility Consolidated Edison dropped 3.3 per cent to $72.16.Elsewhere, Applied Materials shares logged their biggest intraday rally since November 2008 after the maker of equipment used by chipmakers unveiled a sharp rise in new orders and a rosy outlook.The California-based company said orders rose 37 per cent to $3.5bn on a year-on-year basis in the quarter to May 1, the highest mark in 15 years. Management also said it expected adjusted profits of 46 cents to 50 cents a share in the current quarter, compared with Wall Street estimates of 39 cents.Applied Materials’s shares rose 13.8 per cent to $22.66, bringing their year-to-date rally to more than 21 per cent.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,052.3, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.4 per cent to 17,500.9 while the Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.2 per cent to 4,769.6.
9;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2015-11-30T21:40:26Z;Financials top S&P sectors in November;Bank shares sought as investors anticipate wider net interest margins;A glance at Wall Street’s leaders and laggards for November illustrates what is dominating the attention of investors: a looming rate increase by the US Federal Reserve.The financial sector posted the biggest gains this month of the 10 major S&P 500 groups, rallying almost 2 per cent.Regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp was one of the standouts, zooming higher by 8.5 per cent to $20.64. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, climbed 4 per cent to $66.81.The sector has been boosted from rising expectations that the Fed will choose to lift short-term interest rates for the first time in almost a decade at its December meeting.In the wake of a robust reading on the US labour market for October, the odds of a US central bank rate rise have remained above 70 per cent as implied by the December Fed funds futures contract.So-called net interest margins, the difference between the rate banks charge for loans and the yield they pay on deposits, are forecast to climb as interest rates rise. Banks have seen their margins squeezed by the Fed’s highly-accommodative monetary policy as the central bank has held its benchmark lending rate near zero per cent since December 2008 in an effort to spur economic growth and higher inflation.On the other side of the spectrum, utilities have suffered from expectations of rising rates. The S&P 500 utilities sector dipped 2.7 per cent in November, making it the worst performer by a wide margin.Among notable laggards, Duke Energy, a large power company, dropped 5.2 per cent in November to $67.76. NRG Energy, a smaller player in the sector, slid 4.2 per cent to $12.36.Utilities are often favoured for their consistent dividend payments, especially during times of economic turbulence. The prospect of tighter Fed policy has pushed yields higher across a wide variety of bonds, from safe-haven Treasuries, to corporate debt. That makes utilities less attractive on a relative basis. Telecom stocks, another sector replete with dividend-paying companies, have also lagged behind during November.Meanwhile, on Monday, energy stocks advanced on the back of gains in crude oil prices. Among the leaders in the energy space was Transocean, an oil-rig operator. Its shares rose 1.8 per cent to $14.37, helping slice its year-to-date loss to 21.6 per cent.Elsewhere, Lululemon, a maker of athletic apparel, skidded on the back of a downgrade from FBR to “underperform” from “market perform”. The report by Susan Anderson warned that while Thanksgiving weekend sales were likely “very strong”, many customers were “buying the significant amounts of clearance (items) available in stores”.The stock dropped 8.9 per cent on Monday to $47.82. That brings its 2015 loss to 14.3 per cent.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 2,080.41, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent 17,719.92 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4 per cent to 5,108.67. The S&P 500 capped November with a gain of around 0.1 per cent.
11;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Duke Energy to buy Piedmont for $6.7bn;Largest US power utility makes bet on continued growth of gas industry;Duke Energy, the largest US power utility, has become the latest company to make a bet on the continued growth of the country’s gas industry, agreeing a $6.7bn all-cash deal to buy Piedmont Natural Gas.The deal is intended to give Duke a stronger base in natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines, and to increase the proportion of its earnings that come from regulated assets, which have more stable returns and are less exposed to commodity price swings than its operations in competitive markets.The combined company will have more than 90 per cent of its business regulated.It could also provide a boost for the controversial Atlantic Coast Pipeline, a $5bn project that would bring cheap gas from the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and West Virginia down to utilities in Virginia and North Carolina. Both Duke and Piedmont are shareholders in the project.Environmental groups have opposed the plan, arguing that it will encourage increased production and consumption of gas, and hence discourage the use of renewable energy.Tom Skains, Piedmont’s chief executive, said accepting the Duke deal would “greatly expand our platform for future growth”.The deal is similar to the proposed $12bn takeover of gas company AGL Resources by Southern Company, another large utility, which was agreed in August.In recent years analysts and traders have become more confident that US gas prices will remain low for a long time because of the huge resources present in the country’s shale formations, and that has raised utilities’ interest in owning gas businesses.Both Duke and Piedmont have their headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina.Duke, which took the top spot among US utilities with its $13.7bn acquisition of Progress Energy in 2012, is principally an electricity company, with about 57,500 megawatts of generating capacity and about 7.3m US customers in six states.Buying Piedmont — which supplies gas to 1m homes and businesses, has a gas distribution business and invests in joint ventures for storage and pipelines — will triple Duke’s number of local gas customers.Duke is offering $60 in cash for every Piedmont share, for a total of $4.9bn, and will also take on $1.8bn in debt. The offer represents a premium of about 40 per cent to Piedmont’s closing share price on Friday.Duke plans to fund the deal by borrowing, and by raising $500m-$750m from an equity issue.Utility deals are typically slower to close than for any other industry, because of the degree of regulatory scrutiny they face, but Duke and Piedmont aim to have the takeover close in the fourth quarter of next year.Duke was advised by Barclays and Sidley Austin, Piedmont by Goldman Sachs and Kirkland & Ellis.
12;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2015-08-31T16:29:32Z;Twitter lifted as bank’s analysts warm to prospects with upgrade;US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from Chicago and Texas;Twitter shares were buoyed on Monday by an upgrade from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’, as analysts with the bank warm to the company’s prospects and depressed stock price.Shares in the San Francisco-based group advanced 3.5 per cent to $27.78 after Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust, lifted his rating.Mr Peck said that the recent all-time low in Twitter shares, which saw its stock drop below its initial public offering pricing in November 2013, “provide a buying opportunity with: sentiment at a low, potential leadership and board stabilisation, user and monetisation catalysts coming shortly, and an attractive valuation.”Twitter shares have moved erratically since the year began, as investors fret that it will fail to add new users at the same pace it did when it floated.In its latest quarter, the company reported a 61 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier, while its loss narrowed. However, user growth slowed to less than 1 per cent from the first quarter.Planet Fitness climbed 6 per cent to $17.81 after all nine investment banks that underwrote the initial public offering of the chain of budget gyms initiated coverage with ‘buy’ or buy-equivalent ratings, including Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Jefferies.Price targets from the nine banks ranged from $19 to $25 a share, compared to the $16 price the company sold shares for this August.Analysts with Baird said that Planet Fitness had created a “disruptive model” poised to take market share, while those with Jefferies said it was the “logical beneficiary of favourable industry trends given its extensive store base, compelling value proposition and brand strength.”“Planet Fitness disrupted the $23bn US health club industry when the company launched its high-value, low-price business model, helping to create a fundamental shift in how consumers are spending their exercise dollars,” said Jerry Gray, an analyst with Cowen & Company.JC Penney shares rose 2 per cent to $9.11 after analysts with Deutsche Bank upgraded the department store chain to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ on the view same-store sales and margins will improve.“New chief executive Marvin Ellison is now driving the next step of applying the science of retail to bring JC Penney up the curve in pricing and markdown optimisation,” said Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche.Rival chains fell on Monday, with Dillard’s down 0.3 per cent to $92.51 and Sears Holdings dropping 2.2 per cent to $26.71.Netflix shares slid 2 per cent to $115.35 after the company said it would not renew its licensing deal with Epix over the weekend, removing blockbuster titles such as Hunger Games: Catching Fire, World War Z and Transformers: Age of Extinction from its US service at the end of September.Utilities were the worst performing industry on Monday, with the S&P 500 utility index sliding 1.6 per cent to 214.28 following comments from policymakers on Saturday that the US central bank could raise rates in September.Duke Energy slid 2 per cent to $70.91, Exelon declined 2 per cent to $30.76 and FirstEnergy weakened 1.6 per cent to $31.96.Overall, US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from the Greater Chicago and Texas regions.The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,972.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 16,528.03.

13;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2015-07-12T16:38:56Z;Gas overtakes coal at US power stations;Abundance of shale output and fresh regulatory burdens change landscape;The US generated more of its electricity from gas than from coal for the first time ever in April — in a sign of how the shale boom is putting mounting pressure on the country’s mining industry.Plunging prices for natural gas, which have fallen alongside oil since last summer, led to it being used to generate 31 per cent of America’s electricity in April, while coal contributed 30 per cent.This was the first month in US history that gas-fired electricity generation surpassed coal-fired generation, according to SNL Energy, a research firm — although it came close in 2012 when gas prices were also very weak. In 2010, coal provided 45 per cent of US power.Since then, competition from cheap shale gas— unlocked by the rise of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing — plus a growing regulatory burden on coal-fired power plants, has squeezed out coal use. That trend has accelerated in 2015.Brett Blankenship of Wood Mackenzie, the research company, said the combination of cheap gas and new environmental regulations such as curbs on mercury and related pollution from coal-fired plants was having a particularly deleterious effect on coal generation.“Low gas prices mean coal plants are running less, and when they run their margins are typically compressed,” he said.“So companies find it difficult to make the investments needed to comply with regulations and keep those plants running.”US coal production is expected to fall by 7.5 per cent this year, according to the government’s Energy Information Administration. US coal mining companies’ shares and bonds have plunged.There were 593 coal-fired power plants in the US in 2009 but, by 2013, that was down to 518, with a total summer capacity of about 303 gigawatts.Since then, the shift away from coal has gathered pace. US coal capacity dropped by about 3.3GW during 2014, and the EIA expects it to shrink by a further 12.9GW this year, while wind power capacity rises by 9.8GW and gas by 4.3GW.In addition, the surviving coal plants are being run less often. In April 2015, US coal plants generated 42.8 per cent of their capacity, down from 51.3 per cent in April 2013. They switched places with gas-fired combined cycle plants, which generated 47.5 per cent of their capacity in April 2015, up from 40.4 per cent in the same month of 2013.A Supreme Court ruling against the administration’s Environmental Protection Agency last month, which found that the government should have considered the costs of compliance, is likely to lead to the mercury pollution regulations being dropped.However, many companies have already made the decision to either fit the necessary equipment or shut the plans down to comply with the rules.Mr Blankenship said it was likely to make a difference only to “a few plants” at the margin.Market share for solid fuel expected to fall toward 30 per cent.Continue readingMinnesota Power, a division of Duluth-based Allete, said after the Supreme Court ruling that it planned to idle its coal-fired plant at Taconite Harbor from next year, and shut it in 2020, while adding new gas-fired plants.Lynn Good, chief executive of Duke Energy — the electricity group that is the second-largest user of gas in the US — told the Financial Times last month that the fall in long-term prices had made utilities more confident that the cost of gas-fired generation would remain low.“This visibility for a longer period of time is clearer today than it would have been three years ago or five years ago,” she said.Shares in Peabody Energy, the largest US coal producer, have fallen 98 per cent since April 2011, while those of Arch Coal have dropped 99.2 per cent and of Alpha Natural Resources by 99.6 per cent.Bonds issued by these companies are trading at levels that suggest investors see a high probability of default. Peabody’s 2018 bonds, for example, yield 17.9 per cent, according to Morningstar.Earlier this month, Arch launched a debt exchange that gives investors at most $400 or $450 of face value for every $1,000 of principal that they hold.No proper monitoring of methane emissions / From Robin Russell-Jones
14;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2015-07-07T21:18:28Z;US stocks gyrate sharply on fresh turmoil;Utilities and consumer staples benefit from risk aversion;US equity markets gyrated sharply on Tuesday, ending a volatile day higher after briefly falling below a key technical level as turmoil in China and the eurozone knocked investor confidence.The S&P 500 climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,081.34, nearly 2 per cent above lows touched early in the trading day, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 17,776.91.The benchmark US index also pared losses that saw it keel through its 200-day moving average — currently 2,055.27 — as investors sold-off positions in mining, technology and banking stocks heading into the close of trading in European stock markets.While investors remain sceptical that a deal will be reached between Athens and its international creditors, the tone of negotiations softened somewhat as new Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos spoke with his counterparts at an emergency summit in Brussels.Strategists said the move in equity markets, which also saw the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rise 0.1 per cent to 4,997.46, was driven by the Greek talks.“This is headline trading,” Gennadiy Goldberg, a US strategist for TD Securities said. “That’s why you’re seeing the whip from the strong negative to the strong positive. I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday. Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia shed 1.9 per cent to $19.79.Additional reporting by Pan Yuk.
15;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2014-08-22T17:10:04Z;Ross Stores’ strong earnings helps lift US retail sector;;"Retailers finished the week on a high note after a flurry of earnings reports.Discount retailer Ross Stores led the S&P retail sector, trading 7 per cent higher at $74.37. At least four analysts raised their target price after the company reported better than expected sales and profits on Thursday.Net income for the three months ended August 2 rose 12 per cent to $239m, while sales increased 7 per cent to $2.7bn. Comparable store sales, the industry’s key metric, rose 2 per cent.The California retailer has benefited from the consumer trend for bargain hunting. Operating margin for the quarter increased 14 per cent, driven by higher merchandise gross margins and tighter cost controls.The company, valued at $15.6bn, forecast annual earnings per share between $4.18 and $4.26, up from $3.88 the year prior.Strong earnings also lifted a number of other retailers, despite a slightly weak performance on the S&P 500. By close, the S&P retail index had gained 0.7 per cent, compared to the S&P 500’s loss of 0.2 per cent.Shares in Foot Locker reached an all-time intraday high of $55, after the New York-based footwear company beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter earnings.Foot Locker reported profits of $92m, a 39 per cent jump from results a year ago, due to healthy sales of basketball and running shoes. Foot Locker’s second quarter sales grew 13 per cent to $1.64bn, compared to analyst forecasts of $1.57bn.Investors have remained steadily bullish on Foot Locker, pushing the company’s share price up about 30 per cent since the start of the year and closer to 60 per cent in the past 12 months.Gap topped earnings expectations, sending the company’s stock 5 per cent higher, as the fashion chain also announced an expansion into India to capitalise on stronger demand from emerging markets for Western-style clothing.Gap is trying to fill the hole of slowing sales in North America by pushing into Asia; the company said in April it expected sales in China to triple in the next three years.Gap raised its full-year profit forecast to $2.95-$3.00 per share, from $2.90-$2.95 per share. The retailer also reported profits of $332m, or 75 cents per share, compared to analyst forecasts for 69 cents per share.But not all retailers managed a positive week. Aéropostale fell 10 per cent to $3.52 on Friday. The company reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Thursday and same-store sales fell 13 per cent. On Tuesday, the company’s shares rose 20 per cent after it reappointed its former chief executive Julian Geiger to lead the company.Ann Taylor also disappointed investors by cutting its sales outlook, pushing its stock down 3 per cent to $37.52.The clothing company continued to suffer from weak sales as consumers cut back on spending, although it did meet Wall Street expectations for profits.Several energy stocks were down as oil prices dropped slightly primarily due to increased supplies and easing geopolitical tensions.Transocean fell 2 per cent to $37.97, Cabot fell 1.5 per cent to $33.00 and Hess dropped 1 per cent to $98.81. Nabor Industries fell 2 per cent to $25.29 and Diamond Offshore dropped 2 per cent to $43.21.Shares in US electricity provider Dynegy, however, rose 9 per cent to $32.32 on news of a $6.25bn deal for a series of power plants from Duke Energy and a set of assets from Energy Capital.The company, which emerged from bankruptcy less than two years ago, forecast purchases would “significantly improve” its financial outlook by tripling its 2015 adjusted ebitda. Shares in Duke Energy were little changed at $72.87.Overall US equities were mixed following a speech on the US economy from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,988.41, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average loss 0.2 per cent at 17,001.22. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 4,538.55."
16;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2014-08-07T17:25:27Z;Duke Energy: safety in numbers;Regulated and unregulated US power businesses’ fortunes switched recently, and may again soon;Regulated or unregulated, that is the question for US power investors. The latest salvo in the tussle occurred on Tuesday as Duke Energy and NRG Energy both reported earnings. Duke derives nearly 90 per cent of its revenue from the regulated (read: highly protected) activities of transmitting and distributing electricity. Its second-quarter earnings were 28 per cent higher than last year partially driven by hotter than expected temperatures (utilities and power producers have opposite views on extreme weather than, say, retailers).NRG Energy, the large US “merchant” power producer that sells electricity at market prices, also reported both a strong quarter and reaffirmed its outlook for the year. Yet its shares have fallen a fifth since June. The reason: natural gas prices have also fallen a fifth since June, down to under $4/mbtu.Duke happens to be selling its own unregulated merchant power business in Ohio to cut its earnings volatility. NRG, along with a handful of other independent power producers and private equity firms would love to grab those operations. Generating and selling power at market rates was a good business earlier this year as natural gas prices, which drive electricity prices, spiked due to a brutal winter and dwindling supplies. But the reversal this summer has driven down NRG shares.Natural gas prices may remain depressed for an extended period. But Moody’s has just released a bullish report on the power producer sector. It believes cash flow for merchant power producers will jump 25 per cent year-over-year in 2014. Electricity prices should creep up because inefficient plants will be retired and growth regions such as Texas will demand more power. Not confident in that argument? Then turn your eyes to Duke and its 5 per cent dividend yield.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
17;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2014-07-03T17:11:50Z;Utility stocks cool with temperatures;;Energy utility company stocks cooled along with US midwest and east coast weather forecasts, with natural gas prices trading near their three-month lows.The price of gas fell to $4.36 midweek from a spike to a high of $6.15 in February following the severe winter weather patterns. In the past three days, the price had fallen sharply from $4.60, said Travis Miller, a Morningstar analyst.The drop was the consequence of cooler than expected weather forecasts, and demand for power to run air conditioners and fans fell.“This is the biggest drop since February after the polar vortex,” Mr Miller said. “Utilities had a big run in gas prices after the polar vortex. It had a big spike and a big drop.”It was not unusual to see investors rotating their funds from utilities into more growth-oriented sectors, particularly in a rallying market, he noted.The fallers in the S&P 500 were led by Public Service Enterprise Group, the New Jersey-based utility company, down 3 per cent to $38.16.The Tampa-based TECO Energy fell 2 per cent to 17.71. New Orleans-based Entergy fell 2 per cent to $76.97, and North Carolina’s Duke Energy fell 1 per cent to $71.39. Chicago-based Exelon fell 2 per cent to $33.97.By contrast, the S&P 500 gainers were led by Petsmart, the US’s largest retailer of pet items, rising 13 per cent to $67.28 after hedge fund Jana Partners expressed interest in buying the company.Jana Partners on Thursday disclosed a 9.9 per cent stake in Petsmart and pushed management to examine options for the company.Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, amassed its stake after a difficult first quarter for Petsmart in which sales missed expectations.Shares in the company have fallen roughly 12 per cent over the past year.A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made clear that, with its almost 10 per cent stake, Jana expected Petsmart to look at options including a sale, better operating performance and a return of capital to investors.Shares in tobacco groups Lorillard and Reynolds American jumped on merger speculation, after a CNBC report that the two were nearing a deal, following on rumours of talks earlier this year.Shares in Lorillard, maker of Newport and other brands, jumped 5 per cent to $64.41. Shares in Reynolds, maker of Camel, Pall Mall, Winston and others, rose 2 per cent to $61.56.Shares in truck manufacturer Paccar added 5 per cent to $67.25 after Volkswagen denied claims it was interested in making a bid for the company.Speculation of a potential bid for Paccar surfaced late on Wednesday after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said that the head of Daimler’s truck division had told investors that Volkswagen was eyeing a bid for the US truckmaker.Washington-based Paccar had been seen as offering the potential for VW to gain a foothold in the North American market where it lacks a presence.Volkswagen has been trying to integrate its truck operations more closely as it says that could help it achieve extra synergies of at least €650m annually within the next 10 to 15 years.That will help it boost its challenge to rivals Daimler and Volvo. VW’s truck assets comprise Scania, MAN and VW commercial vehicles.Christine Ritz, a VW spokeswoman, denied the reports to media outlets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to breach the 17,000 level for the first time, reaching 17,068.26 by close, buoyed by a much stronger than expected employment report.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,985.44 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 4,485.92.
18;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2014-06-12T17:32:33Z;US power producers: indie label;Volatility to be found in pure-play electricity generators;Market volatility may be at 10-year lows, but it is still there, if one knows where to look. One intriguing spot: the US independent power producers. IPPs, also known as “merchant” or “competitive” plants, generate electricity. Power transmission is then left to utilities whose returns are mandated by regulators. This week the third largest independent was created when PPL Corporation separated its generation business from its utility. It combined those generating assets with a group of power plants owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings to form a new public company, Talen.Talen and its IPP peers are a wager on the upward, if erratic, trajectory of electricity rates. IPPs have had a nice run of late – but the rally should not be enough to erase memories of high-profile busts.The integration of generation and distribution is fading. Exelon recently expanded its regulated utility exposure through the $4bn acquisition of Pepco. Duke Energy, meanwhile, is trying to sell 11 midwest power plants.PPL’s deal to jettison its power-generation business is cleverly structured. The combination with the Riverstone unit is tax-free and the 15 gigawatts of combined capacity is concentrated in two desirable regions: the densely populated mid-Atlantic and fast-growing Texas.In an era of low returns, investors prefer that utilities protect their dividend (PPL’s yield is 4 per cent) and leave power price speculation to the likes of Talen. Of late though, speculation has been a good business. Shares in NRG Energy, the largest IPP, are up a third in the past year. A harsh winter helped it boost its 2014 cash flow outlook by a fifth. Over the longer term, the hope is that the price of natural gas and electricity demand both edge up, combining to boost power rates. Volatility, though, cuts in both ways. Prominent power producers Energy Future Holdings, Dynegy and Calpine guessed wrong on electricity prices (and capital structure) and found bankruptcy.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex
19;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Duke directors targeted over ash spill;;Pension fund investors are trying to oust four board members at Duke Energy, the largest utility in the US, amid mounting criticism of its environmental record and poor oversight of its relationships with regulators.Their intervention comes after a Duke facility spilled 39,000 tons of toxic coal ash into the Dan River in North Carolina in February, and threatens to raise the temperature at the company’s forthcoming shareholder meeting, where dissident investors are already promising to press the company to reveal more details of its political contributions.Calpers, California’s state pension fund, and New York City’s retirement system jointly wrote to fellow shareholders on Monday urging them to withhold support for members of Duke’s regulatory policy and oversight committee at the meeting on May 1.“The financial, legal, regulatory and reputational risks for Duke Energy are serious and mounting,” Calpers corporate governance director Anne Simpson and New York City comptroller Scott Stringer wrote in their open letter.“We understand that Duke has more than 30 coal ash storage pits across its 14 coal plants in North Carolina, indicating that this issue has far reaching ramifications for the company’s risk management and performance.”A broken stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at the retired Dan River Steam Station in early February caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River – the third largest coal ash spill in US history. The basins hold ash created when burning coal for electricity generation.The incident came as Duke was already under fire for an allegedly cosy relationship with regulators in North Carolina, where the state governor, Pat McCrory, was a Duke employee for 28 years.Duke declined to respond to the pension funds’ public attack. Since the February spill, the company has assured North Carolina residents that drinking water is safe, and said it was working with environmental agencies to monitor wildlife in the Dan River and to clean up ash deposits.Mr Stringer said board members needed to be held accountable for oversight failures. “Shareowners rely on Duke’s board to provide effective, independent oversight of major risks, including the company’s environmental and regulatory conduct and compliance,” he said. “The board’s silence has been deafening in the lead up to and aftermath of the Dan River spill.”Calpers and New York City together hold about 4m Duke shares, amounting to 0.6 per cent of the company.They are targeting the four longest serving members of the regulatory policy committee, which has responsibility for environmental protection and safety issues: Alex Bernhardt, James Hyler, James Rhodes and Carlos Saladrigas.None of those directors has experience in hazardous waste disposal, environmental management or regulatory matters, or any coal industry expertise, the pension funds said.
20;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Duke chief predicts slow growth and consolidation in US;;US electricity companies are facing a future of slow demand growth that is likely to force further consolidation, the chief executive of the country’s largest utility has said.Lynn Good, who took over at North Carolina-based Duke Energy last year, said the company was planning for average annual demand growth of just 0.5-1 per cent per year.That compares with growth of 2-3 per cent in the 1990s and early 2000s, and 5-7 per cent in the 1960s and 1970s.Improvements in energy efficiency for buildings and appliances appear to have broken the traditional connection between electricity demand and economic growth.US electricity consumption has fallen in four of the five years to 2012, and is thought to have declined again in 2013, according to the country’s Energy Information Administration.The falls have come even as the US economy has recovered from the recession of 2007-09, and in spite of rising ownership of consumer electronics.Ms Good said: “Electricity is important: we all have our gadgets and devices. But we’re also replacing all of our lightbulbs. Every time we change out our refrigerator, it’s more efficient. Every time we move into a new building, it’s built more efficiently.”The slow demand growth outlook meant “the business case is ripe for consolidation”, she added, with larger companies able to cut costs by spreading their overheads across more customers, and to raise finance more cheaply.The US electricity industry has been on a trend of consolidation, with 244 investor-owned utilities in 1995 dropping to 193 in 2011, and in the past couple of years there have been some large deals.Duke became the largest US utility by market capitalisation, valued at about $48bn, as a result of the acquisition of Progress Energy for about $26bn, including about $12bn in debt, in a deal completed last year.Illinois-based Exelon also bought Maryland-based Constellation Energy for about $10.6bn including debt that same year.Late last year, MidAmerican Energy, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group, completed its acquisition of Nevada’s NV Energy for about $10.1bn including debt.However, securing regulatory approval for utility deals is often difficult. Duke was compelled to take steps in its acquisition of Progress to meet concerns about competition in North and South Carolina.Ms Good said: “It’s really hard to get these things done.”
21;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2014-01-05T17:59:03Z;Duke Energy chief steadies the ship as storms hit sector;;When Lynn Good took over as chief executive of Duke Energy last year, her appointment was seen as a move to steady the ship after the tempestuous final years of her predecessor Jim Rogers.Her chances of seeing out a quiet tenure are slim, however. The US electricity industry is facing its most turbulent conditions for decades.Mr Rogers was a controversial figure, for reasons including his outspoken stance on energy policy and Duke’s investment in an advanced coal-fired power plant at Edwardsport in Indiana, which cost 75 per cent more than was originally planned.He also led the $26bn takeover of Progress Energy that made North Carolina-based Duke the largest utility in the US, and in dramatic circumstances hung on as chief executive of the merged group after a boardroom coup on the day the deal was completed. The decision caused consternation among regulators, who had been told that Bill Johnson, the Progress chief executive, would take over.Ms Good, previously Duke’s chief financial officer, has sworn off emulating any of those moves, at least for the time being. She talks about focusing on relationships with customers, regulators and staff, rather than speaking out on the national and international stage, and is unenthusiastic about further attempts to push back the technological frontier.Nor is she in a hurry to do any more big deals. Although she argues that the business case for further consolidation in the US utilities industry is compelling, the regulatory hurdles are high. The Progress deal faced unexpected obstruction from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which forced a number of changes to Duke’s plans.“We were not anticipating Ferc challenges to the approval process. So as we think about the future of consolidation that Duke would be involved with, I think we would do a very thorough review of regulatory hurdles.”Yet while she may be cautious about high-profile moves, she is still facing some critical decisions. US utilities are grappling with changes including slow long-term demand growth, the shale gas revolution, and a raft of new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency.Above all, there is the rise of distributed generation: individuals and businesses installing their own solar panels or other sources to cut their reliance on the grid and sell some electricity of their own. According to some analysts and executives, it threatens to make the traditional utility business model unviable.To meet environmental regulations, Duke has already retired coal-fired plants with about 7,000 megawatts of capacity. Proposed rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions for new plants would make it very difficult to build any more coal plants to replace them.“I don’t see any new coal,” Ms Good says. Even the advanced integrated gasification combined-cycle plant built at Edwardsport would exceed the new greenhouse gas limits.Coal plants would have to be able to capture and store at least some of their carbon dioxide emissions to comply.“We don’t believe carbon capture is a proven scalable commercially available technology,” Ms Good says.“So there are no coal plants on the drawing board for Duke, which leaves us with gas, renewables and nuclear. And gas and renewables will lead, [because of] the expense of nuclear.”Distributed generation has as yet not made much headway in Duke’s home territory of North and South Carolina, but Ms Good says she is “watching closely” the places where it is growing fast, including Arizona, California and Germany.“The technology cost is coming down, customers are interested in distributed generation . . . So I think we need to embrace it,” she says.However, she adds that regulators need to make sure utilities can be rewarded for providing reliable power supplies.“If we just isolate distributed solar all by itself it does not work, without the utility around it. And so the utility needs to be paid for the services it provides,” she says.“It’s a discussion that we’re having with our regulators, because it’s going to be important over time.”For the future of Duke, Ms Good’s response to that threat is likely to be the most significant issue of all.
22;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;New Duke chief signals change from Rogers’ era;Good to be more ‘internally focused’ than her predecessor;Lynn Good, the new chief executive of Duke Energy, has signalled a change of management style from her predecessor, Jim Rogers, who attracted attention for his outspoken positions on energy policy and the takeover of Progress Energy last year.Ms Good, Duke’s chief financial officer who will take over as CEO on July 1, said she wanted to bring to an end “a period of uncertainty” in the company after the acquisition and continue the integration of the two businesses.She said she would be focusing on relationships with regulators, community leaders and customers.Mr Rogers is stepping down in accordance with an agreement with regulators, after retaining the CEO’s role in contentious circumstances last year.In politics and the industry, Mr Rogers is known for his support for action to address the threat of global warming caused by burning fossil fuels. He was suggested last year as a possible energy secretary in Barack Obama’s administration.By contrast, Ms Good said she would “think about being more internally focused”, at least in her initial time as CEO and would not expect to be staking out strong public positions.She will be paid a basic salary of $1.2m with potential bonus and long-term incentive plan of up to $6.9m, compared with Mr Rogers’ total 2012 remuneration of $8.7m.When Duke announced the deal to buy Progress for about $14bn in 2011, Bill Johnson, Progress’s CEO, was supposed to take over as head of Duke, with Mr Rogers staying on as chairman.Hours after the deal closed, however, Duke’s board voted to retain Mr Rogers and asked Mr Johnson to resign.The move raised concerns among regulators in Duke and Progress’s home state of North Carolina, which had approved the deal on the expectation that Mr Johnson would be chief.In November of last year, Duke agreed a settlement with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, under which Mr Rogers agreed to step down as chairman and chief executive by the end of 2013. The company said on Tuesday he would remain as chairman until the end of the year.Duke has resolved two difficult issues in recent months. In February it decided to retire its Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida, which has been shut down since 2009, because the cost of repairing cracks in its containment structure was uncertain and potentially very high.It has also recently started up its $3.5bn Edwardsport “clean coal” project in Indiana, an innovative coal gasification plant that cost almost double its original budget.Ms Good described the Crystal River decision – echoed in a similar retirement of the San Onofre nuclear plant in California by Edison International – as “situational”, based on the specific problems faced by that plant.She said Duke had “a very fine fleet” of 11 reactors, with licence extensions lasting until 2030 at the earliest and it would not be until the second half of the 2020s that the decisions on whether to keep them running would become “a bit tougher”.On Edwardsport, she said Duke would think carefully before investing in “first of its kind” technology.She added that one of the biggest issues facing the industry was slow demand growth, which created a “burning platform” that demonstrated the need to take cost out of the business. The investments Duke is making – typically in gas-fired plants – were mostly replacing older plants going out of service, she said.
23;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2013-05-15T09:14:53Z;US utilities’ outperformance fades away;Groups shed 4% in May after strong start to year;The record rally for US stocks that kicked off the year was driven by a historic outperformance from companies in the utilities sector, Wall Street’s hallmark defensive equity market bet.Utilities companies significantly, and unusually, outpaced the industry’s expected returns in a rising market during the four months through April, according to historical research compiled by AllianceBernstein.But the sector, which groups together slow-growth, high-yielding companies such as US electricity groups Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, has since weakened. After a ferocious start to the year, utilities companies have shed 3.3 per cent in May even as a broader market rally continues.Analysts said the early-year rally in utilities’ shares was driven by a hesitancy among investors to buy into riskier equities, a fear that has somewhat dissipated.The recent declines for the utilities sector have meant it is now underperforming the S&P 500, having risen 14.6 per cent in the year to date compared with a 16.3 per cent gain for the benchmark. But the healthcare sector, another defensive industry, still remains as the top performing industry this year.“Through much of history, the defensive sectors have tended to consistently underperform in a rising market,” said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein. “What was unique about the period through to the end of April was the very unusual outperformance of utilities and other defensive sectors.”Analysts said the gains were a result of a timid push into equities that helped stretch valuations in the companies beyond long-run price-to-earnings averages.Concerns that the US economy was headed for a spring slowdown have been allayed to some extent of late, as encouraging data on retail sales and employment have boosted investor confidence.Investors are seeking companies that are undervalued across all sectorsWhile utilities and other defensive sectors have weakened in recent days, the broad rally on the US market has been driven by soaring prices in stocks more sensitive to swings in the economy.Financials and companies that sell non-essential consumer goods have been the strongest gaining sectors so far in May. Analysts have said gains from companies in those industries and other cyclical sectors are more typical of a rising US market.“If you think about how the rally started, it was driven by investors who were chasing yield from other asset classes,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TDAmeritrade.“What has happened is that the market has found new momentum and now investors are seeking companies that are undervalued across all sectors, particularly ones that had been depressed in recent months.”
24;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2013-01-07T17:17:28Z;Contenders for Obama’s top jobs;;"Treasury: Tim Geithner has clearly signalled his intention to step down as Treasury secretary at the end of Mr Obama’s first term and is said to be keen to leave Washington as soon as possible – his family returned to New York last year. The top candidate to succeed him is Jack Lew, the president’s chief of staff. Although there will be a confirmation battle over whoever is selected for the sensitive position, Mr Lew has been confirmed by the Senate for previous positions he has held, notably deputy secretary of state and director of the Office of Management and Budget.Other names often mentioned for the job include Laurence Fink, chairman of BlackRock; Roger Altman of Evercore Partners; or a chief executive such as Kenneth Chenault of American Express and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg.Energy: Steven Chu is expected to return to academia after four tough years as energy secretary, which included a controversy over the Obama’s administration’s support for the failed solar-panel maker Solyndra. Contenders for the job include Kent Conrad, the retiring Democratic senator from North Dakota, and Jeff Bingaman, the outgoing chairman of the Senate energy committee. Jim Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy and a supporter of the president’s energy policies, has also been tipped as a contender.EPA: Lisa Jackson has announced she is stepping down as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency after the president’s State of the Union address later this month. Robert Perciasepe, the agency’s deputy administrator is often mentioned as a potential successor.Commerce: Rebecca Blank has been acting commerce secretary since John Bryson resigned last year after suffering seizures that caused him to have back-to-back car crashes. She could stay on, but other names in the ring include Ron Kirk, the US trade representative, and Jeff Zients, acting director of the budget office.Justice: Eric Holder has not given any clues about his future, but his four years as attorney-general have been plagued with controversy, especially over the botched “Fast and Furious” investigation in to gun trafficking on the US-Mexico border. Possible replacements include Janet Napolitano, currently homeland security secretary, and Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts.White House chief of staff: If Mr Lew moves to the Treasury, the job of running the White House will be open. Possible successors include Ron Klain, the veteran political operative who did the same job for vice-president Joe Biden, and Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate majority leader."
25;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2012-09-19T18:50:47Z;Long-term corporate debt sales hit $100bn;;Annual sales of 30-year US corporate debt have broken the $100bn mark for the first time since the start of the financial crisis, and are on course to surpass the previous record year set in 2007.The latest quantitative easing moves last week by the US Federal Reserve provided another incentive to companies, which are keen to lock in long-term funding at rock-bottom interest rates at a time when investors, particularly pension and institutional funds, are hungry for higher yields than the ones offered by top-tier government securities.“We are seeing nothing short of a stampede towards fixed income markets,” said Jason Brady, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “Companies are happy to take money at the lowest costs they’ve ever been, while investors’ insatiable demand for yield is also seen in their willingness to take the longer [dated] bonds,” he added.US utility Duke Energy and Swiss drugmaker Novartis were the latest to join a string of global corporations, including the UK’s SABMiller, United Technologies of the US and Brazil’s Vale, which sold a combined $103.2bn in 30-year debt this year up to Wednesday, according to Dealogic.The sales have already surpassed the entire amount sold in 2011 and may at this pace challenge the 2007 record of $125bn.The sweet spot opened for long-term borrowers at the start of the year when the Fed pledged to keep rates low until at least 2014, and the yield on the US Treasury long bond touched a record low of 2.44 per cent in July.The central bank extended the issuance boom last week after it announced a bond-buying programme aimed at keeping borrowing costs low for longer. Since then, companies have sold $1.62bn worth of 30-year paper.Long-term debt is particularly attractive to pension funds, as well as insurance companies. That group of investors tends to favour 30-year bonds because it matches the long-term nature of their obligations to retirees.US pension funds have bought only small amounts of Treasuries this year, while they have increased their holdings of corporate debt, according to Fed data.“Investors who have to carry long-term debt in their portfolios are lining up for those bonds because historically, sales of 30-year debt have lagged that of other maturities,” said Adrian Miller, a global markets strategist at GMP Securities.“In turn, companies with good balance sheets have absolutely no difficulty in selling 30-year debt, and, in fact, they keep doing so at lower and lower rates,” he said.The performance of the bonds has been strong. At 8.8 per cent, the year-to-date return on long-term investment grade debt far exceeds the 1.3 per cent for US Treasuries maturing in 20 years or more, according to Barclays.
26;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2012-08-13T21:39:04Z;JPMorgan in first debt sale since loss;;JPMorgan returned to the debt markets, selling $2.5bn worth of bonds to investors in its first such issuance since announcing a multibillion-dollar trading loss in May.The bank on Monday sold five-year bonds with a coupon of 2 per cent, the lowest ever for JPMorgan paper of similar maturity, according to Dealogic. The bonds were issued at a yield of 2.04 per cent, just 35 basis points above recent yields on its last five-year debt issue, sold in June 2011.The low coupon indicates that investors continue to pile into US bank paper despite a series of financial industry hiccups and the $5bn derivatives trading loss, known as the “London whale” loss, which has dogged JPMorgan for much of the year.Overall, US debt issuance is set for a strong week, with a host of companies including Duke Energy and General Motors Financial, joining JPMorgan to sell more than $5bn in debt on Monday.US bank bonds in particular have been enjoying a wave of investor popularity even after a rating agency downgrade and lacklustre earnings reports. The debt offers a return that outstrips the record low yields on offer from US Treasuries, and some money managers have argued that new regulation, including Dodd-Frank and higher capital levels, has made investing in bank bonds safer than ever.“When it comes to banks’ debt, some people can argue that on the regulation front, Dodd-Frank is becoming clearer and that reduces the overall risk for banks,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Chicago .“But in the case of JPMorgan, there’s something else at play: the too big to fail argument. For a lot of investors, obviously, events such as ‘the whale’ don’t matter. They actually think that’s just a detail and that this bank is just too big to fail.”The loss at JPMorgan, and comments from Sandy Weill, the former Citigroup chief executive, have combined to reignite the “too big to fail” debate in recent months. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, has argued that the size of his bank, one of the biggest in the US, allows it to provide better services for clients.Monday’s sale of five-year debt was the bank’s first bond issue since March, when JPMorgan offered $2bn worth of three-year notes. Its previous sale of five-year bonds traded at 1.69 per cent on Friday with a coupon of 3.15 per cent.Average yields for US bank paper are near record lows while the sector has outperformed the broader market this year. An index put together by Barclays touched 3.14 per cent last month, the lowest since the bank started to compile the data in 1973. Yields rose slightly since then and traded at 3.17 per cent on Friday.
27;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2012-08-13T16:20:43Z;US bond issuance set for strong week;;"US debt issuance was set for another strong week with companies looking to finalise deals ahead of the slowdown in capital markets activity that typifies the latter half of August.Both investment-grade and junk-rated companies are taking advantage of a sweet spot for issuance as corporate bond yields are near record lows, while there are strong flows from investors into debt fundsThis is resulting in strong demand for bonds as investors seek a higher incremental return than what is available for US Treasuries.Against the backdrop of a sluggish economy and declining corporate earnings, bonds are also seen as a better investment choice than equities.Among a host of deals, JPMorgan sold a $2.5bn five-year issue; there was a $1bn five-year deal from General Motors Financial; and Duke Energy priced a $1.2bn benchmark five- and 10-year issue.“We are anticipating a $20bn week of investment-grade issuance,” Mr Marrinan said.That would follow last week’s strong run of $27bn for investment-grade deals and some $13.5bn for high yield.Utility companies were prominent on Monday, with deals coming from Mississippi Power, Ameren Illinois and Pacific Gas & Electric.The deals came as activity usually shuts down during the last two weeks of August and the first week of September, with much of Wall Street and corporate America taking summer holidays.“It’s a bit unusual to see issuance so high at this time in August, but conditions are really favourable to issuers,” said Michael Collins, senior investment officer at Prudential Fixed Income.“There may be a sense of urgency from their part as US Treasury yields moved higher recently and markets tend to pull back a little in September after Labor Day.”Average yields on the Barclays US investment grade corporate bond index touched a new low of 2.92 per cent at the end of July.Last week, the average yield for the Barclays High Yield Index closed just shy of the all-time low of 6.61 per cent set in May 2011."

Its stock climbed 4.1 per cent to $34.12.JPMorgan Chase rose 1 per cent to $34.59 after The Wall Street Journal reported that the largest US bank is planning to claw back millions of dollars in stock from executives linked to the London chief investment office trading loss.The S&P financials index rose 0.8 per cent as other bank stocks joined the rally. Morgan Stanley rose 0.7 per cent to $13.81 and Bank of America increased 2 per cent to $7.63 but Citigroup erased earlier gains to close at $25.87, the same level it started the session.In broader markets, US stocks recovered losses in a volatile session in which the S&P 500 index fell as much as 0.6 per cent immediately after the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June meeting.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,341.45 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4 per cent to 12,604.53, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,887.98.The Fed minutes revealed that there was a strong bias on the FOMC towards stimulating the US economy more if economic data warranted it. A “few” of the 12 voting members thought that “further policy stimulus likely would be necessary, while “several others” said it might be needed if the economy lost momentum, risks to growth were worse or inflation looked set to remain below target.The Federal Reserve decided to extend “Operation Twist”– its programme of selling short-term securities and buying those with longer to run until maturity – at its June meeting, after the economy added 69,000 jobs in May, a pace too slow to keep up with population growth, and therefore bring down the unemployment rate.As the earnings season began in earnest, with Alcoa reporting results on Monday, investors remain worried about corporate profits after several large companies issued warnings citing the unfavourable business environment in Europe and Asia.“It is likely that the earnings season is not going to be robust and markets have already pulled back in anticipation of softer earnings,” said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Citi Investment Research.“The expectations are already pretty low and if earnings start coming in below that, we might see a sharper pullback.“However, we still see an upside in the markets because of the positive fundamentals, including central bank stimulus in Europe and Asia. And today’s Fed minutes will tell us more about the possibility of further quantitative easing, given that the most recent jobs report indicated the growth is very slow while inflation remains low.”Viacom shares fell 1.5 per cent to $48.98 after reports that DirecTV cut access to the network’s television channels in a dispute over fees.The failure by the satellite broadcaster and Viacom to forge a new deal over carriage fees meant almost 20m subscribers lost access to 17 Viacom networks.Nomura analysts, however, maintained a “buy” rating for Viacom. “We continue to think the stock, valued at nine times of 2013 estimated earnings, is attractive for patient investors,” the investment bank said.The battle between pay-TV companies benefited the internet content provider Netflix. The company’s shares paired some of their earlier gains to close 1.7 per cent higher at $81.64.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, was the worst performing stock among S&P 500 companies, dropping 8.37 per cent to $19.37. The company’s shares fell after Hhgregg, a rival, cut its full-year profits forecast amid sinking TV sales.

29;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Board doubts fail to stop Duke merger;;The boards of Duke Energy and Progress Energy pressed on with their planned merger in spite of concerns over their chosen chief executive’s suitability, the new chief executive of the enlarged group has told regulators.Jim Rogers was testifying before North Carolina’s energy utilities commission after it decided earlier this week to investigate why it had not been informed of the impending change of chief executive.The two companies had said throughout a regulatory approval process dating back to January 2011 that Bill Johnson, Progress Energy’s chief executive, would take the same role at the enlarged group after the deal completed. However, the merged company announced on the morning of July 3, hours after completion, that Mr Johnson had left “by mutual consent” and that Mr Rogers, who had been chief executive of Duke Energy, would instead take over.“We felt that completion of the merger was in the best interests of both companies, the shareholders and the communities,” Mr Rogers said.He said there had been discussion about how regulators would react to the change of chief executive, but a decision had been made that there was “nothing, really, to say”.“Almost regardless of who was the CEO, the over 200 commitments that we committed to would be fulfilled,” Mr Rogers said.No final decision on Mr Johnson’s replacement had been made until an executive session of a meeting of the new, merged company’s board on July 2 after the deal’s official closing at 4.02pm. Mr Rogers did not attend that session, he added.However, he said: “There were a series of things that had happened that led to our board, consistent with their fiduciary duty, changing their minds about the best way forward.” There had been no single event that had led the board to a “loss of confidence” in Mr Johnson’s ability to lead the combined group, Mr Rogers said, but “an accumulation of many factors”.Among the concerns were Mr Johnson’s management style and his ability to bring together the different cultures of the two power companies. The board had also been concerned about his ability to manage the safety of the combined company’s seven nuclear power plants.The all-share takeover turned the new, expanded Duke into the US’s largest electricity generator by installed capacity, covering large parts of the south-eastern US.The utilities commission started an investigation into the circumstances of Mr Johnson’s departure on July 6, saying it had been part of the two companies’ submissions when seeking merger approval that Mr Johnson would be chief executive. 
30;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Duke declines to explain chief’s exit;;Duke Energy, which this week acquired Progress Energy to form the US’s largest energy utility by revenues, has declined to explain the circumstances around the departure of the combined group’s chief executive hours after the deal was completed.Shares in Duke Energy fell 3.45 per cent on Friday, apparently as a result of investor confusion about the departure of Bill Johnson.The company said Mr Johnson, whom the two companies had designated as chief executive when the deal was announced in January last year, was leaving “by mutual consent”.It declined on Friday to elaborate on Tuesday’s statement about his departure and said: “We are not commenting on the board’s deliberations.”Mr Johnson had been Progress’s chief executive. Jim Rogers, who had been Duke Energy’s chief executive before the acquisition and became executive chairman of the combined group, will also serve as chief executive.News of Mr Johnson’s departure was included in the same press release in which the companies announced the successful conclusion of the long-running takeover process at just after midnight the previous night.Duke said then that the all-share acquisition, which had valued Progress at $26bn when the deal was first agreed, now valued the company at $32bn.Duke reiterated that its earnings guidance for 2012 – which stood at $4.20 to $4.35 per share after a three-for-one reverse stock split during the takeover – was unchanged.
31;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2012-03-04T17:00:48Z;High-yield stocks trail Wall St bull run;;The bull-run that has propelled Wall Street to its best start in 21 years has left one popular group of shares behind – dividend-paying stocks.In recent years shares in companies that pay high dividends, such as telecoms group AT&T and power operator Duke Energy, have became an alternative to low yielding US Treasuries, in particular among ageing investors who generally prefer income-producing assets.But the tide has shifted with investors moving away from defensive stocks, buoyed in part by better US jobs data this year, while contagion fears from the eurozone sovereign debt crisis have subsided.Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite benchmarks have gained over 25 per cent since October, while the S&P Aristocrats Index – which tracks companies that have increased pay-outs every year for at least a quarter century – has lagged after two years of strong outperformance.The gap is widening this year, with non-dividend paying S&P stocks higher on average by 17.2 per cent, while dividend-yielding stocks are only up 7.9 per cent, according to data compiled by Factset.“High-dividend companies were at the forefront of investors’ strategy when markets were sloppy and people rushed to more defensive sectors,” said Michael Mullaney, a fund manager at Fiduciary Trust Co. “The strategy now is more risk-on, which doesn’t favour those stocks.”The five S&P stocks with the highest dividend yields have all seen their share prices fall this year. Frontier Communications, for example, the highest dividend paying stock in the rank, is down 12.3 per cent year-to-date.Also weighing on companies that pay solid dividends have been questions about whether they can expand their profits in the coming quarters.“Companies have to generate the earnings to pay for them and the outlook hasn’t been so great for some of the more defensive names this year,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group.He said investors should not completely shun dividend-paying stocks in defensive sectors at a time when high oil prices may slow down the economy.Further spikes in crude could also spark volatility across equity markets and boost the appeal of defensive stocks.“We believe there will be a return of volatility by late spring or early summer that is likely to put defensive names back into favour,” said Oliver Pursche, a fund manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services.More than 200 S&P companies currently offer a better return than the 10-year Treasury note yield of 2 per cent. Moreover, 58 S&P companies pay a dividend yield in excess of 4 per cent.“There’s no such thing as a risk-free stock. You can always loose capital,” said Mr Mullaney at Fiduciary. “But bring me Verizon and A&T, with a combined 5 or 6 per cent yield, and I would much rather buy them as a long-term investment, than buy a 10-year Treasury note.”
32;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T17:16:07+0000;Verizon and AT&T: it’s not just the yields;Two big high-yielding US telecoms groups may hold risks after good dividend run;The past year has been good for big companies that pay big dividends. There are 27 US companies with enterprise values greater than $40bn paying dividends over 3 per cent, according to Capital IQ. Over the past 12 months these have returned 16 per cent to shareholders, on average, compared with the S&P 500’s 5 per cent. Stocks as diverse as Philip Morris, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Duke Energy, Intel and Chevron have all delivered great performances.After such a good run, however, the big-cap yield trade may be concealing risks. Consider two examples: Verizon and AT&T, the big, high-yielding US telecoms groups. They have followed the larger trend, returning 19 and 14 per cent, respectively, for investors over the last year.The biggest flag would be if these two companies’ free cash flows did not comfortably cover their payouts. On first blush, they appear to do just this. In recent years, AT&T’s dividend has absorbed about two thirds of free cash flow. At Verizon, only about a third of reported free cash flow has gone in dividends historically, but there is a catch: Verizon owns only 55 per cent of its wireless business (Vodafone owns the rest) which account for most of the cash. Bernstein Research estimates that once the minority stake is backed out, Verizon’s free cash flow only just covered its dividend payments in 2011 (though the cash flow picture will improve in 2012).That leaves little room for error at Verizon (which reports on Tuesday). And there is reason to wonder if dividend growth may be limited at both companies, because revenue growth is threatened. Wireless data growth has accounted for essentially all the sales growth in recent years, and it is now decelerating. The failure of the T-Mobile/AT&T merger could keep price competition humming, too. Investors must keep industry fundamentals, not just yields, in mind.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

But in the three months to November 26, gross margin declined 76 basis points to 24.3 per cent, as Thanksgiving promotions and the cost of free shipping for online shoppers took their toll.“This lower gross margin, we believe, will be a trend in both consumer electronics and across retail as the cost of sales increases, as the internet, a lower margin sales channel, continues to hurt margins,” said David Strasser, retail analyst at Janney.Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 fell 2 per cent, falling more than any other sector, as nationwide retail sales increased just 0.2 per cent in November, 0.4 percentage points lower than forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.Urban Outfitters was a rare bright spot. It climbed 5.3 per cent to $28.11, as the company said same-store sales in the fourth quarter would show “mid single-digit” growth compared with the same period in 2010, higher than analysts were projecting.Christian Buss, a Credit Suisse retail analyst, warned the group may face margin compression. “Our visits to stores highlight a highly promotional environment, particularly at Anthropologie,” he told clients.“We believe earnings flow through from the improved comparative same store sales may fall short of expectations. Our model is for gross margin of 34.8 per cent, down 480bp year on year.”The Dow Jones fared better than the S&P 500 falling just 0.6 per cent to 11,954.94.

34;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
35;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Wells Fargo sells $1.5bn of unsecured debt;;Wells Fargo, the largest US bank by market value, has sold $1.5bn of five-year senior unsecured notes at 175 basis points over comparable Treasuries, underscoring the ability of US banks to secure funding at a time when their European competitors are struggling to raise money.US banks’ cost of funds last quarter dropped 20bp from last year to 0.7 per cent, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a US bank regulator, the lowest quarterly figure recorded in data going back to 1984.The spread between US bank debt and comparable Treasury securities stood at 386bp as of Friday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. European bank spreads were at 434bp over government securities.However, because US banks are sitting on a record $10tn in deposits, they have only raised $106bn in debt this year, according to Dealogic. About $14bn of that has come in the past four months. European banks have issued more than $659bn in debt this year.“US banks have been virtually nonexistent in funding markets, not because they don’t have access but because they have more money than they know what to do with,” one senior banker said.Over the summer, spreads on European bank debt were narrower than those of their US counterparts as US banks suffered from the aftershocks of a US fiscal debate that ultimately led to a credit downgrade of US sovereign debt. But the eurozone debt crisis has changed that.Wells Fargo’s notes were issued at a higher spread than its previous five-year debt offering in March last year. But the spread was narrower than that of other large US banks. The offering came a week after the San Francisco lender’s debt was downgraded by Standard & Poor’s.Wells issued the debt on Monday with a 2.625 per cent coupon, bringing down its borrowing costs from March 2010, when the lender last issued five-year debt in 3.625 per cent notes.“Of the four largest US banks, we are most impressed with Wells from a credit perspective,” said Jim Leonard, bank credit analyst at Morningstar. “Wells Fargo has a clear funding cost advantage, as low-cost deposits fund its entire loan book and approximately 75 per cent of its earnings assets.”Mr Leonard said Wells’s notes are priced “significantly tighter” than JPMorgan Chase’s five-year notes, which trade at about 220bp over Treasuries, he added.John Stumpf, Wells chief executive, is today expected to address investors at a Goldman Sachs banking conference.The Wells issuance was one of Monday’s largest deals. Duke Energy, Tencent Holdings and Noble Energy were among the companies that issued debt. Companies were expected to sell more than $9.6bn of bonds as of Monday’s close, the largest amount since November 14.
36;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-12-05T22:45:37Z;Rebound spurs $10bn of corporate bond issues;;Companies were expected to sell more than $9.6bn of bonds on Monday as issuers including Wells Fargo, the US largest home lender, took advantage of the past week’s market rally, which brought down borrowing costs and helped boost appetite for riskier assets.As of late afternoon in New York, companies had already priced about half of the day’s expected total, making it the busiest day for US investment-grade issuers since November 14, when $10.24bn worth of investment-grade debt was sold. That level is still far from the $17.6bn mark reached on January 4, according to data compiled by Dealogic.With fewer than 20 business days left in 2011, more issuers may sell debt this week to take advantage of lower borrowing costs.Duke Energy, Tencent Holdings and Noble Energy were among the companies that issued debt earlier in Monday’s session.US corporate and junk bond markets have slowly rebounded from the lows hit in early October when fears about Europe’s debt crisis intensified. Global markets extended last week’s gains on Monday and government bond yields fell sharply in both the US and Europe.As of the start of the month, total corporate debt issuance in the US stood flat at about $1,000bn versus 2010, according to data from Standard & Poor’s. In recent months, volatility in the financial markets had kept many corporate issuers on the sidelines. This has been compounded by so-called blackout periods, when companies cannot sell debt close to their earnings announcements, resulting in a significant backlog of bond deals as the end of the year approaches. A syndicate executive at one large bank said he expects up to $15bn in issuance in the US investment-grade debt market alone this week.“With the end of the year and the holidays approaching, the calendar [for issuance] is very limited. Companies may take the opportunity now to come to markets,” said Richard Peterson, director of markets at Standard & Poor’s.In one of the largest deals on Monday, Wells Fargo sold $1.5bn of 2.625 per cent unsecured five-year notes, at 175 basis points over comparable Treasuries. The San Francisco-based home lender last issued five-year debt in March 2010, when it offered $1.25bn in 3.625 per cent notes, to yield 123bp over Treasuries, according to Bloomberg data.Monday’s sale came one week after S&P downgraded the bank from double A minus to A plus, based on the rating agency’s revised bank criteria.
37;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Speculators return in wake of Enron;;"The reverberations were felt up and down the streets of downtown Houston when Enron collapsed 10 years ago, shattering confidence in the energy trading market on which the company had been built.Competitors to Enron, ranging from Dynegy to El Paso, had also diversified into energy trading. They hoped to mimic Enron’s shift growth from slow and steady businesses, such as power production and pipelines, into higher gear and higher risk trading. And it had worked – for a time.“There was a lot of trading for trading sake,” says Mark Williams, a finance lecturer at Boston University’s School of Management, a former energy trading floor executive and author of Uncontrolled Risk about the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Utilities didn’t really understand what they were getting into,” Mr Williams says. “Enron was a high risk hedge fund disguised as a diversified energy company.”Some 500 companies had been approved by regulators to trade energy, he says. And as volumes built up, along with an eagerness to build up ""brag-a-watts"" based on how many trades they executed, so did volatility.Even as investors piled into these seemingly high growth companies, the credit rating agencies downgraded their ratings, red-flagging them as increasingly high-risk, albeit not in danger of imminent collapse.“The trades were creating no economic value except flipping electrons,” Mr Williams says, adding, “All of a sudden, these smaller trading subsidiaries could undermine the credit worthiness of the larger parent companies.” And they did.As Enron’s faulty accounting was revealed, fears about what these energy trading subsidiaries had been built on surfaced. Investors fled the sector, pushing share prices down to below the cost of a cup of coffee.Companies found themselves with billions of dollars in debt and obligations – in Dynegy’s case $14bn – and they were forced to abandon their trading businesses and sell assets to survive. Thousands of people in Houston alone lost their jobs as the sector imploded.“When Enron blew up, it took down, or took out of energy trading, Dynegy, Duke, PG&E, Mirant, Aquila, El Paso,” says Karl Miller, a former El Paso executive and now a managing partner at Newco Energy Acquisition Holdings. “They did not have the credit capacity to stay in the game. And there was market pressure to get out of the business.”Mirant, NRG, NEG and Calpine followed Enron into bankruptcy.Dynegy, which was the biggest rival to Enron and made a failed bid to rescue its competitor, has managed to stay out of bankruptcy for the past decade. But its chief executive, Bruce Williamson, left the company this year after shareholders refused his plan to merge with a stronger partner, leaving its future uncertain.“It has been a slow bleed for a former energy giant that lost its way,” Mr Williams says. “Dynegy's downfall was moving into electricity trading.”A trader at a major commodities dealer says those who continued to trade energy focused mostly on lower risk physical assets, backing away from speculative trading. Banks and hedge funds moved in to dominate the energy trading business.Yet they refused to make a market in every product, as Enron did. “There is no marketplace like that today,” the trader says. “Nobody is as big as Enron was and willing to provide that service to provide liquidity and make markets in many different products.”On top of that, new regulation aimed at limiting another Enron, such as Dodd-Frank, has built more transparency into the system, according to John England, a partner in the oil and gas practice at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm.""I think people have put more systems, processes and controls around energy trading,"" Mr England says.Nonetheless, Julian Dumoulin-Smith, director of equity research in the Electric Utilities & IPPs Group at UBS Securities, says there is a growing queue of groups interested in trades beyond physical assets.Constellation Energy is one name that crops up as showing interest, along with a host of Europeans: Mercuria, one of the biggest energy trading houses in the world; Arcadia Petroleum, the oil trading house; Glencore, the commodities group.Mr Miller, the former El Paso executive, says: “European utilities are starting to step into the US market and flex some of their balance sheets.”RWE, the German power company; EON, Germany’s largest utility; and EDF, France’s state-owned energy group; are showing an interest, he says, as well as Gazprom Marketing & Trading, the US arm of the world’s biggest natural gas producer, majority owned by the Russian government.With the renaissance in US oil and gas production, driven by the unlocking of hydrocarbons from tightly packed shale rock, there will be a growing need to trade and market around energy in the US, Mr Miller says. And as this physical market builds volumes, increasingly speculative trading will grow, as well, he says. After all, that is where the ""real money"" is made – in risky transactions.“We have recently seen some companies going to banks to find a specialised derivatives trader to build out that speculative trading platform again,” the trader from the commodities house says. “It’s almost come full circle.”"
38;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-11-22T17:47:05Z;US utilities risk backlash, says report;;Utility bills for US consumers are set to rise more rapidly as companies meet new environmental requirements and invest in ageing infrastructure, creating a risk of political and public backlash, a leading consultancy has warned.Mounting customer discontent could lead to regulators clamping down on corporate earnings or demanding greater benefits for consumers before they approve merger and acquisition deals.Public satisfaction with electricity suppliers has already been declining in recent years as bills have risen.Michael Britt of Oliver Wyman, the consultancy, said there could be a sharper “rate shock” to come.The consultancy calculates that average bill increases would need to accelerate to 5.5 per cent a year to pay for strengthening the power grid and meeting new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency on emissions from coal-fired power plants.Electricity price inflation at that rate could lead to utility bills leapfrogging expenditures such as meals out and vehicles to become the sixth-largest cost in US household budgets.In the European Union, energy bills have become an increasingly acrimonious political issue, and there are signs of similar tensions flaring in the US.A group called the Raging Grannies, for example, has been protesting against the 15 per cent rate increase in North Carolina proposed by Duke Energy, now in the process of taking over Progress Energy in a $26bn deal.Consumer opposition has also hit Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities’ plan to buy neighbouring NStar for $4.7bn. Hundreds of thousands of Northeast customers were left for several days without power after tropical storm Irene in August, and then again after a snowstorm in October.Travis Miller of Morningstar, the investment research group, said: “Regulators have never been eager to raise rates for customers, but the balance for them is getting tougher. They are forceful in demanding infrastructure investments to improve customer service, but they are also demanding the lowest rates possible.”He pointed to the rate decisions facing Duke, and other companies such as Xcel Energy of Minnesota, Westar Energy of Kansas and National Grid of the UK in New York, as test cases of regulators’ attitudes.Other factors likely to drive up bills include rising natural gas prices, which at about $3.30 per million British thermal units are well below what many analysts see as a sustainable long-run level.Renewable portfolio standards, which compel generators to produce a set proportion of their power from sources such as wind and solar, can also increase electricity prices because they are often higher cost than coal or gas-fired generation.Steve Sawyer of the Global Wind Energy Council, an industry group, said that in areas of strong wind and plentiful land, such as west Texas or Colorado, wind power could be cheaper than fossil fuel generation even without subsidies.However, he added, costs would be higher in the Pacific states or in the north-east.Mr Britt said utilities would have to work with regulators and politicians to explain the impact of energy policy decisions such as emissions regulations.“They need to understand that the cost of ‘having it all’ may be too great for consumers,” he said.
39;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-11-17T10:59:22Z;US hotrod plants turn to ‘uprates’;;"Nuclear engineers in America today have become like custom car mechanics. With the great majority of US electricity companies deciding that new reactors are too expensive to build, the industry’s focus has been on squeezing more power out of its existing fleet. Like hotrods, US nuclear plants are being tuned and tweaked for maximum performance.Cheaper, simpler and more flexible than new plant construction, “uprates” to increase a plant’s output by installing new equipment are generally much more attractive to investors. Exelon, the largest US nuclear generator, which embarked on its second programme of uprates two years ago, argues that they are one of the most cost-effective means available for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power generation.The latest new nuclear plant to come on line in the US was Watts Bar 1, in Tennessee, in 1996. Since then, though, the country has added about 4,400MW of additional nuclear capacity through uprates; equivalent to four new reactors.However, this apparent miracle source of cheap power is also exhaustible: there are limits to how far any reactor can have its electricity output boosted.For new nuclear construction in the US, the most significant reactors have not been the ones that melted down at Fukushima, but the new ones under construction at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France, which have gone far behind schedule and over budget.The biggest problem is not public resistance to nuclear power and concerns about safety, but the reluctance of investors to finance multibillion-dollar projects that carry such huge commercial risks.Worldwide, the nuclear industry invariably has heavy government involvement, whether through state ownership or intervention in the market. The more laisser faire approach of the US exposes private sector investors, both shareholders and lenders, to the risk of failure.Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a think-tank that promotes energy efficiency and renewable power, says: “There is too much cost and financial risk to attract investors to nuclear. Not a single new nuclear plant is being built anywhere in a wholly free-market transaction.”The two nuclear construction projects that are making real progress in the US, Southern Company’s plan for two new reactors at the Vogtle plant in Georgia, and Scana’s for two more at the Summer plant in South Carolina, both rely on significant participation by public sector utilities and favourable attitudes from regulators, allowing costs to be passed on to customers. Vogtle is also backed by an $8.33bn federal government loan guarantee, standing behind more than half the project’s $14bn cost and putting taxpayers’ money at risk in the event of a default.Even so, the companies are still facing significant commercial risks.It is understandable that Tom Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, has a TV screen in his office where he can watch the progress at the Vogtle site around the clock: his future will depend on the project’s success. Southern’s commitment, based on its 45.7 per cent stake in Vogtle, is $6.1bn; about one-sixth of its market capitalisation of $37.5bn.For the much smaller Scana, the commitment is even greater. It expects to invest $5.8bn as its 55 per cent share of the $10bn Summer project: more than its $5.5bn market capitalisation. Moody’s, the rating agency, downgraded Scana’s debt in September, describing its nuclear plans as “transformative” and “out of scale to the size of the company”.Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, is now a co-chair of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, an industry-backed group that campaigns for nuclear power, in part because of its role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He argues that the lack of effective risk-sharing between investors, companies and government is standing in the way of a revival of nuclear investment.“The capital markets are nervous,” he says. “The piece that has to come is a clear signal from government that it will back the industry with loan guarantees.”As things stand, he says, the conditions and administrative complexity attached to loan guarantees have in some cases actually made them a deterrent to investment, rather than an incentive.Power uprates, on the other hand, do not need loan guarantees. The increased capacity is much cheaper than for new build – Exelon has estimated an investment cost of $2.2m-$2.5m per added megawatt, about half that of a new reactor – and also comes in bite-size chunks rather than a single lump. An uprate project will typically add tens of megawatts to a plant’s capacity, and at most about 300MW.Exelon’s plan to add up to 1300MW, about 8 per cent, to its nuclear capacity by 2017 though 17 uprates at nine plants is not going to transform the company, but is a much more reassuring prospect for investors than if it had decided to add the same amount by building a new plant.As the largest unregulated generator in the US, selling its power on the open market, Exelon is exposed to swings in electricity prices, and the slump in those prices sent its shares down from more than $91 at their peak in 2008 to about $44 today.Hugh Wynne, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, says the nuclear uprate plan is a way to offer growth to shareholders, while avoiding the cost and risk of new nuclear plant construction. Similarly, Exelon’s $7.9bn attempt to buy Maryland-based Constellation Energy, now under review by regulators, would add 3.7GW of nuclear capacity to Exelon’s 17.0GW nuclear fleet at a fraction of new build costs.“That’s the strategy: they are grinding earnings growth out of uprates, out of some relatively small renewables projects, and out of expected cost savings from the Constellation deal,” he says.“And that makes sense. The companies that tend to get their comeuppance are the ones that bet the farm.”There will come a time, however, when all the possible uprating has been done. The modifications involved typically fall into two categories: fitting more advanced instruments, to allow reactors to be run at finer tolerances, and using larger and more sophisticated equipment such as turbines and transformers on the power generation side of the plant. It is the second type that can deliver the largest output gains, but the maximum increase that has been approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is 20 per cent.There may be further technological fixes available in the future.Lightbridge, a company that is developing an innovative nuclear fuel that could deliver a 17 per cent output increase from existing reactors, this month signed up a new advisory board including executives from Exelon and Duke Energy and Dominion, two other leading nuclear generators, in a sign of their interest in the new fuel.Ultimately, however, the US will be forced to address the question of how many new nuclear plants it wants.“It’s a bit odd that the most powerful country in the world should be outdone for nuclear construction by so many other places,” says Mr Moore.“There are countries that are building more reactors, and many that want to start producing nuclear power for the first time. A lot of other countries have made very significant progress.”"
40;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Devon faces US tax if it repatriates cash pile;;Devon Energy will have to pay US corporation tax on the $6.5bn cash it holds outside the US if it repatriates it, the energy company’s chief executive has said.It amassed the money last year when it withdrew from deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the oil and gas industry outside the US and Canada to concentrate on onshore oil and gas development in North America.Many US companies, including Microsoft, Google and Apple, have large offshore cash holdings that would be liable for tax if brought onshore, inspiring a campaign by businesses for tax reform that would encourage that money to flow back home. Under the US system, which taxes a company’s worldwide earnings regardless of where they are made, companies are allowed an exemption for profits not repatriated to the US.Devon sold assets in Brazil, Azerbaijan and the Gulf for more than $10bn, raising about $8bn after local taxes. Overseas proceeds brought home will face US corporation tax of up to 35 per cent, although a deduction is allowed for foreign taxes already paid.Devon is in a tight spot because it has tightened its strategy to focus exclusively on North America, so it has few attractive options for using it.John Richels, chief executive, said he was hoping for tax reform that would make it possible to bring the cash into the US without paying the full rate of tax on it. “We’re hoping the Obama administration sees the wisdom in bringing that money back to the US. There’s $1,500bn sitting offshore right now. It makes sense to get that back to stimulate the economy.”Senators Kay Hagan, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, last week presented a bill that would create a temporary tax “holiday”, allowing earnings to be repatriated at a tax rate of just 8.75 per cent for a year.The move was welcomed by several business leaders, including executives at Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, and Duke Energy, but still faces scepticism in Congress and the administration.
41;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-10-06T22:47:09Z;Bipartisan US push on overseas profits tax;;Efforts by US multinationals to secure a tax holiday on overseas profits were bolstered by a fresh bipartisan push in the Senate but the legislation’s ability to pass muster with the rest of Congress and the Obama administration remains in doubt.Kay Hagan, a Democratic senator from North Carolina, and John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, locked arms on Thursday to present a bill that would temporarily tax earnings generated internationally at rate of 8.75 per cent.At the moment, US companies pay as much as 35 per cent in taxes on income generated from their foreign operations when it is brought back to the US. Supporters of the holiday argue that this encourages businesses to avoid repatriating cash that is needed to prop up the domestic economy.“A trillion dollars is locked out overseas,” Ms Hagan told the Financial Times. “This is truly an opportunity to inject that into this anaemic recovery,” she said.Five other senators – including one Democrat and four Republicans – immediately signed on to the plan.Although the new proposal in the Senate was greeted warmly by campaigners for the tax holiday in corporate America – including top executives at Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft, and Duke Energy – the path to enactment remains highly uncertain.In 2004, under President George W. Bush, the US pushed through a similar tax holiday, and the results were mixed, prompting some lawmakers and the Obama administration to be sceptical of the benefit of doing it again.The FT and ProPublica dissect the battle by banks and companies to preserve tax tactics that save them billions of dollars“There is no evidence that it created jobs and in fact most of the largest beneficiaries actually cut jobs in 2005-06, despite overall economy-wide job growth in those years,” said a US Treasury department spokeswoman on Thursday.There is also a possible “moral hazard” problem with a temporary holiday, in that it could encourage companies to park their profits overseas as they await the next year-long break.The bill proposed by Ms Hagan and Mr McCain tries to address some of the shortcomings of the 2004 plan, offering additional incentives for companies to create jobs, while imposing penalties on those that repatriate earnings but slash payrolls. If businesses add to their employee base, they can cut their taxes on foreign earnings to 5.25 per cent. If they shrink employment, their gross income for tax purposes is increased by $75,000 per job loss.But those changes may not be sufficient. Some senior Republicans in the House of Representatives back a repatriation holiday but, in the Senate, it faces significant obstacles. Democratic leaders there have said they would consider a temporary tax holiday but only in conjunction with other measures that Republicans may oppose, such as new infrastructure investment.The Obama administration has said it would consider changing the tax treatment of foreign earnings but only as part of a much broader corporate tax reform, which may be a long time coming.The Treasury has been working on its own plan for corporate tax reform – which could potentially include a switch to a territorial system that does not tax foreign earnings, with some restrictions – but that has not been released yet.
42;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-08-28T22:02:36Z;US coal-fired power stations under threat;;The US power industry is facing its biggest shake-up since the Three Mile Island accident of 1979.That incident killed off investment in new nuclear plants for a generation. This time, it is coal-fired power stations that are under threat.New regulations governing pollution from coal plants that have been proposed by the US government’s Environmental Protection Agency could force up to 20 per cent of those plants to shut down, according to analysts and industry executives.The American Legislative Exchange Council, a free market campaign group, has described the impending upheaval as a “train wreck” that will cost jobs, send power prices soaring and lead to blackouts.Concern over these effects has led to several pieces of legislation being put forward in Congress to curb the EPA’s powers and stop the new rules.Whether the pollution limits will in fact have such a devastating impact is debatable. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service argued in a report circulated last week that the most alarming forecasts were based on exaggerated assumptions about the EPA’s plans.Nevertheless, the financial impact on US power companies could be significant.The new regulations, intended to reduce the damage to public health from industrial pollution, include tighter restrictions on toxic chemicals in power plants’ waste gases, on water use and on the disposal of coal ash.The first to take effect is the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which cuts the permitted emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, the gases that cause acid rain. It was set out in detail in July and will be enforced from the start of 2012.There are several ways that generators can meet the CSAPR’s requirements.They may be able to buy more pollution permits in the trading scheme for acid gas emissions.They can burn more low-sulphur Powder River Basin coal from Wyoming.They can invest in more flue gas desulphurisation equipment, or make more use of the equipment that is fitted already, or run their plants without it less often.However, all of those options have costs attached and ultimately it may not be worth keeping older and less efficient coal plants open.Those coal plants are likely to be replaced by a new wave of gas-fired plants, which have lower emissions and can take advantage of low fuel prices resulting from the shale gas boom.The consequences for electricity companies will vary.Daniel Ford, of Barclays Capital, says those with regulated businesses should be able to pass the extra costs on to consumers.For unregulated businesses, it will depend on their fuel mix. Companies that are predominantly gas-fired or nuclear will probably gain because the new EPA rules will raise power prices but the coal-heavy ones are likely to be losers.Analysts at Sanford Bernstein highlight Southern Company, American Electric Power and the combination of Duke Energy and Progress Energy as likely to have to close the largest amount of generation capacity in absolute terms.Scana, Integrys, GenOn, FirstEnergy, Southern and AEP face losing the most as a proportion of their total capacity.Companies have become increasingly vocal about their concerns.AEP said in June that the new regulations could cost it $6bn to $8bn before the end of the decade, adding that it planned to close five coal-fuelled plants.Michael Morris, AEP chairman and chief executive, last month called the timetable for compliance “as close to lunacy as you can get”.Probably the most sensitive issue is Texas, where the largest utility, Energy Future Holdings, is already struggling under the burden of the debt it took on in its $45bn leveraged buy-out in 2007.Concern over the threat of blackouts in the state is already high this summer, because of the strain created by high temperatures – which lead to heavier use of air-conditioning – and unexpected plant shutdowns.The issue has been given an extra political edge by the emergence of Rick Perry, the Texas governor, as possible Republican presidential candidate.Mr Perry has already struck out at EPA regulations for killing jobs and characterised the rules as “destructive federal over-reach”.EFH has also protested furiously, saying: “The severe and disproportionate impact on Texas is unjustified and the timeline unreasonable and will harm Texas jobs, prices, and power supply.“EFH and other companies have asked the EPA to delay implementation of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and are now waiting for a reply.If the EPA refuses, it is likely that some companies and states will take legal action.Brannin McBee, of Bentek Energy, a consultancy, says he expects the EPA will give the industry more time, perhaps by phasing in its new restrictions over a number of years.There is simply not enough capacity in the US to fit all the desulphurisation equipment and build the new gas-fired plants and pipelines that will be needed within the EPA’s timetable.However, he adds, the EPA seems determined to press ahead with its strategy.“The general consensus in the industry is that the new rules will have to be delayed somehow,” he says.“But we do believe the new limits will come in some way or another.”
43;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-08-07T18:25:06Z;M&A by US energy utilities at four-year high;Broader, more diversified businesses the goal;Mergers and acquisitions by US energy utilities rose to their highest level for four years in the first half of this year, emphasising how consolidation is being driven by low prices for natural gas, demand for heavy investment and more willingness by regulators to accept deals.PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, says $52bn of deals for electricity and gas companies were announced in the first six months of this year – the strongest such period for M&A since 2007.The largest deals announced to date this year have been Duke Energy’s $26bn acquisition of Progress Energy, Exelon’s $11.5bn deal for Constellation Energy, and AES’s $4.7bn takeover of DPL. All the valuations include debt.John McConomy, PwC’s US utilities and power transactions leader, said recent deals were often driven by energy companies’ attempts to broaden and to diversify their businesses.The shale gas boom, which has caused a rise in US natural gas production as the industry has opened up reserves in shales and other rocks previously unviable economically, has driven down prices for both gas and electricity.Companies that have relied on power generation for a high proportion of their earnings have sought to cut their exposure to electricity price risk by acquiring a larger customer base – which generally delivers more stable returns – or regulated businesses that earn profits agreed by state authorities.Mr McConomy said: “For some companies Wall Street has been saying to them: ‘You are too heavily weighted in the non-regulated business, and you need some more regulated earnings.’”The objective of securing more regulated business drove the first substantial acquisition of a UK utility by a US energy company for about a decade: PPL’s $6.4bn purchase of Central Networks, the British electricity distribution company, from Eon of Germany.Another factor behind recent deals has been the need for companies to grow so they have the financial strength needed to fund heavy investment programmes to replace ageing assets and to meet fresh environmental regulations.Mr McConomy said it was not yet clear what effect the recent market turmoil would have on the sector. “Most utilities in the sector feel pretty positive about the future,” he said. “If we see more rock and rolling [in the markets] we’re going to have to see how that affects things.”M&A in the sector slumped after the financial crisis that began in 2007, recovered in 2010 and then gathered strength in 2011.
44;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-04-29T02:45:20Z;Exelon to buy Constellation in $7.9bn deal;;Exelon, the largest US power company, is buying its rival Constellation Energy in a $7.9bn all-share deal. The acquisition would diversify Exelon’s business, give it more retail customers, and allow it to use its greater financial strength to improve profitability.After years of slow progress in the consolidation of the fragmented US utility sector, with regulators thwarting several proposed deals, the pace of merger and acquisition activity has accelerated since last year.The Exelon/Constellation deal follows Duke Energy’s move in January to acquire Progress Energy, offering $13.7bn in stock and taking on $12.2bn in net debt, and the agreement last week for AES to buy Ohio-based DPL for $4.7bn including debt.In all three deals there are common themes. Weak electricity prices are pushing generation companies to reduce their exposure to power markets and seek more stable retail businesses and regulated assets, said industry bankers.Creating larger utilities with access to cheaper funds should also reduce risk in the industry, after many companies found themselves starved of funds during the financial crisis.Exelon and Constellation said on Thursday that their deal was a good fit because it provided a better match of generation capacity and customer demand.Exelon expects to generate about 165.9 terawatt hours of electricity this year, but has demand from its own customers for only 107.8 TWh, while Constellation expects demand for 105.99 TWh but will only generate about 60.2 TWh.A better match between generation and customers reduces market risk and improves profitability, the companies said.Exelon also sees an opportunity to save money at Constellation by borrowing at more favourable rates. It has a BBB+ grade from Fitch, the rating agency, which was affirmed with a stable outlook on Thursday, while Constellation is rated BBB-.However, that financial strength is unlikely to be deployed towards investment in new nuclear plants. John Rowe, Exelon’s chief executive who will step down once the deal is completed, on Thursday repeated his long-held line that building new reactors was commercially unattractive while electricity and gas prices were at their present levels.Mr Rowe will be replaced as chief executive by Exelon’s chief operating officer, Chris Crane. Mayo Shattuck, CEO of Constellation, will become chairman.The deals stymied by regulators in the past include a planned tie-up between Constellation and Florida’s FPL, scrapped in 2006 after opposition in Maryland.However, people close to the deal pointed out that the Maryland regulator had a new group of commissioners, and that the state had approved the merger between FirstEnergy and Allegheny in January.Barclays Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore and Loop Capital Markets advised Exelon on the deal. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse advised Constellation.
45;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-04-28T21:35:45Z;US GDP data weigh on markets;;Wall Street continued to trend upwards following the multiyear highs reached in the previous session, but sentiment was held back slightly by mixed earnings reports from industry bellwethers ExxonMobil and Procter & Gamble and disappointing data on US economic growth.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company by market capitalisation, reported a 69 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn, largely on the back of high oil prices. A record performance in Exxon’s chemicals division also helped, and earnings came in at $2.14 per share, ahead of the $2.07 expected by analysts.But the recent jump in energy prices had left the markets with extremely high expectations for the oil giant, and so the stock was down 0.5 per cent at $87.34 following the results. The stock has still gained 19.3 per cent, however, since the start of the year.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Procter & Gamble reported weak sales growth of less than 1 per cent in developed markets and said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.But thanks to emerging market growth, overall net sales increased by 4.5 per cent, which helped to negate any negative impact on the stock from slower domestic growth. The stock was mostly flat throughout the day, but was up 0.8 per cent at $64.50 at the close.These mixed results left the wider markets struggling for direction for much of the session, but in late trading the overwhelming optimism in the markets thanks to the surprising good earnings season so far won out.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,360.48, its highest point since June 2008. The S&P has risen 1.8 per cent this week as first-quarter earnings have largely beaten forecasts. So far, 78 per cent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have beaten analysts’ expectations, ahead of the 73 per cent beat-rate in the last quarter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,763.31 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,872.53.Sentiment was not helped by news that the rate of growth in the US economy had slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the 3.1 per cent rate in the same period a year ago. This was below the 2 per cent growth rate expected by economists.“We can see that headwinds like commodity price inflation and the slow rate of job creation are dragging on the US economy,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Hennion & Walsh. “This raises concerns about the sustainability of the US economy when the government stimulus comes to an end,” he said.Starbucks also reported mixed results, leaving the coffee chain 0.8 per cent lower at $36.88. The company reported worldwide net earnings up 20 per cent to $261m as well as a 20 per cent rise in sales growth in China, but margins were hit by higher coffee prices.In deal news, Constellation Energy rose 5.7 per cent to $36.26 after Exelon agreed to buy the electricity generator and utility operator. Exelon shares were up 1.7 per cent to $42.18.The all-stock deal valued at $7.9bn would create a US utility to rival Duke Energy and Progress Energy as the country’s largest power group. Duke was up 0.8 per cent to $18.68 while Progress added 0.8 per cent to $47.32.Sprint Nextel added 6.7 per cent to $5.11 after reporting that its loss had narrowed by nearly half as the wireless carrier continued to add customers.Aetna results were another bright spot, with the stock rising 4.1 per cent to $41.45 after the health insurer raised its 2011 profit target and reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Ebayreported steady earnings growth for the first quarter of 2011, driven mainly by its payment arm. But investors were disappointed, and the stock was down 0.1 per cent to $34.Eastman Kodak, the troubled photography group, sank 10.1 per cent to $2.85 after swinging to a first-quarter loss of 92 cents a share. The company also reported that revenues fell 31 per cent amid continuing declines in its film segment.Evergreen Solar slumped after the company said it may need to raise cash to continue operations after first-quarter sales fell short of expectations. The stock tumbled 31.7 per cent to $1.42.Skechers lost 7.5 per cent to $19.02 after the maker of Shape-ups toning shoes reported first-quarter profit of 24 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate by 20 per cent.
46;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-04-20T15:22:38Z;AES to buy DPL for $3.5bn in consolidation bid;;"AES, the Virginia-based global power producer, has agreed to buy DPL, a regional energy company, in a transaction valued, on an enterprise basis, at $4.7bn.Under the terms of the deal, announced on Wednesday, AES will pay $30 per share in cash to DPL shareholders, for a total of $3.5bn for the equity, and assume $1.2bn in net debt. The purchase price represents close to a 9 per cent premium to DPL’s closing stock price of $27.59 on Tuesday.The deal follows a string of moves in recent months as the sprawling US power sector, of some 250 midsize and large utilities and distribution companies, attempts to consolidate.The process has been difficult; regulators have scuppered previous merger attempts by utilities, making companies uncomfortable about their own prospects.FPL, which owns Florida’s largest utility, abandoned a $11.4bn takeover attempt of Constellation Energy group in 2006 after a face-off with regulators in Maryland, where Constellation is based. Exelon, a utility based in Chicago, dropped its plan in 2006 to buy Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey amid concerns by regulators in that state.In both cases, legislators raised concerns that the combined utility groups could lead to higher power rates.Activity picked up again this past year, however, when Duke Energy announced its $13.8bn takeover of Progress Energy and Northeast Utilities announced its acquisition of Nstar for $4.1bn in shares.Paul Hanrahan, AES president and chief executive, said: “We are concentrating our growth efforts in a few key markets, including the US utility sector, where we see opportunities to leverage our global platform of 40,500MW and 11.5m utility customers’’.He expects the acquisition of DPL to benefit from the regional scale provided by its nearby utility business at Indianapolis Power & Light. DPL serves more than 500,000 customers in West Central Ohio.DPL will remain a standalone business, with local management and corporate functions, but it will be able to leverage the expertise and resources of AES’ global portfolio. DPL headquarters will remain in Dayton, and the company will continue to use the local name.The deal remains subject to approval of DPL shareholders and state and federal regulators. AES expects approvals within six to nine months.AES has committed bridge financing in place from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Financing will include a combination of non-recourse debt, the re-issuance of corporate debt at AES that was temporarily paid down in 2010, and cash on hand.AES shares rose more than 2 per cent, to $12.75, before the market opened. Shares of DPL soared 8 per cent to $29.92.Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial adviser, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom served as legal counsel to AES. DPL’s financial adviser on the transaction was UBS Investment Bank, and its legal adviser was Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft."
47;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;US rediscovers appetite for M&A;;US companies have returned to large strategic deal-making, helping to boost global mergers and acquisitions activity by 26 per cent in the first quarter.Thanks to a flurry of big deals, US M&A activity jumped 84 per cent to $267bn in the first three months of the year, compared to the same period in 2010. The US now accounts for almost half of global activity, up from about a third last year.Nine of the 10 biggest deals this year have been struck in the US, suggesting confidence among American chief executives and boards has bounced back faster than elsewhere.According to a survey released by the Business Roundtable on Wednesday, US executives believe the economic recovery is gaining momentum. “Companies have given strong signals about their willingness to expand,” said Ivan Seidenberg, chairman of the Business Roundtable and CEO of Verizon, with record numbers forecasting higher sales, hiring and capital spending.Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, has said he is interested in more deals in the fragmented US power market. The company’s planned $26bn tie-up with Progress Energy would create the country’s largest utility. Warren Buffett has also signalled that his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, is seeking bigger targets to generate growth. In March, Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy chemicals company Lubrizol for $9bn.Deals involving companies from Brazil, Russia, India and China accounted for 12.6 per cent of global activity, their highest contribution since Mergermarket records began in 2001. “Five years ago, we started to see Asian companies begin to get involved in looking at cross- border deals and gradually building their transaction skills,” said Hernan Cristerna, JPMorgan’s head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “Today, there has been a shift of dealmaking inbound into Europe from China, India and Brazil.”Overall, however, emerging market activity fell about 14 per cent, although last year’s figures were boosted by Carlos Slim’s $34bn restructuring of his Mexican telecoms empire. Advisers said they did not see a tailing off in underlying interest in the emerging markets.Europe had a quieter quarter in M&A, with activity up about 27 per cent to $162bn.“Europe remains a hard market to call,” said Matthew Ponsonby, co-head of Emea M&A at Barclays Capital. “We are up versus the same period last year but it doesn’t feel like an exuberant market. Transactions have to be very measured and make strategic sense.”JPMorgan is poised to finish the quarter at the top of the global league tables for the first time since 2004.
48;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-03-30T20:00:07Z;Advisers big and small jockey for position;;The standard backbiting between advisers looking for league table credit this quarter revolves around one question.Has dealmaking’s balance of power shifted away from institutions with big balance sheets towards independent advisers, or boutiques?JPMorgan’s place at the top of the league tables, in the US and globally, would suggest not.The bank has worked on seven of the 10 largest deals worldwide so far this year, notably utilising its size in writing a $20bn bridge loan to AT&T for the $39bn acquisition of T-Mobile USA, something credit rating agency Moody’s called a “credit negative” that could encourage other banks to take on outsized risks.Spots advising Duke Energy on its $26bn stock deal with Progress Energy and AMB on its $14bn merger with ProLogis, helped JPMorgan pull ahead, even when deals it financed are excluded from the rankings.Yet the ability of independent firms, who do not lend, to execute big deals has also been noteworthy. Perella Weinberg Partners blind-sided Wall Street’s bulge bracket with its role advising NYSE Euronext on its tie-up with Deutsche Börse .Independent advisory outfit Greenhill was lead adviser on the AT&T deal, ahead of JPMorgan and Evercore.For Evercore, AT&T capped a good run, after it also advised Lubrizol on its $9bn acquisition by Warren Buffett.Boutiques argue that providing advice alongside funding creates conflicts of interest.This issue is back in the spotlight after a US court in February criticised Barclays Capital for its conduct in the Del Monte buy-out, where the bank was advising the selling company and financing the buyer Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The enduring presence of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in dealmaking’s upper echelons proves a vast balance sheet is not needed to compete in the M&A business, argue bankers.Moreover, add some, advisers have ample reason to root for deals to happen, whether or not they are providing lucrative funding arrangements.Evercore’s share price jumped 12 per cent on the announcement of the AT&T deal.Thomson Reuters data suggests M&A accounted for 35 per cent of overall investment banking fees in the first quarter.So while lobbying for a name-check on deals muddies the league tables, the long-awaited pick-up in a low capital-intensive, high-margin business is nevertheless good news for all.
49;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:21:11+0000;Duke Energy seeks fresh merger prospects;;Duke Energy, the North Carolina-based power company, will be looking for more acquisitions once it has completed its $13.8bn takeover of its neighbour Progress Energy, its chairman has said.Duke will become the largest energy utility in the US, with a market capitalisation of about $38bn, when the deal closes, which is scheduled for the end of the year.Jim Rogers, who will be executive chairman of the merged company, told the Financial Times that Duke would be “in a stronger position to continue the consolidation which I think is inevitable in a very fragmented market in the US”.He added that it was “almost premature” to think about further targets before the Progress deal was done, but added: “As you think about how this industry has consolidated over the last 20 years, it continues.”Merger and acquisition activity in the US power sector picked up strongly last year, but the industry remains much less concentrated than in the European Union, where a few regional giants such as EDF of France and Eon of Germany are dominant. Their market capitalisations are about $82bn and $65bn, respectively.Several attempted US power utility deals were blocked by regulators in the past decade, and Duke still needs to secure approvals from state and federal authorities. However, regulators recently appear to have been more willing to give a green light to deals.Mr Rogers said he expected Duke to become a “must-own utility” for investors, boosting the share’s price/earnings ratio and strengthening its ability to make acquisitions.He added that the group was likely to look for further deals with utilities that operated under regulation, rather than selling power into a free market.Duke’s shares pay a relatively high yield of about 5.4 per cent, based on last year’s dividends, and regulated returns, which will provide about 85 per cent of the operating profits of the merged group, offer greater stability of cash flows.Mr Rogers’ role will include providing advice on “strategic matters” to Bill Johnson, the chairman and chief executive of Progress who will become chief executive of the merged company.John McConomy, a partner at PwC, said the barriers that had stood in the way of M&A in the US energy industry, including commodity price volatility, uncertainty over regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, and the economic downturn were falling away.“We have considerably more companies generating power in the US than makes sense from an economic point of view,” he said. “I think the conditions remain ripe for further deals.”Mr Rogers, who has been a strong supporter of a cap-and-trade system to curb carbon dioxide emissions, said the proposal had “hit a roadblock” following the midterm elections, which gave the Republican party control of the House of Representatives.
50;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-03-02T02:42:56Z;PPL buys Eon’s UK electricity network for $5.6bn;;PPL, the US utility, has reached a deal to buy Central Networks, the UK electricity networks business of Eon, Germany’s largest utility, for more than $5.6bn (£3.5bn) in cash and $800m of existing public debt to be assumed through consolidation.The Pennsylvania-based power company is snapping up the UK’s second-biggest electricity network, which provides power to more than 5m customers in the Midlands. PPL and Eon expect to close the transaction in early April.“This acquisition expands our UK business into a very strategic and core element of our overall regulated utility business platform,” said James Miller, PPL’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.Eon, which is being advised by JPMorgan and Barclays Capital, could not immediately be reached.The deal marks PPL’s second large purchase from Eon in the past year. The company last April beat Duke Energy and others to buy the German group’s US supply companies for more than $6.7bn in cash – the US utility’s largest deal to date.PPL’s shares sank 2.1 per cent to $24.90 as investors absorbed the prospect of another large deal.Last year’s purchase of Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, Eon’s two regulated US utilities, was financed in part through a $2.5bn sale of equity, as well as through new debt and existing cash balances.PPL’s regulated status makes it important for the company to maintain its investment-grade credit rating.Eon began considering new approaches after talks last year to sell the business to a group of buyers led by Canada Pension Plan stalled over price.PPL edged out Cheung Kong Infrastructure, the investment vehicle of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, which was also bidding. MidAmerican Energy Holdings, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, was also among the interested parties.The sale of the electricity business is part of Eon’s plan to raise €15bn (£12.7bn) by the end of 2013 from asset sales, as it seeks to cut debt and expand in growth regions outside Europe, such as Latin America.The company expects its businesses outside Europe to deliver one quarter of its total earnings by 2015.Last July, EDF of France sold its UK electricity networks business to CKI for £5.8bn, underlining the prices such distribution systems can fetch in today’s market.At the time, analysts said the sale suggested the market for energy companies was improving and that others with similar network assets in Britain, including Eon and Iberdrola of Spain, might put the businesses up for sale.PPL already owns two companies in the UK, known collectively as Western Power Distribution. One delivers electricity to 1.5m customers in an area stretching from Bristol to Bath, while the other serves 1.1m people in south Wales.
51;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-02-20T15:21:47Z;Activist investors set for busy US season;Environmental issues still in favour;"This year’s proxy voting season in the US is shaping up to be just as frenzied as last year’s, with activist shareholders already lodging a total of 359 resolutions, and environmental causes still in favour, a new survey entitled Proxy Preview 2011 suggests.The pet causes of share owners such as pension funds and labour unions include calls for new money laundering restrictions at Bank of America.However, investors have filed more shareholder proposals on environmental issues than any other topic, with 24 resolutions involving coal production and hydraulic fracturing – a shale gas extraction method – targeting companies such as Chevron, El Paso, ExxonMobil and Duke Energy.The Teamsters, a powerful US labour union, is asking Chevron to stop doing business in Burma. Shareholders interested in campaign finance reform are focusing their efforts on alleged abuses involving companies’ political donations.About 26 per cent of the proposals filed in 2011 involve the environment; another 12 per cent focus on labour and human rights; 23 per cent on diversity initiatives; 10 per cent on sustainability; and 23 per cent on political spending.About half of the resolutions filed will be voted on at companies’ annual meetings in the spring, according toAs You Sow, the US non-profit group that compiled the survey."
52;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-02-18T22:44:46Z;Wall Street gains led by energy stocks;;Shares in Progress Energy lost ground after the company reported weak fourth-quarter earnings, but the wider market edged up to fresh two-and-a-half-year highs led by oil stocks.The power generation company reported a 19 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits as interest charges and taxes increased, although revenue edged up and lower operating costs buoyed margins. The stock was down 0.5 per cent to $45.70.Progress is in the midst of being acquired by rival Duke Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US. Duke was down 1 per cent to $17.94.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,343.01, a gain of 1 per cent over the week, led by oil and gas stocks. On Wednesday, the index reached the point where it had doubled from its recession low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,391.25, up 1 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 2,833.95, adding 0.9 per cent over the five-day period.Energy stocks saw the strongest gains as oil prices edged higher on political uncertainty in north Africa and the Middle East. Murphy Oil was up 1.7 per cent to $73.88 while Chevron added 1.6 per cent to $98.72. The S&P oil and gas index was up 0.8 per cent.Material stocks gave up ground, however, on news China had raised its reserve ratio requirement by 50 basis points in a further move to combat inflation.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 4.2 per cent to $52.95 while the S&P basic materials index was 2.4 per cent lower.Traders also had one eye on Europe amid concerns about Portugal’s ability to raise funds in the capital markets, ahead of this weekend’s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Paris.In earnings news, Newpark Resources, a provider of drilling fluids, reported fourth-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, and sending the stock up 4.8 per cent to $6.81.Elsewhere in the wider energy sector, SunPower, the second-largest supplier of solar cells in the US, forecast 2011 earnings of as much as $2.20 a share, far surpassing the $1.74 cents a share estimated by analysts. The shares were up 3.5 per cent to $18.04.Campbell Soup was down 3.9 per cent to $33.58 after the food company reported second-quarter earnings down 7.7 per cent and lowered its 2011 outlook.Mergers and acquisitions activity dominated the week on Wall Street.Monday kicked off with a $2.8bn acquisition by General Electric. The biggest US industrial group by market capitalisation said it was buying the well support arm of John Wood Group, the UK oil services company. GE was up 0.5 per cent to $21.44 over the week.Along with high oil prices amid tensions in the Middle East and north Africa, this helped energy stocks see some of the strongest gains over the week. Among the leaders was Noble, the offshore driller, which was up 8.1 per cent to $42.07 while Schlumberger added 5.1 per cent to $95.04.Elsewhere, NYSE Euronext unveiled formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 1.4 per cent to $37.79 on the week, however, after investors reacted negatively to the specifics of the deal which will see the German exchange own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 13 per cent since rumours of merger talks emerged.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, finally agreed its deal with Genzyme for $20.1bn in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009. This led Genzyme up 3.9 per cent over the week to $75.38.In the retail sector, an investment group made an offer for Family Dollar Stores, sending shares in the discount retailer up 19 per cent to $52.55 over the week.Shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the US market leader in one-cup coffee brewing, lost ground after Starbucks said it was partnering with a rival single-serving coffee company.The stock had jumped more than 40 per cent in the previous two weeks on rumours it was in talks with Starbucks.Analysts at Roth Capital argued, however, that this might all be a negotiation tactic by Starbucks and that there was still a “fair chance” an alliance would be reached. Still, shares in Green Mountain were down 3.8 per cent to $41.81 over the week.A raft of economic data also helped to move the markets higher. The most promising piece of data was from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.However, data also showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment had risen by 10,000 more than expected, to 410,000.In other data, US home construction was strong and consumer price index inflation was higher than expected. The Federal Open Market Committee revised the US gross domestic product outlook up and unemployment down.
53;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-02-17T22:45:05Z;Manufacturing data lift Wall Street;;Cliffs Natural Resources jumped on strong quarterly earnings while the wider markets edged to new 30-month highs as blockbuster manufacturing data outweighed disappointing employment numbers.The iron and coal miner’s record fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, sending the shares up 7.2 per cent to $100.55. The company reported net income of $384.4m, or $2.82 per share, ahead of the $2.18 Wall Street expected.That lifted the iron and steel sector by 2.6 per cent, with Allegheny Technology, the speciality metal manufacturer, adding 1 per cent to $69.16.Indices fell in early trading after employment data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 25,000 to 410,000 in the second week of February – economists had expected the total claims to come in at 400,000.Data also showed that consumer price inflation had risen more than expected in January. Headline CPI was up 0.4 per cent while core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent.But losses on the S&P 500 were pared later in the session after data from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.“The Philly Fed number was extraordinary,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. “It just blew away expectations.”That helped the S&P 500 to close up 0.3 per cent to 1,340.43, a fresh 2½-year high. In the previous session the index reached the point where it had doubled from its March 2009 low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 12,318.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,831.58.The industrial sector saw healthy gains after the release of the manufacturing figures.Masco, the US building products group, was up 3 per cent to $13.20 while the S&P construction and materials index added 1.3 per cent.The data managed to outweigh concerns over global political instability as unrest continued to spread throughout the Middle East, lifting oil and gold prices.The turmoil did help certain sectors and stocks, however. The oilfield service sector gained from the higher oil prices, rising 1.7 per cent with Noble up 3.5 per cent to $41.33 and Halliburton adding 2 per cent to $48.43.Newmont Mining, the gold miner, was up 1.7 per cent to $58.96 as gold prices spiked up.In earnings news, CBS said net profit had risen 78 per cent to $319.4m in the fourth quarter.Earnings for the media group were boosted by local advertising revenue as television, radio and billboards proved popular with advertisers rebounding from the recession. This lifted the stock up 1.1 per cent to $22.35.Williams, the energy group and gas pipeline operator, added 8.4 per cent to $30.08 after announcing that it planned to separate its exploration and production businesses into two independent, publicly traded groups. The company also said it would boost its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 20 cents a share for the first quarter of 2011.That helped lift El Paso, another pipeline owner, by 3.9 per cent to $18. The stock was also helped by news that Raymond James Financial had raised its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”. The S&P pipeline index was up 6.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Duke Energy said fourth-quarter profit had risen 23 per cent, boosted by asset sales, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $18.12. Duke agreed to buy rival Progress Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US.Disappointing results from NetApp weighed on the technology sector.The data storage technology company fell 6.5 per cent to $54.77 after its third-quarter figures showed that revenues had fallen because of component shortages. The computer hardware sector was down 1.2 per cent.Weight Watchers International, which provides services and products for dieting, surprised the markets by issuing a 2011 guidance that far surpassed investor expectations, sending its shares up 45.6 per cent to $65.39.Skechers, the shoe company, was down 0.1 per cent to $22.06 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings had fallen by 88 per cent.
54;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-02-13T17:15:49Z;All-share deals betray shaky nerves;;Cash talks, paper walks.So why are so many stock-for-stock deals taking place when companies have amassed $4,000bn (£2,500bn) in cash on their balance sheets?Only last week, the London Stock Exchange announced a nil-premium, all-share $2.9bn merger with TMX Group of Canada.That followed several other big stock-for-stock deals across several sectors and geographies, including Duke Energy’s $25.7bn merger with Progress Energy and Lundin Mining’s $4.5bn merger with Inmet Mining.As a result, stock-only deals account for 30.4 per cent of worldwide M&A this year, according to data from Thomson Reuters.In 2007, at the peak of the debt boom, all-share deals accounted for just 7.9 per cent of global dealmaking.Cash-only deals, on the other hand, account for about a quarter of deal activity this year. In 2007, all-cash transactions accounted for 45 per cent of announced M&A.The spin from chief executives involved in all-share nil-premium mergers is that by combining two companies of equal size, they can create a new company with double the market capitalisation, double the pricing power and double the management team.That may sound like a simple enough formula, but it comes with snags.First, too much sharing means tough decisions are often ducked – when no one is in charge, promised cost savings and revenue increases can be delayed.Then there is the dreaded F-word – “flowback” – where shareholders dump foreign stock either because, as retail investors, they have no interest in holding it or because, for fund managers, their mandates prohibit it. But there are ways of mitigating such risks.The real reason why stock is the current acquisition currency of choice is a lack of confidence.Chief executives, say bankers, are still nervous about the macroeconomic outlook and are reluctant to empty their war chests on big-ticket M&A. They are right to be cautious.Persistent uncertainties mean reaching agreement on valuation is hard and investors are no longer willing to indulge ego-driven dealmaking. But nil-premium all-share mergers are always about cutting costs, rather than increasing revenues. Companies that fail to make the latter a strategic priority are only storing up trouble for later.lina.saigol@ft.com
55;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-01-11T00:59:04Z;Deal flurry as new year M&A hits $83bn;;A flurry of dealmaking by companies on both sides of the Atlantic has given the year the busiest start for mergers and acquisitions activity for a decade, firming up expectations of a bounceback in volumes as the economy recovers.With deals worth $34bn announced globally on Sunday and Monday, deal volumes so far this year have topped $83bn, up from $67bn in the same period last year.That puts 2011 ahead of the boom years, says Dealogic, with deal volumes higher than in any year-to-date period since 2000.Duke Energy agreed to buy US utility peer Progress Energy in a stock-based deal worth $13.7bn, or $26bn including debt.Meanwhile, US chemicals group DuPont sought to shore up its position in the fast-growing food and nutrition industry, signing a $5.8bn deal with Danisco of Denmark, the maker of food ingredients and enzymes.“A lot of deals which have been in the backlog are finally coming through and companies are moving quickly to get these deals done in case the macroeconomic environment changes,” said Henrik Aslaksen, global head of M&A at Deutsche Bank.Bankers argue that companies across a broad range of sectors are turning to M&A as they look for growth opportunities globally and consider spending the cash piles accumulated since the financial crisis.US companies are estimated to have more than $1,000bn in cash on their balance sheets and are expected to come under increasing pressure to put those funds to work or return money to shareholders.In addition, say advisers, a lower-growth environment in the US and Europe may prompt companies to team up and create value through cost-cutting.Duke, for example, said that it should be able to pass on $600m- $800m in savings to customers in North and South Carolina over five years, as a result of the deal with Progress, with potential for cutting costs expected to be greater still.Improving equity markets have also helped drive activity.“These announcements reinforce the trends we have been seeing,” said Jeff Kaplan, global head of M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.“Reasonable valuations, good financing markets, difficulties finding organic growth and receptivity by managements and boards to deal-making continue to drive further activity.”Hugh Hefner, the 84-year-old founder of Playboy, on Monday agreed a deal to take the publisher private, after making an offer for the company in July.Other long-running deal situations also appear to be making progress.Genzyme said it was discussing a possible transaction with Sanofi-Aventis after the French pharmagroup made an $18.5bn hostile offer for the US biotech last summer.Sara Lee, the food and household goods group, could also bolster the deal statistics. The company has been talking about a sale to Brazilian protein producer JBS and has attracted private equity interest.
56;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;US equities fall on eurozone fears;;DuPont fell after announcing a large European acquisition, while the wider US market lost ground on renewed fears about the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.The chemical company lost 1.5 per cent to $49.03, one of the biggest losers on the Dow Jones index, after agreeing to buy Denmark’s Danisco in a $5.8bn deal aimed at strengthening its presence in the food ingredient and enzyme markets.The deal would be the biggest for DuPont since its $7.7bn acquisition in 1999 of Pioneer, the seed maker, which signalled the start of the chemical company’s push into food and nutrition.A spate of M&A activity affecting the chemical, utilities, IT and food sectors failed to lift the US markets as investor sentiment was weighed on by concerns that the sovereign debt crisis in Europe was spreading after reports that Portugal was under pressure to accept a bail-out.In the utility sector, Duke Energy fell 1.2 per cent to $17.58 after agreeing to buy Progress Energy for $13.7bn over the weekend, a move that would create the largest power utility company in the US. Progress Energy was down 2.1 per cent to $43.075 on the news.iGate, the IT outsourcer, lost ground on deal news, tumbling 10.5 per cent to $17.14 after announcing it was buying India’s Patni Computer Systems. iGate said it would pay $921m to buy a 63 per cent stake in the medium-sized Indian IT group from its founders and private equity firm General Atlantic. The deal represents a 9.4 per cent premium to Patni’s closing price in Mumbai last week.Sara Lee was one of the few stocks to make ground on deal activity,up 4.5 per cent to $18.21 as rumours circulated that the food company was going to be the target of a takeover bid.The S&P 500 closed largely flat, falling 0.1 per cent to 1,269.75, as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the earnings results season that starts this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,637.45 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,707.80.The Vix index, seen as a measure of fear on Wall Street, ticked up, rose 2.5 per cent to 17.56. In late December the index had dropped to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2008, but has since been rising steadily.Investor confidence also continued to be suppressed by fears that the US recovery in 2011 would not be as strong as many had hoped, after weak non-farm payroll data that came out on Friday.“The US employment data for December wrong-footed forecasters. Prior to release of the figures, market expectations of the month-on-month increase in non-farm payrolls had been rising,” said Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities Limited.The figures showed that the US economy created 103,000 non-farm jobs in December, falling short of the consensus forecast of about 140,000.Shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, crept up in anticipation of its fourth-quarter results which were due to be released after the closing bell. The figures heralded the start of the results season. Alcoa was up 0.4 per cent to $16.49. The aluminium maker was expected to announce earnings per share of 19 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Education stocks lost ground as Strayer Education, the fourth-largest for-profit education firm by market capitalisation, said enrolment in its university fell 20 per cent in the winter term, prompting fears of a wider drop in student numbers across the US. Shares in Strayer Education tumbled 22.6 per cent to $118.60. Capella Education was down 19.7 per cent to $53.94.Apollo Group, the US adult education company that owns the University of Phoenix, fell 5.5 per cent to $35.91. DeVry, an operator of for-profit further education colleges, lost 10 per cent to $42.81.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, rose after Bernstein lifted its rating on the stock to “outperform” from “market perform”. CME was up 2.2 per cent to $314.31.Union Pacific, the railway group, was up 2.3 per cent to $97.36 as Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the stocks to $100 from $95.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
58;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-01-10T20:25:37Z;Duke and Progress hail risk reduction;;Duke Energy and Progress Energy said their deal to create the largest US utility group was intended to create a less risky business that would be better able to execute their plans for heavy capital investment that has ramped up steeply in recent years.Duke Energy is acquiring Progress in a $13.7bn stock-based deal and taking on $12.2bn in net debt.The combination of the two companies, both based in North Carolina, creates a merged group with a market capitalisation of about $36bn and more than 7m customers.Cost overruns at Duke’s innovative low-emissions coal power plant at Edwardsport, Indiana, now expected to cost almost $2.9bn, roughly double the original estimate, have shown how the power supply business can be hit by financial shocks.That project has caused an outcry in the state and provoked pressure on regulators to stop Duke passing on the costs to customers.Duke plans total capital spending of $23bn for the merged group during 2010-12, up 18 per cent from $19.5bn for the two companies in 2007-09.Capital investment allows regulated utilities to earn increased profits, providing they hold costs down and are allowed by regulators to raise prices.The merged company, which will retain the name Duke Energy, would have greater financial strength, geographic spread and diversity of regulators, its executives said.The proportion of Duke’s earnings before interest and tax that come from regulated activities also rises from 77 per cent to 85 per cent for the merged group.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said that while the deal had not changed its grade for either company, both rated Baa2, the acquisition had “several positive attributes”.Jim Hempstead of Moody’s said: “The inherent logic behind the merger is the consolidation of two homogenous, capital-intensive companies, to spread fixed costs across a larger asset platform.”S&P, another rating agency, reiterated its A- grade for Duke, and put Progress, previously BBB+, on watch for a potential upgrade.Being larger should also help the two companies manage their portfolios of nuclear plants, according to one person familiar with the deal. Progress owns four nuclear sites, while Duke has three.Although both companies have expressed interest in building new reactors, competition from cheap gas-fired generation and uncertainty over government incentives, including controls on greenhouse gas emissions, have damped hopes for new nuclear construction in the US.Past attempts at large power utility deals in the US, including Constellation’s proposed merger with Florida Power and Light, and Exelon’s with PSEG of New Jersey, were stymied by regulators.Duke and Progress hope they can avoid that because the only state regulators that need to approve the deal are North and South Carolina.JPMorgan and Bank of America advised Duke, while Lazard and Barclays Capital advised Progress.

That should change as they realise that bigger really is better – just.Analysts at Credit Suisse looked at 42 US utility transactions, nine of which ultimately failed to close. The average share price performance of target companies relative to the sector in successful deals was 21 per cent from annoucement to closing, but acquirers outperformed too, by a more modest 4 per cent. Aside from betting that stock market history will repeat itself in the current deal, there are practical reasons to like utility mergers. One is that massive projects like nuclear plants are less risky for a larger company. Big US utilities remain puny in an international context. And though there is limited scope to cut fat in natural monopolies, Duke reckons that average cost savings on non-fuel operations and maintenance in mergers are 5 to 7 per cent. That equates to about $350m, and fuel procurement savings could be twice as much. Taken together, this is about three per cent of combined market value on an ongoing annual basis – not spectacular but probably worth the trouble.How much trouble though? Regulated utility deals need numerous state and federal approvals and take 15 months to close on average. The more the overlap the bigger the potential savings and the tougher the deal. This transaction seems to strike a happy medium, yielding some synergies in the Carolinas but probably not enough to peeve regulators unduly.If buying on a deal’s announcement makes sense though, so does selling once the Powerpoint presentations and executive back-slapping are over. Share prices underperform by nearly 13 per cent in the two years after a deal closes. Buy rumoured synergies but sell the fact.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
60;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2011-01-10T13:28:18Z;Duke Energy to acquire Progress;;"Duke Energy, the North Carolina-based energy group, agreed to buy Progress Energy, in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US.The deal still requires approval from state regulators, who have blocked several attempted utility mergers in the past. The US utility sector is relatively fragmented compared with the European Union, but a long-predicted wave of consolidation appears to be gathering pace.“Our industry is entering a building phase where we must invest in an array of new technologies to reduce our environmental footprints and become more efficient,” said Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy. “By merging our companies, we can do that more economically for our customers, improve shareholder value and continue to grow.”The stock-based deal creates a merged company worth about $37bn. Progress’ market value at the end of last week was $13.1bn, while Duke was worth $23.6bn.The deal offers a modest 6.6 per cent premium to the Progress share price, as is usual in the utility sector, where deals are typically billed as mergers, rather than takeovers involving a control premium. Duke shares rose by 0.28 per cent to $17.79 in pre-market trading on Monday, while shares of Progress rose 1.87 per cent to $44.72.Mr Rogers who has been the industry’s most outspoken advocate of action to cut carbon dioxide emissions, will become executive chairman of the new organisation and play an active role in government relations. Bill Johnson, chief executive of Progress, will lead the combined company.“Together, we can leverage our best practices to achieve even higher levels of safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction, and save money for customers by combining our fuel purchasing power and the dispatch of our generating plants,” Mr Johnson said.The two companies have long been considered a good match. Both are based in North Carolina, offering substantial scope for cost savings; Duke has its headquarters in Charlotte, while Progress’ is 130 miles away in Raleigh.Larger companies also have an advantage in terms of capital raising and in spreading the risk of projects, such as building nuclear facilities, over a bigger balance sheet. Duke is considering building a new nuclear plant in Ohio.Progress has about $10bn in annual revenue and more than 22,000 megawatts of generation capacity. Through its two utilities, Progress serves about 3.1m customers in North and South Carolina and Florida.Duke supplies about 4m customers, using 35,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity in the Carolinas and the Midwest.In recent weeks, claims that Duke’s Indiana unit was improperly close to the state’s main regulator forced the exit of three executives. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Indiana inspector general have been investigating the relationship. However, the commission last month found no evidence that Duke had been favoured.JPMorgan advised Duke on the deal, while Lazard Frères and Barclays Capital advised Progress."
61;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2010-08-03T20:52:10Z;Poor economic data drag on Wall St;;The rally in US stocks faltered yesterday after investors were shaken by worse-than-expected economic data combined with weak earnings reports from Mastercard and Procter & Gamble.The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,120.41, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to close at 10,636.38 and the Nasdaq was 0.5 per cent lower at 2,283.52. Data on consumer spending, personal incomes, pending home sales and factory orders all came in below expectations.Consumer spending was unexpectedly flat in June and personal incomes failed to increase for the first time since September. The savings rate climbed to its highest level in a year. Analysts had expected rises of 0.1 per cent in consumer spending and 0.2 per cent in personal incomes.The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary index fell 1.3 per cent. Pending home sales dropped 2.6 per cent, compared with a forecast rise of 0.6 per cent and factory orders, projected to fall 0.5 per cent, were down 1.2 per cent in June.The S&P 500 housebuilders fell 5.3 per cent and the materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.But Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global, said that the negative earnings should be more surprising than the economic data. He said investors already knew that the expiration of homebuyer’s tax credit would distort home sales and that last week’s gross domestic product figures had provided a clue to a sluggish consumer recovery.Mastercard’s results reflected that sluggish consumer spending, with the total number of transactions rising by only 0.1 per cent. The credit card company announced a 31 per cent jump in profit on the back of 10 per cent cost cuts as consumers gradually started spending again, especially outside the US. Shares fell 0.8 per cent to $200.91.Household goods company Procter & Gamble also suffered from the cautious consumer, reporting a lower-than-expected profit for its fourth quarter. Sales did rise but this was offset by the company increasing the amount it spends on marketing. Earnings fell to 71 cents a share from 80 cents for the same period the year before. Analysts had predicted average earnings of 73 cents a share. Shares fell 3.4 per cent to $59.94.Other fallers included Dow Chemical, the largest US chemical producer, which plummeted 10.1 per cent to $25.48 after it missed analysts’ expectations. Its second-quarter earnings came in at 54 cents, below the consensus forecast of 56 cents.Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes slumped 13.1 per cent to $43.66 after it warned that the moratorium on new deep-water drilling could cut profit by between 8 and 11 cents a share in the second half. Earnings per share in the second quarter were below expectations.Duke Energy was flat at $17.37 after a $660m writedown on the value of some power plants in the Midwest led to a second-quarter loss of 17 cents per share, compared with a profit of 21 cents per share in the same quarter last year. But the power company raised its adjusted full-year per share forecast to a range of $1.30 to $1.35 compared with a previous $1.25 to $1.30.One earnings bright spot was Pfizer, which rose 5.6 per cent to $16.34 after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter. The pharmaceuticals company said that full-year profit would be at the top end of its previous forecast of $2.10 to $2.20 per share, due to synergies from last year’s merger with Wyeth.Pfizer helped push up the S&P 500 Healthcare index by 0.8 per cent, the largest rise for a main S&P sector.Ford fell 1.9 per cent to $12.91 after it sold fewer cars than analysts had estimated last month. Its sales, adjusted for the number of selling days in July, fell 0.7 per cent compared with expectations of a 10 per cent rise.In deal news, Genzyme fell 0.2 per cent to $70.20 after rising 35 per cent in the last two weeks, as it said it had begun takeover talks with Sanofi-Aventis. It has been reported that the French pharmaceuticals company offered between $67 and $70 a share, which would value Genzyme at about $18.4bn.

63;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Funding costs fall for US companies;;Borrowing costs for industrial companies in the US have plunged, allowing some groups to pay the lowest interest rates ever on long-term debt.The decline in funding costs reflects the sharp fall in US Treasury yields amid the surge in demand for low-risk investments as jitters about the eurozone debt crisis have escalated.For investment-grade companies including Altria, the tobacco maker, Duke Energy, the utility, Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceuticals group and General Mills, the food manufacturer, it has provided an opportunity to sell bonds with record low interest payments, according to Dealogic.The interest paid by companies is usually calculated relative to government bond yields.“All the problems in Europe again caused Treasury yields to fall,” said Allen Carrick, general manager of corporate finance at Duke Energy.“This created an opportunity for us. We are part of the flight to quality.”Duke Energy last week sold $450m of 10-year bonds that paid investors a coupon, or interest payment, of 4.3 per cent, the lowest the company has paid for debt of that maturity.This week, Altria sold bonds due in 2015 paying 4.125 per cent.The average yields on the bonds of investment-grade industrial companies recently approached 4 per cent, according to the Barclays Capital US Industrial Bond Index, the lowest level since the index was started in the early 1990s.The 10-year US Treasury bond has fallen to 3.27 per cent from more than 4 per cent in April.Even though the yield differential, or risk premium, between government bonds and corporate bonds has risen amid the flight to quality, the decline in bond yields has offset that spread increase for some groups.The all-in funding cost for companies with high credit ratings and stable prospects has therefore remained low or even fallen.“There is no question that borrowing costs are extremely low,” said Justin D’Ercole, head of Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays Capital.For riskier investments, such as junk-rated US companies or European banks, this has not been the case.Despite the low funding costs, corporate issuance remains light. Many companies have boosted their cash levels since the crisis, and rushed to sell bonds early in the year when economists were predicting that interest rates would rise.Also, turmoil has resulted in lower levels of mergers and acquisitions.“There is relatively little new supply of investment-grade corporate debt, so demand for non-financial companies that do come to market is very strong,” said Jim Probert at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Some investors are, however, cautious about buying bonds at current levels. Any rise in yields would push down the price of bonds.“With very low yields, you don’t have a lot of room for error,” Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said.
64;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Eon puts US supply arms up for sale;;Eon, the German energy group, has put Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, its US supply companies, up for sale with an estimated price of about $6bn, according to people familiar with the situation.Duke Energy of North Carolina and PPL of Pennsylvania are possible buyers, according to SparkSpread, an industry news service.Eon went on an ambitious push for international expansion up to 2008, but has since been retrenching and selling assets, like several other large European energy groups.Last year it set a target of raising at least €10bn ($13.5bn) from disposals by the end of 2010.Eon announced last week that it had sold its high-voltage transmission network for €1.1bn, and last year sold Thüga, its holding company for municipal utility stakes, for about €2.9bn.The proceeds from the sales are being used to pay down Eon’s debts, which were €47bn at the end of June last year.Marcus Schenck, Eon’s chief financial officer, told a German newspaper last month that banks had become more willing to finance acquisitions, helping the company’s disposal programme.Wulf Bernotat, Eon’s chief executive, said last year the company was investing in energy supplies “with the focus on Europe”.LG&E and Kentucky Utilities between them have about 900,000 customers for electricity and 310,000 for gas, and about 8,000 megawatts of generation capacity.The businesses were acquired with Powergen of the UK, which Eon bought in 2002.Eon is being advised on the sale by Goldman Sachs, according to SparkSpread, while Duke Energy is being advised by JPMorgan and Barclays Capital.The companies and their advisers refused to comment.
65;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2010-02-18T01:43:46Z;Energy companies fight own emissions corner;;After making common cause for years, the energy companies campaigning for legislation to curb US greenhouse gas emissions are finding that what divides them may be as important as what unites them.On Tuesday, BP and ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas groups, withdrew from the US Climate Action Partnership, which campaigns for climate legislation.They say they need to make their case for themselves as the debate moves from whether an emissions cap is needed, to how it would be implemented.As the details come into focus, oil and gas companies are being split off from the power generators such as Duke Energy, Exelon and NRG Energy, which remain members of the USCAP. The oil and gas companies say they still want an energy and environment bill to be passed, but do not want just any bill. In particular, they are concentrating on lobbying for legislation promoting natural gas as a way to reduce carbon emissions.Oil companies argue that many of the bills that have come before Congress place an unfair burden on motor fuels and offer too many concessions to coal.The Waxman-Markey bill that passed in the House of Representatives last year, for example, allocates 2 per cent of allowances to fuel producers but makes them responsible for 44 per cent of emissions.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, said last year the proposed legislation could threaten the sustainability of the US refining industry, costing US refiners $100bn (€73bn, £64bn) a year within three years. That would hit an industry under pressure from a drop in demand.On top of that, the industry is upset President Barack Obama’s new budget outlines about $80bn in tax increases on the US oil and gas industry.Jim Mulva, chief executive of Conoco, explained the bills in Congress seek unnecessarily punitive measures on the industry while ignoring the “critical role” natural gas could play in reducing carbon emissions. Natural gas is about 50 per cent less carbon intensive than coal.Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s national trade organisation, said: “We do not understand how the Obama administration and Congress can advocate subsidies for nuclear energy, wind and solar while calling for new taxes on natural gas.” Mr Nichols said he was not surprised BP and Conoco left USCAP.Royal Dutch Shell, the last remaining big oil company in the USCAP, shares Conoco Phillips’ concerns but the company will stay in USCAP to “remain engaged”.
66;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2010-01-30T04:28:25Z;Former BHP Billiton chief joins BP board;;BP has appointed Paul Anderson, the former chief executive of BHP Billiton, as a non-executive director, continuing the overhaul of the board that began with the appointment of Carl-Henric Svanberg as chairman last June.Another non-executive appointment is likely to be made in the next couple of months, as BP seeks to bring in new talent to support the momentum created since new chief executive Tony Hayward took over in May 2007.Appointments to invigorate the board have long been promised by the company, as it sought to put behind it a series of problems and underperformance relative to other big international oil groups.The weakness of the board was highlighted by the public conflict over the departure of Lord Browne, the former chief executive.In the past couple of years, BP’s performance has improved markedly, and this month it overtook Royal Dutch Shell by market capitalisation for the first time in more than three years.Mr Anderson had been a contender for the chairmanship, and was picked out during the selection process as a strong non-executive director.He ran BHP and then Duke Energy of the US, and earned a high reputation at both.At BHP, where he took over as chief executive in 1998, he was one of the architects of the 2001 merger with Billiton that created the world’s largest mining group.Similarly, at North Carolina-based Duke from 2003-07, he turned the company around and built it into one of the biggest power companies in America.Until last year he was chairman of Spectra Energy, a company in the US gas industry, which is one of BP’s strategic priorities.He was early among US energy executives in advocating curbs on carbon dioxide emissions, speaking out in favour of a federal carbon tax back in 2005.Mr Anderson replaces Sir Tom McKillop, the former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, who stood down from the BP board last year.Two further non executives are expected to leave this year: Sir Ian Prosser, the deputy chairman and senior independent director, who has been on the board since 1997, and Erroll Davis, a former director of Amoco who joined BP when the companies merged in 1998.Both men have served past the ten-year limit recommended for non-executive directors.One further appointment to the board as a replacement is likely before BP’s annual general meeting on April 15.Sir William Castell, the former chief executive of Amersham who has been a non-executive director at BP since 2006, is seen by some shareholders as a contender for the role of senior independent director, although he may not formally take the title of deputy chairman.BHP Billiton, meanwhile, said that Mr Anderson and Gail de Planque were stepping down from its board, to be replaced as non-executive directors by Malcolm Broomhead, chairman of Asciano of Australia, and Carolyn Hewson, a former Schroders banker.
67;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Powerful lessons;;At a time when most companies are trimming travel budgets, Duke Energy is increasing its investment in management education.Duke Energy, one of the largest electric power companies in the US with over 18,250 employees, is in the midst of its fourth round of a customised executive training course through the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School and is slated for more.The company is not continuing with the programme because it has extra dollars to spare, however. Rather, this programme pays for itself.“When we designed the programme for Duke Energy, we wanted to be able to show its return on investment,” says Atul Nerkar, associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the school. “We wanted activities that lead to either cost savings or an increase in revenues. We wanted to show where [the programme] impacts the top and bottom lines. This is a unique model in business education, we believe, because the programme pays for itself.”That the programme is self-sustaining is only one of the reasons Duke Energy has stuck with it. The course, which involves 30 participants at one time and takes place over two, week-long residencies, has enabled Duke Energy to mesh its corporate culture with another merged company, helped it to develop a new generation of leaders and helped those future leaders to understand better the changes taking place in the energy industry.Duke Energy first approached Kenan-Flagler in 2007, not long after it merged with Cinergy, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based energy company.The combined company management looked at ways to mesh the company cultures and bring employees from disparate businesses together. A customised business school programme that brought together a range of employees seemed to be the answer.“It’s been a way to get people thinking about how to move the company forward, not just their division or group,” says Doug Esamann, senior vice-president of strategy and planning at Duke Energy.Another goal of the programme was to enhance the company’s talent pool by ensuring that the next cohort of leaders had basic general management skills, according to Susan Palmer, adjunct professor of strategy and entrepreneurship and programme director for UNC executive development. “When they came to us in 2007, they realised that a third of their workforce was eligible to retire within five years and they had not done much in the way of succession planning to prepare the next generation of leaders,” she says.Mark Short, managing director of organisational development at Duke Energy, says the company has historically done “a good job” developing the top 500 employees in the company, but enlisted Kenan-Flagler to help it “develop the skill set of our mid-level to VP-level employees. We needed to prep our leadership pipeline.”To remedy this, Kenan-Flagler and Duke Energy, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, created a programme that targets the company’s middle managers with 10-20 years of career experience under their belts.Perhaps the biggest test for managers at Duke Energy, according to Prof Nerkar, is to understand how the company can continue to be profitable in the short term and be at the forefront of the changes taking place in the energy industry in the long term. While oil and natural gas remain a cornerstone of the US’s energy base, energy companies are under pressure from lawmakers and stakeholders to develop alternative energy sources.In designing the programme, Kenan-Flagler’s professors who specialise in the energy industry worked with senior executives from Duke Energy to understand the critical issues it faces. Duke Energy executives also familiarised management professors with new technologies and innovation in the industry. And a professor from the UNC’s School of Government who focuses on local, state and federal regulatory law also helped develop custom course material.Prof Nerkar worked with the company to design the programme so that it would lead to either a cost reduction, or a boost in profit. A series of business challenges were included, where participants must come up with viable solutions to problems their department faces.“Not every problem is solved, but if we solve even one, the programme has paid for itself two or three times over,” says Prof Nerkar.

69;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2009-10-18T10:03:30Z;Act now for long term investment;;"Investors are being chastised for their role in the economic crisis through speculative trading and applying pressure to boards and management to focus on short-term earnings.The Aspen Institute Business and Society Program released a statement in September that calls on the US Congress to adopt a number of policies designed to encourage longer-term investing.The organisation has recruited an impressive list of signatories, including legendary investor Warren Buffett, Vanguard Group founder John Bogle, Duke Energy chief executive Jim Rogers and former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead.There are two main problems, according to William Sihler, a business professor at the University of Virginia. One is the problem of vote lending, when an investor borrows shares to vote but has no underlying economic interest in the company. This is an issue Securities and Exchange Commission chairwoman Mary Schapiro is expected to look at as part of an overall review of the US proxy voting system. Mr Sihler’s second concern is short-term hedging.One solution to these problems is to give long-term institutional investors greater voting power, he says. It can also be worth a company’s time and effort to recruit the right kind of shareholders. To encourage long-term stockholders you have to “cultivate institutions that are known to be sympathetic with the idea you can show them what is happening”, he says. Analysts cannot be ignored either. This means sending chief executives and chief financial officers on the road to trade shows and spreading the message of the company’s long-term vision.Another possible solution is to give shareholders more rights in exchange for time-weighted voting, says Lynn Stout, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and a signatory to the Aspen Institute statement. This is a concept that is embedded in a controversial so-called proxy access proposal at the SEC, which the commission is expected to rule on early next year. According to the draft proposal, if shareholders want to nominate corporate directors on the company ballot they have to hold stock for at least one year. While many businesses would like to see an even longer time period, the concept of encouraging longer holding periods is a good one, Ms Stout says.While some observers say short-termism has been a problem for the past decade or longer, it has become more prevalent in recent years due to lower trading costs, the advent of technology and the increased use of derivative products.The Aspen Institute first made waves in this area when it released a set of principles in 2007 that called for an end to quarterly earnings guidance from companies and aligning compensation incentives with an eye toward the long term.The latest advocacy is “taking it a step further,” says Ms Stout. “It’s not enough to simply discourage quarterly earnings guidance,” she says.“This round of work is really saying, ‘OK, we need to look at whatever leverage points exist in policy to shore up this direction’,” says Judy Samuelson, executive director of the Aspen Institute Business and Society Program. “Our focus at this point is Capitol Hill and the administration.” The institute is using the networks of its signatories to spread the word in Washington. Hearings on this issue are anticipated in both the House and Senate, several people involved say.The group wants to revise the capital gains tax provisions or implement an excise tax to reward long-term stock holdings; remove limitations on capital loss deductibility for very long-term holdings; and adopt minimum holding periods or time-based vesting in exchange for more shareholder rights. They are also advocating increased disclosure from investors and applying more enforcement of the fiduciary duties of investor advisers.Other organisations are supporting this cause. A recent report from a task force of the America Bar Association, which was sent to members of Congress and the SEC, recommended that policymakers encourage shareholder interest in the long term through tax incentives and enhanced voting rights.At the heart of the issue is a sense that investors encouraged risk-taking and short-sightedness by companies because many shareholders these days are
speculators.However, Jon Ogg, editor of the financial blog 24/7 Wall Street, says the notion that investors are partly to blame for the financial crisis is “silly”. “If you are an investor that knows the economy is rolling over or that a new development may hit your investments by 40 per cent, are you going to wait blindly for that to smooth out in a few years or are you going to sell and buy back in later?” he asks.Nonetheless the Aspen Institute has a number of backers. The organisation has had previous success in its campaign to discourage short-termism. Many companies have eliminated quarterly earnings guidance since the organisation’s initial call to do so two years ago.Kristin Gribben is associate editor of Agenda, a Financial Times service"
70;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2009-10-06T09:59:37Z;BNP Paribas in commodities push;;While Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital and upstart JPMorgan fight for the leadership in commodity derivatives trading, the battle among the banks’ second-tier group is heating up – with BNP Paribas quietly challenging rivals for ascendancy.The French bank is set to multiply its size after it integrates Fortis’ commodities business, particularly the Dutch bank’s former natural gas and power operations.Amine Bel Hadj Soulami, head of commodity derivatives at BNP Paribas, says his objective is “to be at the top of the second-tier commodity derivatives banks”.Fortis Energy Marketing & Trading, based in Houston, was created when the now-defunct bank acquired Cinergy Marketing & Trading from utility Duke Energy in 2006.In addition, the acquisition will add an agriculture book and metals trading.BNP Paribas declined to comment on the specific details of the Fortis purchase but Mr Bel Hadj Soulami told the Financial Times in an interview that his target was “to double commodity derivatives revenues over the next three years”.Bankers estimate that BNP’s commodities revenues are now near $500m a year.The French bank already has 180 staff in commodities, a number that bankers say is set to grow to about 250 by next year with the addition of Fortis’ traders.Mr Bel Hadj Soulami’s 2012 revenue target is, nonetheless, likely to prove tough to meet.As BNP Paribas expands, other banks in the second-tier group, including BofA-Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Macquarie, Société Générale, Standard Chartered and Royal Bank of Scotland are also pushing with aggressive expansion in commodities that, in some cases, are more advanced than the plans of the French bank.The moves reflect the profitability of the business and the belief that dealing in raw materials represents a rare opportunity for continued growth while other sectors, such as securitisation, shrink. Ironically, the financial crisis has boosted second-tier banks “as customers have diversified their banking relationships”, Mr Bel Hadj Soulami says.Second-tier banks have also benefited from less competition as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed and UBS closed the bulk of its commodities business.Greenwich Associates, the financial consultant, says commercial banks such as BNP have been able to use their lending relationship with customers “as an introduction to commodities business”.Hence BNP Paribas was, together with JPMorgan, the financial institution that added “the most new corporate clients in over-the-counter energy derivatives trading last year”.But for the French bank, the strategy of using its credit relationship to expand in commodities has a handicap: it is a powerhouse in European lending but not nearly as strong in the US or Asia.Mr Bel Hadj Soulami says his business “does take risks but we are not taking big proprietary positions”.“It is not only about being big in commodity derivatives, it is also about being sustainable and avoiding becoming a hedge fund,” he concludes.

The companies said the switch, set to begin in January, could reduce emissions by more than 125,000 metric tonnes over the next ten years.“The opportunity for the transportation sector to transition from gasoline or diesel fuel-powered vehicles and trucks has never been greater,” said Jim Rogers, Duke Energy chief executive, in a statement. “Electric-powered vehicles hold great promise as the means to significantly reduce carbon emissions and reduce the US dependence on foreign oil.”Mr Rogers was not the only CGI participant to see a bright future in electric vehicles. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan and Renault, told a panel discussing infrastructure on Thursday that zero-emissions vehicles were the only way to cut greenhouse gas output as the number of cars on the road soars.“Whatever forecast you look at for the next ten years, with China, India, South Africa, the Middle East coming on board…the amount [of vehicles driven] is going to double,” he said.“Are we ready now or should we wait for five more years?” he asked. “We think the time is now.”Nissan is set to start selling an electric car, the Leaf, in the US and Japan late next year, and Mr Ghosn announced earlier this month that Renault would produce four new battery-powered models by 2012.The green fleet initiative was Duke Energy’s second announcement at the four-day philanthropic conference. On Wednesday, the company announced a deal with ENN, the Chinese energy company, to develop clean energy technology, such as solar power, coal gasification and algae that captures carbon.“It seems like we’re natural partners, because we’re one of the largest emitters of CO2 in the US, and so coming up with technological solutions is really key for us as we go forward,” Mr Rogers told the Financial Times in a video interview.
72;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2009-08-04T21:07:08Z;Wall St extends gains on upbeat economic data;;US stocks extended their recent run of gains on Tuesday as encouraging housing data offset concerns that the market’s rally may run out of steam.After brief selling pressure during the afternoon, stocks rallied back in late trade and the S&P 500 closed at a fresh high for the year. That kept the broad benchmark above the 1,000 threshold, which it finally rose above on Monday for the first time since last November.The S&P closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,005.65, near its intra-day high of 1,007.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to close at 9,320.19, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.1 per cent to 2,011.31.“A pullback would be healthy, there have been lots of positives to take from the earnings we have seen,” said Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management.Meanwhile, growing momentum by the Securities and Exchange Commission to ban the use of flash trading orders on exchanges sparked volatility in the shares of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.Shares in NYSE Euronext surged nearly 4 per cent in early afternoon trade, before easing to stand 2.4 per cent higher at $27.40. Nasdaq OMX, which, unlike NYSE Euronext, allows flash orders, fell 0.3 per cent to $21.39 having plumbed an earlier low of $20.78.Financial stocks fell in early trade, knocked in part by data showing that personal income fell more sharply than analysts expected in June.But figures showing that pending home sales jumped much more than predicted during the month saw them rise into positive territory by midday.John Canally, economist for LPL Financial, said the fifth straight month of rises for pending home sales was very encouraging.“After housing starts and moderating prices, the pending home sales figures are the latest sign that the housing market has stabilised.”Citigroup rose 2.2 per cent to $3.25 while Wells Fargo was up 2.9 per cent at $26.55 and Bank of Americapicked up 2.1 per cent to $15.64.Homebuilders saw mixed fortunes as the data lifted some of the sector’s biggest companies following early losses on the back of some disappointing quarterly results.Pulte Homes fell to a heavier loss than expected, with falling land values and weak sales continuing to take their toll. Its shares dropped 0.7 per cent to $11.68.The negative outlook briefly weighed on Centex, which Pulte has agreed to buy, and after early losses, its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $11.33 as the company made a quarterly profit.Rival DR Horton also suffered as a result of record foreclosures and rising unemployment. Its results were worse than expected.But its shares picked up following early falls and it gained 4.9 per cent to close at $12.32.“People are selling the homebuilders after their recent run-up but I would pay more attention to these economic data,” said Mr Canally.The utilities sector was the heaviest faller on the S&P, led lower by Allegheny Energy, which lost 4.9 per cent to $24.50 after the company reported slightly lower profit than expected.The results exacerbated pre-market falls that came on the back of an announcement on Monday evening that the company had filed a universal shelf register with the SEC, which would enable it to sell fresh stock.Meanwhile, Duke Energy announced second-quarter profit 21 per cent below their level at the same time last year – its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to $15.58.There was weakness in the agricultural sector as Archer Daniels Midland fell 5.2 per cent to $28.81 after it reported falling revenues and profit, with demand for its oilseed and other commodities remaining low. Monsanto lost 2.6 per cent to $84.02.Shares in PepsiCo rose 5.1 per cent to $59.06 after the company agreed the purchase of its two large bottling companies.Pepsi increased its offer to $36.50 a share for Pepsi Bottling and $28.50 a share for Pepsi-Americas. Pepsi Bottling rose 8.5 per cent to $36.49 and PepsiAmericas gained 9 per cent to close at $28.50.
73;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2009-07-07T19:03:26Z;Back to petroleum;;"On the sixth floor of County Hall, the slightly tatty Edwardian building on the south bank of the Thames that once housed the Greater London Council, there is a modest office suite that tells a revealing story about the future of the global energy industry.With neighbours including a Dalí exhibition, the Manga Studio and the London Aquarium, it is the perfect location for a creative start-up operating outside the mainstream. Only a discreet green and yellow sign with BP’s “Helios” logo and the word “alternativenergy” reveals that it is the base for a division that was supposed to represent the future for one of Britain’s biggest companies.If BP is to go “beyond petroleum”, as its slogan says, it is the Alternative Energy businesses run from County Hall, including biofuels, solar and wind power, that will take it there. Yet the office is being shut, investment cut and its chief executive has taken early retirement.Under Lord Browne, its previous chief executive, BP positioned itself as a pioneer of the revolution expected to change the energy business. It was a standard-bearer for hopes that companies that dominated the old world of energy would also lead the transition to the new one.Although worldwide investment in renewable energy has taken a knock in the recession, the level of interest remains as strong as ever. The election of President Barack Obama has raised the prospect that Washington will sign up to an international agreement to curb carbon dioxide emissions, transforming the outlook for low-carbon energy sources.Yet having led the charge, BP is now leading the retreat. When the world does move beyond fossil fuels, neither BP nor any other big oil company is likely to be in the vanguard.Tony Hayward, who succeeded Lord Browne two years ago, is pinning BP’s hopes for the future more firmly than before on oil and gas. As one former BP executive puts it, “oil and gas are in the company’s DNA”. Another says that, while the rest of the world is trying to move forward, Mr Hayward is “turning the clock back”.Alternative energy provides less than 1 per cent of BP’s revenues and none of its profits. Capital spending will be about $20bn this year, of which at most 5 per cent will go into renewable energy. But the reason behind the faltering of its ambitions for the business are telling – both for the future of the oil industry and for the world’s energy supplies.As Peter Sutherland, chairman, prepares to hand over to Carl-Henric Svanberg at the end of the year, BP is in many respects on a high. When Mr Hayward took charge, the group’s profitability lagged far behind that of Royal Dutch Shell, its closest rival. Now that gap has been closed.After the plunge in oil and gas prices, this year’s profits will be much lower than last year’s record $25.6bn, but a cost-cutting drive, taking more than 5,000 jobs out of the business, has left BP better positioned than Shell to cope with lower revenues. On the stock market, it has in the past year outperformed Shell and ExxonMobil, the biggest western oil group.Yet for all those achievements, there is deep uncertainty among investors about the company’s future, expressed most starkly in the ratio of its dividend to its share price. The shares yield more than 7 per cent: a remarkable return at a time when 10-year US Treasury bonds pay just 3.5 per cent. The figure indicates the markets think that BP has no prospect of long-term growth.Industry trends suggest those fears are well founded. Western oil groups face pressure from assertive governments of resource-rich countries, and from ambitious rivals emerging in China, Russia and Brazil. BP and other western “majors” are being driven to the most difficult, high-cost reserves, such as Canada’s oil sands.They are also beginning to run up against “peak demand”. As a result of the rise of biofuels and improvements in energy efficiency, oil consumption in developed countries may have passed its peak. Demand will continue to rise in emerging economies such as China, but western companies find it harder to operate in these markets.“This recession has brought forward the point at which demand for one of our principal products, gasoline, will probably be in terminal decline in mature markets,” Mr Hayward says. “So one of the tasks is to figure out how we reposition our business to access more of the growth.”A year ago, it looked as though he too thought renewable energy would be an important part of the answer. It starts from a lower base but is growing faster than oil and gas: by more than 10 per cent a year for wind and more than 20 per cent for solar during 2006-30, even without any additional incentives, according to projections by the International Energy Agency.Many renewables are not profitable without subsidy, but governments are increasingly committed to them, most notably in the US. A global deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions at the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen in December would provide fresh impetus for all forms of low-carbon energy.Fiona Paulus, head of energy at Royal Bank of Scotland, argues that a fundamental shift in the world’s energy supplies is coming. “A hundred years ago, the world’s fuel was primarily coal. Today it is oil. In the future, it will be renewable energy. By 2050, perhaps 50 per cent of our energy will be non-carbon-based.”As a sign of BP’s determination to join that revolution, the lternative Energy division last year moved to its County Hall offices from the group’As grand St James’s Square headquarters: a short distance physically but a long way in spirit. The idea was to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit that drives the small companies plotting a shift in the world’s energy supplies. The move also created a more autonomous unit, which could have brought in outside investors or even gone for a stock market flotation. Now the experiment is being put into reverse. Alternative Energy is being moved back to St James’s Square to use free space opened up by job cuts.Vivienne Cox, who had led the renewables business since 2004, left BP at the end of last month. The group’s investment in alternatives, rising fast to a peak of $1.4bn last year, will fall to just $500m-$1bn this year. The idea of bringing in outside shareholders has been shelved indefinitely. Mr Hayward says he is “weeding” the business, to remove the unpromising activities that stand no chance of being commercially viable.BP’s wind business has been focused on the onshore US, avoiding the more expensive offshore projects seen as the future of the industry in the UK. Solar manufacturing facilities are being shut or cut in the US, Spain and Australia and production shifted to Chinese subcontractors. In biofuels, the company is focusing on a Brazilian joint venture to produce sugar cane ethanol, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than the US corn-based variety, and is backing research into advanced biofuels. However, its project to explore the use of jatropha, once seen as a “wonder crop” for biofuel production, appears to have stalled.Over the next three years, BP is likely to invest about $2.5bn in renewables. In the same period Eon, the German electricity and gas group with about half BP’s market capitalisation, expects to invest more than twice as much in wind and solar power.“What BP are doing shows a lack of commitment,” says a former executive. “When you decide to do something, either you do it wholeheartedly or you shilly-shally around it and you don’t get anywhere.” He believes that, under pressure from the falling oil price, BP’s leaders are retreating to familiar businesses. “A lot of it is instinctual, and the instincts of Tony Hayward and Andy Inglis, head of exploration and production, in particular,” he says. “They are dyed-in-the-wool old-fashioned oilmen. They are extremely smart and clever people but they are trying to cling on to what they know best.”Given the skills and culture of the group, BP’s Alternative Energy division was always going to be fighting uphill. The business is very different from oil and gas. Securing planning permission for a wind farm, for example, has little in common with negotiating an oil exploration licence. There are also fundamental differences of business model and mindset.“What BP is really good at is finding oil: high-cost investments that can create big increases in value,” one former BP man says. Renewable energy, by contrast, “is a slow grind, where you just don’t get that big-value uplift”. Another former executive argues that the lesson of BP’s experience is that companies need to concentrate on doing what they do best: “With the benefit of hindsight, it’s appropriate for companies like BP to stick to their core business.”BP would not disagree, arguing that there is still a hugely successful long-term business in oil and gas. Mr Hayward describes concerns over western companies’ access to resources as “somewhat overstated”, pointing to BP’s 2007 deals with Libya and Oman as evidence. Last week it became the first western company since the US-led invasion of 2003 to agree a deal with the Baghdad government to operate in Iraq’s vast oil fields.At some point, however, the shift in the world’s energy system will come. Lew Watts, an independent consultant, says the future will bring growing electrification, including of transport. “What we are likely to see, and are already seeing, is that energy will continue to de-carbonise and will ultimately move to the electron,” he says. “Any energy company of the future will need to be in the electron or power business. Companies that do not do this become merely commodity suppliers.”Viewed that way, groups such as Eon or EDF of France or Duke Energy of the US have more chance of dominating the future energy landscape than BP. Or, just as IBM failed to realise the potential of the personal computer, established energy companies may be superseded by new ones able to exploit the new forms of energy.BP is thinking now about what the changing global market will mean for its business. Talking about the appointment of the new chairman, currently chief executive at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, Mr Hayward says: “This is the end of chapter one of getting BP back on the rails …We now need to sit down and begin to craft what is chapter two.” Whatever it holds, that chapter seems certain still to have oil and gas at its heart.Two steely oilmenIt is hard to imagine two men more superficially different than Lord Browne, pictured left, and Tony Hayward. Lord Browne, BP’s previous chief executive, is formal, reserved and thoughtful; his protégé and successor, Mr Hayward is relaxed, youthful and active. Lord Browne was a famous cigar smoker; Mr Hayward is a triathlete. The former’s corner office was notorious for its lavish, Viscount Linley-designed furniture; his successor’s is functional, brightened up with pictures of his children and of a yacht battling through the waves (he is a keen sailor) – and not even on a corner.BP insiders likened Lord Browne’s trips to company operations to state visits. Workers in BP’s US business disliked him, seeing him as emblematic of a remote London-based management culture. Mr Hayward is more at ease among the workforce. “BP makes its money by someone somewhere every day putting on boots, coveralls, a hard hat and glasses and going out and turning valves …And we had somehow lost track of that,” he said in a recent talk.What both share, however, is a steely quality that took them to the top. Lord Browne’s deal-making, which built today’s BP, and Mr Hayward’s attack on costs in response to the falling oil price, display a common ruthlessness."
74;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2009-06-14T22:51:49Z;BP close to choosing chairman;;BP’s search for a new chairman has entered its closing stages with a final shortlist drawn up to include Paul Anderson, the former chief executive of BHP Billiton, the mining group.No decision has yet been taken and Mr Anderson is a contender rather than the clear front-runner to succeed Peter Sutherland, chairman since 1997. Other candidates are also in the running and the oil company will have to go through further negotiations before making a selection.Leading shareholders expect to be given the chance to express a view on the proposed candidate.The search was set back when the previous candidate to emerge from BP’s selection process, Paul Skinner, then chairman of Rio Tinto, was opposed by shareholders because of his support for the mining group’s fundraising deal with Chinalco of China. However, BP expects to have a new chairman chosen by August.Anna Mann, traditionally BP’s favoured adviser on top appointments and now at MWM Consulting, has been working on the search, but other headhunters have also been brought in.Mr Anderson is well qualified for the role after highly successful periods at both BHP and Duke Energy of the US, which he led from 2003 to 2007.He is credited with turning round BHP, where he took over as chief executive in 1998, and was one of the architects of the 2001 merger with Billiton that created the company in its present form.At North Carolina-based Duke, he revived the company’s fortunes with some radical restructuring and engineered a merger with Cincinatti-based Cinergy to create one of the biggest power companies in the US.He also has impressive environmental credentials, having been an early convert to the idea that global warming was an issue that the energy industry needed to tackle, and an advocate of a carbon tax to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Mr Anderson’s age may count against him, however: he is 64, slightly older than Mr Sutherland who recently turned 63.But appointing an American chairman could be attractive to BP, which has about 40 per cent of its business in the US.It faces a variety of potential regulatory challenges under the Barack Obama’s administration of including the threat of higher taxes on the oil industry and the prospect of curbs on greenhouse gases, including a “cap and trade” system to control and price carbon dioxide emissions.
75;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2009-03-13T15:24:31Z;Reasons to be cheerful in a downturn;;Environmental projects are already suffering in the recession, according to recent research. HSBC, the international banking group, forecasts that the market for wind energy will drop by 20 per cent in 2009, the first time in years that wind companies have seen anything but rapid growth.New Energy Finance, a research company, says investment in clean energy last year reached $155bn, about 4.4 per cent higher than in 2007. But this masks a different trend – in the first half of last year, there was strong growth. In the second half, this dropped off dramatically, with asset finance for clean energy projects down 25 per cent on its peak level. NEF forecasts that this year will be flat, with about $150bn of investment in the sector.Michael Liebreich, chief executive, says such levels would be insufficient to achieve the carbon reductions scientists say are needed: “This should be a real wake-up call. Something has to happen, [such as] restoring [bank] credit to clean energy projects.”In Europe, the carbon price under the European Union’s emissions trading scheme has plummeted, providing little incentive to make the investments necessary to reduce companies’ greenhouse gas output, and many appear to have sold off their carbon permits in order to raise short-term cash.Recycling has suffered a serious blow as the price of commodities has plunged, shrinking the profits from dealing with waste. Environmental consultancies are also facing a tough year, with growth flat at best, as clients question or scale back projects. And chief executives who a year ago liked to trumpet loudly their green credentials have fallen largely silent, although most companies with environmental plans say they have no intention of dropping them.Yet, despite these portents of gloom, there are reasons to be cheerful for both businesses in the sector and companies looking to improve their environmental performance. One is that a large amount of money is about to enter the “green” economy, with the stimulus packages governments are concocting as a cure for the financial crisis. About $430bn of the planned $2,800bn of stimulus spending is likely to go on green measures, according to HSBC.“There is going to be a very significant upscaling of investment in the whole of green technology in the next two or three years,” Tony Blair, former UK prime minister, told the FT in an interview. “This is good for jobs.” He said public sector money would stimulate “massive amounts” of private sector investment, which would “set the direction to a low-carbon economy”. Europe’s experiences in reducing emissions “show that it is possible to have economic growth [while tackling climate change]”, he said.In the US alone, the beneficiaries of this “green new deal” will be many. Renewable energy companies will receive loan guarantees, and a new “smart” electricity grid, making it easier to incorporate renewable energy sources, will be built. The rail transport system will receive a $9bn upgrade, mainly for new high-speed inter-city links.Another of the big targets is energy efficiency, with projects from the “weatherisation” of homes for low-income families to refurbishing federal buildings to a higher environmental standard. Energy efficiency projects are particularly popular as they are labour-intensive, employing people from the construction industry, which has been one of the worst hit by the recession. The manufacture of products such as solar panels also creates construction sector jobs. Both reduce energy use and produce cost savings in the medium term.Governments, including China, South Korea and France, are also planning to send large amounts of their stimulus in green directions, in the form of tax breaks, subsidies and government-funded projects. Others, such as the UK and Japan, are likely to spend less, but will still be deploying substantial sums.This largesse is warmly welcomed by the industries involved. Rob Rogan, senior vice president at eSolar, a US solar energy company, says: “This recovery package is great news for solar power.We’re hoping both the refundable investment tax credit and manufacturing tax credit will prove very stimulating.”Moves to green the economy are coming at a vital time for international action on climate change. At a conference in Copenhagen in December, the world will negotiate a successor to the Kyoto protocol. The treaty will determine how the world tackles climate change for decades to come. Any new global framework is likely to require all companies, in all sectors, to start cutting their greenhouse gases – quickly and substantially, in the developed world and more slowly in poorer countries.The election of President Barack Obama in the US is viewed by EU diplomats as the most positive change possible, after years of foot-dragging by George W Bush. In sharp contrast to the previous administration, the new president has made clear his determination to negotiate a treaty this year and commit the US to substantial cuts in emissions – of about 16 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050, much of it to be achieved through a cap-and-trade system.Several business leaders have welcomed the president’s commitment to tackling climate change, which will force companies in all energy-intensive sectors to monitor and reduce their emissions. Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy in the US, says: “Decarbonising our economy by 80 per cent between now and 2050 would be historic. The sooner we pass climate change legislation, the better off our economy and the world’s environment.”However, he is concerned about some of the finer details of how a cap-and-trade system would work. If carbon was priced too high too quickly, it would raise electricity prices to consumers, which could give rise to a backlash. But, as the US government’s energy efficiency projects show, lower emissions do not have to mean higher costs. Cutting down on energy use saves money, as does being frugal with other resources.“Will we see a correlation between those who come out of the recession strongest and those who continue to invest in sustainability? We believe so, but it won’t only be because of their sustainability performance: it’s the recognition of where risks and costs are in the business, and where value can be created,” says Malcom Preston, partner at PwC.The combination of new environmental regulations in the US and continuing tightening of regulations elsewhere, government spending to expand the uptake of green goods and services, and the opportunities to cut costs through efficiencies, are likely to remain constants through the recession.Graham Mackay, chief executive of SABMiller, the brewer, which is working to cut its water use and greenhouse gas emissions, adds that companies should resist the temptation to move the environment down the agenda during the recession. He says: “Those businesses that consider sustainable development a discretionary activity will undoubtedly see it as an area for savings, but that misses the point. Sustainable development is not discretionary – it is a core part of business and a critical enabler of commercial success. I do not see how we could remain competitive if we invested less in these core business activities during difficult economic times.”
76;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2008-10-04T01:42:15Z;Gannett borrows extra $1.2bn;;Gannett has drawn down $1.2bn of its borrowing facilities, the publisher of USA Today announced on Friday night, demonstrating the growing rush by businesses to lock in funding as commercial paper markets shut down around them.The decision, which took Gannett’s borrowing under such facilities to $1.9bn, followed similar moves by Goodyear, General Motors and Duke Energy. The publisher, which is suffering from a broad decline in the US newspaper market, tapped agreements with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Barclays, saying the new borrowings would be used to repay commercial paper.Gannett’s use of its bank lines to replace funding it would otherwise have obtained from the commercial paper market highlights the difficulties many companies face in their attempts to raise even short-term funds.Revolving lines of credit are usually only used as a last resort. If many companies tap these back-up lines at the same time, they risk straining the banking system further as banks need to raise the cash to pass on to their corporate clients.Gannett had announced earlier in the week that it had taken the “prudent liquidity measure” of drawing down on its facilities on September 30, but did not disclose the sum that it had raised until Friday night.Standard & Poor’s ratings services warned it might cut Gannett’s credit ratings earlier in the week, prompting the publisher to say it continued to generate substantial cash flow.It added that it had ­“significant untapped availability under its $3.9bn of committed revolving credit facilities, far in excess of [its] total commercial paper obligations”.Craig A. Dubow, chairman and chief executive, also moved to reassure investors, saying: “Our underlying fundamentals remain strong and we continue to be a solid investment grade company.”Lending beyond one day remained effectively frozen on Friday in the money markets which banks use to finance themselves, with the dollar benchmark lending rate rising further.Investors have fled money market funds with investments in bank and company debt after huge unexpected losses resulting from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers nearly three weeks ago. Instead, large amounts of cash have been placed in short-dated US government debt.The extent of the shift became clear this week, when the Federal Reserve revealed the amount invested in the US commercial paper market fell by $95bn during the past week, its biggest weekly drop since the central bank began tracking the sector in 2001.“The $95bn decline in the amount of commercial paper outstanding would be more palatable for the financial markets if the issuers of commercial paper were finding outlets to raise capital,” said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond strategist at Miller Tabak Asset Management. “The problem is that they’re not.”
77;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2008-08-20T21:39:18Z;Venture capitalists boost smart power grid;;Venture capitalists’ growing appetite for companies working on technologies to improve large power grids was underlined on Wednesday after investors put $40m into Trilliant, a Silicon Valley so-called smart grid company.The investment by MissionPoint Capital Partners of the US and Zouk Ventures, a London venture capital group, marks one of the biggest in a string of funding deals for smart grid groups.At least half a dozen other smart grid funding deals have been struck this year in a boom in government support for technologies that improve power grid monitoring and management.Smart grid technologies aim to use IT tools to improve the efficiency and reliability of traditional power grids, whose technological underpinnings date back to the 19th century.The technology can also help smooth the integration of alternative supplies of energy, such as wind or solar power, into existing power infrastructure.Smart grid technologies could allow utility groups to better manage the loads on networks by raising prices at times of peak demand. That would encourage customers to perform non-essential tasks at times of lower demand, to save money.US energy regulators have suggested that a 5 per cent improvement in energy efficiency of US power grids would save energy equivalent to 42 large coal-fired power plants. Bill Vogel, Trilliant’s chief executive, said the funding would “significantly accelerate” the company’s push to become a leading smart grid company.Trilliant, founded in 1985, makes networking and information technologies that allow power utilities to get a better picture of the power demands on their networks and better manage the provision of energy across them.Its customers include Duke Energy, the US oil and gas group, and Hydro One, a Canadian power utility.Trilliant said it would use the money to accelerate growth and expand overseas.Other funding deals are a $23m investment in BPL Global, a smart grid rival, led by Morgan Stanley, and a $17.4m investment in Silver Spring Networks, a networking company focused on power grids.

79;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Quest for clear direction: Corporate America confronts most uncertain outlook in years;;"Theodore Chandler has not had a good summer. As chief executive of LandAmerica, a large provider of property services such as insurance, Mr Chandler was on the front line when the US housing bubble burst.“It has been surprisingly bad,” he says. “Summer is typically our best season, as a lot of people buy and sell houses, but 2007 will go down as the year when the summer never came.”Mr Chandler now faces an unappealing conundrum. LandAmerica has already shed 1,800 of its 14,000 staff and closed branches. He may have to undertake more cost-cutting to cushion the blow of a deepening crisis. But that could leave the Virginia-based company too thinly spread if the housing market rebounds and business picks up.The problem is, Mr Chandler does not really know which way the wind is blowing. “It is the most perplexing market we have been in, because of the paradox of a still healthy US economy and reduced-volume real estate sector.”He is not alone. For the first time in nearly half a decade, US companies have to grapple with an economic environment that is both worrying and unpredictable. After years of chugging along at a relatively brisk and steady pace, the domestic economy has been rocked by the credit squeeze and a housing crisis, which have raised the prospect of a sharp downturn. Neither data nor experts have so far been able to indicate whether the current turmoil will have a lasting negative impact on the world’s largest economy.Even a seasoned watcher such as Robert Rubin, chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup and former Treasury secretary, recently acknowledged that the outlook was “highly uncertain”.The most likely scenario remains that – with the help of recent and future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve – the US economy will get through a couple of quarters of very subdued growth (possibly in the 1.5-2 per cent range in the last three months of this year and the first quarter of 2008) and gradually strengthen next year as the housing correction abates.But there is also an unusually large risk that the housing market woes could become even worse and depress consumer spending. That in turn would raise the chances of the US economy sliding into recession – a probability many economists currently estimate at about 25-30 per cent. “The biggest issue for business at the moment is uncertainty,” says Ian Davis, who as the head of McKinsey, the management consultancy, is in constant touch with corporate leaders. “Most businesses don’t know what is going to happen and that makes things very difficult.”The strategies adopted by companies to deal with these uncertain times are likely to separate the corporate winners from the losers of the next phase of the business cycle. So should companies ramp up investment and employment levels in the hope of a quick rebound? Or should they adopt a defensive stance, cutting expenditure (including jobs) in anticipation of tougher times ahead?These questions have been reverberating through boardrooms across America for the past few weeks but have few answers. When the Business Roundtable asked its members – some 120 of the largest US corporations – whether they were planning to hire more workers in the next six months, it found them split. One third of the companies polled said they wanted to hire more, while just over one quarter said they would cut staff.Similarly, when quizzed about future plans for capital expenditure, half of the executives say they would leave that spending unchanged – a response that underlines their inability to read the economic tea leaves.In the words of Alan Mulally, the chief executive of Ford, a company that is counting on robust US growth to pull it out of a financial and operational crisis: “This is a very ambiguous time right now, because the economy is still growing …but the credit market is tightening [and] the overhang on the homes, new home construction – those are real issues.”Policymakers face similar dilemmas, amplified by the fact that the latest economic data, which lag the real economy by several weeks, have been mixed. Consumer spending seems to be holding up well, though income growth has slowed. Recent automotive sales were not bad and durable goods orders suggest the corporate sector is neither booming nor throwing in the towel. The August jobs report at first appeared to point to a weakening labour market. But last Friday’s sharp upward revision of the August data, coupled with positive figures for September, showed that the labour market had withstood the initial impact of the credit squeeze well.The lack of a clear picture is not surprising. It is likely to take several months before the impact of the credit squeeze shows up in the macroeconomic data. Companies, unfortunately, cannot wait that long and, out of the cacophony of conflicting evidence, a number of distinct corporate strategies are beginning to emerge.One is to carry on with business plans regardless of the perilous economic situation. Companies that have taken this route tend to be concentrated among utilities and other regulated sectors such as pharmaceuticals and tobacco whose profits are less exposed to the vagaries of economic cycles.Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, the North-Carolina-based utility, believes this strategy is underpinned by the role traditionally played by companies such as his. “We have different dynamics from the rest of the economy,” he says. “We provide vital infrastructure to the country. The US has an ageing infrastructure and we need to upgrade it regardless of the economic or business cycle.”To prove the point, Duke recently boosted its planned capital expenditure for the next five years to $22.5bn (£11bn, €16bn). Last month, the New Jersey-based NRG meanwhile submitted the first application in nearly three decades to build nuclear reactors in the US – a project that could cost the equivalent of one-third of the company’s $10bn market capital.But the expansionary plans of Duke and NRG are simply not suitable for the many companies that have been more directly affected by the property and credit crisis. For housebuilders, carmakers, banks and, to a lesser extent, retailers, the real issue is how to scale back costs and production just enough to weather the storm but not too much to hamper a future recovery. At Ford, for example, Mr Mulally has instituted quarterly meetings to review production levels and quickly adjust the company’s vehicle output to changes in demand. “You immediately tailor your production to what [the] real demand is,” he explains.Wall Street has taken more drastic measures. The current season of quarterly earnings reports from investment banks has been a pretty bloody affair, with blue chips such as Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers announcing the closure of business units and hundreds of job losses.Retailers, which rely more than most on the financial health of Middle America, have been adopting a more cautious approach in making their inventory decisions for the remainder of the year and the crucial holiday shopping season. Some, such as Target, the fourth-largest US retailer, and Lowe’s, the second-biggest home improvement chain, have already issued profit warnings. The National Retail Federation is predicting a 4 per cent increase in retail store spending in November and December, the lowest growth for five years.Ken Hicks, president of JCPenney, the department store chain, sums up the sector’s worries thus: “I don’t think anybody knows for sure exactly what the consumer is going to do this fall …Macroeconomic issues are something that we can’t control.”Economists share Mr Hicks’ sense of powerlessness. Over the past few years, US consumer spending has proven remarkably resilient to a variety of shocks, including the housing downturn. With the stock market up and income growth relatively good over the past year, it is possible that spending will not slow dramatically, especially if unemployment experiences only a gentle upward drift from the current low levels.But the threat that the housing woes could spill over into other areas of the economy, precipitating a crisis in consumer confidence, looms large. House prices are probably now falling year-on-year (although different measures tell somewhat differing stories) and home equity withdrawal has become substantially more difficult as a result of the near-seizing up of the mortgage market. The recovery in the equity market helps by counterbalancing the loss of housing wealth, but stocks could just as easily retreat if consumption and the economy soften.That is why many experts believe the winners, or even survivors, of the tectonic shift in macroeconomic conditions will be the companies that are less dependent on the slowing US domestic economy. The stock market, for one, seems to agree: the latest rally in the Dow Jones industrial average has been led by the likes of Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Intel – multinationals that derive most of their sales from outside North America. The slide in the dollar has sharpened the competitive edge of US-based international companies by boosting export volumes and the value of overseas profits.“The increase in exports has created a lot of economic activity,” says Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx, the delivery group whose performance is one of the most accurate gauges of global economic fluctuations. “We don’t just carry things from China and Europe into the US; we are carrying stuff from the US abroad too.”Although FedEx recently cut its profit forecast, citing US economic woes, Mr Smith says a company that moves some 6m packages around the world every day draws its strength from global growth. “We benefit from the continued integration of the global economy,” he says. “The fortunes of large companies these days transcend those of any single economy.”This is indeed the hope not only of the big multi­nationals but also many other companies that have made globalisation their business. Yet the assumption behind this strategy – a “decoupling” that enables the global economy to grow at a healthy clip despite a US slowdown – has not been tested by events and could yet prove a pipe dream.There is, however, a pocket of the US economy that is resolutely not global but could still benefit from the darkening economic clouds. Known as “value investors” or, less politely, “vultures”, financiers such as Warren Buffett and Wilbur Ross could take advantage of the unsettled conditions to buy troubled assets at bargain prices.“It is not just the growth in the economy that matters but also the price at which you can buy something,” says Jim Tisch, who heads Loews, the hotels-to-pipelines group assembled by buying undervalued US companies. “If everybody moves to where the growth is, buying low-growth assets in the US could be a good opportunity.”A “low-growth opportunity”, indeed. As corporate America stares, undecided, at the economic junction ahead, it will have to bear agonisingly in mind the risks inherent in embarking on the wrong road.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall"
80;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2007-08-07T22:03:09Z;US financials rally on Fed statement;;"Wall Street ended higher on Tuesday, thanks to a late rally that overcame an initially negative market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook.“This was really the continuation of the rally that began on Monday,” said Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management. “The fundamentals were always there. If the Fed had made a stronger statement, we might have seen a worse market reaction.”After a jittery afternoon session, the S&P 500 index finished up 0.6 per cent at 1476.71, the Nasdaq Composite ended 0.6 per cent higher at 2,561.60 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.26 per cent at 13504.3.In post-market trade, shares in Cisco surged more than 6 per cent to $31.48 after the tech bellwether reported a 25 per cent rise in fiscal fourth quarter profit. Cisco rose 0.6 per cent to close at $29.69 in regular trade.The Federal Reserve reiterated the risk posed by inflation and continued to forecast a moderate pace of economic expansion. It noted that markets had been volatile in recent weeks.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards said: “This was a harsher statement than what the market was looking for. It leaves us with a couple of months of uncertainty and the Fed could have helped ease that with a sentence or two saying ‘we stand ready to inject liquidity into the system’.”The initial disappointment with the statement was reflected in sharp falls. The S&P 500 index plunged 1.4 per cent in reaction, while the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average both fell by 1.3 per cent immediately following the statement.But the final hours of trading saw a strong rally, led by homebuilders and some financial stocks. The S&P Homebuilder Index was up 5 per cent.TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said: “The statement supports our view that, in the next six to eight weeks, we will know whether the ‘wheels are going to come off’, either from a financial crisis or a greater than expected economic slowdown due to tightening financial conditions, or [if] the financial markets and economy are going to successfully weather the current storm.”Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, finished 5.8 per cent lower. The Vix hit a peak of 26.47 on Monday, its highest reading since April 2003.Among the main S&P industry groups, the financials sector was in the spotlight, rising 0.9 per cent on the day.Leading the charge among financials were Fannie Mae, up 3 per cent at $64.43, and Freddie Mac, 2.8 per cent higher at $61.64. Talk that the government-sponsored enterprises might be allowed to expand their mortgage balance sheets continued to boost their stock prices.Both Fannie and Freddie currently operate under strict portfolio limits, and at the end of June their holdings of mortgages were about $38bn below those caps, said Credit Suisse.Analysts also said the sharp decline in the price of mortgage securities in recent weeks should entail higher profits for the GSE’s as their cost of funding has not risen sharply.“Even if some temporary flexibility is given, the GSEs will probably be required
to make formal requests to amend their growth enforcement orders, have explicit plans on what is to be purchased, and explain how such actions will help the market,” said Alex Li, fixed income strategist at Credit Suisse.The rebound in financials also extended to Wall Street investment banks, which have recently been hit hard by financing problems in mortgage and credit markets.In a conference call held on Tuesday, Moody’s said big investment banks faced a “modest” risk from subprime mortgages and no rating changes were expected.The issuance of new securities in both markets has slowed to a crawl as investors have baulked at buying a pipeline of $300bn in loans and bonds.By the close, the S&P investment bank index was up 1.4 per cent, with Bear Stearns up 2.7 per cent at $116.89, while Lehman Brothers was 4.2 per cent stronger at $60.71.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, was up 2.2 per cent at $27.35, after a rally of 7 per cent on Monday.Beyond financials, investors focused on quarterly earnings news.Wynn Resorts boosted other casino stocks after it reported a quarterly profit of $89.6m. The shares surged 10 per cent to $118.20, after setting an all-time high of $123.71 in early trade.Duke Energy reported a 17 per cent fall in quarterly profit and the stock was 5.4 per cent firmer at $18.86."
81;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
82;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T21:07:36+0000;Bush’s green noises greeted with scepticism;;In the last few months President George W. Bush has performed a number of U-turns.On Monday, for example, US officials held direct talks in Baghdad with their Iranian counterparts for the first time since the 1979 revolution. Similarly, sharp policy changes have occurred on North Korea and Iraq, where Mr Bush suddenly abandoned talk of “victory” following last November’s congressional elections.But Thursday’s speech on global warming, in which Mr Bush proposed that the world should agree a target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, may come to be seen as the most brazen of them all.Summing up the administration’s climate change stance in 2001 following Mr Bush’s first Europe visit, Andrew Card, then White House chief of staff, said: “The emperor Kyoto was running around for a long time and he was naked. It took President Bush to say, ’The guy doesn’t have any clothes on.’”On Thursday Mr Bush essentially proposed a successor protocol to Kyoto, which expires in 2012 and which his administration summarily rejected. Many were virtually speechless at Mr Bush’s change of tune, which he attributed to new scientific evidence. “For the last six and a half years, President Bush has been doing everything possible to prevent international action to tackle global warming and to question whether it is even happening,” said Emily Figdor, director of the global warming programme at Public Interest Research Group, an environmental body. “So please forgive me for sounding a little sceptical.”Others were more incredulous, citing the fact that Mr Bush’s administration continues to contest the right of 12 US states, including California, to set targets to reduce their car emissions – policies which would require a federal waiver.Thursday’s announcement also follows weeks of wrangling between the US and Germany over the text of a communiqué at next week’s Group of Eight leading industrialised nations summit, during which Bush administration officials have strenuously objected to any language that would limit permissible increases in average global temperature.“This is a transparent effort to divert attention from the president’s refusal to accept any emissions reductions proposals at next week’s G8 summit,” said Philip Clap, head of the National Environmental Trust, another lobby group.“The White House is just trying to hide the fact that the President is completely isolated among the G8 leaders by calling vaguely for some agreement next year, right before he leaves office.”However, Barbara Boxer, the Democratic senator who is leading congressional efforts to create a US carbon cap-and-trade system which Mr Bush continues to oppose, yesterday congratulated him for accepting her proposal to convene a summit of the world’s 12 largest economies to set a climate change target. “I stand ready to assist him with the summit and negotiations in any way I can,” she said.Whether or not Mr Bush’s change of policy on global warming is heartfelt, observers are agreed that the US president had little choice but to “get on the right side of history” in the words of a former administration official. Mr Bush has become increasingly isolated on climate change – both globally and within the US – with even some of his staunchest Republican allies accepting the need for action long before his own conversion to the cause.A growing number of evangelical Christians, the bedrock of Mr Bush’s electoral support, have embraced the issue, convinced that responsible stewardship of the environment is a Christian mission. Last year, a group of prominent evangelical leaders launched an advertising campaign on Christian radio stations raising the alarm on global warming.US business leaders have also increasingly broken from Mr Bush on the issue. In January, 10 of the biggest US companies, including Alcoa, General Electric and Lehman Brothers, urged the president to embrace mandatory carbon emissions caps.“The US should take a leadership position in the next phase of Kyoto,” said Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, in an interview with the Financial Times at the time. “It is important that our national response syncs up with the worldwide response.”Meanwhile, almost all of the 2008 presidential candidates have accepted the science behind global warming and the need for action. “Political forces have converged in America to create a perfect storm,” said Julianne Smith, a senior analyst at the Centre for Strategic International Studies in Washington.“One by one, Republicans, business leaders, governors and evangelicals have changed their position. Mr Bush is really following them and not leading.”But the real test, say observers, will be in the precise stance Mr Bush takes at the global warming summits he plans to convene. “Mr Bush says technology, technology technology, and the Europeans say regulation, regulation, regulation,” said Ms Smith. “Let’s see what happens in practice.”
83;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2007-02-06T22:56:41Z;US utilities/environment;;Grandchildren are hardly over-represented in US corporate decision-making. Jim Rogers, Duke Energy’s chief executive, is an exception. But when he talks about his “grandchildren test”, he is not letting his heart rule his head. By taking a public stance, together with a group of other corporate heavyweights, on the desirability of environmental legislation, he has at least got himself a seat at the negotiating table. That will surely turn out to be sensible, given the likelihood of some mandated system to enforce limits on carbon emissions.The economic impact of such regulation may be years away but it could be significant – all the more reason to be there at the start of the debate. There are a few key issues that current and future investors need to be thinking about now. The first and obvious one is the pricing of carbon “credits” under some sort of trading regime for carbon dioxide emissions. Duke is already taking into account a range of pricing in its resource planning. The second is the allocation of carbon credits: some utilities want permits to be allocated based on carbon dioxide emitted, others prefer to look at total electricity output. It may seem technical, but the economic impact of such a choice will flow through eventually. Thirdly, investors need to keep an eye on the cost of new technologies. Environmental legislation to control sulphur dioxide emissions – which also used a cap-and-trade system – is credited with reducing the cost of “scrubbers” to clean up emissions. If a similar system could do the same for carbon dioxide, that too would have an important impact on capital investment and future earnings growth.The current reality may seem far removed from such calculations. But the debate is heating up. Duke’s investors should be pleased their CEO is in the thick of it.
84;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2007-02-06T22:13:31Z;Technology companies depress sentiment;;US stocks were weighed down today by concerns over technology groups.The S&P 500 rose 1 point to close at 1,447.99 as investors cautiously awaited the release of critical economic data on Wednesday.“It is going to be a low volume, not-much-movement-day,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards. “The [productivity] data [on Wednesday] will be critically important.”The tech-led Nasdaq Composite index rallied to recover early losses and close flat at 2,471.49.The Philadelphia semiconductor index was 0.6 per cent weaker at 464.30, with 12 of the 19 members listed in the index seeing their share prices fall.Shares in National Semiconductor led the way down, dropping 2.74 per cent to $22.68 after the group lowered its guidance for third-quarter revenues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was steady at 12,666.31, held down by shares in Hewlett Packard, which were 1.9 per cent lower at $42.01. The printer and computer maker’s stock fell after rival Eastman Kodak released a new line of printers.Investors were hoping that Cisco Systems’ quarterly results announcement, due after the market closed, would lift the sector.The network systems group said its second quarter earnings rose from $1.4bn to $1.9bn, beating analysts expectations. Before the announcement its shares closed 0.84 per cent lower at $27.28. The shares were trading 5 per cent higher at $28.64 in after hours trading.Avon Products reported that net income rose to $184.1m from $183.2m in the fourth quarter. The group’s first profit increase in six quarters helped its shares rise by 9.8 per cent to $38.00.In deal news, Blackstone, the buy-out group, increased its bid for Equity Office Properties to $39bn, or $55.50 a share in cash, from a prior bid of $54. Last week, Vornado Realty Trust tabled a $56 cash and stock bid for EOP. The new Blackstone bid came a day before shareholders of EOP were set to vote on the deal. Shares in EOP were up 1 per cent at $56.05 in early trading.Mortgage insurance provider MGIC Investment said it would buy Radian Group in a $4.9bn all stock deal to form a mortgage and credit risk insurance company with $15bn in assets.Shares in MGIC and Radian rose by 11.38 per cent and 9.3 per cent to $70.1 and $66.51 respectively.Shares in Quality Systems plunged 8.58 per cent to $41.26 after the healthcare information technology provider said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought records on its chief financial officer for an investigation into trading in the company’s shares.Shares in Globalstar fell by 28.18 per cent to $10.40 after the satellite phone operator said technical problems may disrupt its service.Signs of lacklustre demand for cruises saw Carnival fall by 3 per cent to $49.27.
85;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2006-09-28T18:37:29Z;Benefits can be fictional in fiscal switch to green;;"Green taxes are the future: so say a large coalition of politicians, economists and environmentalists. Their dual promise of a better environment and extra tax revenues gives these a unique appeal. They seem more popular than other taxes, they help tackle serious global problems and they may even improve the working of the economy.Countries across Europe, including France, Ireland and Switzerland, are examining the scope for more green taxes. In Britain, the main opposition parties have proposed a “green switch” to environmental taxes. The Liberal Democrats, for instance, called for these as part of “the biggest overhaul to British tax policy in modern times”.Finance ministers concerned about future budget shortfalls are eyeing such taxes with enthusiasm. Dieter Helm, a fellow at New College, Oxford, says: “Within five years, this is the way that most democratic governments will plug their revenue gaps.”Even in the US, renowned for its opposition to energy taxes, the subject is being discussed. Paul Anderson, chairman of Duke Energy, a Fortune 500 energy company, who has repeatedly called for a carbon tax to tackle global warming, says attitudes are changing. “In the media, in business circles and even in the halls of Congress we are hearing serious discussion about a carbon tax.”In principle, the enthusiasm for green taxes is well founded. Taxing environmentally damaging activities sends a signal about the costs of pollution: in economists’ jargon, it “internalises” an otherwise ignored “externality”. They also raise revenues that can be used to cut other unpopular taxes, such as taxes on labour. The aim, as the British government put it in 1997, is to “shift the tax burden from ‘goods’ to ‘bads’”.But despite their undoubted merits, the claims for green taxes are easily exaggerated. Enthusiasts for the “green shift” often overstate the case. They argue that when environmental taxes are used to cut labour taxes they offer a “double dividend” – a better environment and more jobs. This claim is hotly disputed among economists. Moreover, recent experience suggests that a radical shift towards green taxes may be harder than the politicians imply. Despite a flurry of enthusiasm for environmental taxes in the 1990s, progress has slowed in recent years.Indeed, across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, revenues from environmental taxes decreased slightly between 1995 and 2003 – a trend only partly explained by a reduction in petrol demand in Europe. The 375 environmental taxes levied in the OECD currently raise an average equivalent to 2-2.5 per cent of gross domestic product – or 6-7 per cent of total tax revenues.The main obstacles to green taxation are political: a fear that competitiveness might be lost and that poor households could suffer, according to a recent OECD report. As a result, governments have granted more than 1,150 exemptions favouring various economic sectors and products – reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of the taxes.A report this year by the European Environment Agency concluded that, with the current structure of tax revenues, the prevalence of these exemptions was cause for scepticism. A 15 per cent increase in green taxes would be needed to reduce taxes on labour across the European Union by 2 per cent. “The potential for easing the traditional tax burden, through shifts towards taxing the use of the environment, seems limited,” it said.There is no shortage of candidates for environmental taxes. Apart from energy and transport, there is a fast-growing and largely effective category of taxes on pollution, waste, resources, chemicals and packaging. For example, in Ireland shoppers pay tax on plastic bags and in Finland on disposable cups, while Hungary taxes air pollution.But this group of taxes accounts for just 0.2 per cent of European tax revenues; even a sharp increase in these taxes would offer little scope to cut labour taxes.Transport also poses problems as a source of additional revenues. In Europe, taxes (excluding value added tax) account for 40-60 per cent of fuel prices, which – along with tough emission standards – has helped make Europe’s cars much more fuel-efficient than their US counterparts. But high fuel prices have led to resistance from motorists, which came to a head with the blockages and motorway “go-slows” of fuel protests in the UK, France and elsewhere in 2000. Although there is scope for new taxes on aviation fuel in Europe, that industry appears to have sidestepped this threat by opting into the EU’s emissions trading scheme instead.Energy and carbon taxes present the stiffest test of politicians’ resolve. They have been widely introduced – in Scandinavia, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the UK among others – but they have been hedged with large concessions to reduce their impact on heavy industry and poor households.Political constraints mean that energy taxes have fallen far short of what is needed to address the threat of global warming. This was vividly illustrated in the early 1990s by the disastrous attempt by then president Bill Clinton to introduce an energy tax in the US and the acrimonious failure of EU efforts to agree a common energy tax.These failures mean that the idea put forward in the early 1990s of tackling climate change through an international agreement to levy a carbon tax was stillborn.Instead, the international effort to tackle climate change was based around another economic instrument: an emissions trading scheme, based on tradeable permits that limit the quantity of emissions. This approach, which was also adopted within the EU, was more palatable to industry than a carbon tax. Indeed, industry has often benefited from emissions trading because it has usually succeeded in persuading governments to give away – rather than auction – permits to existing businesses.Objections to new carbon taxes will not come from industry alone. Most countries do not tax coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel of all. Imposing new taxes on coal will be unpopular and affect security of energy supplies.None of these problems are fatal. The OECD says green taxes “can be effective and efficient instruments for environmental policy”.For green taxes to work as an environmental measure, they should be high enough to change taxpayers’ behaviour. Yet the more successful a tax is at reducing pollution, the less revenue it will generate. Green taxes have a role in raising revenues and tackling environmental problems. But trying to do both at the same time is more difficult than the political rhetoric suggests."
86;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2006-06-29T20:43:18Z;Wall Street surges on rate decision;;"Wall Street enjoyed a dramatic rally on Thursday, surging in the final hours after news on interest rates from the Federal Reserve.The wave of buying pushed all main indices up sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying its best day since April 2005.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee said economic growth was moderating but inflation expectations were “contained”. Initial reaction was that its brief statement left it more leeway to discontinue its campaign of tightening interest rates.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the post-decision rally was an expression of investor relief. “The market is breathing a sigh of relief that it’s over and we can now get on with our lives,” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.2 per cent, or 26.87 points, at 1,272.87, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 3 per cent, or 62.54 points, at 2,174.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 per cent, or 217.24 points, at 11,190.80. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies leapt 3.5 per cent.All the main indices jumped by between one and two percentage points in the aftermath of the Fed announcement.Energy stocks rose steeply, aided by strong crude prices, which reached $73 a barrel. Valero rose 4.3 per cent to a six-week high of $66.13, and Sunoco gained 5.3 per cent to $68.73.Duke Energy leapt 4.6 per cent to $29.69 after announcing on Wednesday that it would spin off its natural gas business to its shareholders. The move prompted Lehman Brothers to raise its rating on the stock from “equal weight” to “over weight”.Stronger copper and gold prices buoyed mining stocks. Freeport McMoran rose
10.2 per cent to $55.26, and Barrick Gold gained 5.3 per cent to $29.28.Healthcare provider Cigna rose 5 per cent to $96.26 after an announcement that the company’s stock buy-back programme would be increased by a further $500m.Open-source software maker Red Hat was a rare loser, plunging 6.4 per cent to $23.40, its lowest level since November. On Wednesday, the company reported earnings that came in below analysts’ forecasts, due to accounting charges and the acquisition of JBoss, another software maker.Micron Technology also disappointed with its fiscal third-quarter earnings, sending shares down 5.3 per cent to $15.12. Revenue came in below analysts' expectations.But there were gains elsewhere in the technology sector, with Jabil up 6.3 per cent to $25.74 after it announced it would buy back $200m worth of shares. Electronic Arts was up 5.1 per cent to $43.47.Consumer stocks performed well. McDonald’s added 5 per cent to $33.56 and Starbucks soared 6.3 per cent to $37.97."
87;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2006-05-02T20:15:46Z;Lex: US utilities;;Energy conservation has been all the rage in the US lately. Fortunately for utility companies, neither that, nor the relatively mild winter, has damped profits. Instead, high natural gas prices have pushed up electricity prices across the board. At FPL Group, Florida’s largest utility and the leading US generator of wind power, that helped boost underlying earnings in the first quarter by 36 per cent year-on-year. Duke Energy, which remains the largest US utility for now, was similarly able to offset lower residential energy demand, mainly due to better wholesale prices.Assessing how sustainable the latest pick-up in profits will prove is even harder than usual, with much of the industry busying itself with selling and buying businesses. Much of the corporate activity is sensible. Duke looks set to part with its gas business before too long, having just completed merging with its electricity rival, Cinergy. While Duke’s discount to the sum of its parts already looks small, the end result should be a more tightly focused set of operations.The snag is that it remains hard to say how much of any gains investors in various energy companies will ultimately be able to pocket. US energy regulation remains highly fragmented. That not only impacts prices, but can also complicate consolidation – witness FPL’s difficulties in consummating its merger with Maryland’s Constellation Energy. It also remains far from clear what, if any, curbs on greenhouse gases will eventually be imposed nationally. For now, the sector’s defensive appeal looks fairly limited.
88;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2006-05-02T16:24:37Z;Duke Energy unmoved by missed estimates;;Duke Energy, the largest US utility, on Tuesday reported earnings excluding special items that missed estimates following the divestment from a gas venture, but added that full-year earnings would beat forecasts.The company said per-share earnings excluding items were up 11.6 per cent to 48 cents, a penny shy of average analyst estimates.Net earnings fell 59 per cent to $358m, or 37 cents per share, from $866m, or 88 cents, thanks to last year’s gain from an asset sale.Duke sold a 19.7 per cent stake in Duke Energy Field Services, a gas-processing business, to ConocoPhillips. The company has disposed of assets worth more than $6bn in the past three years, exiting unprofitable business include power generation.The company became the largest utility operator in the US after the $9.2bn acquisition of Cinergy in April amid a trend of consolidation in the sector.James Rogers, chief executive, said Duke’s “electric and gas operations delivered solid performances this quarter” and said it was happy with a full-year earnings target of $1.90 per share, 6 cents above estimates.Cinergy, whose results were separate from Duke’s in the first quarter, saw per-share earnings after items rise 3.3 per cent to 62 cents, from 60 cents a year ago. Net earnings per share fell 35 per cent to 39 cents.Duke’s pipeline business reported 6.6 per cent growth in earnings, while its international energy division surged almost 28 per cent to $87m, compared with $68m in the previous year.The company attributed the jump to strong prices and revenues in Latin America.As part of its restructuring process, Duke has said it is looking to divest from its gas distribution business and has hired Lazard to look for strategic options for the operation, which includes more than 17,500 miles of pipeline.
89;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2006-04-11T22:28:11Z;Goldman and Merrill staff charged with insider trading;;Prosecutors on Tuesday accused three employees at Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs of taking part in a “massive” $6.7m international insider trading scheme involving the sharing of tips on sensitive mergers and acquisitions by Merrill clients.Michael Garcia, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, said Stanislav Shpigelman, a 23-year-old investment banking analyst at Merrill Lynch, gave Eugene Plotkin, an associate in the fixed income division of Goldman Sachs, and another person, information on six different pending mergers in exchange for cash payments.The indictment paints a picture of Wall Street go-getters who hoped to find other ways to maximise their gains, including helping other individuals get jobs at investment banks in the hope that they would later share insider tips with them.It is alleged that Mr Plotkin and David Pajcin, another former Goldman employee who was previously arrested by the FBI and is co-operating with the investigation, used the information to buy stocks based on knowledge of the deals before they were publicly announced. The tips included information about Procter & Gamble’s takeover of Gillette, Novartis’s takeover of Eon, the merger between Cinergy and Duke Energy, and Adidas’s takeover of Reebok.In the case of Reebok, prosecutors allege that an account in the name of Sonja Anticevic had purchased nearly 2,000 “out of money” call options for Reebok stock for $130,000 two days before the deal was announced. The sale of the call options ultimately reaped a $2m profit following a surge in Reebok shares. An investigation into the account found it was controlled by the three defendants, according to the complaint.It alleges that Mr Plotkin first introduced Mr Pajcin to Mr Shpigelman in 2004, at a Russian day spa called Spa 88 in lower Manhattan. At a later meeting, the Merrill employee told the others he had flown to Ohio, where P&G is based, to deliver documents related to the Gillette deal. It is alleged Mr Pajcin told an FBI agent that he and Mr Plotkin shared the information with other traders, including a dancer from New York and “foreign tippees” from Germany and Switzerland.Mr Plotkin, a Harvard graduate who worked at Goldman since 2000, and Mr Pajcin are alleged to have hatched another scheme to trade on information from BusinessWeek magazine, which they obtained in early copies by bribing two employees at the print plant where the magazine was produced.The two are said to have made $340,000 from buying the stocks before the column was public and later selling them. Prosecutors allege that the two print plant employees gave Mr Plotkin and Mr Pajcin the named of stocks that were mentioned favourably in the magazine’s “Inside Wall Street” column.The two men named in the complaint could not be reached for comment.
90;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2005-12-19T14:10:29Z;FPL to buy Constellation for $11bn;;FPL Group on Monday agreed to acquire Constellation Energy in an $11.1bn all-stock transaction which analysts expect will trigger further consolidation in the US power-generation market.Shareholders in Florida-based FPL would hold 60 per cent of the enlarged entity, which would adopt the Constellation Energy brand and have pro forma annual revenues of $27bn, ranking it third in the US market behind the products of two other takeovers announced over the past 12 months.The new Constellation Energy would retain both well-regarded management teams and have a diversified mix of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power stations serving more than 7m customers.The two companies said a combination would also create the largest power producer in competitive markets, reflecting the complexities of the partially-deregulated US system and the pressures faced in regulated markets where retail and commercial prices are often capped in long-term supply agreements.“What you see here is a clear trend,” said Mark Williams, an energy expert at Boston University. ”FPL’s business is about 80-90 per cent regulated, and Constellation’s is about 75 per cent unregulated.”The two companies estimated the proposed deal would generate $200m-$250m in annual synergies after three years and expect regulatory approvals to take 9-12 months.Recent legislation and regulatory decisions have also increased the likelihood of further consolidation, and the stock prices of potential takeover candidates such as First Energy and Northeast Utilities have climbed in their wake.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently approved the planned purchase of PSEG by Exelon to create the largest US power producer, though the deal still has to secure other clearances. Ferc also backed the purchase of Cinergy by Duke Energy and MidAmerican’s acquisition of PacifiCorp.The new energy bill has added to the momentum, said Mr Williams. “Congress lifting the ban on interstate mergers lifts the flood gates. If you’re a medium to small-sized utility, watch out. If you’re a bigger utility, watch out, there might be ones that want to expand into your area.”The terms of the proposed FPL/Constellation deal are in line with media reports last week, with each common share of Constellation converted into 1.44 shares of the enlarged entity, a premium of 15 per cent on the average exchange ratio in the previous 20 days.FPL would have nine of the 15 board seats, with FPL head Lewis Hay taking on the chief executive role while Constellation’s Mayo Shattuck would become chairman.
91;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2005-05-13T20:51:26Z;Volatility continues on Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks continued their recent volatile pattern to finish the week lower amid mixed corporate results and uncertainty about the pace of economic growth.By the close on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.5 per cent down at 10,140.12 on the day as the broader S&P 500 index gave up 0.5 per cent to 1,154.05. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 per cent to 1,976.80.For the week, the Dow lost 2 per cent, the S&P 500 declined 1.5 per cent while the Nasdaq managed a 0.5 per cent gain, helped by positive earnings from several technology bellwethers.While retail sales figures on Thursday and trade deficit data two days earlier turned out much better than expected, investor sentiment was damped by disappointing data on consumer confidence on Friday. A tumble in crude futures also signalled expectations that slowing economic activity might weigh on demand for oil.In addition, disappointing earnings results from Wal-Mart on Thursday indicated a shift in consumer behaviour towards low-end, low-margin merchandise. This further fanned worries about a prolonged “soft patch” in US economic activity.Wal-Mart shares declined 2 per cent on Thursday. Target, its chief rival, rose 1.2 per cent in the same session as it reported higher earnings. For the week, Wal-Mart lost 3.7 per cent while Target gained 3.7 per cent by the close on Friday.Dell Computer, the world’s largest maker of personal computers, confounded fears about the outlook for profits by reporting a 28 per cent rise in quarterly profits after the Thursday close. Dell saw its shares add 7.4 per cent to $39.33 on Friday, to finish the week 5.9 per cent higher.Dell concluded a busy week for corporate earnings that came mostly from the retail sector but included another technology bell-wether Cisco Systems.The world’s largest networking products company reported higher quarterly earnings after the Wednesday close and saw shares gain 1.9 per cent in the following session. Cisco had gained 4.8 per cent for the week.Elsewhere in technology, plans by Yahoo to launch an online music service took a bite out of Apple Computer’s valuation mid-week as investors fretted about increased competitive pressures on Apple’s iTunes service, which accompanies its popular iPod music players.Apple shares declined 2.2 per cent on Wednesday. RealNetworks, also likely to be affected by Yahoo’s plans, saw its shares lose 21.1 per cent. Napster, a name once synonymous with online music, was off 26.8 per cent during the same session. By Friday’s close, Yahoo put on 0.9 per cent for the week as Apple lost 6.6 per cent. RealNetworks lost 24.9 per cent and Napster fell 39.7 per cent.Retailers reporting quarterly results and monthly sales this week included restaurant operators and grocers. Mergers and acquisitions continued to provide a backdrop for trading, even though the traditional perception that M&A activity signals increased confidence about the future of the economy failed to spur broad gains across the board.On Monday, Duke Energy announced it would take over Cinergy in a $9bn all-stock transaction that would create a company with 5.4m retail customers. The news sent shares in Cinergy 5.8 per cent higher for the session as Duke stock declined 1.8 per cent. For the week, Cinergy was 1.7 per cent up as Duke lost 6.1 per cent.The following session saw a merger in the technology sector as two developers of speech recognition technology combined forces. Nuance Communications rose 39 per cent on the news that it would be acquired by ScanSoft, declining 16.8 per cent that session. For the week, Nuance gained 46.6 per cent, while ScanSoft fell 12.8 per cent.The volatile oil price also attracted attention. After a dramatic rise in crude futures earlier in the week kept market gains in check, a tumble on Thursday triggered a decline in energy stocks. ExxonMobil fell 4.3 per cent during the session as Marathon Oil lost 5.1 per cent. For the week, Exxon was down 6.8 per cent, while shares in Marathon gave up 6.2 per cent.
92;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Merger deals lift mood on Wall Street;;A renewed wave of merger deals lifted sentiment for Wall Street stock investors on Monday at the start of a week of corporate releases.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had inched up 0.4 per cent to 10,384.79, while the S&P 500 index put on 0.6 per cent to 1,178.79. The Nasdaq Composite index added 0.6 per cent to 1,979.67.The indices struggled to make headway in the wake of a disappointing response to positive employment data in the previous session.Arthur Cashin, the managing director at UBS, said “the stock market is temporarily dealing with its own health and well being . . . working its way through [key resistance levels]” such as the 200-day moving average for the Dow. Skittishness among investors was apparent in the high ratio between put and call options on the S&P 500 index, said Ken Tower, the chief market analyst at CyberTrader.The number of investors purchasing options to protect themselves against a fall in the index suggested “the widespread expectation that the market can not rally from current levels”, Mr Tower said.However, the recent decline in the market has led to many stocks being oversold, according to Merrill Lynch analysts who said in a research note that: “It appears the correction in the market is completed and we would be accumulating equity positions in our belief that the market will test its previous high and possibly make a new recovery high.”In deal news, Duke Energy announced it would buy Cinergy for about $9bn in stock, creating an energy group with about 5.4m retail customers. Shares in Cinergy rose 4.8 per cent to $42.32, while Duke gave up 1.8 per cent to $28.82.Among financial stocks, E*Trade shares rose 5.8 per cent to $12.62 amid reports it was in merger talks with Ameritrade, a rival online broker. Ameritrade shares jumped 18.7 per cent to $13.42.Research in Motion shares added 3.1 per cent to $70.02 after the maker of popular handheld computers said it had 3m subscribers for its wireless email service.Amid earnings news, King Pharmaceuticals jumped 1.9 per cent to $9.16 after it reported a return to profitability in the latest quarter.Earnings at Alcan, of Canada, more than doubled thanks to higher aluminium prices. Shares eased 1.1 per cent to $33, as Alcoa, its chief rival, edged off 0.1 per cent to $29.35.Dynergy shares gained 12.5 per cent to $4.24 after the company reported a quarterly loss over charges.McDonald’s shares rose 2.5 per cent to $30.12 after the world’s largest fast-food restaurant operator reported a 4.7 per cent rise in sales at stores open at least a year.A brake for stock bulls appeared to come from crude oil futures, which were trading above $51 per barrel as Opec said the cartel was producing near full capacity.
93;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2020-04-24T17:25:23+0000;Duke Energy to buy Cinergy for about $9bn;;"Duke Energy on Monday agreed to buy Cinergy for $9.1bn in stock, a combination of two utilities that dominate the regulated gas and electrical businesses in parts of south-east and midwest US.The deal marks the second large merger since December in the US power industry, where regulatory obstacles and risk aversion among chief executives have prevented consolidation in recent years.Duke, based in North Carolina, will remain the second largest US utility after Exelon, which agreed to buy PSEG of New Jersey for $13bn five months ago. But the purchase of Cinergy will expand Duke's geographic reach into Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky - and increase its size to include $70bn in assets, $36bn in market capitalisation, 5.4m retail customers, $27bn in annual revenues and $1.9bn in annual net income.Duke has for at least one year been on the hunt for a merger partner. In September, Duke discussed a deal with FPL, the Florida utility worth about $15bn in market capitalisation.Those discussions broke down, and in December the company launched exploratory talks with Cinergy.Under the terms of the deal, Cinergy investors will receive 1.56 Duke shares for every Cinergy share.Based on Friday's closing prices, this exchange ratio values Cinergy at $45.80 - or a 13.4 per cent premium.Jim Rogers, Cinergy's chief executive, will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Paul Anderson, chief executive of Duke, becoming chairman of the enlarged Duke.One of Mr Anderson's priorities in finding an acquisition target for Duke was to select a company that could help revive its merchant operations, which, like many of its competitors, had been hit by the post-Enron crisis of confidence.The deal will also better position the enlarged Duke for a separation of its gas and electrical businesses, which it has been considering, according to people familiar with the matter.""This union is a great strategic fit and leaves us well positioned for continued consolidation in the energy sector, as both the electric and gas businesses will have the scale to stand alone,"" Mr Anderson said.The companies expect to produce cost savings of $400m within three years. About 1,500 jobs would be cut through attrition, early retirement and severance programmes, they indicated.Duke shares fell 1.87 per cent in morning trading to $28.81 on Monday. Cinergy shares rose 5.32 per cent to $42.53 - just below the offer price.UBS advised Duke, with Lazard providing a fairness opinion. Cinergy was advised by Merrill Lynch."
94;DUK;Duke Energy Corp;2005-02-22T21:38:38Z;Wall St slides as oil moves back over $50;;Wall Street suffered its biggest single-day decline of the year on Tuesday, after investor jitters over the rising price of oil and a sharp fall in the dollar sparked a sell-off.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 10,611.13, and the S&P 500 lost 1.5 per cent 1,184.22 - the biggest single-day fall for both indices since August last year. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4 per cent to 2,030.32.The fall extended the market’s losses from last week, which saw US stocks retreat from year-highs.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that, in spite of recent dithering, strong corporate profit growth in the fourth quarter and improving expectations for the first quarter meant that stocks were still looking cheap. “Valuations in the market today are no different than they were at the bottom of the market in late 2002 and early 2003,” he said.But Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said continued earnings strength was far from certain. “A lot depends on where interest rates will be six months from now,” he said, adding that the market would remain sensitive to signs of rising inflation.Pharmaceutical companies took a beating following Monday’s news that Novartis, the Swiss drugmaker, had paid $8bn to snap up Germany’s second-biggest generic drugs group. Merck and Pfizer, two of the biggest US drugmakers, fell 4.3 per cent to $31.20 and 0.8 per cent to $26.59, respectively.Big-name pharma groups have come under pressure from generic competition in recent years. That pressure is expected to mount as patents expire on a raft of name-brand drugs.Energy stocks were among the rare gainers on the S&P 500 yesterday as the price of oil climbed following the cold snap that settled across much of the northern US and Europe at the weekend. Valero Energy, the oil refiner, jumped 1.8 per cent to $66.44. ConocoPhillips, the oil and gasoline group, gave back early gains, however, to close down 0.3 per cent at $105.95.Kerr McGee, the oil and gas producer, received an extra boost after Carl Icahn, the billionaire financier, said he was considering investing up to $1bn in the company. Its shares rose 5.3 per cent to $74.20.But Duke Energy and Dynegy slumped after the US Supreme Court hinted that it might consider reviving a lawsuit brought against the companies for alleged price-fixing during the California energy crisis of 2000-01. Duke shares slipped 2.1 per cent to $26.08, while Dynegy shares fell 4.4 per cent to $4.43.Trading in shares of Winn-Dixie, the grocer, was halted after the company declared bankruptcy. The shares plunged more than 50 per cent in pre-market trading. The company posted a widened quarterly loss this month.Home Depot led decliners on the S&P 500. The home improvement chain slipped 4.1 per cent to $40.28 after its quarterly results landed within their expected range.
