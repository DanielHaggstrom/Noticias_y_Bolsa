0;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2019-07-22T12:44:34Z;US jobs growth bypasses railway workers;Once reliable source of blue-collar employment cuts back as wider labour market booms;US employment growth has bypassed the railroad industry, a provider of good wages for blue-collar workers across the country.Headcount at the largest US freight railroads was down 4 per cent on year to 141,000 in June, a lower number than in the financial crisis, government data show. The sum is set to fall further this year as managers streamline operations under pressure from investors.Last week Union Pacific Railroad, the largest listed US railroad, said it intended to cut payrolls by 10 per cent in 2019 as it reported a record second-quarter profit of $1.6bn.At CSX, whose web of tracks lies east of the Mississippi river, employee counts were down 5 per cent on the year in June after a 14 per cent reduction last year. Executives seek another 2.5 per cent reduction between now and 2020.The Norfolk Southern Railway, which reports results this week, has outlined plans to eliminate more than 500 positions this year.The prolonged cuts stand in contrast to robust hiring in the US labour market, where non-farm payrolls rose by 224,000 in June.Railroad jobs are becoming more scarce as managers try to boost profit margins, in some cases to placate activist shareholders. Most operators have in the past two years embraced principles known as “precision scheduled railroading,” which entail rigid timetables, longer trains, thousands of idled locomotives and less labour.Driving trains, maintaining right-of-way and dispatching cars are largely unionised jobs that do not require a university degree. The average employee at a large freight railroad earned $87,100 in wages and $38,300 of fringe benefits in 2017, according to the Association of American Railroads.The slackening rail employment picture has drawn scrutiny from Congress. A House transport subcommittee last month conducted a hearing on the state of the workforce. Lawmakers questioned the consequences of lower staffing.“While worker productivity has never been better and Class 1 railroads have enjoyed multibillion-dollar profits for many years, employment levels are headed in the other direction with thousands of rail employees furloughed,” Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union, told the subcommittee.Precision railroading was evangelised by Hunter Harrison, a renowned manager who introduced it first on Canadian railways. After he was hired in March 2017 from Canadian Pacific Railway to run CSX, he swiftly began transforming the 21,000-mile network.An acolyte continued to execute his vision after Harrison died in December 2017. Last week the Jacksonville, Florida-based company reported an operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — of 57.4 per cent, its best for any second quarter.CSX’s headcount was 21,541 in June, down by almost 10,000 since 2014.“The whole objective [of precision railroading] is to remove all of the unnecessary touches and handling and steps throughout the process of moving freight. And as you remove those steps, it means that you require fewer people to do it,” CSX said.Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — the other big listed US railroads — have since taken precision methods aboard. An S&P index of the four most valuable railroad stocks has risen 56 per cent since Harrison’s arrival at CSX, more than double the increase of the broader US stock market.In its latest quarter, Union Pacific said it had curtailed operations at two rail yards in Illinois and one in Texas and stored 2,150 locomotives.“We’ve taken a lot of work out of the network, and it’s being reflected now on our manpower,” said Lance Fritz, Union Pacific chief executive.One outlier is BNSF, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Headcount has hovered near 42,000 over the past few years at the railroad, which competes with Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern in the central and western US.BNSF’s former executive chairman, Matthew Rose, questioned the merits of precision railroading before he retired this year. Mr Buffett has more recently sounded open to the concept.“If we think we can serve our customers well and get more efficient in the process, we will adopt whatever we observe,” Mr Buffett told the company’s annual meeting in May.In a blow to efforts to preserve jobs, a regulator in May scrapped a proposal to require a minimum number of crew members on each train. Labour unions had sought at least two, but the Federal Railroad Administration found no evidence multiple workers made trains safer.Further, the agency said any requirement would “unnecessarily impede the future of rail innovation and automation.”
1;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2019-04-18T17:26:09Z;Railroad stocks set record highs as price increases boost earnings;;Shares in US railroads are trading near all-time highs after a trio of America’s largest train operators steamrollered earnings forecasts this week, backed by higher shipping rates.Union Pacific, CSX and Kansas City Southern cheered investors with first-quarter results that benefited from price hikes and cost efficiencies, which offset the financial impact of disruptive winter storms and record Midwest flooding that caused billions of dollars in damage in the region.Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific kept the rally train moving on Thursday, revealing net income grew 6 per cent year-over-year to $1.39bn as rate increases helped the company overcome weaker volume. On an adjusted basis, earnings of $1.93 a share topped analysts’ average estimate by four cents, even as revenue of $5.4bn, down from $5.5bn, fell short.The company’s stock surged 4.5 per cent to $176.90 in intraday trade, higher than its previous closing high of $171.33 set on February 19.The Dow Jones US Railroads Index, up 2.6 per cent on Thursday, was also trading at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average — a closely watched index seen as a gauge of the US economy — was tracking toward its highest close in more than 6 months with a gain of 1.7 per cent to 11,007.09.CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, who raised his price targets for all three companies this week, said CSX and Kansas City Southern have improved profitability with a shift to scheduled railroading — when trains depart at a set time as opposed to waiting for a certain number of cars.“CSX’s shift to scheduled railroading has driven declines in headcount, fuel costs and most other cost categories, and these benefits are likely to continue through 2019,” he wrote to clients.Mr Corridore remained concerned about carload declines at Union Pacific, saying it would likely lag behind other railroads on its operating ratio while it rolls out an improvement plan. The company’s operating ratio, a key industry measure of profitability, improved 1 percentage point to 63.6 per cent last quarter. CSX’s operating ratio was a first-quarter record for the group at 59.5 per cent. A lower number indicates stronger profitability.CSX booked revenue growth of 5 per cent in the March quarter on “broad-based pricing gains” and increased shipping volume in merchandise. Its net earnings expanded by 20 per cent.First-quarter revenues at Kansas City Southern rose 6 per cent amid strong gains in chemicals and petroleum shipments, while net earnings, which fell 29 per cent, were knocked by restructuring charges. Excluding one-time costs, adjusted earnings per share rose 18 per cent.Kansas City Southern shares jumped 1.5 per cent to $124.71, about 1 per cent from its closing high and setting a pace to wrap trading at its best level since November 2014. CSX ticked fractionally lower during the session after setting a record high on Wednesday.Not to be left out, Norfolk Southern, which will report first-quarter results next week, rose 1.2 per cent and eyed a fresh record high on its peers’ upbeat views.
2;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2018-10-25T16:30:28Z;US railroads employ ‘precision’ principles to boost profit;Approach pioneered by the late Hunter Harrison is spreading;North American railroad executives facing pressure to boost results are embracing the principles of Hunter Harrison, an industry legend who died in December last year. The sector’s quarterly earnings season, which continued on Thursday with results from Union Pacific, revealed the extent to which Harrison’s “precision scheduled railroading” strategy has spread.Under Harrison’s trademark approach, railroads work to improve profitability by running longer trains, increasing car velocities, using fixed timetables and maximising the use of assets. The veteran executive successfully used the strategy at the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railways before he was recruited last year to run CSX, the largest rail company in the eastern US. His successor, James Foote, has held fast to his vision and CSX doubled net income in the third quarter. CSX’s eastern rival Norfolk Southern disclosed Wednesday it would adopt precision railroading, meaning a majority of large North American freight rail companies has now embraced it. Union Pacific, one of the two biggest western US rail groups, launched its own precision plan on October 1 and said on Thursday that it had already cut 627 locomotives, about 8 per cent of its fleet.“There has been some speculation of what we’re doing as a ‘light version’ of PSR,” Thomas Lischer, Union Pacific’s executive vice-president of operations, told analysts on an earnings call Thursday. “I can assure you that is not the case.”Union Pacific, which has struggled with service problems this year, said it would phase in the changes starting with a route between Wisconsin and Texas.Introducing precision railroading has often upset labour and shippers. As trains run more efficiently, workers are made redundant. At CSX, average headcount fell 8 per cent even as volume rose 4 per cent year on year in the third quarter. In Harrison’s early months at CSX, service disruptions led to a government inquiry as shippers complained that their chemicals, grain and other bulk goods were not delivered. Performance has since bounced back, with train velocity up 28 per cent year on year in the third quarter. Some customers still report problems, said Jay Roman, president of Escalation Consultants, which advises shippers on transport matters. Citing the CSX ordeal, the Surface Transportation Board regulatory body has asked Union Pacific to hold weekly calls with its staff. “We trust that UP will work in a transparent manner to avoid similar disruptions to our nation’s rail system,” STB officials wrote. The strong US economy has been good for rail companies, which have suffered in recent years as coal volumes declined because coal-fired power plants were being retired. North American rail volume in 2018 to date is up 3.4 per cent from last year, according to the Association of American Railroads. But investors have demanded more as the precision approach paid off on the Canadian lines and at CSX. Norfolk Southern’s operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — was 65.4 per cent in the third quarter, well above CSX’s 58.7 per cent. Union Pacific on Thursday reported third-quarter net income of $1.6bn, up 33 per cent on year, but its operating ratio was frozen at 61.7 per cent. “The analysts are asking them: ‘Why aren’t you adopting the same systems as CSX, because they seem to be doing it very successfully?’” said Daniel Sherman, analyst at Edward Jones.James Squires, Norfolk Southern chief executive, said on a conference call that his company would implement precision railroading principles “where they lead to a better result for customers and shareholders.” Its shares rose 2.1 per cent to $160.19 on Wednesday, buoyed by record quarterly earnings of $702m. “Certainly, we are looking to change the way we operate. That's necessary. The network has evolved over the years,” Mr Squires said.CSX shareholders paid Harrison $84m up front to leave his job at Canadian Pacific in a bet that his management skills were one of a kind. Mr Foote worked under Harrison at Canadian National and was familiar with the precision model. “Whether UP and NS can do it without someone like Harrison is an open question,” said Howard Green, the author of Railroader, a biography of Harrison. “Harrison was the passion. He was the bullheaded, relentless, uncompromising preacher. He created disciples, and enemies, wherever he went.”
3;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2017-12-07T04:00:39Z;Going local for supplies sparks new frac sand boom;Market is stretched to full capacity amid US shale oil’s drive to extend output cheaply;Windblown dunes in west Texas are the latest front in the shale oil industry’s campaign to extract more barrels at less cost.The industry is excavating dunes for frac sand, which is pumped into wells to crack open rocks and get oil and gas flowing. The deposits are in demand because they lie close by the hot Permian shale region, making them cheaper than sands carried in from older mines 1,000 miles away.Locally dug sand is influencing the economics of US oil production, helping shale supplies compete in world markets. It is also worrying investors who own shares in railroads that haul sand and in sand miners that may be on the cusp of a glut.Sand was a critical ingredient of the shale drilling revolution. Without it, US oil production would not have nearly doubled in the past decade to an estimated 9.7m barrels per day.Between 2012 and 2014, total US demand for “proppants” such as frac sand rose from 34m to 61.5m short tons, according to Rystad Energy, a consultancy. Then oil prices collapsed, bringing down sand consumption as well.Volumes are again on the upswing as drilling accelerates, oil wells get longer and more sand is used per foot of well. Demand is forecast to surpass 100m short tons next year, Rystad says.“Right now, the market is really stretched thin,” says Thomas Jacob, a senior analyst at IHS Markit, a research company. “Everyone is running at full capacity.”But this sand boom is different than the last. In the first phase of the shale fracking boom, oil producers were notorious for prioritising production growth over investor returns.They sought premium sand supplies far from the oil patch in states such as Wisconsin. Its “northern white sand” was prized for hardness and roundness that made a porous latticework inside underground wells.But given its bulk, it also cost a fortune to ship. Northern white sand has averaged $41 per short ton at the mine gate this year, according to IHS Markit, but can cost $120 at a Texas well head after transport.Cost-cutting among oil companies sparked a search for supplies lying around the Permian, known as brown sand. While finer in grain, it is also cheaper at $75-$80 per short ton at the well head, Mr Jacob says. Distances are short enough to make some deliveries economical by truck.Sand supplier Hi-Crush Partners recently opened a sand mine at Kermit, Texas, with annual capacity of 3m short tons per year. This month, US Silica expects to open a site in Crane county, Texas, that will add about 4m short tons of capacity. A third company, Fairmount Santrol, plans to open a 3m short ton plant in Kermit in 2018.The shifting sand market has unnerved investors in railroads. At Union Pacific, the largest listed railroad company, frac sand accounts for 5 per cent of revenue, according to Bernstein Research.Robert Knight, Union Pacific chief financial officer, told a conference last week that brown sand “may well be trucked to the ultimate location rather than rail”, though sand was only a small portion of his railroad’s traffic.The local sand mines face obstacles to growth. One is the dunes sagebrush lizard, a threatened reptile that lives in the area. Further sand mining threatens to put it on the endangered species list, potentially hobbling oil and gas drilling in the Permian region.Sand also needs to be washed before it is used, which is a challenge in the drylands of west Texas, says Marc Bianchi, analyst at Cowen. The two-lane roads of west Texas may not be able to handle fleets of sand trucks, he adds.The majority of sand is sold on long-term contracts, industry executives say. Rising demand has stirred interest in expanding spot markets where miners, service companies and producers can swap loads and obtain more insight into prices.PanXchange, a Denver-based company, this autumn launched an online frac sand exchange which it says now has nearly two dozen members including Hi-Crush.The existing sand market is “very, very inefficient”, says Laura Fulton, Hi-Crush chief financial officer. “Having all this on a clearinghouse would really provide more transparency and more efficiency in the market, so you would know who has sand available to sell and what price they’re willing to transact at.”The strengthening sand demand shows how oil wells have become more productive, according to Artem Abramov, who heads Rystad’s North America well research — so much so he believes that the “the market should not be surprised next year by an impressive 1.2m b/d of US light oil production growth”.
4;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2017-07-19T17:24:32Z;Coal has no future, says US railroad boss;CSX will not buy locomotives to haul the fuel despite Trump pledge to revive industry;"One of the largest haulers of US coal says fossil fuels have no future, despite pledges to the contrary from President Donald Trump.CSX, a freight railroad company with origins in the bituminous coal seams of Appalachia, will not buy a single new locomotive to pull coal trains, chief executive Hunter Harrison told analysts on Wednesday.“Fossil fuels are dead,” Mr Harrison said. “That’s a long-term view. It’s not going to happen overnight. It’s not going to be in two or three years. But it’s going away, in my view.” His comments come as the White House aims to revive the American coal industry by rescinding environmental regulations and abandoning the Paris climate agreement. Mr Trump surrounded himself with coal miners earlier this year when he signed an executive order he said was “putting an end to the war on coal”. Fossil fuels are dead . . . It’s not going to be in two or three years. But it’s going away, in my viewYet US power generators are building more plants fuelled by cheap natural gas, displacing old coal-fired units. Falling costs for solar and wind energy have also eaten into coal’s market share. North American railroads have reshaped their asset holdings in acknowledgment that coal’s apex has passed.Lance Fritz, chief executive of the Union Pacific railroad, said in a recent interview that Mr Trump’s move to scrap Clean Power Plan regulations was unlikely to grow its coal business. “It takes away a headwind,"" he said.Nearly a fifth, or $530m, of CSX’s $2.9bn of second-quarter revenue came from coal, a 27 per cent rise from the same period a year before. In the second quarter of 2011, CSX coal revenue totalled nearly $1bn.CSX’s rise in coal volumes derived from 8.2m tonnes of exports. Deliveries of coal to US utilities declined year on year to 11m tonnes. Despite long-term trends, Mr Harrison reiterated his support for the business. “The last carload of coal that’s shipped out of this country, I want to be the carrier that ships it,” he said. Mr Harrison, a legendary railroad manager, joined CSX in March after he was recruited from his job running the Canadian Pacific railway by an activist hedge fund, Mantle Ridge. CSX shareholders last month agreed to reimburse him $84m in money he forfeited when he left CP. CSX reported net profit of $510m, or 55 cents per share, in the second quarter, up 15 per cent from $445m, or 47 cents per share, in the same period a year before. But investors drove the company’s shares down 6.1 per cent to $51.31 as they queried how quickly Mr Harrison will deliver on his promises to raise performance. “It is hard to deny that CSX's second-quarter results came in below elevated expectations,” Barclays wrote.Mr Harrison said he was not going to buy locomotives or double-track CSX’s routes to accommodate coal. “Coal is not a long-term issue,” he said."
5;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2016-06-06T17:29:25Z;US economy: capital punishment;Investors in capital-intensive sectors will hope US data are misleading;Last week Brent crude futures closed above $50 for the first time since November. Sighs of relief all round: how bad can the economy be when fuel prices are rising? Then came the lousy US job numbers on Friday: maybe it can be pretty bad, after all. And the jobs data are not the only sign that the commodity bounce does not reflect strong US output.Data from the Association of American Railroads reveal startlingly low demand for carload and container shipments since the beginning of the year. This can be explained, in some part, by producers’ unwillingness to ship coal and petroleum products at the low prices prevailing earlier in the year. Lower raw material costs should provide a boost to manufacturing and building, though. This does not seem to be working. The Federal Reserve reported in April that the year-on-year increase in total dollars spent for building construction and improvement is among the lowest observed since the financial crisis. The Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index is hovering near post-crisis lows, having dipped below 50 (indicating contraction) five times in the past year.The railway sector has already taken its lumps, although stocks such as CSX and Union Pacific have recovered somewhat since the beginning of the year. Not all sectors that should be sensitive to weak industrial activity have suffered, though. The ratio of prices to historic earnings in the capital goods sector has pushed out to 20, compared with a one-year average of 18.The likes of Illinois Tool Works and Stanley Black & Decker, for example — both sought-after, high-quality stocks with attractive dividends and limited commodity exposure — are up nicely over the past year. This looks odd, if US housing and industrial activity is rolling over. And the economic data are at least consistent with such a slowdown.Economies are devilishly hard to predict. Talk of “leading indicators” is misleading in most every case. Some stock prices, however, look like a poor fit with where the economy appears to be right now.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
6;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2016-06-05T17:15:25Z;Biggest US rail operator slams trade politics;Union Pacific chief hits at stance of presidential hopefuls;The biggest US rail operator has criticised presidential candidates’ reluctance to support bilateral trade agreements, as two-way shipments to Mexico provide a rare industry bright spot.Lance Fritz, chief executive of Union Pacific, said that movements to and from Mexico in the first quarter grew 6 per cent for the company, which covers much of America west of the Mississippi River with its network.The traffic now accounts for 12 per cent of all UP’s business. It could be vulnerable to any renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1994, which has encouraged a surge in trade between the US, Canada and Mexico.Many of UP’s other business areas are suffering because of slumping demand to move coal, reduced oil and gas drilling activity and lacklustre global trade growth. Overall traffic declined 8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly called Nafta “a disaster,” vowing to scrap the deal.Mr Fritz joked in response to a question about Mr Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border: “As long as it has portals for rail traffic”.He otherwise declined to comment on specific candidates, saying only that UP wanted a president who cared deeply about the issues that were important to the railroad.None of the remaining potential candidates for the White House — Mr Trump, and the Democratic contenders, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton — currently supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement with Asian countries that is the US’s biggest pending trade deal. Mrs Clinton supported it when secretary of state from 2009 until 2013, however.Mr Fritz rejected suggestions that he was mainly criticising Mr Trump.“I’m concerned I don’t hear any candidate right now talking about free and open trade,” he said. “I’d like to hear one of them speak to and be more positive about Nafta. From 1994 to today, US trade to Mexico is up fourfold and Mexico trade with the US is up even more.”Mr Fritz’s criticism of the candidates comes as UP wrestles with a sharp downturn in traffic that has abruptly ended several years of rapid growth following the 2008-09 Great Recession.Movements of coal, 12 per cent of revenue, were down 34 per cent in the first quarter over the first three months of 2015. Intermodal traffic, as movement of shipping containers and truck trailers is known, was down 3 per cent in the first quarter. Mr Fritz said that this had worsened since the first-quarter report.
7;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2016-02-11T22:16:25Z;Maersk’s stumble highlights sluggish state of global trade;Several freight markets look weak, including air and dry bulk ships;When AP Møller-Maersk warned this week that the Danish conglomerate was enduring business conditions in container shipping markedly worse than during the 2008 financial crisis, it appeared to fit into a wider pattern.Maersk is the world’s largest container shipping company, and it is the latest in a series of companies to have made gloomy announcements in recent weeks about economic conditions, including the weak state of global trade. Maersk said on Wednesday that it earned “significantly lower” prices for moving containers during 2015 than 2014, and the group reported a $2.5bn net loss for the fourth quarter of last year.US railroads including Union Pacific, the largest, have also recorded big falls in profits for the fourth quarter. Companies that ship dry bulk commodities are in precarious financial positions after rates to charter vessels fell to the lowest levels since the Baltic Dry Index was set up in 1985 to track such data.One key question now is how far the sharp falls in prices for moving goods are a leading indicator of further demand problems in a global economy shaken by China’s deepening slowdown.The general picture of gloom is countered by conditions in oil tanker markets. Here, despite some recent falls in rates, owners can still generate profits by charging $50,000 a day for a very large crude carrier.It is also noteworthy that Maersk forecasts growth in world container trade of 1 to 3 per cent in 2016, not a downturn in traffic. The air freight market — often quick to slow down in a downturn — is experiencing modest growth. US railroads, while losing traffic in many areas, are benefiting from the booming domestic car market.Erik Stavseth, analyst at Oslo-based Arctic Securities, says demand to move freight in many markets appears to be slackening. But he says that in most shipping markets the problem is that owners were too optimistic about future growth levels and over-invested in new vessels.Mr Stavseth points to the oil tanker market as one of several cases in the global economy that illustrate the delicate balance between supply and demand.While the low oil price has stimulated demand for crude and hence the need to move it, the biggest factor in the tanker sector’s positive performance is that the market is short of ships.“That tanker rates are strong doesn’t really underline that the economy is great,” says Mr Stavseth. “It just underlines that the supply-demand balance is positive.”There is little doubt that conditions in the market to move dry bulk commodities are catastrophic. Average short-term rates to charter Capesize carriers — the largest kind — were at $2,756 per day on Thursday, well below their roughly $8,000 operating cost.Paul Slater, a shipping finance expert based in Florida, says China’s demand for commodities has waned not only because of its economic slowdown but also because of changes in the country’s buying practices. The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has brought order to once chaotic commodity-buying practices, greatly reducing China’s stockpile.But overall demand is flat rather than declining and few industry observers believe a surge could revive the dry bulk ship market, which has been swamped by vessel deliveries that expected to increase the world fleet by 4 per cent this year.“There’s really an extreme oversupply of vessels, built on the premise that China doesn’t slow down,” says Mr Stavseth.Most industry observers believe container shipping lines’ problems reflect world economic conditions more closely than trends in other transport segments. Container shipping lines such as Maersk and Hong Kong’s Orient Overseas International, parent of Orient Overseas Container Line, carry manufactured and semi-finished goods. They are consequently far more exposed to worldwide consumer demand.Container throughput at the Port of Singapore, the world’s second-busiest container port after Shanghai, was down 8.7 per cent in 2015 on the record 33.9m 20-foot equivalent units handled in 2014. Maersk said container demand grew by 0 to 1 per cent in 2015.But, even in this market, the problem has been least as much shipping lines’ over-optimism in forecasting future demand and buying big new ships as it is underlying weakness in demand.Drewry, the London-based shipping consultants, calculate that shipping lines earned an average $2,063 per 40-foot container in 2014, but that the figure fell to $1,570 in 2015, and is down to $1,548 so far this year.No sector illustrates the complexities of the demand swings currently sweeping freight markets as well as the US’s railroad industry.According to the Association of American Railroads, the number of carloads moved in the first five weeks of 2016 fell 15.7 per cent on the same period last year. Movements of containers and truck trailers — together known as intermodal traffic, which is counted separately — were 4.8 per cent up.The carload figures were dominated by a 30 per cent decline in coal traffic. This is a reflection of falling worldwide demand for the US’s high-quality metallurgical coal and power companies’ growing preference for gas for generating electricity.The low oil price, meanwhile, helped to depress once-buoyant movements of oil and refined products.The increase in intermodal shipments looks positive. But that trend reflects mainly the end of last year’s go-slow at US west coast ports, which held up many container movements.While global economic weakness has sent earnings tumbling at operators of dry bulk vessels, and also put container shipping companies’ profits under pressure, a very different set of factors has played out in the market for moving crude oil.The crude price collapse since mid-2014 has increased demand to move oil, while shipowners, who suffered a prolonged period of weakness in 2012 and 2013, did not place the excess orders that dry bulk shipowners and container shipping lines did.Tanker owners have also benefited from changes in the oil market following the crude price rout. More of the world’s oil supplies are now coming from low-cost producing areas led by the Gulf, and this makes tanker voyages longer, and therefore soaks up more capacity.But there are some signs of weakness in the tanker market. For example, shipowners face a sudden surge of competition with the return to the market of Iran’s oil tankers, following the lifting of international sanctions.Air freight is particularly vulnerable in economic downturns. When demand softens, shippers tend to move freight from expensive aircraft to far cheaper container ships.Data from the International Air Transport Association, the airlines’ representative body, suggest such a process might be under way. They show a gap opening up between world trade growth and the more sluggish expansion of the air cargo sector.Trade nevertheless continues to grow, albeit very modestly. Traffic in December 2015 was 0.8 per cent up on the same month in 2014.Conditions for air cargo operators, however, have deteriorated sharply. Record deliveries of large passenger jets with substantial cargo holds meant that capacity to move air freight was 6.5 per cent up year-on-year in December. Only 43.9 per cent of available capacity was used.These difficult conditions were the backdrop to Boeing’s decision last month to slow production of its 747 jumbo jet, which sells mainly to cargo operators.
8;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Norfolk Southern to cut jobs, routes and locomotives;Drop in coal demand hits rail operator stalked by Canadian Pacific;Norfolk Southern, the US railroad being stalked by Canadian Pacific, on Wednesday outlined plans to cut staff, close routes and mothball locomotives amid a series of measures aimed at cutting annual costs by $650m by 2020.The company revealed the plans after publishing fourth-quarter figures showing net income down 29 per cent year on year to $361m, following a 20 per cent slump in coal revenues. Demand for high-quality metallurgical coal from the Appalachians — which makes up a high proportion of NS’s coal business — has been badly hit in particular by the worldwide fall in steelmaking.Announcement of the plan boosted NS’s shares 1.4 per cent in New York to $69.89.The savings plans elaborate on the company’s announcement on December 4 that it intended to make significant savings to cope with the challenges posed by sharp traffic declines across a range of commodities. The company has stepped up its efforts to cut costs since CP in November proposed a merger between the two companies designed to cut overheads and improve the two companies’ operations.NS has rejected the overtures from CP — whose biggest shareholder is Bill Ackman, the activist investor — by saying that regulators would bar a tie-up.Jim Squires, chief executive, said the company’s senior executives had already taken “significant steps” to improve financial and operational performance.“While Norfolk Southern’s fourth-quarter results do not yet reflect the initiatives under way, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate growth and enhance value for shareholders,” he said.The company said it planned to reduce its staff — currently 30,000 — by 2,000 by 2020. It also planned to dispose of or downgrade 1,500 miles of secondary routes — including 1,000 miles this year — by the end of the decade. Some of the lines may be hived off to “shortline” operators— smaller rail companies that face less onerous operating standards than big Class I railroads like NS.The company said it would reduce its active locomotive fleet by 300 this year and another 100 by 2020. It will replace the oldest, least efficient locomotives and step up a programme of fitting more modern, efficient traction motors.NS’s revenue decline follows the announcement last week by Union Pacific, operator of the US’s biggest rail network, that its fourth-quarter net income had fallen 22 per cent following a 31 per cent fall in coal revenue.NS’s coal revenue for the quarter fell to $433m against $543m in the fourth quarter of 2014, while general merchandise revenue fell 9 per cent to $1.52bn. Revenue from intermodal traffic — shipping containers and truck trailers — fell 13 per cent to $563m. Overall revenues fell 12 per cent to $2.52bn.The coal declines were particularly sharp in the domestic metallurgical coal market, where sharp falls in US steel production sent traffic down 14 per cent year on year in the quarter.

Sales slid 4.6 per cent to $566.2m. Analysts had forecast earnings of 49 cents a share, on sales of $554.6m.Alongside its results, Xilinx also indicated a change in control provision — which allows for some protections for employees in the event of a change in ownership — for its key executives, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.“We believe the change in control provision significantly raises the probability of Xilinx being acquired by another company,” said Ambrish Srivastava, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “The last time we saw such a provision in our coverage was by Xilinx’s rival Altera, which ended up getting acquired by Intel, for a significant premium.”He noted that Qualcomm and Tsinghua Holdings could be potential acquirers but that Qualcomm would be the more likely buyer and that such a deal could help it diversify away from handsets.The semiconductor industry has seen a wave of consolidation as companies try to boost growth and cut costs in the wake of weaker PC demand and increasing competition.Xilinx was upgraded to “outperform” from “market perform” by BMO Capital which raised the price target on the stock to $57 from $44. Xilinx shares advanced 9 per cent last year.Union Pacific fell 3.55 per cent to $71.00, after the railroad operator reported fourth-quarter results that missed analysts forecasts amid weakening freight demand.Net income fell to $1.1bn or $1.31 a share, compared with $1.4bn or $1.61 a share in the year ago period. Sales fell 15 per cent to $5.2bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of $1.43 a share, on sales of $5.4bn.Shares in FireEye, which sells cyber security products, climbed after the company said it would pay $200m in cash to acquire iSight Partners. “This acquisition extends FireEye’s intelligence lead with an offering no one else in the industry can match,” chief executive David DeWalt said. By the close its shares were off 0.54 per cent at $14.79.A rally in crude prices sent the S&P 500 energy index 2.8 per cent higher.Kinder Morgan shares jumped 15.57 per cent to $13.88, even as the company said it had swung to a loss in the fourth quarter.Shares in Southwestern Energy jumped 19.24 per cent to $8.80, while Transocean shares climbed 7.05 per cent to $9.72.The rally in energy stocks helped US markets rebound on Thursday, following a tumultuous session the previous day, although they lost some of their gains in later trading.The S&P 500 was up 0.52 per cent to 1,868.99, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.74 per cent higher to 15,882.68.

10;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2016-01-21T17:32:33Z;Train groups derailed by commodities slump;Shares in Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific tumble as quarterly net income drops;Two of North America’s biggest rail companies confirmed the gloomy prospects for the sector on Thursday when they reported fourth-quarter results that sent their shares tumbling.Shares in Union Pacific, operator of the US’s largest rail network, fell 5 per cent to $69.92 after its fourth-quarter net income fell 22 per cent to $1.11bn and operating revenues dropped 15 per cent. Canadian Pacific — one of Canada’s two big railways — fell 3 per cent in New York to $101.01 after its fourth-quarter net income dropped 7.1 per cent to C$319m on revenue down 4.1 per cent.The results reflected significant falls in movements of a wide range of commodities, particularly coal and crude oil. UP’s coal revenue tumbled 31 per cent against the same quarter last year, to $745m. CP’s revenue from moving crude oil fell 19 per cent to C$105m.Lance Fritz, UP chief executive, said the past year had been “difficult”.“Economic conditions, uncertainty in the energy markets, commodity prices, and the strength of the US dollar will continue to have a major impact on our business this year,” he said.Hunter Harrison, CP chief executive, said the company had matched its record low operating ratio — the proportion of revenue eaten up by costs — of 59.8 per cent. “While the North American economy braces itself for more headwinds, we remain optimistic about the future,” he said.Both companies are suffering from the rapid reversal of trends that a little over a year ago were leading rail executives to warn of looming gridlock on US rail networks. Operators were struggling to cope with a mix of booming crude oil movements, bumper grain harvests and strong demand for coal, the biggest commodity for many operators.The sharp fall in the oil price has made natural gas far more attractive than coal for producing electricity, while China’s economic weakness has slashed demand for high-quality metallurgical coal. Movements of grain and other agricultural products have also fallen sharply — UP’s agricultural revenue was down 12 per cent to $895m.Eric Butler, UP’s head of sales and marketing, said nearly all commodity types faced a difficult year but promised to cut costs and seek new business to bolster results.“With our growth dependent on both the national and global economy, we will continue to strengthen our customer value proposition and develop new business opportunities across our diverse franchise,” he said.The results come as CP pursues a merger with Norfolk Southern, the number two rail operator in the eastern US. CP has demanded the US justice department act over Mr Fritz’s comment that UP would do everything in its power to stop mergers among the seven Class I rail companies that dominate the sector in the US and Canada.Mr Fritz said on Thursday that UP opposed mergers and it was “paying close attention to the situation”.
11;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-12-16T17:22:31Z;Ackman pressures Norfolk Southern board on CP rail deal;Activist investor says railroad industry is warming to consolidation;"Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has laid out plans to put further pressure on Norfolk Southern to consider a merger with Canadian Pacific, as CP announced the latest adjustment to its offer for the US’s fourth-biggest railroad.Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square fund is CP’s biggest shareholder, was speaking in a conference call where he portrayed the US and Canadian rail industry as warming to his plans for a new, highly controversial round of consolidation.However, he said that if NS continued to reject CP’s offer, shareholders’ first chance to force the company to consider CP’s offer would come at its annual meeting, due in May. He suggested shareholders could either pass a motion demanding the board consider CP’s offer or propose alternative directors.“I think the annual meeting is the most likely timeframe — and the simplest one — for getting a transaction done,” Mr Ackman said.CP is offering a mix of cash and shares for NS that the target company values at $91.62 per share, valuing the company’s equity at $27.3bn. CP contends that the offer is worth between $125 and $140 a share.NS said it would “carefully consider” the revised offer, which, in addition to terms announced last week — $32.86 cash per share and 0.451 of a share in the new, merged company — would offer shareholders a “contingent value right” in the new company. The CVR would offer shareholders up to $25 a share if the new company’s shares are below $175 a share in October 2017. CP projects that the shares will be worth between $204 and $237 each, depending on whether the deal wins regulatory approval.NS said that, other than the CVR, the deal changed nothing compared with the previous offer that NS’s board unanimously rejected.NS’s shares had fallen 1.8 per cent to $89.39 by lunchtime in New York. CP’s shares rose 0.4 per cent in New York to $125.56.NS has consistently dismissed the idea of further consolidation among the seven Class I railroads in the US and Canada, saying it would be impossible to gain approval from the US’s Surface Transportation Board. A series of mergers in the 1990s left just Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe in the western US; Norfolk Southern and CSX in the eastern US; CP and Canadian National in Canada; and Kansas City Southern operating north to south.Mr Ackman portrayed the transaction as having two parts. CP would first take management control of NS, as early as May next year, and put Hunter Harrison, CP’s chief executive, in charge of improving NS operations. The second stage — after at least 18 months of working for regulatory approval — would involve merging the companies’ operations.Mr Ackman suggested other railroads were also warming to the idea of new mergers. He said CSX, which CP approached last year, had put itself up for sale. CSX denied having done so. He also suggested that BNSF was considering participating in mergers, although the company — like Union Pacific — has stressed it opposes new mergers."
12;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-11-17T23:24:36Z;Norfolk Southern criticises ‘highly conditional’ bid from CP;US railroad says offer values it about $28.3bn, less than 10 per cent premium to trading price;Norfolk Southern on Tuesday criticised an “unsolicited, low-premium, non-binding and highly conditional” potential bid from Canadian Pacific that would value the US’s fourth-biggest railroad network at around $28.3bn.But the US railroad said it would “carefully evaluate and consider” the bid from Canada’s number two railroad, aimed at creating the first railroad able to operate all the way across the US and Canada from the Pacific to the Atlantic.NS was reacting to CP’s confirmation hours earlier that it had formally written to NS to express interest in a merger. CP had said in its statement — which followed speculation on November 9 that it was considering a bid — that its offer would offer “a sizeable premium in cash and stock for NS shareholders”. CP had not disclosed the precise price it was offering.NS said CP was offering $46.72 in cash and 0.348 CP shares for every NS share. At Tuesday’s $135.58 closing price for CP in New York, the deal would offer a combined $94.94 per share, valuing the whole company at $28.3bn. NS’s shares closed at $86.97 on Tuesday in New York. They initially surged more than 6 per cent in after-market trading on CP’s confirmation of its approach. But they later pared those gains on news of the exact proposed terms and were 3.4 per cent up at $89.90 at 7pm.NS said the price offered a premium of less than 10 per cent to Tuesday’s share price — although the shares stood at only $79.90 before news of a possible approach first emerged.NS said it would consider the approach in the context of NS’s “strategic plans, and its ongoing review of opportunities to enhance stockholder value through strategic, financial and operational measures and pursue the best interests of the company and its stockholders.”CP had said in its statement that it would offer other railroads access to its network if its service levels declined or prices rose following a merger. The provision is designed to short circuit expected opposition from regulators and customers to a merger, which would be the first between the big Class I railroads in the US and Canada since 1999.NS nevertheless expressed doubt about the potential for winning approval. The industry’s current structure— with CSX and NS in the eastern US, Union Pacific and BNSF in the west, CP and Canadian National in Canada and Kansas City Southern operating north-south — is widely regarded as highly consolidated.“Any consolidation among Class I railroads in North America would face significant regulatory hurdles,” NS said.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad expert, said CP’s access suggestion was a surprise.“It has been expected that this would be the response by regulators [to a merger proposal],” Mr Hatch said of the proposal to open up the network. “It is, I will have to admit, a surprising tactic to put it out there at first.”An opening up of the combined company’s network to competitors could help to counter objections from shipper groups that customer service at CP under Hunter Harrison, chief executive since 2012, has worsened. Mr Harrison — one of the industry’s most admired executives, a former chief executive of Canadian National — has vastly improved the network’s efficiency but irritated some shipper groups who thought their needs had been neglected.The NS bid is CP’s second for another North American railroad under Mr Harrison. The company last October approached CSX but was rebuffed..
13;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:00:27+0000;Sun Valley’s chairlift to the stars;The first destination ski resort in the US has rediscovered its 1930s allure;"The 1932 Winter Olympics, only the third cold-weather version of the Games, were held at New York’s Lake Placid. The spectacle was a crowd-pleasing success, igniting interest in winter sports among an inexperienced American audience. At the time, American skiing was still a sport of walking uphill to slide down, and the United States did not even get its first motorised lift — an improvised rope tow made with the engine from a Ford Model A on a Vermont hillside — until 1934. The notion of a dedicated “ski holiday” was limited to the few wealthy enough to travel to the Alps.One of those was life-long ski enthusiast W Averell Harriman (later New York’s governor), who became determined in the years following the Olympics to create the very first destination ski resort in the US, based on what he had seen at Swiss resorts such as Davos and St Moritz. Harriman was driven not just by his love of skiing but also by self-interest — as chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, he hoped a resort would boost ticket sales on the railway, a business model that had already worked for Canadian Pacific with their grand hotels at Banff Springs and the Château Lake Louise. He hired a charismatic Austrian skier, Count Felix Schaffgotsch, to scour the American west for a site for his train-served ski resort. The count rode Union Pacific trains for months across California, Colorado, Nevada, Wyoming, and Utah, rejecting every location until in early 1936, he arrived in Ketchum, Idaho, the end of a branch line, and wired his boss with the good news: he had found the perfect spot.Work on the Lodge, a centrepiece hotel just outside the town, began within weeks, and America’s first ski resort opened that winter. This coming ski season brings the 80th anniversary of the resort’s foundation, and in the run up to the occasion it has invested heavily in trying to recapture its early success and glory days. Harriman was a natural promoter: even the name Sun Valley was intentionally chosen by a public relations expert to dispel any negative association with cold or discomfort, and he invited numerous celebrities to lend star appeal to his new resort. Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Lucille Ball and Marilyn Monroe all visited; Ernest Hemingway wrote parts of his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls in his suite at the Lodge. The resort made skiing synonymous with glamour in the US, went on to spawn countless Olympians and even gave rise to the industry of ski films, mainly through the efforts of local ski bum Warren Miller, who would become the king of his self-made genre. But of all the many firsts the resort is associated with, one changed skiing more than any other: the chairlift.Harriman wanted to elevate his resort above its European peers, all of which relied on surface lifts such as rope tows and T-bars. But Harriman’s customers sat comfortably on his trains and they would sit on their way up his mountain, thanks to the efforts of Union Pacific railway engineers, who built and installed the world’s first two chairlifts for the opening of Sun Valley. A third was added the following season.In the following decades, Sun Valley expanded greatly. Today there are 18 lifts serving 121 pistes, plus a full Nordic centre, superpipe and three terrain parks. But while it has retained a devoted following from the entertainment world (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey have all visited), Sun Valley’s lustre has faded with the skiing public.Besides a gondola added in 2009, there have been few big improvements in the past decade — a time of massive expansion, innovation and consolidation in the rest of the American ski resort industry. Built on the concept of luxury but stuck in a faux Alpine time warp, Sun Valley lost caché to glitzier ski spots such as Aspen, Deer Valley and Beaver Creek, full of modern five-star hotels. Twenty years ago, operators such as Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Aman, Waldorf Astoria and St Regis were not in the ski business: today they all are, but not in Sun Valley.To make the resort competitive again, the owners have added another 50 acres of glade-skiing on Bald Mountain, but more importantly, they have completely renovated the flagship Sun Valley Lodge, the haunt of Hemingway, which has been here since the beginning. The Lodge reopened this summer after nine months of work, with the number of rooms cut from 148 to 94. Also added is a 20,000 sq ft spa with fitness centre, beauty salon and yoga studio, a new après-ski lounge and a large patio deck beside the outdoor pool.The resort’s reputation already seems to be on the rise. An annual readers’ poll carried out by Ski Magazine elevated Sun Valley to the number-one resort in the western US for 2016, and also gave it first place in several categories including character and, appropriately, lifts. After eight historic decades of skiing, Harriman’s invention continues to shine brightly in the Idaho wilderness.Larry Olmsted was a guest of Sun Valley; see sunvalley.com=Photographs: Keystone/Getty Images; Alfred Eisenstaedt"
14;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-09-14T16:33:57Z;US rail: off track;A mismatch between depreciation and capex mean the railroads are not in value territory yet;The US has, arguably, the healthiest large economy in the world. Railroads are a crucial part of its circulatory system. Yet shares in the biggest rail companies — Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Kansas City Southern — are down by about a quarter so far this year. Relative to expected earnings, the shares are the cheapest they have been in two years. Surely, then, the value train is pulling into the station?No. The problem is an industry-wide gap between depreciation (the item on the income statement reflecting consumption of fixed capital) and capital expenditure (the cash the companies spend on fixed capital). When depreciation is less than capex, cash generation lags behind reported earnings (because capex is a cash expense and depreciation is not). For the railroads, the gap is longstanding but has widened notably over the past decade. This makes a certain amount of sense, given the industry’s solid growth: capex rises first when companies expand. But in general, depreciation and capex should converge as growth normalises.And growth is normalising, to put it kindly. Coal shipments have fallen badly, agricultural volumes are soft and a strong dollar does not help shipments to the country’s ports and borders. Sales at the big four are expected to fall this year, earnings will be flat to down. The market took lagging cash in its stride while the industry was expanding. But as growth investors and momentum-chasers look elsewhere, and value investors start assessing the stocks, the question is going to be asked: when is capex going to come down? Because at 30 or more times free cash flow, value investors are not going to consider these stocks cheap. And, with the exception of Kansas City Southern, capex has risen in the first half of this year.Last year, all four companies spent more on dividends and share buybacks than they generated in free cash. So they are adding leverage, too. Their debt loads are not too heavy but adding debt to please investors can only go on for so long. Increasing cash flow then becomes even more crucial.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
15;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-07-23T16:02:41Z;Coal slump weighs on Union Pacific;Revenues drop 10 per cent as natural gas trumps coal;Union Pacific, the US’s largest rail network, on Thursday became the latest rail company to reveal the impact of sharp declines in coal traffic when it announced net income fell 7 per cent to $1.2bn after a 31 per cent drop in coal revenue.The fall in coal revenues compared with last year’s second quarter, to $679m, helped to push group revenue down 10 per cent to $5.43bn.The decline reflected the falling price of natural gas, which has pushed out coal as a fuel for generating electricity, weak demand for export coal and weather disruptions that closed some tracks. The volume of coal carried fell 26 per cent, pushing overall volumes down 6 per cent.Shares in the company fell 5.7 per cent by close of trading in New York at $92.12.The reversal in coal has ended a period when the US’s big railroads were scrambling to add capacity to cope with strong growth in movements of oil, agricultural products and shipping containers to head off growing congestion on their networks. On July 14, CSX, the main railroad in the eastern US, reported an 11 per cent second-quarter fall in coal revenues and a 15 per cent decline in traffic.UP, which operates in the western two-thirds of the US, suffered particularly heavily because its main coal traffic is low-quality coal from the Powder River Basin, which is used mainly for electricity generation. Much of the coal traffic for CSX and Norfolk Southern, which operate east of the Mississippi, is high-quality metallurgical coal used in steel production.Lance Fritz, UP chief executive, said that gains from price increases in the quarter had not been enough to overcome a “significant decrease” in demand.Industrial products — where revenue fell 14 per cent to $970m — and agricultural products — where revenue fell 7 per cent to $867m — also produced what Mr Fritz called “significant volume decreases”. Earnings per share fell 3.5 per cent to $1.38.However, he added that the company had made “meaningful progress” in “right sizing” its resources to the current volumes.Many of the challenges facing UP reflect the reversal in the high oil price, which significantly benefited railroads in recent years. The companies benefited not only from a boom in movements of domestically produced crude oil and supplies for new oil and gas wells, but also from strong movements of coal encouraged by the high price of natural gas.Intermodal traffic — shipping containers and truck trailers — benefited from pressure on companies to convert truck movements to rail to exploit rail’s greater fuel-efficiency.UP’s crude oil traffic for the quarter declined 29 per cent to 25,200 carloads. Intermodal volume was down 5 per cent to $1.09bn, despite a 2 per cent increase in volumes. International intermodal traffic — containers going to and from ports — grew only 1 per cent as US west coast ports continued to grapple with the effects of a months-long labour dispute. Domestic intermodal grew 3 per cent.Mr Fritz said the volume outlook remained “uncertain” but the company was “laser focused” on operating safely and efficiently.“We will continue to reduce costs and improve productivity as we further align resources with demand,” he said.
16;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-05-31T15:55:03Z;Union Pacific chief threatens action on oil train brake rules;Surge in traffic exposes shortcomings in existing safety regulations;The chief executive of Union Pacific, the US’s largest rail network, has vowed legal action over a provision of new rules for oil trains that he says would cost billions of dollars and provide little benefit.The pledge from Lance Fritz threatens further delay to rules that have already been years in preparation.The Federal Railroad Administration and Canadian regulators jointly announced the rules less than a month ago to improve the safety of oil movements by rail, which have risen sharply following the surge in US oil and gas production in recent years.The surge — from only about 1m tonnes of traffic in 2007 to roughly 40m in 2013, the last year for which full data are available — has exposed the shortcomings of existing safety rules for tank cars, with several trains exploding following derailments.While Mr Fritz said that most of the new provisions were “great regulation”, he criticised provisions demanding that railways start controlling tank cars’ brakes via an electric signal either transmitted wirelessly from the lead locomotive or via electrical wires running along the train.The new arrangement, known as electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) braking, is intended to speed up the transmission of the braking command compared with current methods, which rely on pressure changes in a pipe running along the train. That should reduce the number of cars that derail in a crash.Mr Fritz said, however, that virtually the same improvements could be gained by spacing locomotives out along a train, as Union Pacific frequently does, and the extra benefits of ECP did not justify the costs. The new equipment would cost about $75,000 for each of UP’s 6,500 locomotives, while there would also be substantial costs for fitting out tank cars, nearly all owned by oil shippers or leasing companies.“The juice isn’t worth the press,” Mr Fritz said. “We think that’s very ill-considered. We provided that feedback and we will continue to provide that feedback.”The industry could appeal against the rule both through administrative channels and in the courts, Mr Fritz said. “We as an industry are taking that path,” he added.Railways have been pressing for improvements in tank car design to avoid a repetition of disasters like the Lac-Mégantic explosion in Canada in 2013, in which 47 people died when a poorly secured oil train broke lose, derailed and exploded in the centre of a small town.Operators are barred from refusing to carry cargo that meets the minimum regulatory requirements but have been concerned that under existing regulations cars were excessively vulnerable in an explosion.Mr Fritz also criticised the new rules’ standards for thermal protection for cars, meant to prevent their exploding in a fire, saying they were not strict enough.The Federal Railroad Administration declined to comment publicly on Mr Fritz’s criticisms but looks determined to press ahead with the mandate for ECP brakes.UP, which has a larger track network than any other US railway, has been a significant beneficiary of the surge in oil movements. Mr Fritz said he expected a strong continuing role for rail in transporting US-produced crude oil.The sharp fall in the oil price in recent months has shifted traffic away from the routes that UP serves, however, pushing down crude oil movements on its network by 38 per cent in the first quarter compared with last year.
17;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-05-15T22:59:00Z;FBI probe damage to Amtrak crash train;Investigators examine whether cab was struck by an object before leaving rails;Federal investigators looking into the US’s worst train crash in more than five years have called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine whether the train involved was struck by a missile before crashing.A missile strike could explain why the driver of the Washington to New York train failed to slow as required for a bend in northern Philadelphia. The train, operated by government-owned Amtrak, entered the curve at 106mph — more than twice the 50mph speed limit— and derailed, killing eight of the 243 people on board.Robert Sumwalt, a board member at the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, revealed the developments in the investigation at a media briefing on Friday afternoon.Mr Sumwalt said an assistant conductor in the Amtrak train’s café car heard the train’s driver communicating with the driver of another train, operated by the South Eastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa). The Septa train’s driver reported having been shot at or struck by an object. The assistant conductor subsequently heard her own train’s driver mention that his cab was also being struck.The NTSB had asked the FBI for technical advice on examining a portion of the Amtrak locomotive’s windscreen that showed evidence of damage, Mr Sumwalt said. Video footage from the Septa train was also being examined.If it turns out that the Amtrak driver was distracted by an attack on the train, it could further underline the arguments that have emerged since the crash for quick installation of modern signalling that would take over when drivers forget to brake as required. Amtrak has gradually installed a modern safety system — known as Positive Train Control — along much of the Washington to Boston northeast corridor. But the section including Philadelphia — between Wilmington, Delaware, and Trenton, New Jersey — is due to be completed only later this year.Mr Sumwalt told reporters that the train’s driver, identified in the media as Brandon Bostian, recalled nothing of the train’s journey after it passed North Philadelphia station, short of the crash site. He had nevertheless given a one-and-a-half hour interview to investigators.102mphSpeed at which the train was travelling before the crashInvestigators know from the train’s data recorders, which they have been examining since Wednesday morning, that the train accelerated rapidly after a stop at Philadelphia’s main 30th St station and that the driver applied an emergency brake only three seconds before the train left the rails. The emergency brake slowed the train only from 106mph to 102mph before the crash, which threw the locomotive and all seven carriages off the tracks.Congress obliged train operators to install PTC-type signalling systems on their riskiest routes after a suburban train driver passed a red signal at Chatsworth, in Los Angeles, in 2008 while distracted by his mobile phone. The subsequent head-on crash with a Union Pacific freight train killed 25 people.Tuesday’s crash is the second fatal train crash in the US in just over 18 months because of excess speed. In December 2013, a driver suffering from sleep apnoea rounded a 30mph curve at Spuyten Duyvil, in New York City, at 82mph, derailing the train and killing four passengers.The Amtrak crash is the US’s worst since a collision on the Washington Metro in June 2009 killed nine people.
18;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;Union Pacific growth held back by weaker coal and oil traffic;Rail operator hit by labour disruption at ports on US West Coast;The months-long disruption in US West Coast ports and falling traffic in coal and crude oil held back first-quarter profit growth at Union Pacific, operator of the US’s biggest rail network.The figures initially sent shares in the company, which operates in the two-thirds of the US west of the Mississippi, down 3 per cent in New York. By the close they were down 2.11 per cent at $108.39.Lance Fritz, chief executive, said that 9 per cent growth in earnings per share to $1.30 had been offset by a “sharp drop in volume”.Overall traffic declined 2 per cent. Coal, which suffered from mild winter weather in the western US, low natural gas prices and weak export demand, was down 7 per cent by volume and 5 per cent in revenue.Intermodal — shipping containers and truck trailers — fell 3 per cent by volume and 5 per cent by revenue. Domestic movements within the US grew 9 per cent but international volumes heading to and from ports fell 12 per cent because of severe disruption at ports hit by a labour dispute.Chemicals traffic was down 1 per cent by volume but the figure concealed a 38 per cent decline in movements of crude oil after sharp oil price declines made expensively produced US crude oil less attractive.“While we took actions during the quarter to adjust for the volume decline, we did not run an efficient operation,” Mr Fritz said.The company’s operating ratio, the proportion of revenue eaten up by expenses, shrank from 67.1 per cent in last year’s first quarter to 64.8 per cent. But the company attributed the improvement mainly to above-inflation price increases and the beneficial effects of a 38 per cent decline in the company’s average fuel price. The network had still suffered from “operational inefficiencies” as declining volumes left assets such as locomotives underused.UP is the second big US railway to announce disappointing figures for the first quarter. On April 13, Norfolk Southern, one of two big railways in the eastern US, warned that its first-quarter earnings per share — due to be announced next week — would be 15 per cent down on the same period last year. Norfolk Southern depends heavily on moving coal from the Appalachian coalfields.38%Decline in movements of crude oil at Union PacificRailways had until last year been among the biggest corporate beneficiaries of the US’s economic recovery. Movements of automotive products — which were up 7 per cent by volume year-on-year in the first quarter for UP — and agricultural goods — which were up 3 per cent — remain strong.However, the railways are heavily dependent on coal and intermodal traffic and had been growing fast in crude oil. Many of the railroads — particularly Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-biggest, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — have had to invest heavily to relieve congestion.UP’s net income rose 6 per cent to $1.15bn, on revenue down 0.4 per cent to $5.61bn.
19;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-03-26T19:04:46Z;Dow Transports puts shadow on US equities;Barometer of economy and overall sentiment lags broader market;Investors are shunning US transport stocks and this barometer of the economy and overall equity sentiment on Thursday continued lagging the broad market.Investors have turned cold on transport equities since the start of the year, discouraged by weakening economic reports that have forced economists to downgrade their forecasts for the world’s biggest economy.The shift by investors accompanies spotty performance for some of the sector’s biggest companies after bumper returns in 2013 and 2014. Shares of UPS, Avis and Kansas City Southern have all fallen more than 10 per cent, while two-thirds of the Dow Jones Transportation Average members have declined since the start of the year.The Dow Transports retreat casts a cloud over the broader equity market as a bullish or bearish trend is flagged whenever the benchmark rallies or declines sharply. This is based on the notion that transport stocks reflect the underlying economy far better than the average company and thus foreshadow prospects for economic growth.Analysts with JPMorgan said a stronger dollar has crimped export activity, which is a key component of the rail business. Credit Suisse, which remains bullish on the rail industry, noted that a slide in energy prices has weighed on deliveries of coal and crude oil products.“We have witnessed the impact in the past few weeks during which CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have each experienced notable year-over-year declines in coal,” said Allison Landry, an analyst with Credit Suisse.She added: “This, in conjunction with a step down in shale-related volumes relative to the beginning of the quarter, potentially leading to extra costs related to a mismatch in the resource-to-demand equation, will likely result in downward first-quarter earnings revisions.”That left Dow Transports on course for lagging its namesake counterpart for a fifth consecutive day on Thursday. The benchmark has registered a fall of almost 5 per cent this year, reflecting in part investors increasing bearish or so-called short positions in transport companies after two years of double-digit gains.Shares of SPDR S&P Transport ETF constituents, which includes CSX, FedEx and Avis Budget, on loan to short the underlying stock have climbed 33 basis points from a low touched in January. At 3.4 per cent, the figure was the highest since the middle of November, according to data provider Markit.The case for transport stocks rests largely on wider US and global activity as the rail and shipping behemoths depend on increases in trade to fill rail cars and cargo holds.Retailers have warned that port disputes on the US West Coast have stunted supply chains, prompting companies including Union Pacific to forecast first-quarter volumes that will be flat to slightly down as it takes weeks to clear inventory backlogs.The strength of the dollar is also weighing on export-heavy industries, including semiconductors, as big corporations put systems upgrades on hold.“Foreign demand should be cut as long as [the] dollar stays in this area,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Until we have consistent strength in the economy, domestic companies may say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit’.”eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
20;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-01-27T14:00:27Z;Bond markets rush to beat blizzard chaos;US corporate borrowers sell more than $6bn in notes and bonds;Corporate borrowers rushed to raise funds on US debt capital markets on Monday ahead of a policy meeting by the Federal Reserve and potential disruption in trading activity as a severe snowstorm approached the US northeast.Companies including Union Pacific, Credit Suisse, Penske Truck Leasing, HJ Heinz and railcar and freight company TTX sold more than $6bn in notes and bonds combined, just as Wall Street scrambled to make preparations for what was expected to be the worst blizzard to hit the region since at least 2006.The worst fears regarding the storm had failed to materialise by early on Tuesday with markets on track to operate regularly.Still, analysts said companies tried to squeeze in as many debt deals as possible in anticipation of worst weather and a potential shutdown.A shutdown disrupted activity on Wall Street for a couple of days in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy in October 2012.Corporate borrowers also tried to lock in long-term funding costs before Wednesday’s FOMC meeting with analysts debating whether the central bank would remove the “considerable time” reference from its policy statement as it reiterates that the US economy is expanding at a “moderate” pace.“Companies were trying to move ahead of the storm and the Fed, front-loading the week with bond sales and coming to debt markets all at once,” said Ed Marrinan, head of credit strategy at RBS Securities.In Monday’s largest debt offerings, Union Pacific sold $1.15bn in five, 20 and 40-year bonds, with yields ranging from 1.84 to 3.89 per cent, while Credit Suisse sold $2.75bn in floating and fixed three-year notes.In spite of Monday’s flurry of bond sales, the start of the year has been the slowest for new corporate debt issuance since 2010.Nearly $75bn worth of high-grade bonds were sold in the US so far this month, down from $93.3bn in the same period of 2014.The drop of new offerings in the high-yield market has been even more pronounced with new issuance of junk-rated debt dropping 41 per cent so far this month to $13.3bn, according to Dealogic.The first couple of weeks of each year tend to set the tone for new bond sales for the coming 12 months with banks and large global corporations usually rushing to raise funds as soon as markets reopen after the holiday season.But a spike in market volatility and a sell-off in many fixed-income asset classes in the aftermath of a relentless drop in oil prices has weighed on the outlook for corporate debt borrowing.“It’s been a very volatile start of the year, with a lot of uncertainty still lingering on markets,” said Mr Marrinan. “From monetary policy, to oil prices, to elections in Greece. It’s a lot for companies and investors to contend with.”
21;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-01-22T17:56:25Z;Union Pacific upbeat despite ports woes;West coast problems a big uncertainty for largest US rail network;Congestion at US west coast ports has held back shipping container movements in the first few weeks of this year, Union Pacific, the US’s biggest rail network, said on Thursday, amid otherwise largely bullish projections for the coming year.UP cited the problems at west coast ports — related to a simmering labour dispute and operational problems— as a key uncertainty for its business, alongside falling oil prices and weak international economies.However, the company’s shares surged 4 per cent to $118.97 after its results for last year’s fourth quarter and its projections for the coming year exceeded most analysts’ expectations.UP operates in the western two-thirds of the US, where surging grain traffic, growing oil-related movements and strong growth in consumer demand all boosted traffic during 2014. UP’s fourth-quarter revenue was up 9 per cent to $6.2bn, on traffic up 6 per cent.The rising traffic, however, created severe congestion, particularly on Warren Buffett’s BNSF, UP’s largest rival . The congestion reduced UP’s average speeds in the quarter by 8 per cent to 23.8mph compared with the previous year.Fourth-quarter net income was up 22 per to $1.43bn, while full-year net income rose 18 per cent to $5.18bn on revenues up 9 per cent to $24bn.There were also strong fourth-quarter results on Thursday from Canadian Pacific, Canada’s second-biggest railroad, which reported a rise in net income from C$82m to C$451m, on revenue up 8 per cent to C$6.62bn.Eric Butler, UP’s head of marketing and sales, said strong agricultural demand, growing domestic construction and the generally strong US economy should help UP to record still higher traffic volumes and higher profits for 2015.However, he said, if oil prices remained at current levels, the company’s projections for crude oil traffic and related business, such as movements of sand for hydraulic fracturing of wells, would suffer.“We’ll have to see how the energy markets play out, to see what the ultimate impact will be on our sand volumes,” he said.Mr Butler also expected growth in intermodal traffic — containers and truck trailers. But while the company expected increasing imports to boost international intermodal movements — to and from ports — for the year, they were suffering from the congestion issues.“While we are hopeful that the parties will come to a resolution soon, international intermodal will be a headwind until the labour dispute is resolved,” Mr Butler said.Various sectors of the US economy — including retailers, the footwear industry and agricultural producers — have complained about the ports slowdown. The contract between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Association expired on July 1 and work at many ports has slowed significantly while the talks drag on.
22;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2015-01-01T16:16:36Z;Big ships leave ports awash with problems;Container areas in Los Angeles and Long Beach often overflowing;Five years ago, the Xin Ou Zhou would have turned heads in the Port of Long Beach, California, because of its sheer size.The China Shipping Container Lines vessel is 334m long, 42.8m wide and can carry 8,530 20ft equivalent units of containers, a standard measure of ship capacity.But the Xin Ou Zhou, which was launched in 2007, is now one of the smaller container ships arriving laden at Long Beach or the nearby Port of Los Angeles from across the Pacific. Other vessels are attracting attention, such as Cosco’s Cosco Development. Completed in 2011, she is 366m long, 48.2m wide and able to carry 13,092 TEUs of containers.The transformation in scale has hugely improved the efficiency of container transport, allowing shipping lines to reduce the number of sailings while carrying the same cargo or more. Two vessels like the Cosco Development can carry the same cargo as three the size of the Xin Ou Zhou. Shipping lines have formed new, bigger alliances to make the most efficient possible use of the new vessels. Lines carry other alliance members’ cargo on their own vessels.But the change has also over the past few months often left the container stacking areas along the quays in Los Angeles and Long Beach full to overflowing. Terminals have struggled to handle the volumes of containers during the traditional August to December peak shipping season. Up to 18 vessels have sometimes been left waiting outside the twin ports, which together handled 41 per cent of US container traffic in 2013.Terminal operators, port authorities, shipping lines and railroads are working together to try to resolve the congestion crisis, the worst at US ports since 2004. Similar problems, but on a smaller scale, have also affected other big container terminals on the Pacific Coast, including Seattle and Oakland.Mark Simon, assistant vice-president for the international container business of Union Pacific, operator of the US’ biggest rail network, says that before the arrival of the bigger ships, vessels would discharge cargo at different terminals around the port in far smaller quantities.Instead of 5,000 TEUs coming off a ship, you now have 10,000 TEUs . . . In some cases, there are 13,000 TEU ships calling“Instead of 5,000 TEUs coming off a ship, you now have 10,000 TEUs,” he says. “In some cases, there are 13,000 TEU ships calling.”Efforts to resolve the issues are being made amid a simmering industrial dispute that employers blame for creating or exacerbating problems. Members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union — the dockers’ union at all the coast’s ports — have been working since July without a contract. The two sides have held periodic talks aimed at reaching a new deal but have so far failed.The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents the employers, acknowledges that operational issues have led to some of the problems at LA and Long Beach. But it blames unofficial go-slows by the ILWU for many of the problems at the twin ports and all at other west coast facilities. The ILWU insists the problems result from the ports’ operational flaws.Neil Davidson, ports analyst at London-based Drewry Shipping Consultants, says it is unclear how far union action is to blame for the disruption. But he says: “There are certainly some deeper issues that have to be addressed even after the contract is agreed.”One relates to a decision by terminal operators this year to stop providing truckers with the chassis on which they haul containers to and from ports. The lack of alternative sources created a shortage.That problem was exacerbated when terminals started to fill up and operators began to refuse to accept deliveries of empty containers, which then sat outside on some of the few available chassis.Noel Hacegaba, chief commercial officer for the Port of Long Beach, says the port tried to ease the problem by buying 3,000 new chassis for truckers to use. It also set up a storage site for empty containers.For Union Pacific, one of the biggest challenges has been multiple shipping lines’ cargo on each vessel, says Mr Simon, meaning goods need far more sorting before they can be loaded on to trains. Union Pacific is working with shipping lines to ensure clumps of containers heading to the same destinations are grouped together to minimise sorting.Mr Davidson says the most basic problems are longstanding. US container terminals are the least productive in the developed world, largely because operators, worrying about labour unrest, have been reluctant to invest in modern equipment.The challenges on the US west coast are particularly acute because port authorities traditionally created multiple terminals in each facility for individual shipping lines. Those small facilities have been easily overwhelmed by deliveries from big new ships.“There are some fundamental issues underneath it all,” Mr Davidson says. “There’s all this latent capacity that doesn’t get used.”Port operators insist they intend to address some of these longer term issues once the immediate crisis is over.Mr Hacegaba says emergency measures, plus the diversion of some ships away from the most congested ports, and seasonal declines in cargo volumes, had helped to ease the challenges. “We see signs of improvement,” he adds.But Jonathan Gold, head of supply chain for the US National Retail Federation, says many problems will remain until labour leaders and employers settle their dispute.
23;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2014-06-08T07:58:58Z;North America’s rail regulators face safety concerns on oil transport;New standards for tankers may allow the industry to abandon speed restrictions;When a train carrying crude oil exploded by Virginia’s James River, it was a stark confirmation of local environmentalists’ fears.Less than a month before, on April 30, the local chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, had warned that an increase in crude shipments to a transport hub at Yorktown by CSX, the eastern US’s main railroad, was a “recipe for disaster”.And so it proved, when several cars derailed and three exploded, spilling oil into the river and sending fireballs into the sky above the small town of Lynchburg.The crash, which injured no one, was the latest of a series to have hit trains across North America over the past year, as the risks of carrying oil from North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation have become clear.The worst incident came last July when a train of tank cars ran away in Quebec and crashed in the small town of Lac-Mégantic, killing 47 people.Yet the response – from both the oil and rail businesses – has been to improve safety standards, rather than revert to the pipelines that have carried most crude since shortly after oil was first found in Pennsylvania in the 1850s. That reflects the industry’s confidence that the problems can be overcome and the discovery that rail offers unexpected flexibility.Ed Hamberger, chief executive of the Association of American Railroads (AAR), an industry association, insists 99.9 per cent of shipments carried in the traditional North American tank car – the DOT-111 – reach their destination with no leakage. “It’s not an unsafe tank car,” he says.But last October the AAR decided to issue a new standard for tank cars in the face of slow decision making by regulators.It obliges any railroad ordering tank cars after the regulation’s publication to order them with stronger ends, better pressure-relief valves and better insulation to stop a fire heating the car’s contents. “There can be more robust tank cars that are safer,” Mr Hamberger adds.The adoption of new standards should allow railroads to abandon the speed restrictions that have been imposed on most crude shipments in DOT-111 tank cars since the aftermath of the Lac-Mégantic crash, according to Bill Furman, chief executive of Greenbrier Group, one of the US’s biggest tank car manufacturers.The DOT-111 was designed for the slower speeds of previous decades’ railroad network. Overall speeds have increased as railroads have expanded into handling more containerised consumer goods, which tend to be time-critical.Mr Furman says: “In order for the industry to participate in this growth in oil and not hamper the economic benefits that the oil and gas business will bring to North America and the world, we have to be able to run these trains under the current US model. We can’t slow them down.”At the heart of the questions surrounding crude oil transport by rail are the unusual characteristics of the crude oil emerging from the Bakken shale area. It is high-quality light, sweet oil, in contrast to the sour crude emerging from the Permian shale oilfield in Texas.Investigators after the Lac-Mégantic crash concluded that Bakken crude was more prone to explosion than other rail-moved oil, such as the sour crude from Canada’s oil sands. Many of the cars that crashed in Quebec had been labelled as less dangerous than they actually were.The crude’s composition also explains why there is so much demand to move it by rail. Its characteristics are similar to those of internationally traded light, sweet Brent crude usually handled in refineries in the US northeast and California.The US pipeline network, however, best serves refineries around the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana. They are either set up to process sour Arabian crude or are supplied with the sweet crude oil that emerges from the Eagle Ford shale, traditional wells in Louisiana and Texas or west African imports.The steep price discrepancy – or spread – between Bakken crude and Brent has made it compelling for refineries that previously depended on imported sweet oil, which mostly lack a ready way to obtain Bakken crude by pipeline.“Spreads are favouring the Bakken crude to move to the east and west coasts, and not to the Gulf coast,” says Jack Koraleski, chief executive of Union Pacific (UP), the US’s biggest rail network.Rail movements have been particularly useful for oil producers, because supply chains can be quickly reconfigured when price changes alter the pattern of demand from refineries.“I think all of this speaks to the nimbleness of this industry, which is perhaps not known in the minds of a lot of people as being very nimble and viewed as a 19th-century industry,” Mr Hamberger says.There is little doubt that pipeline construction will eventually erode railroads’ share of movements – even if increased production keeps rail movements of crude oil growing overall.However, Mr Koraleski and others in the industry remain confident that, even if the main projected pipeline – Keystone XL from Alberta’s oil sands to the US – is built, the outlook remains rosy.Keystone XL would remove between 700,000 and 800,000 barrels a day of oil – 10-15 trains – from the network. There are nevertheless “plenty” of other opportunities for rail to continue to grow, Mr Koraleski says.UP currently handles more of the fracking sand needed to dislodge oil and gas from shale rock than it does actual crude.“If they do build it, it’s 1,200 miles and that’s 1,200 miles of pipe we’ll have a chance to move – the pipe, all the rock, the cement,” Mr Koraleski adds.There would also be 9,000 workers, all of whom would need somewhere to live and trucks to drive during the construction. “It’s win-win either way for us,” Mr Koraleski says.
24;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2014-02-26T15:32:51Z;Bondholders pay price of share buybacks;;A surge in sales of corporate bonds to fund share buybacks is adding pressure to companies’ balance sheets and increasing risks for holders of corporate debt.Some of the country’s largest companies, including FedEx, Union Pacific and Cisco, have issued debt this year to help finance stock repurchases.Companies have raised at least $11bn worth of debt in 2014 for this purpose, according to data from Standard & Poor’s LCD, compared with $19bn raised by companies with similar investment grade ratings for the whole of 2013.The 2014 figure might be even higher, analysts say, since most companies are not required to say how they use proceeds from debt sales.Debt has become a cheap source of capital for many companies and a means to reward shareholders, particularly at times when revenue growth is lacklustre.But for bondholders, such shareholder-friendly practices come at a price.As companies add leverage to boost their stock prices, the higher debt load, combined with slower growth expectations may lead to credit downgrades and a potential decline in the price of their bonds.“The money a company uses to fund buybacks is money that simply goes out of the door and it never gets back,” said Jesse Fogarty, a portfolio manager at Cutwater Asset Management.“It doesn’t immediately raise the probability of default, but as a bondholder I would prefer to see a company sell bonds and use the same amount of money on activities that have the potential to generate cash one day, even with no guarantee of success.”The practice has increased in popularity among corporate borrowers in the past couple of years as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary stimulus policies brought borrowing costs down to record lows.Most of the issuance has come from large companies with investment grade ratings and very low borrowing costs. Still, sales by junk-rated companies has picked up and totalled $12bn in 2013.Analysts at Fitch Ratings said: “While most stock buybacks and dividends are done in a credit-neutral manner, shareholder-friendly actions continue to drive a steady flow of downgrades and negative outlook changes.”Fitch took six negative rating actions on US companies in 2013 due at least in part to share repurchases.“The heavy use of bond issuance to fund share buybacks is related to corporations’ reluctance to invest in plant and equipment, which is an increasingly controversial subject,” said Marty Fridson, chief executive of FridsonVision, a financial research company.“Worse than having bondholders subsidise shareholders is the fact that this strategy does not always work to lift the stock price.”In this year’s largest deal, Cisco sold $8bn in bonds, in which a portion of the proceeds was earmarked to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks.The sale follows the company’s warning that its fiscal third-quarter results may miss some analysts’ estimates. Cisco has already bought back $4bn of its own stock in the three months through to January 25, but its shares are still lagging behind gains in the S&P 500 Information Technology group.
25;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2014-01-23T18:45:25Z;Union Pacific defies coal declines to beat forecasts;;Union Pacific on Thursday became the second rail freight network in two days to announce far stronger than expected full-year results as strong agricultural and automotive demand allowed it to defy falling coal and oil volumes.Fourth-quarter net income for UP was up 13 per cent to $1.17bn, on revenues up 7 per cent to $5.3bn. The earnings per share figure – up 16 per cent to $2.55 – was 6 cents better than consensus forecasts.The results sent shares in UP, operator of the US’s biggest rail freight network, up 3.3 per cent to $174.12 by the close of trade.UP’s results came the day after Norfolk Southern, the US’s fourth-biggest operator, announced fourth-quarter net income up 24 per cent to $513m, on revenues up 7 per cent to $2.9bn.The results illustrate how US railroads continue to be able to increase prices and improve returns, despite declines in coal volumes– traditionally the biggest single commodity for railroads. US power stations have been using far less coal as the country’s shale oil and gas boom has sent natural gas prices tumbling.UP’s fourth-quarter coal volumes fell 10 per cent and its coal revenue declined 1 per cent to $985m, while NS’s coal volumes fell 8 per cent and its coal revenues fell 2.4 per cent to $641m.UP also defied a 22 per cent fourth-quarter decline in shipments of crude oil, which has been one of the fastest-growing areas for the industry.Eric Butler, UP’s head of marketing and sales, said greater supplies of imported oil at Gulf Coast refineries had depressed shipments from West Texas and Oklahoma. Changing price differentials had also prompted shippers to send less oil from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota to Louisiana refineries, which UP is best placed to serve.Jack Koraleski, chief executive, said 2013 had been a “terrific year” for UP.“For the first time in six quarters, we reported overall volume growth despite significantly weaker coal shipment, which highlights the strength of our diverse franchise, the extensive network reach we have to various markets and a strong grain harvest,” he said of the fourth quarter.The company had improved its operating ratio – the proportion of its revenues consumed by operating costs – to 65 per cent for the quarter. The figure was above 70 per cent as recently as 2010.Mr Koraleski said UP now expected to return a full-year operating ratio below 65 per cent before the target date of 2017, but he could not be sure when. The 2013 full-year figure was 66.1 per cent.UP attributed its improved profitability in the quarter mainly to a 3.5 per cent increase in “core pricing”, its average price per unit shipped. NS also succeeded in raising its core prices.UP’s agricultural traffic in the quarter rose 13 per cent, while revenue grew 19 per cent. Automotive traffic – both completed cars and parts – rose 10 per cent, with revenue up 17 per cent.
26;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2014-01-23T17:35:49Z;US airlines drop despite profit growth;;US airlines United Continental Holdings and Southwest stumbled on Thursday as earnings season continued its brisk pace and equity markets declined.Shares in United fell as much as 4 per cent to $47.00 before recovering to close at $48.33, after the company said passenger revenue per available seat mile would be flat to 2 per cent in the current quarter.The guidance, from the parent company of United Air Lines, was coupled with the airline’s quarterly results, which showed the carrier swung to a profit of $140m, or 37 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss of $620m a year earlier. Sales increased 7 per cent from a year earlier to $9.3bn in the fourth quarter.Shares in Southwest ended 2.39 per cent lower at $21.25 even after the group reported a 172 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profit. Net income increased to $212m, or 30 cents per diluted share, on sales of $4.4bn.The declines on Thursday follow a strong start for the airline sector in 2014, with carriers making up five of the top six performing stocks in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.Nutrition company Herbalife declined on Thursday after Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts sent letters to US regulators calling for an investigation into the company’s business practices.The senator’s questions follow investor Bill Ackman’s contention that Herbalife operates a pyramid scheme, which the company has vigorously denied.“I have seen reports from Massachusetts residents that suggest Herbalife is a pyramid scheme,” Senator Markey wrote in a letter dated Wednesday.Shares tumbled 10.38 per cent to $65.90 following the announcement.US defence company Lockheed Martin fell 3.93 per cent in New York, ending at $150.50 following its quarterly results, which showed the sixth quarter of sales declines.Profits dropped to $488m, or $1.50 a share, for the quarter from $569m, or $1.73, a year earlier. Overall revenues fell to $11.5bn from $12.09bn.The company, which has been trimming costs and jobs as the pockets of its largest customer, the US government, shrink, said it was hit by fewer deliveries of its military jets in the period.Netflix led the S&P 500 on Thursday, after the company reported a sixfold increase in profits in the fourth quarter and a 2.3m increase in domestic subscribers after market close on Wednesday.The streaming movie and television provider said profits rose to $48.4m, or 79 cents per diluted share. Sales increased 24 per cent to $1.2bn in the three months ending December.The domestic subscription gains were at the high end of the company’s earlier guidance and the company said it was seeing improvements in its international operations, which now count more than 10m members. Shares rose 16.48 per cent to $388.72.Union Pacific advanced 3.36 per cent to $174.17 after posting its first rise in volumes for six quarters, helped by more shipments of agriculture, cars and industrial goods. The railroad said it saw signs the US economy was “slowly strengthening”.Chief executive Jack Koraleski said the railroad had been able to pass along higher prices to customers and had growth across most of the goods it moves.Profits at the largest US railroad rose 13 per cent from a year earlier to $1.2bn, or $2.55 a share, topping Wall Street forecasts. Sales increased 7 per cent from a year ago to $5.6bn.Overall, US markets declined sharply on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 more than 1 per cent lower since the year began. A report from the labour department showed initial jobless claims rose 1,000 from a week earlier to 326,000, while existing home sales climbed by a better than expected 1 per cent in December.“Both series indicate an economy that is doing quite well, almost at normal levels,” Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ economist Chris Rupkey said. “The only concern is the sudden loss of emergency unemployment benefits.”The S&P 500 fell 0.89 per cent to 1,828.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.07 per cent to 16,197.35, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.57 per cent to 4,218.87.
27;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-12-04T14:13:38Z;New technology could have prevented Bronx train crash;;Investigators have said new signalling technology might have prevented Sunday’s fatal New York City train crash, but even the crashed train’s operator has admitted it will probably miss a congressional deadline to introduce the system.Earl Weener, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press briefing on the board’s crash investigation it was “possible” Positive Train Control might have prevented the crash, caused by excessive speed. The signalling system – which Congress demanded in a 2008 law – could intervene to prevent mistakes by drivers, Mr Weener added.However, New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority – one of scores of public-sector commuter train operators due to introduce the new technology – admitted it would be “very difficult” for it to meet a 2015 deadline to introduce the system.Mr Weener’s comments came as the Federal Railroad Administration, the rail system’s safety regulator, wrote to the MTA to voice “significant concerns” about safety on Metro-North, the operator of the train that crashed on Sunday. The MTA runs both Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, the US’s busiest commuter rail network.The MTA said it had started work on introducing Positive Train Control on the two systems in 2009 and had budgeted $600m for the work involved but that total implementation costs were expected to reach $900m.The authority would seek to make money to fund installation available on “the most aggressive schedule possible”, it said.But it went on: “Implementing PTC by the 2015 deadline will be very difficult for the MTA as well as for other commuter railroads, as the Federal Railroad Administration and the Government Accountability Office have both concluded”.PTC is similar to other advanced signalling systems being introduced worldwide and has elements in common with Europe’s European Train Control System and the UK’s Train Protection and Warning System. TPWS has eliminated most movements past danger signals on the UK railways, which has suffered only a single passenger fatality in a crash caused by the rail system since 2002.PTC systems constantly monitor a train’s speed to ensure it will be able to stop before the next obstruction and in time to obey any speed limits. It steps in if the driver fails to slow down appropriately and applies the brakes.The NTSB said on Monday the train in Sunday’s crash – from Poughkeepsie to New York City – was running at 82mph on a curve restricted to 30mph when it hurtled off the rails.Mr Weener said the NTSB had been asking for Positive Train Control’s introduction for 20 years.“We know that operator error can be eradicated and that PTC is capable of intervening to prevent it,” Mr Weener said. “Since this is a derailment involving a high-speed train, it’s possible that PTC could have prevented it.”Congress demanded many commuter rail operators and the biggest freight railroads – known as the Class Is – introduce positive train control in the wake of the 2008 Chatsworth train crash near Los Angeles. The crash, which killed 25 people, occurred after a commuter train driver passed a red signal and ploughed into an oncoming Union Pacific freight train.Both public sector transit agencies and the private freight operators have been struggling to find the billions of dollars necessary to introduce the technology and wrestling with technical problems.The FRA’s letter told Thomas Prendergast, the MTA’s chief executive, that Metro-North’s recent safety record was “simply unacceptable”. As well as Sunday’s crash, Metro-North this year has suffered a derailment and collision in Connecticut in May apparently caused by a broken rail, the death of a track worker and the derailment in July of a freight train in The Bronx very close to the site of Sunday’s crash.The FRA demanded the MTA give details of its plans to improve employee briefing on safety and ordered it to institute a confidential reporting system for “close calls” that could have led to accidents.“We have significant concerns about the situation at Metro-North, and are actively considering other ways that FRA can use its federal oversight authority to provide additional safety enhancement of MTA operations,” Joseph Szabo, the FRA’s administrator, wrote to Mr Prendergast.
28;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Growth in crude oil shipped by rail slows;;Rail shipments of crude oil in the US – one of the major trends to emerge from the shale drilling boom, are hitting the buffers.As the price differential between inland and coastal oil markets narrows, railways and logistics companies are reporting falling traffic on the lines connecting oilfields to refineries.This slowdown comes as railways face tighter regulation after a runaway crude train exploded in Quebec last month, killing 47. But the immediate cause of the pullback is economic: the difference in price between North Dakota’s Bakken oil and coastal Light Louisiana Sweet crude has shrunk 60 per cent from the start of the year.For some refineries, this makes African crude delivered by tanker more attractive than domestic oil shuttled by train.Phillips 66, whose New Jersey refinery has been taking deliveries of US oil by train and barge, has told investors: “We have reduced our take on the Bakken to the east coast, as we’ve adjusted our crude slates and [are] replacing that with more competitive barrels from imports.”On Thursday, the oil storage and transport company Global Partners – which has a contract to deliver Bakken crude by train to Phillips 66 – cut profit expectations partly due to lower crude oil shipments to the east and west coasts. “Our second-half volumes will be lower,” said Mark Romaine, chief operating officer.Last month, the Canadian Pacific railway told investors that narrowing price differences had eased the pace of growth in oil by rail. Union Pacific, operator of the US’s largest rail network, also said it was making “less sense” for refineries to ship oil by rail from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford shale areas in Texas, at current prices.“With the spreads as tight as they are, you’re just not seeing a lot of room for the cost of the rail shipment and the tank car and the terminal fees,” said Beth Whited, general manager for the chemicals business of Union Pacific.However, many industry executives and analysts believe the coastal/inland price differential will widen again later this year as US production surges, making imports of competing grades of crude less attractive.BNSF, operator of the US’s second-biggest rail network, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said: “Crude oil shale production…continues to increase across the United States and demand for efficient and safe crude by rail continues to grow.”Union Pacific said that while Texas volumes had slumped after new pipelines linked oilfields to the coast, its Bakken trade – which accounts for 80 per cent of its oil traffic – had kept growing. “We moved as much oil as we ever have out of the Bakken to the Gulf coast in July,” Ms Whited said.Paul Cheng, refining industry analyst at Barclays, said the cost of leasing rail tank cars has dropped from a peak of about $3,000 per car per month. Traders from refiners to investment banks invested heavily in rolling stock on the assumption wide spreads would remain.“Right now you cannot ship to the east. The differential is not big enough,” Mr Cheng said.
29;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-05-14T23:03:27Z;Transport: Virginia port shows transport pressures;Investment in extra capacity and rate changes illustrate the continuing potential of coal, oil and gas, writes Robert Wright;On the waterfront in the port of Lamberts Point, Virginia, the activity is more intense than for several years. Two machines, owned by Norfolk Southern (NS), one of two big railroads in the eastern US, haul railcars two at a time up to a big rotating drum. With a sudden twist, the drums turn, tipping out coal from the cars on to a conveyor belt that leads to a waiting ship. A plume of coal dust fills the air.The activity at Lamberts Point, a dedicated coal port that NS owns, reflects the state of the US coal market. Faced with slumping domestic coal demand, NS, according to Wick Moorman, its chief executive, has cut its prices for handling export coal to boost volumes.It is one of many examples of how transport providers’ investments in new capacity and changes to rate structures have helped to facilitate and smooth the big changes under way in US energy markets. NS and CSX, its bigger rival in the eastern US, have both sought to boost coal export volumes to make use of their extensive networks in the coal-producing parts of the Appalachians and Illinois River Basin.In the western US, the two big railroads – Union Pacific and BNSF – have invested heavily in the region’s booming oil production. Railroads across North America increasingly handle sand and other material going to wells that produce natural gas by hydraulic fracturing. The question is whether the recent big changes are likely to become permanent, with coal traffic depressed and significant oil traffic by rail, or whether coal volumes will rebound and oil revert to pipelines.For NS the price cuts in the first quarter produced a 21 per cent increase in export coal volumes that slowed the overall decline for all coal traffic – including domestic volumes – to 4.4 per cent. Revenues from transporting coal, however, fell 17 per cent to $635m.“There’s some US coal that just doesn’t compete in the global market that well,” Mr Moorman says.The company has changed its rate structures to improve such coal’s competitiveness. “It’s still a good business,” Mr Moorman says. “But the rates are down 25 or 30 per cent.”At the heart of NS’s coal conundrums and energy transport in North America lies the question of how most cost-effectively to bring products to the markets that will deliver the highest prices. The effect has been particularly marked, according to Jonathan Garrett, an upstream analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy, for producers of oil from the vast Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana.Wood Mackenzie estimates that although it costs about 60 per cent more to move crude oil by rail than by pipeline, the benefits have more than outweighed the costs. Producers moving the Bakken’s light sweet crude by rail have been able to sell it to coastal US refineries at the international benchmark price of Brent Crude.If they had moved it by pipeline, it would have sold at the price at the inland pipeline junction of Cushing, Oklahoma, which has been consistently running $13/bbl lower than Brent. Wood Mackenzie calculates that Continental Resources, the biggest holder of Bakken production and exploration acreage, has boosted the PV10 value – an industry standard measure – of its holdings by $574m by using rail to reach coastal refineries, rather than only pipelines. PV10 measures the net present value of an area’s future revenues, discounted by 10 per cent annually and net of production expenses. “If you can rail your barrels to markets where you get premium pricing, then you see a premium over what you’ve been receiving in the past,” Mr Garrett says. “Now you’re getting $85 a barrel, rather than $75.”Similar calculations lie behind changes in coal movements by rail, according to Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer of CSX. Coal from the Illinois river basin, which CSX serves, can compete with natural gas for power generation when natural gas prices are about $3.50 per million British thermal units (mBTUs).Appalachian coal competes only from about $4.50 per mBTU. A recent rise in gas prices has taken rates only up to around $4.10 per mBTU, compared with $13 at their summer 2008 peak.The best hope of finding a profitable market for more expensively-produced coal lies outside the US – although CSX still experienced a 3 per cent decline in its coal export volumes for the first quarter against last year. Its domestic coal volumes fell 14 per cent.“While the US is going through this big energy renaissance as a result of fracking and horizontal drilling, the rest of the world isn’t going through that energy renaissance,” Mr Eliasson says. “Coal is still the baseload capacity in most countries for electricity generation.”In the longer term, both Mr Moorman and Mr Eliasson express hope that rising gas prices and the gradual running down of big coal stockpiles at power stations should mean demand for their domestic coal services has at least hit bottom.For railroads in the western US, meanwhile, the outlook in energy is more positive.Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive. says there is no immediate prospect that, even if some rail volumes move to new pipelines, a pipeline will be built to move crude oil from North Dakota to the US east coast.“Our markets will move around a little bit,” Mr Rose says. “We don’t see at all that our business is going to go away.”
30;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-04-14T14:20:07Z;US rail operators divided over LNG future;;The US rail industry has reached a crossing point in its debate over making a transition from running diesel fuel to adopting liquefied natural gas.Natural gas power could slash costs for US railroads, which operate the world’s largest and busiest rail freight network, compared with existing diesel fuel. Despite a recent increase in prices, US natural gas prices remain historically low at a time when oil – and diesel fuel – prices are near record highs.Matt Rose, chief executive of BNSF, the US’s second biggest rail network by route miles, is one of the most enthusiastic exponents for a potential switch to LNG. BNSF could convert on its own to using LNG if necessary, Mr Rose said.“We don’t change a lot in our industry,” Mr Rose said. “There was a big change from steam to diesel. This is that kind of change.”However, Jack Koraleski, chief executive of Union Pacific, operator of the biggest network, Wick Moorman, chief executive of Norfolk Southern, operator of the fourth-biggest, and Fredrik Eliasson, chief financial officer for CSX, the number three, have all expressed reservations.Mr Eliasson said it was “pretty clear” the economics of operating on LNG would work. But a switch at one railroad could jeopardise the smooth running of locomotives between different railroads.“It’s much more a question of how much and how quickly will the industry convert small portions, large portions or all of their fleet over to utilise LNG,” Mr Eliasson said.Mr Moorman called LNG conversion “an extraordinarily interesting opportunity”. But he queried whether gas-powered locomotives would generate the power of diesels.Mr Koraleski acknowledged it was undoubtedly possible to run a locomotive on natural gas, but he added: “The question is, can you do it economically, can you do it safely and can you do it on a consistently reliable basis?”The LNG, which is generally regarded as cleaner than diesel, would be carried in supercooled liquefied form either within the locomotive itself or an adapted freight car. Both GE Transportation and Caterpillar are co-operating with railroads in trials of the new technology due to start later this year.Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Transportation, the General Electric business that is one of the US’s two big locomotive builders, said his company was developing LNG power in response to customers’ demands. He added that the company’s intended LNG locomotives should produce at least the same power as existing ones running on diesel. The locomotives might also be able to run further than existing ones between fuelling stopsGE’s main rival, the EMD unit of Caterpillar, said locomotives were likely to be able to carry substantial quantities of fuel within existing locomotive bodyshells, even without a neighbouring car to carry additional stocks.
31;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;Coal’s decline comes as oil booms;;The boom in rail-borne crude oil movements from windswept North Dakota has run parallel with a downturn in the fortunes of another area that was once North American rail’s new energy frontier: Wyoming’s Powder River Basin.US utility companies turned to Powder River Basin coal in the 1970s and 1980s because its low sulphur content helped them meet the era’s strict new energy requirements.The area provides most of the coal that both Union Pacific and BNSF move.Capacity on rail routes to and from the area was very tight until recently.However, low natural gas prices after the US shale boom have prompted many utilities to drop coal where possible, pushing BNSF’s coal traffic down 6 per cent last year and Union Pacific’s down 14 per cent.Coal’s decline poses even greater problems for the main railways in the eastern US– CSX and Norfolk Southern – which rely heavily on carrying more expensively mined coal from the Appalachians, Pennsylvania and the Illinois basin.Neither of the big eastern railways are benefiting as much as the western railroads from fresh energy sources, yet there is little doubt that every big US railway would appreciate some revival in the coal business.Even after last year’s decline, coal accounted for 24 per cent of BNSF’s freight revenues last year and 20 per cent of Union Pacific’s.Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, says even the breakneck growth in oil and gas-related movements is still only halfway to making up for the revenue lost because of declining coal volumes.Nevertheless, Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific’s chief executive, expresses optimism that better times are approaching.Natural gas prices are expected to rise – and cheap PRB coal will compete after even a modest price rise.Both Union Pacific and BNSF are also working on plans for providing new coal export facilities in Washington State that could take PRB coal to Chinese power stations.“We’re cautiously positive [about the] outlook for our coal business,” Mr Koraleski says.
32;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-04-07T19:05:33Z;Oil traffic surge strains US trains;;The train that stands on the track running past the Union Pacific railroad’s Davidson Yard in Fort Worth, Texas, is one that two years ago the company could scarcely have anticipated operating.A big diesel engine stands at the rear, while another two stand at the front. In between, taking up a mile-and-a-half of track, stand 93 tank cars filled with about 55,000 barrels of crude oil coaxed by new drilling techniques from the ground under Oklahoma.Such trains, heading for US coastal refineries, are becoming increasingly common sights on Union Pacific and other big US railways exposed to the USshale oil boom.Union Pacific was typical in recording a trebling of crude oil traffic for 2012 over 2011 and looks set for another year of strong growth. BNSF, the other big western railway, also expects rising oil traffic to continue.However, 650 miles to the north at Union Pacific’s Harriman Dispatch Centre in Omaha, which controls the company’s 32,000-mile network, operators can see the strain the new traffic is imposing.Screens indicating the state of the company’s network show formerly problem areas – including the main transcontinental route and the busiest coal routes – a reassuring (meaning undercapacity) blue.But the areas around Fort Worth and the coastal refineries are all an angry red, showing they are operating at least 10 per cent over their comfortable capacity and at risk of growing congested.Cliff Bowman, Union Pacific’s director of terminal operations for the Davidson Yard, says the yard not only now handles significant crude oil traffic but, standing in the yard’s control tower, points to the many cars loaded with pipeline parts and other oil industry supplies. Many are heading for West Texas’s fast-growing oilfields.“It’s been a surprise to see how fast the crude oil business has taken off – it really has,” Mr Bowman says. “It changes so fast.”The question for the US’s largest railways is how heavily they should invest to turn those routes from an overcapacity red to at-capacity yellow while simultaneously coping with slackening demand for coal, once their main commodity.“It’s going to continue to be a challenge in terms of capital allocation,” Tony Hatch, an independent railways analyst says, adding that the decision will involve an element of gambling on future traffic flows. “The question is, where do you put your chips?”Musket Corporation’s Fort Worth ethanol facility, served by BNSF a few miles from the Davidson Yard, illustrates part of the solution to the investment dilemma.We actually have more crude train sets running than agriculture train sets. That’s pretty significant for usHere the ethanol distributors paid to construct the terminal – lowering costs to the rail companies – which was a model adopted for last decade’s boom in ethanol shipments by rail. Third parties also own the tank cars that use the facility.Railways have adopted the same approach to minimising the capital they invest in the new crude oil business, letting oil producers and refinery operators purchase new railcars and bear the costs of developing the terminals where tanks begin and end their journeys.However, Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, points out that ethanol mostly ran on track that had already been brought up to a high standard to handle significant flows of agricultural products.Crude oil is moving in areas such as North Dakota, where there was previously little traffic of any kind.“In this case, we didn’t have capacity,” Mr Rose says of the crude oil traffic. “Today we actually have more crude train sets running than agriculture train sets. That’s pretty significant for us.”The ethanol experience also illustrates how traffic that suddenly spikes can disappear just as swiftly. Last year’s drought in the US midwest and changing federal incentives have reduced ethanol shipments.There have also been concerns that the laying of the pipeline parts – now visible in loaded up cars around Davidson Yard – could shift much of the new shale oil volume from trains into pipelines.However, Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific’s chief executive, reflects the rail industry’s general optimism, pointing out that customers have invested heavily in new terminals and tank cars to move crude by rail.Both Mr Rose and Mr Koraleski say oil shippers appreciate how rail lets them shop about between refineries for the best price for their crude. Pipelines offer less flexibility. “Their investment tells us that they’re going to plan to use rail for a long time even as pipelines get built,” Mr Koraleski says.There remain practical challenges in dealing with the surging traffic. The lines that the Davidson Yard crude train will use – and many other crude oil routes – remain single-track, Mr Koraleski says. The company is seeking to lay a second track along many of them, to improve capacity and make maintenance easier.The difficulty is that the traffic’s demands make it hard to find a good time to close the line to do that work.But Mr Koraleski is optimistic, based on the railway’s experience of handling previous sudden traffic growth, that the congestion will gradually ease and the growth will be accommodated.“Every time we hand over a piece of added capacity, it just gets a little better,” he says.
33;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
34;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-04-07T19:04:07Z;Biggest US rails to invest $450m in crude;;The US’s two biggest railroads are ploughing more than $450m into boosting their capacity to the sudden boom in shale oil production.The chief executives of Union Pacific, operator of the biggest network, and BNSF, operator of the second largest, told the Financial Times the investments were justified because they believed that oil traffic would remain significant long term. Oil companies have invested heavily in oil-carrying tank cars and rail terminals, while several chemical manufacturers are building new, rail-linked facilities to exploit the US’s relatively cheap and plentiful new gas and oil supplies.The sharp rise in crude oil traffic by rail is one of the biggest changes in the US industry since deregulation in 1980Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, said the company expected to be handling 700,000 barrels a day by the end of this year compared with 525,000 at present and saw “a pathway” to “something over” 1m barrels a day. In January the company was handling about 150,000 barrels daily.Union Pacific said that its crude oil volumes so far this year are running at twice last year’s levels and that it carried 300,000 barrels a day in February.Many of the new oil-producing areas are cut off from the existing oil pipeline network.At 1m barrels a day, volumes on BNSF alone would equal around 40 per cent of the US’s daily pipeline imports and around a sixth of its seaborne crude imports.“This crude by rail is something that literally five years ago we didn’t see on the horizon,” Mr Rose said. “So that has been a real opportunity for us.”Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific’s chief executive, said the company planned to invest more than $250m this year in assets mainly for use by its crude oil business. Mr Rose said BNSF, part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, would spend $200m this year on work mainly aimed at the traffic.Fast-rising crude oil traffic has helped to cushion both railroads against the effects of sharp falls in coal volumes following big falls in US natural gas prices.Oil traffic demands particularly heavy investment, however, because the commodity uses different routes from the now-underused coal lines.“We have excess capacity in one franchise and we’re having to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to handle the crude oil franchise,” Mr Rose said.Both men were also adamant that customers would continue to use rail to move crude oil even once pipelines reached some of the main shale oil areas.“Customers have discovered the flexibility, the speed to market and the consistency and reliability of rail,” Mr Koraleski said.
35;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-01-29T22:19:16Z;CP shares up as chief projects record year;;Shares in Canadian Pacific, operator of one of Canada’s two transcontinental rail networks, rose more than 4 per cent on Tuesday after the fast-changing company’s new chief executive vowed to produce “record-setting results” for 2013.Fourth-quarter earnings per share for the company, which had been an efficiency laggard amid rapidly improving North American rail companies, rose 15 per cent to C$1.28, excluding the effects of big writedowns taken in the quarter.The company had taken a C$53m charge for restructuring its workforce, a C$185m writedown mainly for abandoning plans to build a new rail line into Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and an C$80m writedown of the value of some locomotives it plans to sell.CP has been undergoing a comprehensive shake-up since shareholders last June installed Hunter Harrison, a former chief executive of Canadian National Railway, as chief executive, in place of Fred Green. Mr Harrison is widely respected in North American rail for leading a transformation of CN’s efficiency, speeding up services and cutting out waste. He has set about introducing similar initiatives at CP.Including the effects of the impairment charges, fourth-quarter net income fell to C$15m, from C$221m last time, on revenue up 6.7 per cent to C$1.5bn. Full-year net income fell 15 per cent to C$484m, on revenues up 10 per cent to C$5.69bn.Excluding the effect of the writedowns, CP’s fourth-quarter operating ratio – the proportion of revenues consumed by operating costs – improved to 74.8 per cent, compared with 78.5 per cent for the full 2011 year. The company expected an operating ratio in the “low 70s” for 2013, it said. The best-performing North American railroads – including Canadian National and Union Pacific – report operating ratios in the mid-60s.The company expected 2013 earnings per share to be 40 per cent up on the 2012 figure excluding the impairment charges of C$4.84.CP was moving forward on its “transformational journey” to become the most efficient railroad in North America, Mr Harrison said.“Management made a number of hard decisions this quarter including booking several significant items,” he said. “With these decisions now behind us, we anticipate record-setting financial and operational results starting in 2013.”CP has been one of the rail companies most exposed to the boom in rail movements of crude oil because of its good access to North Dakota’s Bakken Shale oil producing region. Traffic in its industrial and consumer products segment – which includes crude oil – was up 29 per cent in the quarter. The company is relatively little exposed to coal, volumes of which have been falling, although coal traffic was 1 per cent down for the quarter.The shares rose 4.4 per cent in New York to $116.91.
36;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2013-01-24T16:12:35Z;Union Pacific profits rise on non-coal traffic;;Union Pacific, operator of the US’s biggest rail network, overcame sharp falls in its core agricultural and coal traffic to post a 7 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net income, in the latest sign of the company’s improving performance.Fourth-quarter coal revenue for the company, which operates across the US west of the Mississippi, fell 7 per cent for the quarter to $770m as US power generators shifted toward gas and away from coal.Agricultural revenues – mainly related to bulk grain movements – fell 8 per cent to $785m as the Midwestern drought hit grain yields.The declines were offset by a 14 per cent increase in automotive traffic – a result of sharply rebounding US car demand– and a 15 per cent rise in chemicals, which included fast-growing traffic in crude oil from new sources, particularly North Dakota.Industrial products revenue grew 3 per cent, while intermodal – movements of truck trailers and shipping containers – grew 6 per cent. Rail operators have won significant new intermodal traffic in recent years as high fuel prices have pushed customers to use rail for long-haul movements instead of trucks.Net income for the quarter was $1bn, on operating revenues up 3 per cent to $5.25bn. Full-year net income improved 20 per cent to $3.94bn, on revenues up 7 per cent to $20.9bn.After decades of making losses or only marginal profitability, US railroads have rebounded strongly over the last decade, helped by tight capacity, booming demand for commodities and high fuel costs for competing modes.Union Pacific has recovered particularly strongly, bringing its operating ratio – the proportion of revenues consumed by costs – from the 80s into the 60s, in line with the industry’s best performers. The fourth-quarter operating ratio was 67.1 per cent, 1.2 points better than in 2011’s fourth quarter.Jack Koraleski, chief executive, said the company’s diverse portfolio of businesses, pricing gains and efficient network operations had produced the results, despite “significantly weaker” coal and grain markets. The year had been the most profitable in the history of the company, founded 150 years ago to link California to the US’s eastern railroad network.The company expected to experience many of the same challenges in 2013 that it had experienced in 2012, Mr Koraleski said. It would also be keeping a close eye on debates over the US budget in Washington, to see how they affected the wider economy.But he went on: “We successfully navigated through the complexities of 2012, and we’ll continue to follow that same strategy going forward.”Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share improved 10 per cent to $2.19, while the full-year figure improved 23 per cent to $8.27.
37;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2012-12-03T23:31:43Z;Weak demand for coal puts rail plan on ice;;Canadian Pacific has put off indefinitely plans to build what would have been the United States’ longest new railway in more than a century, in the latest sign of US railways’ growing scepticism about the future market for thermal coal.The abandonment of the plans for a new, 260-mile long line into Wyoming’s Powder River Basin is the first significant change of strategy for CP since Hunter Harrison became chief executive in June. Shareholders installed Mr Harrison, a respected former chief executive of Canadian National Railway, following a proxy battle. He replaced Fred Green, who resigned in May ahead of the shareholder vote.CP said it would take a $180m pre-tax charge for the fourth quarter for the project’s costs, including what it paid for the option to build the line, land and engineering and other costs already incurred. CP’s shares fell $1.51 in New York to $91.83.CP acquired plans to build the line – the third to serve the coal-rich area – when it bought the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad in 2007. The Powder River Basin has supplied a significant proportion of the thermal coal for the US’s power stations since the mid-1970s, when the Clean Air Act first made it economic to mine its coal. PRB coal produces relatively little energy for every ton burnt but also produces little sulphur, whose emission into the atmosphere the Clean Air Act limited.Railroads have experienced sharp tail-offs in coal volumes this year as low power demand and mild winters have combined with new, cheap supplies of natural gas to send demand for thermal coal plummeting. Some railways expect the change to be permanent.“It is CP’s intention to defer indefinitely plans to extend its rail network into the PRB coal mines based on continued deterioration in the market for domestic thermal coal, including a sharp deterioration in 2012,” CP said.Henry Posner, an investor who closely follows the US rail scene, said there had always been questions about the economics of the PRB plan, because it would be the third rail line into the region, which Union Pacific and BNSF already serve.“There always seemed to be a scepticism within the industry as to how likely it was, even with coal being as strong as it was up until several years ago, that the project made any sense at all,” Mr Posner said.A PRB line would have significantly increased the dependence on coal of CP, one of the North American railways least dependent on the product. Its low coal traffic and strong position in the market to haul domestically-produced US crude oil have made CP a major beneficiary of the shift in North America’s energy supplies.
38;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Norfolk Southern rail hit by fuel switch;;Norfolk Southern, one of the two main railroad operators in the eastern US, broke the industry’s run of robust results when it announced third-quarter net income down 27 per cent as natural gas displaced its coal traffic.NS, which handles coal moving from the Pennsylvania and Kentucky coalfields to power stations, steel mills and ports, also warned the fourth quarter was likely to reflect the weak trends of September.The company, which more heavily depends on coal than any of the eight Class I North American railroads, said on September 19 that its third-quarter figures would be at least 25 per cent down year on year.Wick Moorman, chief executive, said the figures reflected weak market conditions, which had led to falls in shipments of coal and general merchandise.“We remain focused on controlling costs while continuing to provide high service levels for our customers and invest in projects that will support future growth,” he said.Net third-quarter income fell to $402m, from $554m last time, on revenues down 7 per cent to $2.7bn. Earnings per diluted share fell 27 per cent to $1.59.Both CSX, NS’s rival in the east, and Union Pacific, operator of the largest network, have reported significant falls in coal volumes in the third quarter as generators switch to cheap natural gas and Chinese coking coal demand falls. But both CSX and UP largely made up for this in other areas, particularly movements of crude oil from new shale oilfields.However, as well as recording a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in coal volumes, NS suffered from the 27 per cent decline, brought on by low natural gas prices, in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania and New York. Drilling activity generates demand for fracking sand and pipeline parts.Demand for utility coal fell 15 per cent to 225,100 carloads, while demand for export coal, which had been supporting NS’s coal volumes, was down 7 per cent year-on-year and 28 per cent on the second quarter. Coal revenue fell 22 per cent to $701m.Volumes in intermodal services – movements of containers and truck trailers by road – increased 5 per cent, while revenues grew 3 per cent to $567m. Revenue in general merchandise fell 1 per cent to $1.4bn, on traffic down the same amount.The results emerged after close of trading. The shares fell 2.3 per cent in after-market trading to $64.50.
39;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2012-10-18T18:47:55Z;Oil and gas boom boost Union Pacific;;Union Pacific, operator of the largest US rail network, illustrated the industry’s continued robust earning power in the face of the global downturn when it unveiled record quarterly profits despite a sharp fall in coal volumes.Union Pacific, which operates in the two-thirds of the US west of the Mississippi, reported a 15 per cent rise in net income compared with last year’s third quarter to $1.04bn on operating revenues up 5 per cent to $5.34bn.Union Pacific is the second of North America’s big rail operators – known as the Class Is – to report third-quarter figures. There had been an intense focus ahead of the earnings round on the likely effects of sharp drops in demand for coal both for use in domestic power stations and for export. Union Pacific said its coal revenue fell 5 per cent to $1.06bn, while the volumes of coal carried fell 12 per cent to 501,000 carloads.However, Union Pacific benefited more strongly than CSX, operator of the largest network east of the Mississippi, from the boom in crude oil and gas production from shale rock formations. Some railroads have experienced sharp rises in their crude oil traffic as states such as North Dakota, which are unconnected to the US’s oil pipeline network, have emerged as significant oil producers.Union Pacific’s petroleum product traffic rose 95 per cent year-on-year to 62.1m carloads, contributing to an 18 per cent year-on-year increase in chemical traffic. The chemical segment’s revenue rose 17 per cent to $841m.Eric Butler, Union Pacific’s executive vice-president of marketing, said the company had seen a “steady ramp-up” in crude oil volumes throughout the year.“We would see ourselves being able to continue to take advantage of that growth opportunity,” Mr Butler said.Intermodal traffic – truck trailers and shipping containers – rose 1 per cent while revenue from the business increased 8 per cent to $1.02bn. The business had suffered from sluggish US economic growth, Union Pacific said, but continued to benefit from conversions of traffic from truck to rail amid high fuel prices.Tony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said the results were a tribute to a company that following some years of lacklustre performance, had “got its operational momentum back”.“This is very impressive,” he said.Union Pacific was solidly in the second tier of rail beneficiaries from the switch towards new energy sources, Mr Hatch added. It handles significant quantities of oil heading from other railroads’ networks to its customers and large volumes of the sand used in hydraulic fracturing of shale oil and gas wells.Union Pacific’s shares rose 1.4 per cent to $125.43. Diluted earnings per share rose 18 per cent to $2.19, while the company declared a dividend of 60 cents, up 26 per cent.
40;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2012-07-19T18:29:08Z;Union Pacific rolls through coal drop-off;;Union Pacific, the operator of the largest US rail network, reported record quarterly net earnings of $1bn, becoming the latest big railroad to overcome slumping coal volumes to produce strong results.The company, the main rail operator in the western two-thirds of the US, said it also expected record results for the full year, despite growing economic uncertainty.The quarter’s net earnings were 28 per cent up on the $785m reported a year earlier, on operating revenues up 7 per cent to $5.22bn. Diluted earnings per share rose 32 per cent to $2.10.Union Pacific’s shares were 3.8 per cent higher in afternoon trade in New York at $123.10.Jack Koraleski, Union Pacific chief executive, said strong growth in most of the company’s product areas had offset a 17 per cent decline in coal volumes.“When combined with solid pricing, efficient network operations and continued productivity gains, the net result was our best-ever quarter by almost every financial measure,” he said.Railroads have experienced steep declines in demand to move coal, largely because of utilities’ switch to suddenly cheap natural gas. Union Pacific’s coal revenue for the quarter fell 9 per cent year-on-year to $869m.Eric Butler, Union Pacific’s director of marketing and sales, said: “Coal demand remained weak as historically low natural gas prices reduced coal’s share of electricity generation and mild winter weather sent coal stockpiles soaring.”Union Pacific’s results came two days after CSX, operator of the largest railroad network in the eastern US, reported marginally improved second-quarter earnings despite a 35 per cent drop in domestic coal demand. Union Pacific gave no detailed breakdown of the balance between domestic and international demand.Revived demand for US-built cars drove Union Pacific’s automotive traffic up 15 per cent and revenue was up 25 per cent to $475m. Chemical traffic rose 12 per cent, raising revenue 13 per cent to $795m, while industrial product traffic rose 6 per cent, with revenue up 14 per cent to $917m. Both chemicals and industrial products have benefited from traffic in fracking sand, wind turbines and other materials associated with new energy sources.North American rail groups have generally performed strongly during the economic downturn because their fuel efficiency has helped them to win traffic at times of high fuel prices. Union Pacific’s intermodal traffic – trailers and shipping containers that can also go by truck – was 3 per cent up year-on-year, while revenue rose 10 per cent to $1bn. Rail operators have also benefited from growing export demand for US-produced bulk commodities.Mr Koraleski acknowledged that the world economic outlook was growing more uncertain. But he went on: “We are going to continue to take opportunities provided by our diverse portfolio to achieve record full-year earnings.”
41;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-24T00:38:09+0000;Georgian Railway to list in London;;Georgian Railway, which claims to be one of the world’s most profitable rail operations, on Monday outlined plans to become the first quoted state-controlled railway monopoly by listing on the London Stock Exchange.Irakli Ezugbaia, Georgian Railway’s chief executive, said the ex-Soviet state’s government would use proceeds from the listing, expected in May, to invest in the Caucasian state’s infrastructure. An exact date for the IPO – under which Georgian Railway will list global depositary receipts representing 25 per cent of its capital – would depend on market conditions, the company said.Two other railway operators from the former Soviet Union – Globaltrans, a private Russian rail freight operator, and TransContainer, the container arm of Russia’s state-owned rail company – are already listed in London. Georgian Railway will be the first traditional state railway monopoly – with an infrastructure-owning arm and freight and passenger operations – to list its shares anywhere in the world.Mr Ezugbaia said the company was listing itself as an undivided, integrated organisation to mimic the structure of large, North American railroads, such as Union Pacific and CSX. Those companies own their own track, locomotives and wagons, instead of dividing the infrastructure and operations as normally happens in the European Union.“We found that this exact strategy is the way to be oriented to successful growth for the railway operations,” Mr Ezugbaia said.The company’s profitability depends entirely on its handling of freight traffic, particularly oil moving from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan towards western Europe. Freight provided 95 per cent of the company’s $286m revenues for last year, it said. The company earned earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) of $156m and $104m net income last year. The ebitda margin of 54.4 per cent for the year was one of the highest globally, it said.The company had undergone a five-year restructuring to transform its previously Soviet-style management practices, Mr Ezugbaia said. Its organisation was now based on “profit maximisation”, he said.The other ex-Soviet rail companies listed in London all depend on RZD, the Russian state-owned train operator and infrastructure owner, to provide access to its network and, in many cases, to haul their trains. Regulatory rules stipulate how much RZD can charge.However, Georgian Railway will be an unusual example of a listed company enjoying a state-sanctioned monopoly in its industry but allowed to set its own charging levels. Such a position allowed Georgian Railway to maximise shareholder value, Mr Ezugbaia said.“This has to be more interesting for private shareholders,” he said.Mr Ezugbaia downplayed, meanwhile, the risks to the company of a renewal of conflict between Georgia and Russia over the breakaway region of South Ossetia, where the two fought a brief war in 2008. The two had reached an agreement over the region that had allowed Russia to join the World Trade Organisation, Mr Ezugbaia pointed out.

This career has seen her writing – in partnership with David Clark – eight books about Warren Buffett and his investment methodology. The latest, The Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio, was published at the end of last year.In an exclusive interview in the FT magazine Investors Chronicle this week, she claims that private investors can easily emulate Buffett Snr’s approach, if they have patience and a sufficiently long time horizon.“He made $60bn by only investing in the stock market,” she explains. “Everyone can with much less capital still get outstanding returns. Anyone can invest like Warren if you stick to the principles and discipline. It’s not rocket science, but not many people do it.”In her new book, she examines 17 equity investments that have helped him to achieve his extraordinary wealth, and reveals the four basic questions that he uses to identify a company with a durable consumer monopoly:17 Warren Buffett investments with a durable competitive advantage●American Express●Bank of New York Mellon●ConocoPhillips●Costco Wholesale Corporation●GlaxoSmithKline●Johnson & Johnson●Kraft Foods●Moody’s Corporation●Procter & Gamble●Sanofi SA●Torchmark Corporation●Union Pacific Corporation●US Bancorp●Walmart●Washington Post Company●Wells Fargo1. Will the product or service the company is selling today be the same product or service that it will be selling ten years from now? Or, as Warren Buffett puts it: “Take Wrigley’s chewing gum. I don’t think the internet is going to change how people chew gum.” Other examples are Coca-Cola and Kraft.2. Can you understand how the product works? Mary says: “Railroads, ie Union Pacific Corporation; and discount shopping, ie Walmart, are not difficult to understand.”3. Does it take large amounts of research and development to keep the service or product competitive?4. Does the company in question have a monopoly or is it the leading low-cost producer of the product or service it sells? “Predictable products equal predictable earnings,” says Mary.She explains that Warren Buffett likes to view stocks like these as fixed-income investments, because their earnings are so predictable. He calls them “equity bonds”. Once a company’s durable competitive advantage and predictability of earning have been established, the “Sage of Omaha” gauges a stock’s value by how attractively it is priced and the consistent long-term profit he believes it will bear.“We are, as value investors, price-motivated. The lower the price the higher the motivation.“It’s like in High School and you like a guy but he is going out with another girl. You wait and then make your move when they break up,” she explains. “This is the key thing that investors don’t do – know what you want to buy and then wait for it to be sold at a discount.”She advises that investors use the tools that are out there on the internet to evaluate companies. “Don’t think of it as stock. Buying a stock is buying a fractional piece of business.”GlaxoSmithKline is the only London-listed stock among the 17 highlighted companies. “It shows great consistency in earnings and rising per share book value,” she says. “Plus, it has really made its mark with Aids antivirals. For Warren and the foundations he has supported it is a natural.”Moira O’Neill is personal finance editor of Investors Chronicle. Read the full interview in this week's issue on sale now"
43;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2011-10-20T21:14:42Z;Shale oil exploration costs hit Newfield;Regional banks face scrutiny from investors;Shares in oil and gas field developer Newfield Exploration plunged on Thursday, after the company cut its full-year production guidance by 4 per cent because of rising costs at a large shale oil exploration site in the Rocky Mountains.“In response to service cost pressures, Newfield is voluntarily reducing its activities in the Williston Basin,” the company said in its quarterly earnings statement.Newfield shares fell 14.9 per cent to $35.81, as the company said it had cut the number of active rigs at Williston and deferred completion of 13 wells into 2012.“The explosion in shale exploration means there’s a huge demand for completion equipment so costs are rising and margins are being squeezed,” said Robert Morris, at Citibank.The S&P 500 ended a volatile day up 0.5 per cent to 1,215.37, as rumour and counter-rumour about the status of negotiations on the eurozone rescue fund shifted sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent to 11,541.78 but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,598.62.“The economic backdrop today was good,” said Phil Orlando, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. “Unemployment claims were good, the Philly Fed survey was excellent but it’s still Europe that’s moving markets, so we’re staying on the sidelines,” he added.Goldman Sachs put out a downbeat note on “lacklustre” results at regional banks, but highlighted, “the potential for dispersion within the sector and the growing ability to identify outperformers”, as investors judge banks on their ability to grow high margin loan books.Microsoft slipped back slightly in after-hours trading, despite a healthy quarterly earnings report issued after the close of the markets. Sales rose 7 per cent compared with the same period last year to $17.4bn.Fifth Third Bancorp was up 9.1 per cent to $11.63 after the Midwest-focused lender revealed its net interest margin had increased 3 basis points to 3.65 per cent, driven by increased commercial loans.But Huntington Bancshares dropped 6.9 per cent to $4.88 after its net interest margin fell 6bp to 3.34 per cent and it increased its allowance for credit losses to non-accrual loan coverage from 181 per cent to 187 per cent.Money manager Janus Capital Group closed up 1.6 per cent to $6.38, despite revealing that assets under management fell more than 10 per cent during the third quarter. Fund management fees helped push the company’s operating margin up 0.3 percentage points to 31.3 per cent, but investors withdrew more than $2bn from Janus funds while falling asset prices knocked $20bn off AUM.Wynn Resorts fell 5.3 per cent to $123.37, after the company dashed hopes it would pay out a special quarterly dividend, on top of its normal $0.50 payout.Jon Oh, an analyst at CLSA, said Wynn needed to hoard cash as it faces capital expenditure of between $2.5bn and $3bn to build a second casino in Macau.Wynn shares have been highly volatile for the past month on rumours of a slowdown in Chinese corporate junket tourism to Macau.But the company’s third-quarter earnings showed a 41.7 per cent increase in revenues at Wynn Macau compared with the same quarter in 2010, with occupancy robust into October.Personal computer manufacturer Dell fell 5.4 per cent to $15.05 after the world’s leading manufacturer of hard disk drives, Western Digital Corporation, warned that flooding in Thailand could disrupt production for several quarters to come.Western Digital was down as much as 5 per cent in early trading, nearing its tangible book value of $21 – the value the company’s assets would fetch in a fire sale. But the stock rebounded to close the day up 6.2 per cent at $25.96.But Western Digital is still down almost 10 per cent for the week, after the company closed all its Thai plants indefinitely.Memory manufacturers rose on the news, however, on hopes for higher sales of netbooks, which incorporate memory, but do not include hard drives.STEC Inc was up 5.7 per cent to $10.82.Union Pacific Corporation, one of the biggest US railroads, posted record profits of $1.85 a share, although the strong performance was mainly down to higher charges. Its shares were up 4 per cent to $94.59.
44;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2011-10-19T22:46:52Z;Record CSX earnings show strong outlook for US rail;;CSX, the biggest railroad on the US’s eastern seaboard, reported record third-quarter earnings late on Tuesday with revenue growth in all its main traffic areas, in the first sign that US railroads’ strong performance has survived the US economy’s recent weakening.Strong growth in metals traffic and resilient revenue in both coal and container traffic helped to drive net earnings up 12 per cent to $464m, on revenues up 11 per cent on the same quarter last year to $2.96bn.CSX’s results are closely watched because it is the first of the seven large Class I North American railroads– which also include Union Pacific, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern – to announce financial figures.The railroad industry has produced its strongest financial results in decades in recent years as rationalisation in the 30 years since deregulation has combined with strong commodities demand and a shift in traffic from trucks to rail to boost the system’s earning power.Michael Ward, chief executive, said that even as the US economy had moderated, CSX had produced strong financial results while investing in additional resources to strengthen customer service.“This helped position our business, our customers and our communities for growth in the near and long-term,” he said.In intermodal or container traffic, which accounts for 36 per cent of volumes, there was only modest traffic growth because declining traffic to and from ports offset domestic traffic increases. However, it recorded 16 per cent growth to $369 in revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal traffic has benefitted from US truckers’ growing struggles with high fuel prices and driver shortages, which have prompted customers to shift from truck to rail.Volumes of coal, which accounts for 24 per cent of traffic, declined 1 per cent, although revenue per unit increased 16 per cent.The company forecast that growth would continue in the fourth quarter and into 2012 and that demand for export coal would continue to offset declining demand from US electricity generators.“The underlying fundamentals of the business continue to support our aspirations for the future,” Mr Ward said. “The outlook for freight rail transportation remains attractive.”CSX’s operating expenses rose 13 per cent to $2.09bn for the quarter, largely because of a 48 per cent increase to $412m in fuel costs. Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to $0.43.
45;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2011-09-21T23:21:57Z;Alpha sparks fears of coal demand slowdown;;Fresh signs of a slowdown in demand for natural resources emerged as a leading US coal producer warned that it was likely to ship less coal than previously forecast this year because of “unexpectedly curtailed customer activity levels”.Shares in Alpha Natural Resources, which issued the statement, and other US miners, including Arch Coal and Cliffs Natural Resources, fell sharply on Wednesday.Walter Energy, another metallurgical coal producer, was also hit after warning of production delays that meant its output would be lower than expected in the second half of 2011.Metallurgical, or “met”, coal, an essential raw material for steelmaking, is often seen as an indicator of the health of the economy, both globally and specifically in China, which last year accounted for 44 per cent of total world steel production.Indicators of Asian demand for raw materials have generally remained robust. Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest natural resources companies said on Tuesday that markets were “somewhat weaker” and a few customers were asking to reschedule deliveries, but said the slowdown was not spreading into Asia.However, Virginia-based Alpha on Wednesday revised down its guidance for 2011 shipments to 102.5m to109.5m tonnes, compared with its previous range of 104m to112m tonnes, in part because of weaker than expected demand.It also cited other factors, including lower than expected production from some of its mines, including some brought in with the $8.5bn acquisition of Massey Energy agreed at the start of the year.Alpha’s shares dropped 17 per cent to $22.30. Arch fell 11 per cent to $16.12 and Cliffs Natural Resources, which exports coal as well as iron and other materials, was down 13 per cent to $61.55. Walter was down 12 per cent at $66.25.However, some analysts said they did not see any evidence of a general slowdown in demand for raw materials.“All of the metrics that we have show solid demand for metallurgical coal,” said Brandon Blossman, energy analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Holt.Metallurgical coal shipments from US ports were up 7 per cent year-on-year in July, and vessel queues at US coal terminals remain high.The mere hint of a Chinese slowdown was enough to move any stocks related to raw materials. Joy Global, the mining equipment manufacturer, fell 7 per cent to $70.44.Stocks in railroad companies, which transport US coal to ports for export, were also buffeted. Norfolk Southern and CSX were both down 8 per cent, and Union Pacific fell 6 per cent.All three companies have benefited from strong demand for coal, by negotiating individual contracts with miners.James Squires, chief financial officer of Norfolk Southern, said at a conference on Wednesday: “We are getting no such indications that across the board demand is softening for export metal coal.”He added: “We are very bullish on the long-term outlook for US export coal based on the feedback that we have got from our customers and information about global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Lemer
46;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2011-08-22T17:44:58Z;Iowa typifies small railroad success;;Every few miles along the Iowa Interstate Railroad’s route from Council Bluffs, Iowa towards Chicago, two things mark the start of another town. On the track’s northern side, there will be a grain elevator. On its south is generally an unused red-brick passenger station with the words “Rock Island” on the gable end.The stations are a reminder of the present Iowa Interstate’s roots in one of the darkest chapters of US railroad history – the collapse into bankruptcy and eventual closure of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad between 1975 and 1980, amid the railroad system’s then heavy-handed regulation.The current rude health of the route – equipped with the latest General Electric diesel engines, often hauling trains 120 cars long – testifies to the often unheralded success of the US’s hundreds of regional and shortline railroads since the system’s 1980 deregulation. The small, local operations – often spun out of Class Is (a railroad with more than $380m in annual revenue) in the years after deregulation – tend to be far better than the large railroads at understanding small, local customers’ needs and meeting them cost-effectively.According to John Giles, chief executive of Rail America, a listed company operating 43 shortlines across the US, these entities work well when they fit in with the unique needs of the local area’s economy and co-operate with the area’s Class Is to generate new traffic.“We put our heads together and figure out how we can collectively compete,” Mr Giles says.In the Iowa Interstate’s case, Henry Posner, a railway entrepreneur, bought the 592-mile route from the Rock Island’s liquidator in 1984, with backing from local business and government interests.The railroad has benefited in recent years not only from strong demand for the region’s grain but also booming demand for ethanol produced in plants along the line. The company continues to pursue a policy of “industrial development”, persuading factories to set up next to the line, Mr Posner says.Many customers prefer setting up next to a relatively minor railroad, Mr Posner adds, because they can retain a choice about which connecting Class I will handle their long-distance movements.“If a customer on our railroad were shipping to some place in the west, it might well be a destination served by both the Union Pacific and BNSF,” Mr Posner says. “So we would have the effect of creating competition for that customer.”
47;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2011-08-22T17:24:21Z;The biggest North American railroads;;The US and Canadian railroad industry is dominated by the seven “Class I” railroads, most of them formed as a result of a wave of consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s.In order of 2010 operating revenue, they are:1. Union Pacific: $17bnStill operator of the largest route network of any Class I, Union Pacific is also the only one able to trace its history back to the earliest years of the US railroads, having been formed in 1862 to build the eastern end of the historic Iowa to California trans-continental railroad. It was transformed, however, by its 1996 merger with Southern Pacific. Operating west of the Mississippi, UP depends heavily on hauling containers from west coast ports, on hauling coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and transporting mid-western grain and other bulk products.2. BNSF: $16.8bnThe Burlington Northern and Santa Fe is currently most famous for being owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment vehicle, which bought it in 2009. However, the railroad, product of a 1995 merger between Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroads, was already well-known in the industry for running a highly efficient railroad – which now rivals Union Pacific in revenue despite having a smaller network.3. CSX: $10.6bnCSX, operator of the largest railroad network east of the Mississippi, depends heavily on the region’s industrial base for its traffic. The company divided Conrail, the formerly government-owned railroad company, with Norfolk Southern in a 1997 merger.4. Norfolk Southern: $9.5bnOne of the most efficient railroads, Norfolk Southern has the smaller network of the two east-of-the-Mississippi Class Is but has routes more tightly focused on the main sources of traffic and has long generated better returns than its rivals. It is the most reliant of the Class Is on coal, handling coal produced in the Appalachians, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Much of it is exported through the company’s dedicated coal facility at Lamberts Point in Portsmouth, Virginia.5. Canadian National: $8.38bnCanadian National operates a substantial network in the US, as well as its core trans-continental line linking Vancouver and Calgary to the main eastern Canadian population centres.6. Canadian Pacific: $5.05bnCanadian Pacific, operating a network parallel to CN’s, is less profitable than its larger rival but gradually improving.7. Kansas City Southern: $1.81bnSmallest of the US and Canadian Class Is, Kansas City Southern markets itself as “the Nafta railroad”, since its main routes run north to south, linking Canada to Mexico. It also has extensive operations in Mexico and operates the Panama Canal Railway in Panama.
48;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2011-08-22T16:20:42Z;Union Pacific crosses profitability threshold;;The operator of the US’s largest railway network has crossed a key profitability threshold for only the second year in its 149-year history, amid a rebound that has vindicated Warren Buffett’s 2009 gamble on the sector.Rob Knight, finance director of Union Pacific, told the Financial Times that its 2010 returns on invested capital exceeded its cost of capital – a key test that the industry’s regulators and investors consider when deciding how much railways can reasonably charge their customers.UP had until recently been slower than other big railways to catch up to its cost of capital threshold – a mark most railways started missing before the second world war. Last year might therefore have been the first in many decades when nearly all big industry players earned returns strong enough to cover their investment costs.Executives at all four of the biggest US-based railway companies – UP, Burlington Northern & Santa Fe, CSX and Norfolk Southern – told the Financial Times that high road fuel prices were pushing increasing numbers of containers on to rail from road. Some export commodities – including grain heading to China – are also performing well.Mr Buffett, the billionaire investor, earlier this year told shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway investment vehicle that his bet on the industry – his $44bn November 2009 acquisition of BNSF – was working out even better than he had expected.Find out the shunting order of the seven Class I railroads on the continentUP, founded in 1862 to build the US’s first trans-continental rail link, said in its annual filing to the Surface Transportation Board watchdog – which uses different methods from published company results to calculate what rail operators can charge – that it generated returns on invested capital of 11.5 per cent for 2010. Since the STB is all but certain to declare the industry’s cost of capital last year was below 11 per cent, UP will comfortably clear the hurdle.The company, which endured several bankruptcies in its chaotic early years, previously earned its cost of capital only in 1995, the year before its takeover of the financially-troubled Southern Pacific.“In our 150-year history, we’re just now getting close to earning our cost of capital on a book value basis,” Mr Knight said.Anthony Hatch, an independent analyst, said the other big US-based operators had also probably either met or come close to meeting the cost-of-capital test.Mr Knight promised the company would not rest on its laurels, however. Like other railways, UP argues the STB’s calculations overstate its returns, meaning that it still has room to improve.“We’ve got to continue to move the business forward, which is where we’re headed,” Mr Knight said.
49;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-24T01:13:06+0000;Texas rail yard highlights growth challenges;;Beneath the scorching Texas sun at Burlington Northern & Santa Fe’s Alliance intermodal yard outside Fort Worth, orange mobile cranes straddle container trains so long they seem to stretch into infinity. The cranes swing containers from trains to waiting tractors then move on swiftly, reflecting the pressure on a yard whose management is stuggling to cope with 13 per cent year-on-year traffic growth so far this year.There is a similar sense of bustle at many key facilities across the US’s railroad system, still the world’s largest by route miles. US railroads’ container traffic – traffic in boxes that can carry anything from Chinese-manufactured toys to food or chemicals – was up 7.8 per cent in the first half of this year, to 421,241 units, against the same period last year, amid only 1 per cent first-half growth in US GDP. Maru Iabichela, the Alliance yard’s manager, says that there have been instances this year where have been held outside the yard, obstructing a main line, for lack of anywhere to put them.The rows of white trucks belonging to JB Hunt, one of the US’s biggest trucking companies, in the Alliance yard’s truck park illustrated one of the main reasons for the robust growth. Many US trucking companies, suffering from high fuel prices, driver shortages and road congestion, have shifted many long-haul trips to rail, and opted instead to handle only the short-haul trips to and from yards such as Alliance.Railcars carrying some of the in-demand commodities that are also contributing to growth – including grain, soya beans and ethanol – are handled at a neighbouring yard.Ms Iabichela’s most pressing concern is to extend the yard’s truck parking area for the fifth time this year – and to find more workers.“We’ve had to hire more aggressively,” Ms Iabichela says. “With these volumes, we need to be flooding those tracks with people, getting cranes up to trains . . . It’s good times.”Yet the good times for BNSF and other railroads are not solely a result of rising traffic. Rob Knight, finance director of Union Pacific, owner of the largest US rail network, is one of many executives to highlight the importance of efficiency improvements since industry deregulation in 1980.A programme to tackle yard congestion and other productivity problems reduced the proportion of UP’s revenues used up by costs from 81.6 per cent in 2006, to 70.6 per cent in 2010, he says. “It’s really unlocking the motivation of all of our employees,” Mr Knight adds.Investment is also sharply up. Norfolk Southern, the second-largest network in the eastern US, has spent heavily on upgrading its Heartland Corridor between Virginia and Chicago to handle new traffic arriving at eastern seaports. Traffic is expected to grow after 2014, when the expanded Panama Canal will allow shipping lines to introduce new, bigger ships on services from Asia.“We’re willing to make those investments in a way that, 20 years ago when every dollar was tight, we would hold back,” Wick Moorman, NS’s chief executive, says.Uncertainties remain, meanwhile. If expansion to the Panama Canal encourages shipping lines to send more goods to US east coast ports, that could cut out some lucrative, long-distance train journeys eastwards from southern Californian ports for BNSF and Union Pacific.“I think our view is that the Panama Canal will change things, certainly in ways that we’re not sure of,” Mr Moorman says. “But our traffic is going to continue to grow from both directions.”Mr Knight also sounds a cautious note about the growing traffic in “ag” commodities such as grain and soya beans that he acknowledges have boosted both UP’s and BNSF’s traffic this year.“Ag markets have tended to come and go, particularly export markets,” he says.Regulators could also step in if market conditions remain favourable. Hearings this year of the Surface Transportation Board – the industry regulator – have investigated customers’ claims that some railroads are exploiting current conditions to overcharge.Mr Knight of UP, which plans $3.3bn capital expenditure this year, says railroads would reduce expenditure on improving capacity and buying new locomotives if regulators capped returns.Yet there remains a powerful sense that today’s railroads face fundamentally different circumstances from 30 years ago.“They’ve changed from inwardly-focused slow or no-growth engineering companies, to companies who have offices globally,” Anthony Hatch, a veteran industry analyst, says. “[They] look to see where manufacturing changes in Asia, how that’s going to impact trade flows.”The US’s clogged highways, poor public finances and truck driver shortages should ensure the growth that has facilitated that transformation continues, according to Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive.“There’s going to be such a shortage of transportation on the highway side of the sector that the railways are going to have to continue to step up and provide more and more capacity,” he says.

Progress Energy was down 2.1 per cent to $43.075 on the news.iGate, the IT outsourcer, lost ground on deal news, tumbling 10.5 per cent to $17.14 after announcing it was buying India’s Patni Computer Systems. iGate said it would pay $921m to buy a 63 per cent stake in the medium-sized Indian IT group from its founders and private equity firm General Atlantic. The deal represents a 9.4 per cent premium to Patni’s closing price in Mumbai last week.Sara Lee was one of the few stocks to make ground on deal activity,up 4.5 per cent to $18.21 as rumours circulated that the food company was going to be the target of a takeover bid.The S&P 500 closed largely flat, falling 0.1 per cent to 1,269.75, as traders were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the earnings results season that starts this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,637.45 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,707.80.The Vix index, seen as a measure of fear on Wall Street, ticked up, rose 2.5 per cent to 17.56. In late December the index had dropped to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2008, but has since been rising steadily.Investor confidence also continued to be suppressed by fears that the US recovery in 2011 would not be as strong as many had hoped, after weak non-farm payroll data that came out on Friday.“The US employment data for December wrong-footed forecasters. Prior to release of the figures, market expectations of the month-on-month increase in non-farm payrolls had been rising,” said Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities Limited.The figures showed that the US economy created 103,000 non-farm jobs in December, falling short of the consensus forecast of about 140,000.Shares in Alcoa, the aluminium producer, crept up in anticipation of its fourth-quarter results which were due to be released after the closing bell. The figures heralded the start of the results season. Alcoa was up 0.4 per cent to $16.49. The aluminium maker was expected to announce earnings per share of 19 cents, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Education stocks lost ground as Strayer Education, the fourth-largest for-profit education firm by market capitalisation, said enrolment in its university fell 20 per cent in the winter term, prompting fears of a wider drop in student numbers across the US. Shares in Strayer Education tumbled 22.6 per cent to $118.60.

Analysts predicted that the PC component inventory cycle had bottomed out and that the threat from tablet computers was included in the sales outlook.Amazon.com surged 0.7 per cent to $171.99 after the online retailer bought privately owned Quidsi, which owns diapers.com and soap.com. It paid $500m in cash for the company that will help it expand into baby care products.Yahoo rose 1.1 per cent to $16.44 after it was reported that the search engine operator could be exploring a tie-up with AOL. The latter’s shares climbed 4.7 per cent to $26.10.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,223.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.3 per cent to close at 11,406.84, but the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.1 at 2,580.05.Last week, stocks hit their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing and the Republican victory in the House of Representatives. David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comparing the market to last time the S&P 500 broke out above 1,200 in April, said: “There are many fundamental reasons for stocks to rally further.“Higher earnings per share has made the S&P cheaper today than in April. Currently, the S&P is trading at 13.8 times annualised third-quarter earnings per share compared with 15.2 times annualised first-quarter earnings per share in April.“We believe the rising likelihood of Congress passing a tax package before year-end can get the S&P close to 1,300.”Financials fell 0.8 per cent as regional banks continued to suffer since they reported their third-quarter results.The S&P 500 regional banking index slid 0.8 per cent with Regions Financial Corp losing 1.7 per cent to $6.34 and PNC Financial Services declining 1.3 per cent to $57.65.Analysts at Oppenheimer reaffirmed their “overweight” rating for the industrial sector but said they were selectively increasing risk exposure, looking at machinery and road and rail stocks. They said machinery stocks were attractive because they would benefit from new orders and construction spending trends. Analysts at Credit Suisse echoed this recommendation, saying the stocks were cheap.Oppenheimer analysts also said road and rail stocks were expected to increase their sales, earnings and margins at a higher rate than the overall sector in 2011 because of freight volumes and truck tonnage increasing significantly in recent months.The S&P 500 industrials sector lost 0.3 per cent.But manufacturing and construction company Fluor added 2.2 per cent to $55.72 and rail transport stocks CSX and Union Pacific both edged up.CSX rose 0.7 per cent to $62.23 and Union Pacific, which benefited from an upgrade at Credit Suisse, was up 0.8 per cent to $91.98. Also in industrials, Boeing shares fell in spite of a $3.3bn order from Saudi Arabian Airlines for 12 aircraft and were lower by

The rise of 6.5 per cent was helped in recent months by sales of smoothies and its dollar menu but the increase in the US was lower than analysts had forecast. Sysco, which distributes food for the food service industry, fell 2.7 per cent to $29.23 after it reported its earnings were squeezed by higher food and commodity costs."
52;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2010-11-02T20:37:40Z;Better a distant judge than a pliant regulator;Why overseers are so often captured by their industries;"In 1887, Congress passed an act to regulate the US railroad industry. The legislation originated in the demands of farmers and merchants for protection against the “robber barons”.Despite this background, railroad interests supported the bill. Charles Adams, president of the Union Pacific Railroad, explained his reasoning to a sympathetic congressman, John D. Long. “What is desired,” he wrote, “is something having a good sound, but quite harmless, which will impress the popular mind with the idea that a great deal is being done, when, in reality, very little is intended to be done.”On the whole, he got what he wanted. The Interstate Commerce Commission established by the act was chaired by a lawyer with experience of the railroad industry – acquired, naturally, by acting on behalf of his railroad clients. When, a decade later, the Supreme Court ruled that a rate-fixing agreement between railroads was illegal, the ICC was crestfallen: surely, the commission said, it should not be unlawful to confer, to achieve what the law enjoins – the setting of just and reasonable rates. Soon after, Congress approved legislation making it a criminal offence to offer rebates on tariffs the ICC had approved, and the commission thereafter operated as the manager of a railroad cartel.Regulatory capture is the process by which the regulators of an industry come to view it through the eyes of its principal actors, and to equate the public interest with the financial stability of these actors. Sometimes such capture is overtly corrupt, as when regulators are in the past or present pay of the corporations they oversee. The largest contributors to congressional campaign funding are heavily regulated industries such as financial services, pharmaceuticals and energy.Corruption can be more subtle. A politician who looks to a life after politics knows that big companies can offer lucrative consultancies and directorships, but representing the public interest does not. Everyone who works in a regulatory agency knows that if they are well regarded in the industry, they are eligible for jobs in the private sector that are often more rewarding than employment in a public agency.But the most common form of capture is honest and may be characterised as intellectual capture. Every regulatory agency is dependent for information on the businesses it regulates. Many of the people who run regulated companies are agreeable, committed individuals who are properly affronted by any suggestion that their activities do not serve the public good. Few members of the public, by contrast, ever make contact with a regulatory agency; almost always, they are less well informed than the professionals who deal with regulatory issues. It requires a considerable effort of imagination to visualise that any industry might be organised very differently from the way that industry is organised now. So even the regulator with the best intentions comes to see issues in much the same way as the corporate officers he deals with every day. You require both an abrasive personality and considerable intellectual curiosity to do the job in any other way. And these are not the qualities often sought, or found, in regulators.Judges are surrounded by pompous ritual and dress in gowns and wigs, plaintiffs and defendants are not allowed to take them to lunch, and judicial proceedings enforce the law rather than promote economic efficiency. The purpose is to maintain distance between the arbiter and those he must arbitrate between, and to secure a clash of conflicting views.A price must be paid for this judicial detachment. There is a loss of intimacy in knowledge and understanding, and a reduction in subtlety and flexibility of approach that comes from insistence on judicable principles and rigid rules. But the prevalence of regulatory capture is such that it is often a price well worth paying. Charles Adams was prescient in his quick understanding of this issue.johnkay@johnkay.com"
53;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2010-11-02T20:37:40Z;Divided government reveals America’s indecision;Republican victory shows US voters undecided over how to fix their country’s most troubling problems, writes Clive Crook;"On Tuesday, the US electorate spoke pretty clearly about what it does not want. It does not want slow economic growth, continuing financial distress, and persistently high unemployment. A sufficient number of voters also said that they do not want a transformative policy agenda of the kind that Barack Obama has lately dangled in front of the most committed Democrats in an effort to get them to the polls. What voters have yet to decide is what they do want – and therein lies a large problem for their country.Most Democrats are dismissing Tuesday’s results as little more than a complaint about the weak economy. When the economy returns to a healthy pace of expansion, as it eventually will, they think their reformist programme will be popular again – as it was, these Democrats point out, in 2008.This is half-right at best. Lower unemployment would certainly improve the Democrats’ standing, but the view that a buoyant economy would refloat their wider political project underestimates anxiety about Democratic ambitions. Too many voters have decided they misjudged Mr Obama in 2008; too many now see him as a traditional, left-leaning, tax-and-spend Democrat. In the United States, that is still a bad thing to be.A stronger economy might temper this judgement but is unlikely to reverse it. With a little help from tactically purblind Republicans – think Sarah Palin, think Christine O’Donnell in Delaware – Mr Obama might win re-election in 2012, but he will never again inspire the same uncritical enthusiasm, extending well into the centre of the political spectrum, as he did two years ago. Some of that gloss is gone for good.In other words, voters have come to a better understanding of Mr Obama’s goals and powers. Their expectations of him have returned to lower and more plausible altitudes. In the long tradition of divided US government, voters have chosen to weaken him still further by putting his opponents in charge of the House of Representatives. Yet, whatever the validity of their view of the president, voters have not even begun to think seriously about the choices that confront the country. No politician has asked them to, and they have not yet done it of their own accord.The Republican party has taken back control of the House, in a sweep as dramatic as the one that floored the Clinton administration in 1994, but this time without even the pretence of a policy programme. The GOP deplores high public borrowing but wants to cut taxes. The spending cuts needed to make good on that intention are arithmetically, let alone politically, impossible. Republican candidates have promised to protect (if not increase) spending on Medicare, social security, defence, and homeland security.The sad thing is that the public knows this does not add up – just as it always doubted Mr Obama’s claims about the money he would save by making access to health insurance nearly universal. Voters were so keen to check the Democrats that they chose not to question the Republicans’ proposals. In one way, of course, this made sense. The Republicans will not be in charge; they cannot implement their policies, if any, good or bad, without another election.Yet the midterms were a chance to test competing proposals for treating America’s chronic fiscal incontinence and other ills. This long overdue debate has been postponed once again. Soon the US may discover that the issues cannot wait any longer.The writer is an FT columnist"
54;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2010-01-22T01:33:48Z;Drop in coal demand weighs on US rail groups;;The two biggest railway companies in the US on Thursday unveiled results badly affected by declining demand for coal, consumer products and the problems of the US industrial sector.Union Pacific revealed fourth-quarter net income down 17 per cent to $551m on revenue down 12 per cent to $3.75bn, while full-year net income for 2009 fell 19 per cent to $1.9bn on revenue down 21 per cent to $14.1bn.BNSF, number two in the market, saw fourth-quarter net income down 12.8 per cent to $536m on revenues down 15.8 per cent to $3.68bn. Full-year net income was down 18.6 per cent on turnover down 22 per cent to $14bn.The results follow similar figures on Wednesday from CSX, the biggest railway in the eastern US, which announced full-year net earnings down 16 per cent.BNSF’s figures are likely to be the last it announces as an independent company. A shareholder meeting on February 11 is expected to approve the company’s takeover by Berkshire Hathaway, the investment vehicle of Warren Buffett, in a deal valuing the company at $44bn.Mr Buffett called the deal, his biggest takeover, an “all-in wager” on America’s economic future when it was announced in November.Both companies suffered from falling demand for coal, a key cargo for the US’s large railways. Both Union Pacific and BNSF move significant quantities of coal from Wyoming’s vast Powder River Basin for utilities. Union Pacific saw its “energy” shipments – almost wholly coal – fall 22 per cent to $765m for the third quarter, while BNSF saw a fall of 17 per cent to $886m. As well as coal movements, the two railways, which together dominate the US west of the Mississippi River, depend on moving maritime containers from west coast ports to the eastern US. The container business is known as intermodal.The fourth quarter saw a 5 per cent recovery in intermodal volumes for Union Pacific, but revenues in the area were still down 3 per cent year-on-year, reflecting falling yields. Spare capacity and weak demand are driving prices down in a number of areas.BNSF saw revenues from consumer products – which covers intermodal and automotive products – fall 19.8 per cent to $1.14bn for the quarter.Both Jim Young, Union Pacific’s chief executive, and Matthew Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, expressed optimism about 2010. Mr Young said prospects for the year looked better than they did a year ago. Union Pacific’s revenue carloads – the number of loaded railcars (or wagons) moved – were 4 per cent higher in December than in the previous year. Mr Rose said BNSF had seen some volume improvements in the second half of 2009 and expected the gradual recovery to continue.
55;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2010-01-21T20:29:07Z;Train spotty;Investors’ zeal for US railroads comes amid mediocre fundamentals;When Warren Buffett described his $34bn deal for freight railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe as an “all-in wager” on the US economy, it highlighted the utility-like nature of these natural monopolies. But for anyone whose thinking is shorter term than Mr Buffett’s – and this includes nearly everyone – the ride may be dull and uncomfortably bumpy.As an industry with high fixed costs, volumes matter immensely and these are now recovering from an epic decline that sapped a quarter or more of traffic by early 2009. Recent earnings reports by Union Pacific and CSX Corp show that the worst has passed. Some categories like automobiles, which saw traffic rise 50 per cent recently versus a year ago on restocking, are skewing the sense of recovery though. Other categories like coal, the bread-and-butter of most railroads, will remain depressed for some time.Even once the industry gets back to pre-recessionary volumes, railroads will be a proxy for growth rather than the one-way investment bet they were for most of the past decade. Railroads were an industry in crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, but deregulation paved the way for painful consolidation and major efficiency gains. During the past two decades, the ton-miles of freight hauled by America’s large, interstate railroads doubled. Booming trade and high oil prices drove more traffic to energy-efficient railroads, helping turn these once chronic destroyers of capital into a hot sector. In the decade ending in July 2008 the four large US freight railroads had total shareholder returns of between 200 and 350 per cent, handily outpacing equities overall.The easy money has been made though. No longer priced for perfection as they were two years ago, railroads are fairly priced only for those investors prepared for a long, slow haul.
56;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2010-01-20T22:18:54Z;CSX boss warns on US rail legislation;;Investment in US freight railways will fall if proposed federal rail legislation is passed in its present form, the chief executive of the sector’s third-largest company has warned after announcing improved fourth-quarter net earnings.Michael Ward was speaking on Wednesday after CSX, the larger of two big railways in the eastern US, became the first major US-based rail company to announce 2009 results.CSX reported net earnings for the three months to December 25 up 23 per cent over the same quarter of 2008 to $305m on revenue down 13 per cent to $2.32bn. Full-year net earnings fell 16 per cent to $1.15bn on revenue down 20 per cent to $9.04bn.CSX had demonstrated its operating capability by withstanding the worst economic recession of recent times and emerging stronger, Mr Ward said. However, he expressed concern about the potential effects of legislation being debated to strengthen the powers of the Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s regulator.The main railways have long been concerned that tightening regulation could reduce the incentives for large investments in improved infrastructure and rolling stock. Some railway customers – particularly those that have no choice of operator – have complained about steep price rises.CSX is due to make $1.7bn capital investment this year.“We are concerned about threatened federal regulations that will without doubt cut investment in freight rail systems,” Mr Ward said.The company would comply with new federal regulations on rail signalling – expected to cost CSX $750m by 2015.But Mr Ward went on: “At the same time, we see other substantial federal demands on the horizon which could negatively impact the financial health of the industry. The current Senate version of the STB re-authorisation bill is not balanced.”Fuel – one of CSX’s largest outgoings – cost $250m in 2009, down 24 per cent on the year before. However, revenue from fuel surcharges also fell. Revenues and profitability were also hit by a 24 per cent fall in revenues from coal, the single biggest commodity for most freight railways and one of the most profitable cargoes.
57;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2009-11-03T20:42:04Z;Buffett sends important signal in rail move;;When Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s chief aide, addressed the 2007 shareholder meeting of one of the companies in the Berkshire Hathaway group, he was frank about railroad investing. The pair who run Berkshire had been too late to spot a change in the nature of a business they had hated, he admitted.In light of that admission, Berkshire Hathaway’s $26bn bid for Burlington Northern Santa Fe – which values the company at $44bn, including $10bn of debt and the value of the stake Berkshire had accumulated since 2007 – looks like a bold effort to make up for lost time.“We threw out our paradigms, but did it too late,” Mr Munger said in 2007.The question now is what light Berkshire Hathaway’s offer for the railroad company sheds on the wider prospects of a business Mr Munger says he and Mr Buffett had regarded as “terrible” and “lousy for investors”.Henry Posner, who invests in railways worldwide through his Pittsburgh-based Railroad Development Corporation, welcomes the signal the proposed takeover will give to would-be rail investors.“This is the highest vote of confidence any company can have,” Mr Posner says.The BNSF takeover conforms to many of Mr Buffett’s famous rules of investment. The company has some of the most highly regarded managers in the US railroad sector, led by Matthew Rose, chief executive. BNSF management invested heavily in improving capacity earlier this decade, at a point when most investment analysts doubted it was worthwhile.The result was that, when Union Pacific, the other main railroad in the western US, suffered severe congestion during a surge in container traffic in 2004, BNSF handled the traffic far more easily.“They are extremely well run,” says Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst.BNSF also faces far fewer competition problems than many railroads have faced in recent years. Railroads compete strongly against trucking companies, which labour with higher fuel and labour costs. A wave of consolidation in the sector – Burlington Northern merged with the Santa Fe railroad in 1995 – has left two major operators.Mr Buffett’s move also comes amid an economic downturn that has shown the profitability of the bigger rail companies to be resilient. While the profitability of many transport operators has slumped, BNSF’s third-quarter figures, announced on October 22, showed operating income down only 25.3 per cent on the same quarter in 2008, to $901m. This was in spite of a 27 per cent fall in the third-quarter freight revenue to $3.49bn.“There are still people out there who believe the rail industry is obsolete and slowly dying,” Mr Hatch says, but adds: “That’s not been true for 15 years.”The deal is unlikely to run into the regulatory problems that have held up other railroad mergers. Thomas Hund, BNSF’s finance director, told investors yesterday that, because Berkshire Hathaway controlled no other railroads, the Surface Transportation Board, the regulator, should not need to get involved.According to Mr Hatch, the deal also suggests Mr Buffett is unconcerned at the prospect of more rigorous railroad regulation under Barack Obama’s presidency. Concerns over such prospects have increased since February, when BNSF was ordered to pay $100m reparations to Western Fuels, a coal customer, and cap its rates to the customer for 16 years.Instead, Henry Posner argues, the transaction could encourage BNSF to take a longer-term view of investment in capacity – potentially improving its service to its customers.The wider impact of Mr Buffett’s move remains unclear, however. Other companies among the big four US railroads saw share price rises on yesterday’s news. Main rival Union Pacific rose 6.8 per cent, while Norfolk Southern rose 2.4 per cent and CSX 6 per cent. Investor interest is frequently boosted when Mr Buffett makes a major move in a sector, Mr Hatch says.But few investors now are likely to find the resources for as ambitious a bid.His conversion to believing in the merits of railroad investing is unlikely to remain unique, but his ability to swallow large operators might be, according to Mr Hatch. “I don’t think there are a lot of other private investors who can afford this kind of price, particularly in the current environment.”

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it would acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-biggest US railroad by revenue, for $26bn in cash and stock.The deal valued Burlington Northern at $44bn, pushing its shares up 27.5 per cent to $97. Berkshire gained 1.7 per cent to $100,450. The takeover, which is the biggest acquisition made by Berkshire, prompted a rally in other US rail companies, pushing Union Pacific up 7.9 per cent to $59.41 and CSX up 7.3 per cent to $45.97.Stanley Works was up 10.1 per cent at $49.69 after the tool supplier announced after the closing bell on Monday that it would buy Black & Decker for $3.46bn in stock.Encouraging data on September factory orders also helped push stocks higher, lifting the market into positive territory and prompting a late recovery in financial stocks. After early losses, Bank of America closed 1.2 per cent higher at $14.80 while Citigroup gained 1.3 per cent to $4.04.However, investors re-mained cautious before today's closing comments from the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting.The S&P 500 finally closed 0.2 per cent higher at 1,045.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 9,771.91 and the Nasdaq gained 0.4 per cent to 2,057.32.""The downgrade on Intel is weighing on the market somewhat but the big story is Berkshire buying Burlington Northern,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon. ""The M&A [activity] fortifies the notion that corporate America is feeling good about the prospects of economic growth next year and the factory orders were also another plus point for the economy.""Cognizant Technology Solutions also helped to mitigate losses in the technology sector after reporting better results than expected from the third quarter and raising its full-year profit forecast. Its shares were up 8.2 per cent to $41.97.Synchronoss Technologies, the communications software maker, gained 12.2 per cent to $13.02 after posting a 34 per cent rise in quarterly earnings owing to strong demand from wireless carriers.Viacom, which owns the MTV Networks and Paramount film studios, posted profits above expectations after video-game sales and box office hits including Transformers helped the company overcome a slump in advertising revenues. The shares gained 1.3 per cent to $30.17. A late recovery in oil prices also helped lift energy stocks into positive territory before the closing bell.However, Johnson & Johnson weighed on the market after it announced a significant restructuring plan. The healthcare company said it would cut up to 7 per cent of its global workforce, or 8,000 positions, generating savings of between $1.4bn to $1.7bn in 2011. Its shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $58.93.Ferro, which produces materials such as enamel and plastic compounds, fell 6 per cent to $5.60 after announcing the pricing of a common stock offering."

The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.7 per cent lower at 2059.61.Investors have lately been leery of buying into signs of a stronger economy, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“Early on it was a reluctance to believe in the recovery,” he said. “As people become more convinced about the recovery, they really remain concerned about how far the markets have moved.”Third-quarter corporate earnings announcements on Wednesday sent mixed messages on the economic recovery.Among the stocks most punished was Goodyear, the tyremaker, whose revenues declined 15 per cent in the quarter. It dropped 19.6 per cent to $13.46 as the group indicated that its North American business faced struggles.International Paper declined 3.5 per cent to $21.83 after telling investors that seasonally weak demand would render “significantly lower” results in the final quarter of the year from the past quarter.A report that sales of new houses in the US fell a surprise 3.6 per cent in September also damped market sentiment. Shares of Lennar, a builder, fell 7.5 per cent to $12.63.Energy stocks felt pressure. US coal miner Massey Energy sank 8.5 per cent to $28.66 as weak demand from power plants triggered a profit drop. Rival Peabody Energy was 6 per cent lower at $39.64.ConocoPhillips, the first big US oil producer to report results this week, was down 2.8 per cent at $49.49 after announcing a 71 per cent drop in profit to $1.5bn, or $1 a share.A steep decline in crude futures on Wednesday also dented its shares.Financial stocks sputtered. Insurer Genworth Financial fell 7.6 per cent to $8.69 while insurer MBIA fell 8.2 per cent to $4.02.Meanwhile, card payment processor Visa rose 3.6 per cent to $76.57 after beating profit forecasts and indicating that consumer spending could be firming up.The Commerce Department reported orders for long-lived goods from US manufacturers rose 1 per cent last month, marking a reversal from a decline in August.“Through the month-to-month volatility, the improvement in manufacturing activity is evident across a large number of reports, and this is another one that fits into that picture,” analysts at RDQ Economics wrote in a note.Yet industrial stocks did not reflect optimism. US Steel fell 5 per cent to $35.53 after its quarterly loss announced this week was followed by disappointing results at ArcelorMittal, the largest steelmaker. Aluminium group Alcoa fell 6.9 per cent to $11.93.Norfolk Southern, the fourth-largest US rail transporter, rose 0.4 per cent to $46.25 after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings late on Tuesday. Rail company Union Pacific rose 0.7 per cent to $55.45.Among the handful of initial public offerings this week, Vitamin Shoppe, a US health supplement retailer, which was priced at $17 a share, ended its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a bang at $17.95 a share.Addus HomeCare, which provides home health care, traded 15.1 per cent below its initial offer price of $10 a share.Telecoms gained.

61;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-24T01:15:21+0000;The wilderness of Sun Valley;;"That’s where they are!” my companion cried, as she pointed vaguely towards the Idaho mountains all around us. “Up there is where the sheep-herders are, and they’re all Basques, and they’ve got donkeys up there, and they live as nomads with their sheep, and they move about with the seasons!”It all seemed unlikely to me, as we sat with lemonades on a terrace of one of the most luxurious resorts in the US – and in fact she was incorrect in detail. The sheep-herders have horses, not donkeys, and since most of the Basque shepherds are now settled in comfortable houses in the valleys, Latin American employees herd the sheep for them. It is perfectly true, though, that up there, in the 21st century, almost within sight of our chaises longues, nomadic Peruvian herdsmen live according to the immemorial demands of transhumance – high in the summer, lower down when winter comes.Idaho, one of the least densely populated of all the American states, is rich in paradox and surprise. We were indulging ourselves that morning at the Sun Valley Resort, by the Big Wood River near the heart of the state, and this celebrated pleasure-place is itself an astonishment.The Union Pacific Railroad company founded the resort in 1936 simply as a destination, because it needed somewhere in these almost empty parts of the US to take its profitable passengers. Advised by an Austrian count who was in its employ, the company hit upon the valley of the Big Wood River, among the northern Rocky Mountains, as a likely site. In no time at all it had a name and was fitted up with lodges, golf courses, Austrian ski instructors and the world’s first chair-lifts (based upon a banana transporter).Fashionable America flocked to Sun Valley, basking in the company of Clark Gable, the Kennedy clan, Ernest Hemingway and the Shah of Iran, and the wandering shepherds in the hills found themselves looking down upon the glitz.By now, of course, Sun Valley has infected the valley around it – which, seen from the air if one flies in across the wide salt flats of Utah, really does look, as its publicists maintain, like another Shangri-La among its forests and bare brown mountains. The hick mining and gambling town of Ketchum was the only nearby settlement when Sun Valley erupted. Now it has elegant shops and sophisticated bookstores, gourmet restaurants and environs littered with the villas of the rich and famous.But in half an hour the highway will transport you northward into wilderness. The very place names are lonely, windswept, romantic – Salman River, known as “the River of No Return”, the Sawtooth Wilderness, Hell Roaring Lake, White Cloud Peaks and Donkey Hills. You are barely clear of the Sun Valley golf tees than the terrific line of the Sawtooth Mountains faces you – a crest of jagged peaks, 10,000ft high, snow-flecked all the year and so formidable that when I first came to these parts, only 60-odd years ago, my guidebook described them as “still partly unexplored”.For this is rough mountain country, dominated by its highlands, and proud of it. An old Idaho joke says that if its peaks could be flattened out it would be the biggest state in the Union, instead of the 14th biggest. Few foreigners know just where it is; many Americans, if asked, have to think hard. In winter Idaho is the coldest place in the republic – if you don’t count Alaska – and in some settlements, I am proudly told, temperatures are below freezing on an average 280 days in every year. It took generations of rugged adventurers to open up this country. Only in 1934 was route 75 to the north made available for passenger traffic.Nowadays, the road takes me easily enough through the heart of Idaho, and tourism has long displaced gold mining in these parts. Even so, the days of the pioneers seem close. At the isolated settlement of Stanley (a couple of unpaved streets and a population of 100) the Sawtooth Interpretative and Historical Association offers a historic walking tour, and its high points include the Ace of Diamonds Club (1921) which isn’t there any more, the Shaw Cabin (1902), named for the second family to homestead in the upper Sawtooth Valley, the Rod’n’Gun Club (1936) where there used to be a sign at the door telling customers to “check gun and knife at door”, and the Casino Club (1935), which gave up being a real casino when Idaho gambling was outlawed in the 1960s, and is now a restaurant trendily called the Kasino Club. At The Bakery in Stanley, where I stopped off for a most delicious light lunch, a line of aprons was drying on a line above the cooking range, and very pioneer-like it seemed.“Wait, there’s more!” cries the Sawtooth Interpretative and Historical Association’s walking tour at the end of its leaflet, and so there is. Stanley is delightful in its rawness, but in the stunning empty country all around there are marvellous sights to see. There are herds of black cattle on valley ranches. There is the Salmon River, full of trout too, curling its lordly way through the valleys. There are ghost towns up inaccessible creeks. Near a settlement called Sunbeam there is a monstrous mechanism called the Yankee Fork Gold Dredge, a high towering thing of engines and buckets, big as an office block, which for 13 years, night and day, scooped up gold from the Yankee Fork valley, until in 1953 the gold ran out and the clanking leviathan was abandoned (it had dug out $1m worth of gold, and it cost just about a million to get the thing there).There are elk about here sometimes, and wolves, and ospreys. I didn’t see any of them, but as I stood contemplating the poor old Gold Dredge a big bird flew over me, making a melancholy mewing noise. A pioneer-type lady standing nearby told me it was an eagle. “One of our natives”, she said it was, which made it sound like an oyster, I thought.“Was that all you saw?” asked my companion when I returned to Sun Valley. “No sheep? No shepherds?” Not a solitary Peruvian herdsman, I replied, let alone a black-hatted Basque. But the wildlife back in Sun Valley was exotic enough for me. What all-American sights there were to see in that splendiferous retreat! What energy! What enthusiasm! Mighty breakfasts were eaten, gallons of coffee were drunk, car after car set off for the golf-links loaded with jolly, handsome men and talkative sun-visored wives. “You haven’t met my boy Jack, he’s joining us for the weekend from Stanford.” “Do tell me, darling, what is that heavenly perfume?” “Hey, Teddy, come with us!” In and out they go, laughing, carefree, while streams of adorable small children in helmets are shepherded around cycle tracks, and on the all-year championship skating rink, just below our terrace, graceful adolescents perpetually swoop and pirouette.No, no nomads are to be seen on the surrounding hills (in which Clint Eastwood made Pale Rider – “he has a home here, you know”), but there’s a Peruvian restaurant down the road in Ketchum, in an elegantly adapted railroad car.Jan Morris is the author of more than 40 books.

62;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2009-06-30T18:55:41Z;Time will tell;;"Martin Thomas is at the forefront of a shift in working habits sweeping the world. The product manager at British Airways has just decided to take a month off without pay this summer and then work part-time for the following 14 months – and that is precisely what the lossmaking airline wants.“It was an opportunity to give some focused time that I wouldn’t have been able to commit to if this opportunity hadn’t presented itself,” says Mr Thomas, who will help his parents set up a charity in Wales as well as enjoying more time with his wife and two daughters.Thousands of people like Mr Thomas around the world are looking ahead to a summer of unpaid leave or fewer working hours as employers try out a raft of methods to counter the deep recession. Companies across the spectrum – from Cartier in luxury goods to BBVA among the banks and KPMG in professional services as well as Union Pacific, the rail operator, and ArcelorMittal in steel – have looked at ways to cut costs without axing jobs. Their aim is to ride out the downturn with as much talent intact as possible.But are such examples merely eye-catching quirks while the rest of the corporate world continues to use the rather blunter instrument of simply firing people, or do they highlight a new way of working?Employers in the UK, for one, say something fundamental has changed. “There has been a remarkable solidarity of employers and their employees during this recession in taking difficult decisions,” says John Cridland of the CBI employers’ group. A CBI survey showed nearly two-thirds of employers were introducing changes such as flexible working hours, extended shutdowns, extra holidays or cuts in paid overtime – in addition to widespread pay freezes – as they struggle to retain skilled employees they will need in an upturn.At BA, nearly 7,000 of its 40,000 staff have offered to take unpaid leave, part-time or unpaid work, including 800 who volunteered to work for nothing for up to a month. KPMG, the professional services firm, asked staff to volunteer for a four-day week or take a sabbatical of up to 12 weeks on one-third of salary. (The Financial Times is offering staff an extra week or more of holiday at 30 per cent of pay.)To some extent, this is the white-collar sector finding ways of doing what manufacturers have always done – cutting shifts and mothballing plants – but in industry too it has gone deeper. Honda not only shut its Swindon car plant west of London for four months: when shop-floor workers came back, they also agreed to a 3 per cent pay cut, reductions in hours and measures for some surplus staff to take jobs at nearby suppliers.“The whole concept of flexibility, working different hours and part-time working is seen as more acceptable than it was,” says David Yeandle, head of employment policy at the EEF manufacturers’ organisation.Not everyone thinks staff are doing it for love of the company. “The claim that it represents some different ethos at work is just ridiculous,” says Adam Lent, head of economics at Britain’s Trades Union Congress. “It’s the hard facts of a recession that are making people agree to these arrangements.”John Philpott, chief economist at the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development in London, says one reason for the trend is that workforces are leaner: there is less fat to cut. Also, employers remember they sacked too many in the last recession, in the early 1990s, and found themselves short of talent. Albert Ellis, of Harvey Nash, a recruitment consultancy, sees the attitudes of “Gener-ation Y”, those born between the late 1970s and 2000, as a further factor. “They are less loyal, less committed to the job for life, but far more flexible,” he says.How much difference this is making to unemployment is debatable. Joblessness in the UK has so far risen to 2.26m, or 7.2 per cent of the workforce – tracking almost exactly the early stages of the deep recession of the 1980s. Mr Cridland argues that without the shorter hours, the increase would have been even worse.Rachel Campbell, head of people at KPMG, hopes its scheme will encourage a permanent shift to more flexible and family-friendly forms of employment. That, however, appears to be a matter of giving a modest boost to a long-term trend that is continuing during the recession. In most companies, people will revert to their former hours after the downturn.Otherwise, says Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital: “From an economic point of view it reduces the long-term potential rate of growth of the economy. But while there is a weakness in demand it allows people to adjust their work-leisure balance.”Overall, he sees such measures as encouraging. “If somebody is made redundant, there is a major loss of embedded human capital. If there is a way of hanging on to that without a lot of costs, then that has to be good.”Continental Europe offers fewer examples of working-time innovations. The most prominent are BBVA, the Spanish bank that offered its 30,000 domestic staff the chance to take as much as five years’ leave at 30 per cent of pay, and KLM, the Dutch airline that asked pilots to cover the work of baggage handlers among other jobs. Such approaches are used less than elsewhere because government-funded schemes allow companies to introduce subsidised short-time working. Faced with a dip in demand, businesses can send workers home and governments will pick up the large part of the tab for a set period, which in Germany is up to two years. The effects are profound. In Germany, 1.25m were on short-time working in March against 3.45m unemployed. About a third less time is being worked, so authorities reckon that without short-time the unemployment figure would be close to 4m; 200,000 workers were on a similar scheme in France in the first quarter compared with 3.7m unemployed.Are governments simply massaging the unemployment figures? Not really, says Andrew Watt at the European Trade Union Institute. “We know there are hiring and firing costs, so it does make sense to keep people in the company in terms of talent. But there is no doubt that the de facto German unemployment rate is much higher.”Grohe, a German maker of bathroom fittings, started by drawing down on time and holiday “accounts”. These allowed Grohe to “pay for” overtime worked in the boom times with time off. After that it placed workers on short tim e. “It is a great tool. It is fantastic because it keeps our costs down but allows us to keep our trained workers,” says David Haines, chief executive of the private equity-owned group.In Switzerland, Cartier put 200 factory workers on short time earlier this year and they received 95 per cent of pay for not working. Hungary, Slovenia and Portugal have introduced short-time schemes recently, according to Mr Watt. Finnair, the struggling Finnish airline, introduced staggered layoffs, sending two-thirds of its 9,000 workers home for an average of two weeks.But some question whether such schemes will work in the long term. Even the European Central Bank has waded into the debate, saying short-time working will delay the recovery. It argues that if the downturn is short-lived such schemes can be “efficient tools” but “over time, these measures generate a major fiscal burden without creating incentives for investment to foster recovery”. Jorma Ollila, chairman of Nokia and Royal Dutch Shell, frets about the impact on national budgets: “It is a costly way for governments to buy time.”Mr Watt counters by emphasising the differences between a country such as Germany, more reliant on short time, and Spain, where unemployment has soared close to 20 per cent after a slew of temporary contracts was terminated: “It shows the stabilising factor of some of these labour market institutions.”In the US, the number of people working for fewer than 35 hours a week because of “economic reasons, slack work or business conditions” has soared since the recession started. According to Department of Labor statistics for May, economic reasons led to 2.8m people over 16 who would normally work full-time working less than 35 hours a week – up 50 per cent from a year ago.Those numbers will be boosted over the summer, as more cash-strapped state and city governments announce working-time reductions for their employees. In California, state university employees, including academics, are among 238,000 facing the prospect of two fewer days’ work a month. In Hawaii, the state employees’ union is fighting a proposal to lay off workers for three Fridays a month over the next two years. In Michigan, state employees will work six days less over the summer. Broadly, state employees’ unions have accepted “furloughs” – periods of unpaid leave – as an alternative to either permanent wage cuts or workforce cuts.In the private sector during previous recessions, furloughs were associated with large manufacturers. Cyclical businesses such as railways and airlines have also historically laid off staff temporarily at periods of slack demand but hired them back when business improves. Union Pacific has about 5,000 people on furlough but is keeping about 1,600 of them in a higher state of readiness to return to work, after being caught out by a surge in demand in 2004. Allegheny Technologies, a speciality metals producer, is running its plants only half the time and furloughing its staff for the rest of the month.“You say, ‘Well, gee whiz, why don’t you just lay people off?’” Pat Hassey, Allegheny’s chief executive, told Wall Street analysts recently. “There’s a two-edged sword to that. One is, you don’t operate as effectively if you’re running shorter volumes and shorter shifts. And secondly, all those people that leave over time lose their healthcare, lose a lot of things.”Dick Beatty, professor of human resource management at Rutgers University, says that while furloughs have been a feature of past recessions, “what is new is the creativity with which firms are using them”.The division here is between the US and UK, where creative forms of shorter hours are flourishing without government intervention, and continental European countries with state-subsidised short-time schemes. The latter are more effective in the short term in restraining unemployment. The former fit in with a longer-term trend – certainly in Britain – towards more flexible, family-friendly working patterns that are likely to continue, even if most of the current arrangements do not outlast the recession.At British Airways, Mr Thomas is thinking of the more immediate future. He says: “The first priority of my unpaid leave is to recharge the batteries …I’m also hoping that my month off coincides with some rather nice summer sun.”"
63;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2009-03-16T22:33:59Z;US rail freight finally starts to hit the buffers;;"North America’s railways appear finally to be experiencing the full force of the economic downturn after freight volumes fell 14.5 per cent in February against the previous year and some of the biggest operators reported still worse figures.The falls come amid growing fears that regulators are growing tougher with operators, following a record fine for Burlington, Northern and Santa Fe, the market number two, over the treatment of a customer.The largest US and Canadian railways – known as the Class I – had previously proved more resilient than other segments of the
economy to the economic slowdown.Anthony Hatch, an independent rail analyst, said he still believed the industry would survive the downturn better than many others. But traffic falls of the kind currently being experienced had last been seen in 1982.He said: “In the fourth quarter, the railroads were able to avoid being part of the real world. In the first quarter of 2009, this isn’t true.”Some of the most dramatic falls overall in February, according to the Association of American Railroads, were in motor vehicles carried – which were down 51.5 per cent compared with February 2008 – metal products (down 52.2 per cent) and grain (down 18.7 per cent).The falls reflected falling demand for cars and other manufactured goods, as well as waning demand for ethanol, which had been a big driver of grain traffic.Since the end of February, Union Pacific, the largest railway by revenues, has announced that traffic was down still further – 19 per cent – for the first week of March, against the equivalent week of 2008.Announcing the gloomy February figures, John Gray, senior vice-president of the AAR, made a plea for the industry to be granted some of the economic stimulus funds being spent by the new US administration.As private businesses, railways have traditionally had only fairly modest state funding.“Obviously, it’s still a very difficult economic environment out there for railroads and their customers,” he said.The railways’ gloom has been deepened by a judgment in February against BNSF by the Surface Transportation Board, the industry regulator, over complaints brought by Western Fuels, a utility that used the company to ship coal from the Powder River Basin coalfield.Having once ruled in 2007 that the railway’s charge for the service was reasonable, the board announced last month it would require BNSF to pay Western Fuels $100m reparations and would cap its rates on the service for 16 years, losing the company future revenues of $245m at present values.The judgment – which BNSF fiercely criticised – will add to concerns that have been growing in recent years that regulators could get tougher with railways over competition issues after recent years’ strong demand and rising prices on competing modes allowed them to raise rates.Railways argue that, since returns for most only just exceed their cost of capital, prices cannot be excessive."
64;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2009-02-08T22:33:18Z;US rail companies steam through the downturn in profit;;North America’s principal rail companies underlined their growing resilience and pricing power by reporting improved operating profits for the quarter when the economic downturn started in earnest.Over the past three weeks, the four biggest US-based operators – Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX and Norfolk Southern – all reported improved operating profits for the quarter compared with 2007, in spite of sharp volume falls in some commodities.Anthony Hatch, an independent railroad analyst, said the last quarter’s figures showed the companies had continued to enjoy the power to maintain prices they developed in the years of strong growth between 2003 and 2007.In the past, railroads were often forced to slash their rates during a recession to win traffic from trucking companies and keep the cash flow necessary to service their debts.“In the fourth quarter, we went from a slowdown to a complete collapse in demand,” Mr Hatch said. “Railroads responded with a good quarter. It’s further evidence that the rail renaissance, as I call it, is actually happening.”Railroads’ finances have improved as growing traffic levels have filled up the available capacity of their networks. For many, that has raised the returns on investments in new capacity above the cost of the capital required for the first time in more than 60 years.Even in areas where demand fell in the fourth quarter, revenue generally fell less than traffic. BNSF, which with Union Pacific dominates rail traffic in the western two-thirds of the US, saw volumes of automotive traffic – mainly new cars – fall 28.6 per cent between the last quarters of 2007 and 2008. But revenue per unit moved rose 20 per cent. Similarly, international inter-modal traffic – shipping containers moving between ports and end-customers – fell 11 per cent but revenue per unit moved rose 5.9 per cent.The companies’ pricing power was still more evident in the areas where demand remained strong. Norfolk Southern, which depends on coal mined in West Virginia and Pennsylvania for about a quarter of its revenues, benefited both from steady domestic demand for power station coal and continuing export demand. Coal volumes in the fourth quarter were up 5 per cent on the previous year, while revenues rose 33 per cent to $798m.However, according to Mr Hatch, demand for railroads to move containers within North America could be a still more positive long-term sign. Many observers had believed growth in recent years in the segment was dependent on high fuel prices, which made it cheaper for trucking lines to send goods by train for most of their trips.The only slight falls in volumes in the fourth quarter, when fuel prices fell substantially, suggest that instead a long-term shift of such traffic from road to rail is under way.
65;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;US railroads on track;;The US economy may be going off the rails, but don’t tell that to the men who make the trains run on time. It would seem the four big freight railroad companies that haul much of the industrial output and deliver commodities from coast to coast would be the first to feel the pain of the sharp downturn. Instead they are thriving. Recent quarterly reports for Norfolk Southern, CSX, Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe revealed an average of 29 per cent earnings per share growth versus the same period a year ago, with all four beating consensus forecasts and issuing mostly upbeat guidance.This stands in stark contrast to the ailing trucking industry or indicators such as the Baltic Dry index, measuring bulk shipping rates, which is off 90 per cent since June. The reason for the huge discrepancy is the quasi-monopolistic nature of railways and long-term tariff agreements. The sector’s return on equity climbed enough to attract Warren Buffett’s interest in BNSF last year.Since 1980, when the industry was partially deregulated and emerged from decades of decline, it has seen volumes rise and productivity increase amid falling tariffs. Tight capacity has allowed railways to raise prices the past few years but rates per-ton-mile are 54 per cent less in real terms than in 1981. That means rail remains extremely competitive versus trucks.All the big railways see easing volumes next quarter, having taken a hit from the slumping housing, auto and chemical industries. Next year they may even face some weakness in cash cows such as coal and grains, while expensive new safety mandates are also a concern. Railway shares’ relative outperformance does not make them expensive though.

Dow Chemical, Altria and Eli Lilly were up 10.5 per cent to $24.43, 1.5 per cent to $19.58 and 4.3 per cent to $33.48, respectively, after overshooting analyst estimates.However, the S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 908.11 points having swung between losses of 4.3 per cent and gains of 2.9 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent higher at 8,691.25 points but the Nasdaq Composite Index ended 0.7 per cent down at 1,603.91 points.Financials were one of three sectors to drag on the market, down 0.9 per cent. Goldman Sachs tumbled 5.3 per cent to $108.58 after it emerged that the bank was planning to cut 10 per cent of its workforce in response to the deteriorating environment.The sector was also hit by further stress in money markets after signs of improvement this week. The rate at which banks lend to each other over the long-term rose for the first time since the fresh round of government intervention in the banking system this month.General Motors lost 1.5 per cent to $6.10 after it emerged that the group was to begin involuntary lay-offs.The news from Goldman and GM came after first-time unemployment benefit data jumped more than forecast. “There is every reason to expect hiring to drop in the wake of the disaster in the stock markets and the continued tightening of credit,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics.The rise came after the benchmark S&P 500 index fell to a fresh five-year low in the previous session after poor figures from companies such as AT&T and Boeing.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose as much as 14 per cent, to 79.43, which continued to signal a heightened level of distress. It had fallen as much as 7.5 per cent in the session.Alan Greenspan, former Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress that the global financial crisis was a “once-in-a-century credit tsunami” and he foresaw more
lay-offs.Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said that this quarter, companies could no longer “have good earnings and expect that your stock’s going to go higher”.Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 18.5 per cent to $9 after the soft-drink bottler and distributor lowered its profit forecast for the year, while the consumer discretionary sector was another key weight on the market, off 0.5 per cent.Homebuilders were among the hardest hit sectors. Pulte Homes dropped 18.5 per cent to $8.11 after posting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.Online retailers tumbled in sympathy with Amazon, which earlier rose as much as 1.8 per cent to $50.91 after the group lowered guidance for the fourth quarter. It ended the session 0.7 per cent higher at $50.32 while Ebay rose 1.9 per cent to $15.32.Xerox slid 3.4 per cent to $7.71 after the office supplier posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.Energy was the biggest winner, up 6.6 per cent overall, helped by oil’s edge towards $70 a barrel as well as positive results in the sector. National Oilwell Varco advanced 9.4 per cent to $26.78 after profit topped forecasts.Chevron and Exxon Mobil jumped 8.2 per cent to $66.77 and 9 per cent to $70.39, respectively. Transportation stocks enjoyed an early boost on the back of well-received earnings.Union Pacific, one of several hard-hit railway stocks, jumped 2.4 per cent to $58.25 after the railway company unveiled better-than-expected results.United Parcel Service gained 3.8 per cent to $48.13 after its drop in profit was not as bad as feared.Amgen climbed 11.8 per cent to $55.55 after the world’s largest biotechnology company forecast optimistic full-year earnings on the back of a fivefold increase in quarterly profit.In technology, Microsoft, which lost 7.8 per cent in the previous session, recovered 3.7 per cent to $22.32 ahead of results due after the bell."
67;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-10-03T18:45:53Z;US stocks falls after bail-out approval;;"US stocks took scant comfort from Congressional approval of the $700bn bail-out plan, suffering their worst week since September 2001.Traders snapped up stocks ahead of the bill’s anticipated passage yet sold off sharply after the event.The vote ended a week in which concerns grew that the essential closure of the credit markets would erode company earnings by denting their ability to raise funds.Financials, up as much as 4.9 per cent in early trading, ended the New York session down 4 per cent, leading a wide-ranging decline in share prices.Banks had led the market higher by 3.6 per cent after Wells Fargo agreed to acquire Wachovia, demonstrating that deals could still be struck in the crisis-hit sector without the need for government assistance.Wachovia soared 63.7 per cent to $6.40 as the deal valued Wachovia at just over $7 per share. Wells Fargo fell 1.7 per cent to $34.56. Citigroup, which was poised to acquire Wachovia’s banking business earlier in the week, said it would oppose the new deal. Citigroup’s shares tumbled 18.4 per cent to $18.35.Housing-related stocks were among the worst hit as fears grew over the health of the economy. CB Richard Ellis fell 11.7 per cent on Friday to $9.45. Lennar and DR Horton fell 13 per cent at $12.08 and 8.4 per cent $11.07.Regional banks were one of the few sectors to hang onto gains. Regions Financial and Sovereign Bancorp rallied 14.1 per cent to $13.52 and 11.2 per cent to $5.84, respectively.That left the regional banking sector 3.3 per cent lower for the week. Financials overall ended the week 10.8 per cent lower as money markets remained paralysed.The S&P 500 finished down on Friday 1.4 per cent at 1,099.23 points after a steep sell-off towards the close. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.5 per cent at 1,947.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 1.5 per cent lower at 10,325.38 points.In a highly volatile week, the S&P was down 9.4 per cent, the Nasdaq down 10.8 per cent and the Dow Jones off 7.3 per cent.Stocks suffered their biggest one-day fall since 1987 on Monday in response to the House of Representatives failure to approve the original bail-out package.Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said its passage on Friday was “not a panacea . . . There’s still a list of things weighing on the economy.”Grim job figures on Friday added to a glut of downbeat economic data from manufacturing to mortgage applications released in the week.“All the evidence suggests a massive retrenchment in US consumer spending in September,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.Regulators extended a temporary ban on short selling of financial stocks that had been due to expire after Thursday’s session.Throughout the week, the index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list hovered around the level of when the ban started last month and fell 1.4 per cent on Friday.Bucking the negative trend, JPMorgan reached its highest level in more than a year during the week, although it reversed course and fell 7.9 per cent on Friday to $45.90.Bank of America reached its highest level since May during the week but fell
5.2 per cent to $34.48.General Electric’s need to raise $15bn capital highlighted the risks the credit crunch posed for corporate America. GE fell 14.6 per cent over the week and threatened to reach an 11-year low.Other industrials suffered sharp falls. Railways – heavily owned by hedge funds, whose redemptions observers said pushed several stocks sharply lower – erased much of their gains for the week. CSX and Union Pacific lost 15.4 per cent and 15.6 per cent over the period.Big name technology companies, also heavily owned by hedge funds, sustained losses. Yahoo sank 15.4 per cent over the week after recovering 2.7 per cent to $16 on Friday."
68;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-10-02T21:30:16Z;Wall Street slides on grim economic data;;Industrial and material stocks led more Wall Street falls on Thursday as concerns heightened that the intensifying credit squeeze was spreading beyond the financial sector.“The reality is setting in that every day that they can’t fix this crisis is a day that a company can’t get funding,” said Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “People just didn’t think it was going to [happen] this quick.”Largely absent from the SEC’s financials-dominated short-ban list, the big names in these sectors sustained heavy losses as worse-than-expected factory orders and jobless claims also showed that demand was slackening.Agricultural stocks were among the worst hit in the S&P materials sector, which tumbled 8 per cent overall. Mosaic sank 41.3 per cent to $39.65 after disappointing first quarter earnings and warning it would sharply reduce phosphate production.Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on fertiliser peers Potash and Agrium, which lost 27 per cent to $93.51 and 24.2 per cent at $41.61 respectively, from “buy” to “underperform”.Monsanto, meanwhile, dropped 16.2 per cent to $82.01 after Merrill Lynch also cut its recommendation on the seed and herbicide producer from “buy” to “neutral’’.Industrials endured another heavy fall, down 6.8 per cent. Hedge-fund redemptions weighed on the performance of some stocks, observers said.CSX and Union Pacific, down 11 per cent at $47.21 and 10.1 per cent at $62.10 respectively, led a nosedive in the railway sector that erased much of its gain for the year.Both were included in a list of stocks that “matter most” to hedge funds, compiled by Goldman Sachs.A profit warning from trucker Con-way pushed the shares 20.5 per cent lower to $34.16.Airlines – such as Northwest, down 7.5 per cent at $9.71 – endured sharp declines in spite of a drop in oil prices.Meanwhile, GE sank 9.6 per cent to $22.15 on Thursday after it priced 547.83m shares at $22.25 apiece, below Wednesday’s closing price.The S&P 500 closed down 4 per cent at 1,114.28 points. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4.5 per cent at 1,976.72, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.2 per cent to 10,482.85.The resource-heavy Toronto Stock Exchange dropped 7 per cent to 10,900.54 points.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index shot up 14.6 per cent to 45.61, indicating extremely high levels of distress.Although US senators revived the banking sector bail-out plan on Wednesday night, investors were nervous ahead of another vote from the House of Representatives expected on Friday.Financials also continued their slide, down 4.3 per cent in spite of a relatively positive update from Swiss bank UBS. Banks continued to hoard cash amid severe strain in the money markets.Regulators said they would extend their ban on short selling of financial stocks that had been due to expire on Thursday.The index of stocks placed on the SEC’s short-ban list, compiled by Bloomberg, fell 4.5 per cent, below the level when the ban started last month.Semiconductor stocks took scant comfort from global sales figures. The sector fell 4.5 per cent even after Semiconductor Industry Association data showed sales rose 5.5 per cent in August from the previous year.Big name technology companies, which have sustained heavy losses and are also widely held by hedge funds, continued their slide. Google and Apple lost 5.2 per cent to $390.49 and 8.3 per cent to $100.10, respectively.Ebay tumbled 8.2 per cent to $19.15 after Morgan Stanley downgraded its recommendation on the internet auctioneer from “overweight” to “equal weight”.Bucking the downward trend, Atmel jumped 34.2 per cent to $4.40 after Microchip Technology and ON Semiconductor made an unsolicited $2.3bn offer.Constellation Energy rose 14.7 per cent to $27.23 after the Financial Times reported EDF was nearing a deal with private equity group KKR to trump Warren Buffett’s $4.7bn takeover.Some defensive stocks – such as Kraft, up 0.3 per cent to $33.54 – escaped the worst declines.
69;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-09-29T17:52:10Z;US freight lines carrying a lighter burden;;"The huge yellow crane straddling the tracks at one of Norfolk Southern Railway’s container-handling yards works steadily along the train. It lifts each of the two containers stacked on each railcar and places them on to a waiting flatbed truck trailer, ready to be driven off.Business at the yard in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania remains steady in spite of the downturn in demand for the consumer goods often carried in containers. Falling overall demand has been partially offset by the high fuel prices and driver shortages facing the US trucking industry.Lines such as JB Hunt, the US’s largest trucking company, save money by bringing containers to rail facilities such as Harrisburg for their journeys’ long-haul legs rather than hauling them by truck. As a result, revenues in Norfolk Southern’s Intermodal arm – its container-hauling business – were up 11 per cent year on year to $532m in the three months to June 30.There is even more robust activity at the Lamberts Point coal port that NS, the fourth largest US rail operator, operates in Virginia. Long lines of coal trucks wait at the port for loading on to ships. Demand for coal – including the 20m tonnes of Pennsyvlanian and West Virginian coal exported through Lamberts Point annually – gave NS coal revenues for the second quarter this year up 33 per cent on the same quarter of 2007.The less-severe-than-expected impact of reduced US consumer spending and strong growth in bulk commodities have together helped the seven large US and Canadian railways to withstand the economic slowdown better than any previous such crisis for several decades.For the second quarter this year, NS, one of two leading US operators east of the River Mississippi, reported net income up 15 per cent year on year to $453m on rail operating revenues up 16 per cent to $2.76bn. Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi, reported second-quarter net income up 19 per cent year on year to $531m on operating revenues up 13 per cent to $4.57bn.Anthony Hatch, an independent, New York-based rail analyst, says most leading groups beat market expectations in results in the second quarter. They were among the few groups in industrial North America to have done so.The sector’s strength has allowed it to raise prices. NS’s average revenue per carload of coal in the second quarter was up nearly 30 per cent year on year to $1,729; intermodal yields rose 9.6 per cent to $656.James Squires, NS’s chief financial officer, gives several reasons for the improvement, including the industry’s improving service.But a key factor has been rationalisation. The industry’s liberalisation in 1980 permitted operators to close lines and tear up unused tracks, saving millions of dollars in maintenance costs.There has also been consolidation among operators, which has allowed elimination of underused routes. “Capacity is still, on a comparative basis historically, relatively constrained,” Mr Squires says. “That leads to better pricing and financial performance even through a downturn.”Thanks to the price increases and volume growth, most large US rail groups for the first time in decades earn returns from investments higher than their cost of capital. As a result, railways are among the few US infrastructure owners investing heavily in increasing capacity. NS is still, for example, working on the $151m Heartland Corridor project to clear its route from the Hampton Roads ports in Virginia to Chicago to carry containers stacked two-high, as already happens on other parts of the network.The work – which, because of its potential to remove trucks from roads, is being part-funded by state and federal governments – should hugely improve the competitiveness of the Heartland route for container shipments to the Midwest.Mr Squires accepts that rail’s profitability and investment might not survive if the slowdown becomes very severe. “If there’s a long, deep recession, things are not going to go as well for us, even with the advantages and benefits we have,” he says.But NS is in a very different position from the years following its 1997 acquisition of part of Conrail, another leading railway, when its priority was to cut its debt.Now, says Mr Squires, NS is inclined to borrow so that its investments need not stop. “That gives you a lot more flexibility – including the ability to maintain growth-oriented investments which traditionally have been cut at the first sign of a downturn.”"
70;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-08-31T22:35:33Z;Atticus principals to be hit where it hurts most;;"For most of the past decade, Atticus Capital has been a force to reckon with in global markets. From its base in New York, the hedge fund, which had more than $20bn of assets under management at its peak last year, helped dictate the course of mega-mergers and corporate strategy at some of the world’s biggest companies – and made a fortune in the process.Founded by Tim Barakett, a Canadian, in 1995, the young manager soon hired Nathaniel Rothschild, son of Lord Jacob Rothschild, to act as co-chairman and draw on his connections to raise money. He subsequently poached David Slager, a British-educated Dutch trader, from Goldman Sachs, who launched a European fund that grew rapidly to pass the original Global fund Mr Barakett runs.All three of them went on to make personal fortunes in the bull market, which ended in summer last year. Mr Barakett and Mr Slager were estimated by Trader Monthly magazine to have made $250m-$300m each last year, with Mr Rothschild adding to his family’s wealth with a similar income. The three of them, together with other staff, have more than $1.4bn invested in the $14bn fund, with Mr Barakett and Mr Slager having the vast bulk of their personal wealth tied up in Atticus.When the credit crunch hit in August last year, Atticus was caught out. The firm had a $1bn position in Britain’s Barclays Bank, where it was publicly opposing efforts by John Varley, chief executive, to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro – a deal that Barclays lost to Royal Bank of Scotland – as well as major unhedged holdings across many large companies. Mr Slager’s fund plunged more than 10 per cent in the month, its worst result yet, as banking shares, and Barclays, tumbled. Still, investors were unconcerned. The funds made back all their losses over the next two months, and the European fund ended 2007 up 28 per cent after fees – not a patch on the 44 per cent and 63 per cent gains of the previous two years, but still a phenomenal result for such a large fund.This year, investors have been more worried. The fund’s low levels of short-selling, which can hedge against falling markets, and its enormous position in Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, the stock exchanges, has hammered its results. Mr Slager has recorded his seven worst months since the credit crisis hit, and at the end of August was down 32.9 per cent this year. Mr Barakett has fared slightly better, but was still down 25 per cent.Now the fund and its top executives are braced for at least a year without bonuses, as Atticus will receive no performance fees – the bulk of its income – until the funds have made back their losses – requiring gains of 50 per cent for Mr Slager and 33 per cent for Mr Barakett.“Perhaps one concludes that the time is over for them,” said one investor. However, other investors said the dire results over the past 12 months were just a “natural” give-back of some earlier profits. Clients who put money with Mr Slager when his fund launched in 2001, for example, have still made more than three and a half times their money, turning $10m at launch into almost $37m.Nicola Horlick, in the latest report to shareholders in Bramdean, the London-listed investment fund she runs, said its holding in Atticus European was expected to be volatile, and was kept small as a result. “Given that the manager maintains concentrated positions, the heavy losses in declining markets are not surprising,” she wrote.Still, this year’s losses have been galling for Atticus, which believes it has picked strong companies in sectors which are fundamentally sound.“We continue to be disappointed by what we believe is an over-reaction in specific themes to concerns about growth,” it said in a report to Atticus European investors last month.“These valuations indicate persistent fear, and reflect the willingness of many investors to de-risk their portfolios uneconomically,” it wrote. “Historically, these conditions have indicated the wrong time to sell equities, and we believe that remains true today.”The latest regulatory filings show Atticus running with three big investment themes at the end of June: mining and oil/energy, including a $1bn holding in ConocoPhillips; financials and stock exchanges, including more than €1bn ($1.47bn) of Deutsche Börse, and a combined $1bn in Visa and Mastercard; and US rail, with $1bn of Union Pacific and another $1bn in Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Norfolk Southern. The hedge fund focuses on large companies, unlike many rivals, taking very large, concentrated positions. It originally started out following the “event-driven” strategy: buying cheap stocks where a corporate event could provide a catalyst for a jump in the price.As it grew bigger and more powerful it began to provide the catalyst itself, pushing management to take action it believed would boost the stock. In the case of Phelps Dodge, the miner, it even hired its own investment bankers to find a buyer, ahead of its sale last year to Freeport-McMoRan. It halved its $1.1bn equity stake in the second quarter, although it also bought $200m worth of options.Atticus has come under scrutiny for its links to The Children’s Investment Fund, an aggressive London activist hedge fund run by Chris Hohn, a Harvard friend of Mr Barakett.The two have frequently bought the same stocks or taken the same general views – including their focus on US rail – and are the two largest shareholders in Deutsche Börse.They worked together to prevent the exchange’s purchase of the London Stock Exchange, although subsequently they have diverged in views, particularly with regard to ABN, where Mr Hohn was pushing the Dutch bank to sell, while Atticus was trying to stop Barclays from buying.Concerns that they could be seen as acting together, highlighted by an inconclusive investigation by the German regulator, were behind Mr Hohn’s resignation last year as a director of RIT Capital, the listed Rothschild investment trust, where Mr Rothschild is also a director. RIT is an investor in Atticus, and the hedge fund rents its London office from RIT."
71;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-07-24T20:44:53Z;Sharp fall in financials hurts Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday as concerns about further losses on mortgage-related assets and the prospect of increased regulation sent financial stocks to their biggest one-day falls since the start of the credit crisis.Since July 15, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 3.1 per cent, triggered by falling oil prices and a 21.5 per cent gain for financial shares after surprisingly solid results from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.Financials gave up a chunk of those gains on Thursday after Bill Gross, who manages Pimco, the world’s largest bond fund, said in a letter to clients that the housing crisis could force financial firms to take $1,000bn in writedowns.As if to underline that possibility the National Association of Realtors said sales in June of existing homes fell to the lowest level in a decade, knocking an index of homebuilder stocks down 15.2 per cent.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “About two thirds of US bank loans are real estate related and with that much exposure it is hard to think that we are going to get a sustained turnaround in the financial sector until the housing market stabilises.”At the same time Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, asked lawmakers to compel investment banks to submit to SEC oversight and mooted forcing short-sellers to reveal any “substantial” holdings.Citigroup fell 9.8 per cent to $19.06, Bank of America slipped 8.4 per cent to $30.64 and JPMorgan lost 6.7 per cent to $39.14. The S&P 500 financials index gave back 6.7 per cent.Some of the most volatile stocks of recent weeks also came under pressure. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac slid 19.9 per cent to $12.02 and 18.4 per cent to $8.81 while Merrill Lynch lost 14.1 per cent to $29.04 and Lehman Brothers dropped 12.2 per cent to $18.52.National City, the Ohio-based bank, reported a $1.76bn second-quarter loss – far more than expected and set aside more money to cover bad loans.The shares limited their losses to 0.9 per cent at $4.67 after Peter Raskind, chief executive, said the bank had sufficient capital.New data, showing that initial jobless claims jumped last week to the highest level in almost four months, did little to improve the mood.All 10 leading industry groups were in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 2.3 per cent to 1,252.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,349.28 points, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2 per cent to 2,280.11 points.In the background, crude oil prices popped above $125 a barrel, putting pressure on consumer-facing stocks.In the consumer discretionary sector, Jones Apparel lost 6.3 per cent to $15.25 and Dillard’s dipped 10.3 per cent to $10.49 while the sector lost 2.8 per cent.Carmakers and hotels were particularly hard hit after disappointing second-quarter results and full-year profit forecasts from Ford and Starwood Hotels respectively. Ford fell 15.3 per cent to $5.11 while Starwood slid 11.5 per cent to $35.26.There were some bright spots. Amazon and Radio Shack both reported estimate-beating second-quarter results. The shares rose 11.6 per cent to $78.72 and 13.8 per cent to $15.95 respectively.In the industrial sector, better than expected earnings from industrial bellwether 3M, Cooper Industries and Union Pacific could do little to spark buying interest.Shares in 3M rose 0.4 per cent to $71.05, Cooper added 2 per cent to $44.35 while Union dipped 0.2 per cent to $77.18, however the sector dropped 2.5 per cent.Healthcare was the only sector in positive territory for much of the day but it too gave up gains at the close in spite of upbeat results news from Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The pair received a boost from sales of psychiatric drugs and a weak dollar and their shares rose 0,8 per cent to $48 and 1.1 per cent to $22.12 respectively. Higher commodity prices did little for energy and materials stocks and the sectors lost 0.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively.Newmont Mining was an exception rising 3.9 per cent to $48.77, aided by its estimate-beating second-quarter profits.
72;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-07-01T20:42:32Z;GM helps dispel some of Wall Street gloom;;"US equity markets fought back tenaciously on Tuesday, throwing off fuel and financial worries to post modest gains after General Motors showed a smaller than expected decline in sales for June.The morning session proved volatile and gloomy as oil prices streaked higher, keeping up the pressure on consumer-facing and energy-dependent stocks while earnings downgrades hit the banking sector.New data showing an unexpected expansion in manufacturing activity in June helped limit losses. The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing index rose from 49.6 in May to 50.2 last month. Economists had expected the index to slip back in June.Markets swung into positive territory in mid-afternoon when General Motors reported that its sales in North America, seasonally adjusted, declined only 8.3 per cent in June – far less than expected.GM shares, which hit a 54 year low on Monday, overturned early losses to surge as much as 15 per cent. The shares closed 2.2 per cent ahead at $11.75. Ford lost 2.1 per cent to $4.71 after it posted a larger decline in sales.The picture for US auto makers in general looks challenging. Record high oil prices have encouraged buyers to purchase smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, often made by foreign competitors.Investors also bought back into financial shares, picking up some of the most heavily sold stocks.Still, gains were limited by a slump in material stocks, which lost 1 per cent, while the consumer discretionary sector, of which automakers are a part, also lost ground.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,284.93 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 11,382.26 points while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 2,304.97 points.On Monday, most stocks fell, rounding off the S&P 500’s worst month in six years as rising oil prices and worries about the health of the leading financial institutions undermined investor confidence. The Dow showed its biggest June decline since 1930.Larry Smith, chief investment officer at Third Wave Global Investors, said: “These very poor equity numbers directly reflect the fact that, until oil comes down, we are going to continue to have growth that is weak and gets weaker.”The downward trend paused on Tuesday, but weak spots were evident.In materials, energy-intensive steel producers were among the biggest fallers. AK Steel , US Steel and Nucor lost 4.9 per cent to $65.59; 5.1 per cent to $175.35; and 3.3 per cent to $72.23, respectively.In the industrial sector, railway stocks CSX and Union Pacific lost 3 per cent to $60.93 and 2.5 per cent to $73.65, while package delivery companies FedEx and UPS slipped 3.1 per cent to $76.37 and 1.5 per cent to $60.55.A rally in GE and Deere shares helped counterbalance those losses at the close however. The pair added 1.6 per cent to $27.12 and 1.8 per cent to $73.42 respectively.Meanwhile, consumer discretionary stocks also fell slightly as fuel prices rose. Dillard’s, the department store operator, fell 6.2 per cent to $10.85 while Jones Apparelslipped 1.9 per cent to $13.49.The biggest loser was Fortune Brands. The home products maker gave up 13.3 per cent to $54.13 after second-quarter profit fell more than it forecast, in part because of the US housing slump.Energy stocks made up for those losses. Schlumberger, the oil services company, added 2.3 per cent to $109.86 while the sector as whole gained 0.6 per cent. The refiners struggled however. Tesoro lost 2.2 per cent to $19.37.Banking stocks proved surprisingly resilient, looking past a UBS note in which the firm slashed its earnings forecasts for US banks for 2008 and 2009 by up to 30 per cent.The sector overturned losses of as much as 2.8 per cent to gain 1 per cent and snap a three day losing streak. JPMorganand Citigroup recovered from early losses to gain 0.3 per cent to $34.02 and 2.2 per cent to $17.13.Lehman Brothers also made ground, rebounding 5.8 per cent to $20.96 after Morgan Stanley rated the firm “overweight” in new coverage.CIT Group the loss-making business lender, was the leading sector gainer however, rising 30 per cent to $8.83 after it agreed to sell its manufactured housing and home-loan businesses for $1.8bn to focus on commercial lending."
73;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-06-19T20:47:02Z;Wall St rebounds after drop in oil prices;;Wall Street stock markets rebounded on Thursday after a drop in oil prices buoyed consumer discretionary and transport stocks, taking the sting out of data showing continued weakness in the US economy and a warning from Citigroup about further writedowns.The day began in a downbeat fashion with new data that showed initial jobless claims dropped by less than expected last week, while manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region contracted more than expected in June.Still, it was the travails of the banking sector that weighed heaviest on equity markets in early trading. Comments from the chief financial officer of Citigroup accelerated losses.Gary Crittenden told investors that the largest US bank would have substantial writedowns on its holdings of subprime mortgage-related debt. Citigroup shares slid as much as 4.9 per cent before recovering to $20.17, down 1.3 per cent.As oil prices fell back however, a rally in the consumer discretionary and industrial sectors picked up steam, and they advanced 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively erasing early losses.Amid the broad market rally, even financials ended the day in positive territory, adding 0.9 per cent alongside a 1.2 per cent gain for technology.By the close S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent at 1,342.83 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly dipped below 12,000 points for the second successive day, before reviving. The index ended the day 0.3 per cent higher at 12,063.09 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.3 per cent to 2,446.99 points.On Wednesday, equity markets sold off sharply, and the Dow hit a three-month low, after declines in the banking sector and a downbeat outlook on the economy from FedEx weighed on sentiment.The pattern initially repeated on Thursday after analysts cut their earnings estimates for Morgan Stanley, triggering a sell-off. Morgan Stanley shares, which struggled to a small gain on Wednesday, fell 1.2 per cent to $40.19.Regional banks have come under particular selling pressure in the past few days as a number of analysts have questioned the ability of smaller, less capitalised banks to stand up to the strains of the credit crisis and mounting losses on mortgage assets.But they also found some positive momentum on Thursday, adding to their gains after BB&T said that it would increase its dividend, dismissing an analyst’s prediction that the North Carolina bank would do just the opposite. BB&T overturned early losses to climb 0.1 per cent to $24.35, while Fifth Third recovered 5.3 per cent to $9.75.Industrials proved robust, as transport stocks helped them shake off the poor macroeconomic data.A number of rail companies have given warnings that flooding in the Midwest of the US will dent earnings, most recently Burlington Northern Santa Fe, but analysts and investors remain positive over the long-term outlook for the sector.Burlington shares added 2.3 per cent to $105.55 while peers Union Pacific and CSX climbed 2.6 per cent to $77.80 and 3.3 per cent to $66.34 respectively.In earnings news, Circuit City Stores, the electronics retailer that put itself up for sale last month, disappointed investors by reporting a loss of $164.8m and revenue down 7.4 per cent to $2.3bn. Circuit shares fell 1.7 per cent to $3.98.Better than expected second-quarter results from Carnival, the cruise line company, a rally in oversold stocks in the staples sector and a $5 drop in oil prices helped keep consumer-facing stocks well above water.Carnival rose 5.4 per cent to $36.84 and Tyson Foods added 5.8 per cent to $14.47.Technology stocks were among the biggest gainers, benefiting from tumbling oil prices, which may ease strains on global economic growth. Microsoft rose 1.7 per cent to $28.93, Intel 2.6 per cent $22.85 and IBM 0.7 per cent to $125.02.Broadcom, the maker of chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, rose 7.6 per cent to $27.22 after analysts at Lehman Brothers said second-quarter earnings will get a boost off higher demand.Energy was the only sector to close in the red.ExxonMobil dropped 2.3 per cent to $85.79 while ConocoPhillips fell 1.6 per cent to $93.66.
74;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-06-18T20:34:48Z;US stocks fall as oil prices surge;;US stocks fell for a second session on Wednesday as oil prices surged in late trading while poor results from FedEx underscored the challenges of rising energy prices and crumbling profitability facing the broader economy and equity markets.FedEx said it had lost $241m in the fourth quarter after rising fuel costs and a writedown on FedEx Kinko, its copy centre unit, took their toll. The company’s outlook statement for 2009 was also downbeat.The results will further heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.The parcel delivery firm is often seen as a bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the economy.FedEx shares fell 2.1 per cent to $82.60 while rival UPS lost 2.3 per cent to $65.80, dragging the industrials sector down 1 per cent.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said profit dropped 57 per cent in the second quarter due to weak performances at its trading and investment banking units. The stock initially fell as much as 7.8 per cent, weighing on sentiment, only to swing back into the black in late trading.Still, the rally had little effect on the broader financial sector.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday that it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets to shore up its balance sheet after nine quarters of declining profit. The Ohio-based bank will also cut its dividend.Morgan added 0.5 per cent to $40.80, Goldman rose 1.9 per cent to $182.77 but Fifth Third slumped 27.3 per cent to $9.26.The S&P 500 financials sector slipped 1.2 per cent while the KBW banking index hit a six-year low.By the close, the S&P 500 was down 1 per cent at 1,337.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.1 per cent to 12,029.06, hitting a three-month low, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,429.71.On Tuesday, equity markets ended a weak three-day rally, led lower by the financial sector and economic data that triggered further worries about inflation and the housing market.Regional bank shares were sold particularly hard after some negative analyst comments. That trend continued on Wednesday as Fifth Third’s capital-raising weighed on the sector.SunTrust Banks fell 9 per cent to $36.95, Regions Financial dropped 10.4 per cent to $11.40 while Huntington Bancshares slipped 9.5 per cent to $5.52.The FedEx results cast a pall over equity markets and by the end of the day, all 10 leading industrial groups on the S&P 500 retreated into the red.A rise in oil prices did little to help, and the consumer discretionary and staples sectors were among the leading fallers, dropping 1.9 per cent and 1.1 per cent respectively.Carmakers led the way down after analysts predicted that US vehicle sales could slump to their lowest in more than 15 years this month as buyers shun the gas-guzzling vehicles that are their bread and butter. General Motors lost 5.9 per cent to $14.89 while Ford slid 5.8 per cent to $6.22.Tyson Foods, the chicken producer, also fell back, slumping 8.2 per cent to $13.68 after Fitch cut its debt to non-investment grade.In other corporate news, MF Global, the broker of exchange-traded futures contracts, tumbled 41 per cent to $7.83 after it said revenues would come in below analysts’ estimates. It added that it planned to sell shares to pay down debt.There were bright spots. Union Pacific said in the week that flooding in the Midwest had disrupted services and damaged its infrastructure – it estimated that the weather would trim second-quarter earnings. However, its shares still rose 4.6 per cent to $75.82 on Wednesday following an upbeat report from Morgan Stanley said rising productivity would offset higher oil prices and boost profit.Peer CSX added 1.3 per cent to $64.20 while trucking company YRC Worldwide added 5.4 per cent to $17.68 after reaffirming its second- quarter guidance.
75;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2008-06-11T20:40:57Z;Wall St falls led by financials;;Wall Street fell sharply on Wednesday as financials resumed their relentless downward path and technology stocks came under heavy selling pressure after a key industry group cut its sales outlook for semi­conductors.In the background, oil prices jumped more than $5 a barrel, taking the momentum out of Tuesday’s shallow rally in consumer-facing shares. The consumer discretionary sector fell 2.2 per cent while the homebuilder sub-sector fell 8 per cent to within touching distance of a seven-year low.The leading fallers, however, were financial stocks, which dropped 3.3 per cent, giving up recent fragile gains and suggesting that the sector has yet to find a solid bottom amid a steady trickle of bad news.Technology stocks followed close behind, slipping 2.4 per cent after the Semiconductor Industry Association said sales will grow less rapidly than expected this year as competition drives down prices, particularly for memory chips.Nine of the 10 leading industry sectors were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 index down 1.7 per cent to 1,335.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.7 per cent to 12,083.69. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2 per cent to 2,394.01.The tone on Wall Street has perceptibly darkened over the past few weeks as investors cope with bad news from financials and look ahead to rising inflation, weak consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed earnings.While the S&P 500 posted monthly gains of 1.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent in April and May, so far in June the benchmark index is down 4.6 per cent.Scott Armiger, a vice-president at Christiana Bank & Trust, said: “We were thinking that you would see some signs of expansion in the second half, and now it seems that it is going to be a long, hot summer and perhaps we won’t start to recover until next year.”Financials reprised their role as the villains of the piece on Wednesday and have fallen in all but two sessions in June. The sector is down 23.8 per cent this year.Washington Mutual, First Horizon and Huntington Bancshares fell 9.3 per cent to $6.06, 6 per cent to $8.27 and 6.5 per cent to $6.92 respectively. The banks have some of the highest exposures to home equity loans, which some analysts see as the next front in the ongoing credit crisis.Investment banks also took a beating as Lehman Brothers fell a 13.6 per cent to $23.75, dragging the sector down 5.3 per cent. It was followed by Merrill Lynch, down 6.6 per cent to $35.46. Matthew Albrecht, an equity analyst with S&P, said: “Preliminary results from Lehman Brothers should remind investors that this group is not out of the woods regarding mortgage and bridge loan exposure, and risk governance remains in focus.”Industrials came under pressure after UBS rated Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the railway company, a “short-term sell”, suggesting rising fuel prices may impact second-quarter earnings. Burlington dropped 7 per cent to $103.77, dragging down peers Union Pacific and CSX, which slipped 5.7 per cent to $74.10 and 4 per cent to $63.60 respectively. CSX is in the middle of a messy proxy battle with British hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund.Energy stocks were the sole gainers amid the broader malaise, following oil prices higher. ExxonÂ­Mobil rose 0.8 per cent to $88.61 and ConocoPhillips added 1.3 per cent to $94.08.Materials stocks fell in spite of some positive momentum for gold focused shares. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, for example, rose 0.6 per cent to $120.09.Gains for the broader sector were swamped, however, after JPMorgan downgraded Alcoa from “overweight” to “neutral”, suggesting that the aluminium producer would likely not be a take­over target. Alcoa dropped 8 per cent to $39.32.In technology, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel were among the leading fallers, losing 6.3 per cent to $6.96 and 3.8 per cent to $21.81 respectively.Amerigroup, the managed healthcare provider, fell 14.1 per cent to $23.36. It suspended its annual profit forecast as higher-than-expected claims forced it to renegotiate rates with the state of Tennessee.Meanwhile, Staples succeeded in its efforts to buy Corporate Express, a Dutch peer, with a revised $2.7bn offer. Staples shares rose 5.3 per cent to $24.38.
76;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-12-21T21:57:49Z;RIM brings cheer as Wall Street closes on high;;Wall Street ended the week on a high note on Friday with technology stocks leading the charge after some strong results from Research In Motion cheered the market.The banking sector rallied on reports that Merrill Lynch is seeking a multi-billion-dollar capital injection and financials appeared untroubled by reports that plans for a “superfund” to bail out troubled structured investment vehicles were being dropped for lack of demand.Energy and materials were the pick of the S&P’s leading sectors as commodity prices surged and retailers rebounded after the Commerce Department revealed a sharp rise in consumer spending.The S&P 500 closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,484.46 on Friday for an increase of 1.1 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent on the week to 13,450.65 while the Nasdaq Composite fared better, gaining 2.1 per cent to 2,691.99 over the period. The Russell 2000 small cap index climbed 4.2 per cent to 785.60 this week, helped by an increase in deal-making.The New York Stock Exchange set a volume record in the first hour on Friday as traders settled positions before the holidays and as several types of derivative contracts expired – a quarterly event known as “quadruple witching”. However, volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index – Wall Street’s so-called “fear barometer” – fell to its lowest level since the end of October, down 19.7 per cent for the week at 18.68.Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry e-mail device, capped a good week for technology after it said third-quarter net in-come more than doubled to $370.5m and revenues soared. The company’s up-beat fourth-quarter guidance exceeded analysts’ estimates and the shares jumped 11.9 per cent on the week to $118.63. UBS raised its price target to $155.RIM’s stellar results came in the same week that Oracle increased second-quarter profit by 35 per cent, helped by strong software licence sales. Its shares rose 7.1 per cent to $22.71 this week.Adobe Systems, the software company, beat estimates with a 21 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits and the shares edged up 0.2 per cent to $42.18.“There’s been no crisis in technology. The momentum has been phenomenal,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Financials had a mixed week as investors were forced to weigh up whether to avoid the sector because of more mortage-related losses or buy into the stocks because of the prospect of big capital infusions from abroad.Reports that Merrill Lynch is in talks with Temasek, Singapore’s state investment agency, about a potential multi-billion-dollar investment moved the shares higher on Friday.Like many US banks, Merrill could benefit from a boost to its capital reserves after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October. The shares fell 2.3 per cent on the week to $55.54 after an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton forecast Merrill would take another $8.6bn in writedowns this quarter.Morgan Stanley this week tapped China Investment Corp for $5bn as it an-nounced a total of $9.4bn in writedowns for the fourth quarter and posted the first loss in its history. The shares ended the week up 8.1 per cent at $54.37.Bear Stearns, which in October took a $1bn investment from China’s Citic Securities, fell to its first loss this week, after it wrote down $1.9bn for the quarter. The shares fell 5.6 per cent to $89.95 on the week.Investors were rocked by the threat of credit downgrades on monoline bond insurers.A downgrade of bond insurers could seriously affect world credit markets, triggering sharp losses on insured securities.MBIA, fell 27.4 per cent to $20.03 this week after it revealed $30.6n in exposure to complex debt securities. Fitch Ratings warned it could cut MBIA’s triple-A rating unless it raised $1bn in capital.Fitch issued the same warning to Ambac Financial on Friday after identifying $32.2bn in exposure to collateralised debt obligations backed by subprime collateral.However, Ambac’s shares rose 16.9 per cent to $26.66 on the week after Moody’s affirmed its triple-A rating.Transport stocks were disappointing after FedEx, the logistics company, and Union Pacific, rail operator, issued weak earnings guidance, citing rising fuel costs. The shares fell 1.7 per cent to $94.29 and 3.5 per cent to $126.02 respectively.
77;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-11-13T13:39:36Z;Investors flock to railroad recovery;;The recovery in the fortunes of the largest North American railroads has been marked by enthusiasm from three different types of investors - the very long-term, those adept at forcing a quick change of tack and private equity.The biggest name involved is Berkshire Hathaway, the vehicle of Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, which emerged as a major buyer of railroad stocks in May. Buffett’s company has concentrated heavily on BNSF, where it is by now much the biggest shareholder, but it has also taken stakes in Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. All three are seen as having the strong managements Mr Buffett favours.Railroads have been less enthusiastic about the attention of activist investors, often hedge funds. The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, is now the second-largest shareholder in CSX, whose management it is trying to force to change course, and also holds stakes in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. Carl Icahn, the celebrity investor, and Atticus Capital have also taken railroad stakes.The most significant development, meanwhile, could be rising interest from the private equity industry. In July it emerged that one private equity house - Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management - had made a tentative approach to Canadian Pacific, which turned it down. However, private equity firms have bought up several short-line railroads, including the Florida East Coast Railroad, which sold itself to Fortress Investment Group in May for $3.5bn.
78;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;US rail chiefs say new laws will halt investment;;Accelerating investment in US railroads’ capacity could come to a halt if proposed legislation to re-regulate many of the railroads’ prices is brought into force, the chief executives of three of the top five US railroads have warned.The chief executives of CSX Corporation, Union Pacific and BNSF – all among the five large US-based Class I railroads – have told the Financial Times that fewer new investments will be justifiable if any of the four bills to regulate rates being debated in Congress becomes law.Most US rail rates were deregulated in 1980, in response to a financial crisis at many railroads exacerbated by the previous system of federal oversight.Railroads have invested heavily in capacity in recent years following a surge in traffic caused by the growing popularity of coal for power generation, expanding wheat production and growing imports of shipping containers from Asia.The increased demand and need to pay for investments has pushed up many freight rates, although the Association of American Railroads says they remain about half the level they were before rail deregulation in real terms. Railroads plan to invest about $10bn in new capacity this year.However, some rail customers back the bills – which would cap freight rates and increase competition – because they say consolidation has given more operators monopoly power over certain customers.The controversy has fed into a debate about how the government can best encourage increased use of the US’s railroads to relieve pressure on highway networks.Jim Young, chief executive of Union Pacific, the US’s largest railroad by revenue and network size, said he had told legislators that the company would change the size of its network to suit its returns.“I said: ‘The government needs to be careful because you’re making decisions that determine how much business you want moving on the railroads long term,’” Mr Young said. “If they make the wrong decisions and we restrict that growth, they are going to have to figure out how to handle it on the highway.”Matt Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, said a legislative restriction on earning potential would force capital out of the industry.The only big point of dispute among railroads is over the likelihood that the legislation will succeed.Mr Young said he was taking it seriously, while Michael Ward, chief executive of CSX, said he thought the consequences would be so damaging that the legislation would fail.
79;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Expansion poses a challenge for repairs;;"The scale of the revival of the US’s railroads is clear looking from a flyover at the world’s busiest railyard, Union Pacific’s Bailey Yard, in North Platte, Nebraska.Two long trains of shipping containers – stacked two high – are moving in opposite directions; two mile-and-a-half long coal trains are also making their way through the yard, while another train is made up of a mixture of wagons carrying different products in smaller batches.The yard, at the meeting point of UP’s most important trans-continental routes and the coal route from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, handles 150 trains a day, examining 15,000 wagons for faults.North Platte is at the centre of a series of initiatives that aim to improve UP’s ability to handle the vast and growing quantities of traffic coming its way with the minimum possible extra investment.The main aim, according to Cameron Scott, the manager in charge of Bailey Yard, has been to improve the effectiveness of repairs to the coal trains coming from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin. Each day, 37 trains each way travel through the yard from Powder River.Mr Scott initially focused on reducing from 12 days to two the time it took North Platte’s repair shops to return defective wagons to service. However, with demand still increasing, the yard has now switched to repairing wagons where possible without removing them from service.The affected wagon is jacked up, its defective wheels removed and new ones put in place.“We thought two days was pretty good,” Mr Scott says of the initial improvement. “[But] the in-train repair takes 15 minutes.“The car never goes to the [repair] shop. We bring the shop workers to the train instead of bringing the
train to the shop.”"
80;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Mergers signal the rise of an all-powerful seven;;A series of mergers during the 1980s and 1990s shaped the structure of North America’s Class I railroads – all those with annual revenue of more than $319.3m – leaving most regions with just two competing operators.BNSF and Union Pacific compete over the western two-thirds of the US, while CSX and Norfolk Southern operate almost exclusively east of the Mississippi. The two Canadian Class Is – Canadian National and Canadian Pacific – have parallel routes from British Columbia to Canada’s main population centres, and substantial US operations.The seventh and smallest Class I – Kansas City Southern – operates mainly in a north-south corridor from the Canadian border through the Midwest into Mexico, where it owns one of the country’s two largest railroads.One of the two competing operators in each region has a history of being stronger than the other, even if the recent surge in traffic is reviving all lines. Just as BNSF’s operating figures have long been better than UP’s, Norfolk Southern has generally had stronger figures than CSX.
81;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-11-12T21:59:05Z;Railroads’ US revival entices investors;;Just four years ago, an economic slowdown like that now under way in the US would have produced long faces and worried expressions at the headquarters of Union Pacific, the US’s largest railroad by annual revenue, or at Burlington Northern and Santa Fe, the number two.This autumn, in spite of a slowdown of consumer demand – which drives railroads’ business carrying maritime containers – and of the housing market – which drives demand for building materials – executives at the two companies are positively buoyant.Omaha, Nebraska-based UP’s third-quarter operating income was a record $1bn, 34 per cent up on the year before, on $4.2bn revenue. Fort Worth, Texas-based BNSF’s income, also $1bn, on $4.07bn revenue, was 9 per cent up on the previous year.The robust performance results from a long-term surge in demand for nearly everything they deliver, from coal to shipping containers and from cars to wheat.The traffic has filled all the spare capacity on many routes and allowed operators to withstand slowdowns like the present one without cutting their rates.In previous economic cycles, the struggle to cover their high fixed costs meant railroads would often cut their rates in bad times to ensure truckers did not take too much of their business. This time the truckers are suffering.The railroads’ revival has provoked interest from many different kinds of investors. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by Warren Buffett, has taken stakes in several companies, including 17.2 per cent of BNSF, seen as soundly managed.The Children’s Investment Fund, a London-based hedge fund, and Carl Icahn, the activist investor, have concentrated on operators such as CSX, which they see as having the most turnround potential.CSX and UP still have more to do to catch up with the best-performing of the four largest US railroads, Norfolk Southern and BNSF. Of the two largest, BNSF, which competes with UP on key routes in the western US, still enjoys better returns and higher profitability than UP, thanks to its managers’ early spotting of the looming capacity shortage.BNSF had most of its key Los Angeles to Chicago line double-tracked before a sudden surge in container traffic in 2004 that overwhelmed UP’s systems and pushed traffic to BNSF.“We are behind the capacity curve,” admits Jim Young, UP’s chief executive, who blames the problem partly on the former Southern Pacific, which UP took over in 1996 during a consolidation wave that also saw the then Burlington Northern take over the better-maintained Santa Fe.UP is now rushing to double-track the Southern Pacific’s key Los Angeles to Texas Sunset Corridor, whose deficiencies lay behind many of its problems in 2004.Even the better-performing operators face a challenge raising the funds needed to invest for continued growth. UP plans to invest about $3.2bn this year, while BNSF plans to spend $2.75bn.Of the two, only BNSF consistently earns more than the roughly 10 per cent it and other railroads have to pay to raise capital.Even its position would look less healthy if its returns were calculated against the replacement cost of its assets, not the unrealistically low historic cost.Matthew Rose, BNSF’s chief executive, consequently concentrates investment on the core, strategic network, such as the Los Angeles-Chicago route, which is high-growth and low-risk for capital investment.This approach has required freight rate rises, which have angered customers of BNSF and other railroads. “Quite frankly, if you’re a shipper in the US, you’ve been used to lower costs every year since motor carrier, railroad and airline deregulation [in 1980],” Mr Rose says. “So customers are frustrated because for the first time they’re seeing rates go up.”The development is leading to “a lot of noise” from the marketplace saying the industry is making too much money, Mr Rose adds.“When you look at the basic returns and compare that to the S&P 500, we’re still below the majority of the S&P 500. It’s puzzling how anyone can look at the industry and say we’re making excessive profits.”As long as there is no serious re-regulation there is substantial evidence rates will keep increasing, helping to fund projects such as the UP’s double-tracking of the Sunset Corridor.That is the hope at UP, whose financial performance is poorer largely because 25 per cent of its business is still conducted under long-term contracts signed in the industry’s fallow days.The company, which earned 8.2 per cent on its invested capital last year, hopes to improve its performance as the contracts gradually come up for renewal.
82;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
83;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-07-19T21:24:52Z;S&P 500, Dow close at all-time high;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday as positive sentiment in the technology sector helped investors shrug off fresh worries about the hard-hit US subprime mortgage market.The bullish mood propelled the S&P 500 to a record close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average settled above 14,000 for the first time.Ben Bernanke, the US Federal Reserve chairman, told US lawmakers that losses from the subprime mortgage market could range between $50bn and $100bn.Leading the major benchmarks was the Nasdaq Composite, with a gain of 0.8 per cent to 2,720.04. One boost for the tech sector was a 12.5 per cent surge to $30.06 in Juniper Networks shares after the networking equipment maker swung to a second-quarter profit. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”, in the expectation that strong sales growth would boost operating margins.Cisco rose 1.7 per cent to $29.94 and had set a 52-week high of $30.So far this year, the Nasdaq’s gain of 12.6 per cent has outpaced the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the Nasdaq 100 has rallied 16.8 per cent. In a bull market, the more volatile technology stocks led the way as they enable investors to reap higher returns.“It’s no surprise that high beta stocks are doing well in this current rally,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “People who have missed some of the rally, and are forced to chase returns, can get back in the race by buying high beta names.”Another factor in favour of the tech sector is that international sales form a larger proportion of total sales, say analysts. A faster growing global economy in conjunction with a sharply weaker dollar is a fillip for the sector and multinational blue chip companies.But a sour note for techs was struck by Ebay, which fell 1.6 per cent to $33.50, after the online auctioneer posted a 50 per cent rise in quarterly profit, but left its outlook for 2007 unchanged. Investors had hoped for a rise in guidance and also focused on lower global listings.After the closing bell Google reported a 28 per cent rise in second quarter profits that missed estimates as higher costs eroded better-than-expected revenue growth. Google slumped more than 6 per cent in post-market trade.Also after the close, Microsoft met earnings estimates and raised guidance. Microsoft initially rallied in after-hours action, following a gain of 1.9 per cent to $31.51 in regular trade.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices reported a loss in the second quarter as a rise in sales for the chip maker was offset by lower microprocessor prices and costs associated with the $5.6bn purchase of ATI Technologies, a graphics chip maker. In after-hours trade, the stock rallied further after a rise of 2.1 per cent to $15.87 at the closing bell.The enthusiasm for tech stocks lifted the broad market into record territory. The S&P rose 0.45 per cent to 1,553.07 a new record high. Among the major sectors, utilities, technology and energy led gains, while health care and financials declined.Among the financials, Bank of America said quarterly earnings rose 5 per cent with an increase in the provision for credit losses. BofA has now set aside $1.81bn to cover these losses, up from $1.01bn in the second quarter of 2006. Shares in BofA fell 0.2 per cent to $49.27.PNC Financial, a mid-Atlantic regional bank, said quarterly earnings expanded 11 per cent and was also buying Sterling Financial for $565m, or $19 per share. The stock slipped 2.5 per cent to $71.37.Shares in MF Global fell on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MF closed at $27.55, after the financial firm had listed at $30 a share – lower than the expected range of $36 to $39, traders said.The American Stock Exchange Broker-Dealer index fell 0.75 per cent.Another financial stock in the news was American Home Mortgage Investment. The stock plunged 20.8 per cent to $10.76 as subprime worries among investors intensified and the company did not comment on the sharp decline.Blue chips rallied, led by IBM, and the DJIA rose 0.6 per cent to close at 14,000.41.In earnings news, IBM reported a 12 per cent rise in second quarter profit, and raised earnings guidance for 2007. The stock gained 4.3 per cent to $115.86 and had set a new five-year high of $116.48.Another Dow stock, Honeywell, posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating estimates. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $60.98 and also reached a seven-year high of $61.90 earlier in the day. The company raised guidance for 2007 and also authorised the buyback of an additional $3bn in stock.Shares in Foot Locker surged 8.6 per cent to $22.71, after the company said it would consider putting itself up for sale. The shoe retailer recently failed to buy rival Genesco.In other earnings, Motorola recorded a quarterly loss amid lower revenue from weak phone sales. Shares rose 1.2 per cent to $18.22.Union Pacific reported a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The railroad slid 0.1 per cent to $125.74.Hershey reported a 96 per cent drop in profits for the past quarter, as the confectionary maker invested in transforming its production lines. Its shares fell 3 per cent to $48.45.Harley Davidson reported a 19 per cent rise in profit and reaffirmed guidance for 2007. But domestic sales of motorcycles fell and the stock slid 2.9 per cent to $59.37.Investors will focus on earnings from two DJIA stocks, Citigroup and Caterpillar on Friday. Citi fell 0.9 per cent to $51.14, while Cat rose 0.9 per cent to $86.42 on Thursday.In economic news on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed survey reported a drop to 9.2 in July from a reading of 18 in June. The six-month outlook index rose 30.4 in July from a reading of 16.7 in June.Economists at Bear Stearns said: “This is a stronger report than suggested by the headline sentiment index.”Later this afternoon the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting in June are released.Earlier in the day, leading indicators for June fell 0.3 per cent, more than a forecast decline of 0.1 per cent.“Housing continues to weigh, a theme that ties in with the concerns Bernanke stated yesterday [Wednesday],” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “However, despite the decline, the trend in the overall index appears to have stabilised after declining early 2006 to a cyclical low in early 2007.”Stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but did pare the worst of their earlier losses.
84;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Buffett spends $1.3bn on healthcare investments;;Warren Buffett has increased his bet on the pharmaceutical sector, spending some $1.3bn in three months to more than double its stake in healthcare group Johnson & Johnson and boost its holding in French drugmaker Sanofi Aventis.The move by the “Sage of Omaha”, who recently complained at the dearth of undervalued companies to invest in, suggests he is seeking to diversify his $58bn portfolio away from financial and consumer products companies.News of Mr Buffett’s increased interest – his stake in J&J is now about 1.6 per cent – sent shares in the healthcare group 2 per cent higher in afternoon trading to $63.02. The legendary investor also disclosed a smaller investment in Wellpoint, a US health insurer, and revealed further details of its exposure to the railway industry, identifying Virginia-based Norfolk Southern Corp as his mystery target in the sector.Berkshire Hathaway, Mr Buffett’s investment vehicle, had previously disclosed stakes in two railway operators, Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific but declined to name the identity of the third company in its portfolio.Mr Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway were unavailable for comment.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Berkshire Hathaway said its holdings in Johnson & Johnson had risen to 48.7m shares in the three months to March, more than double the 24m shares it had at year-end. The value of Mr Buffett’s stake in J&J is around $2.9bn, according to the document.Mr Buffett’s widely followed investment strategy is predicated on buying companies that are undervalued, easy to understand and have strong management teams.Shares in J&J have fallen more than 9 per cent in the three months to March amid regulatory problems for some of the company’s new drugs.Sanofi Aventis shares lost more than 6 per cent over the same period – a fall that may have prompted Mr Buffett to buy more of the company’s US-traded American Depositary Receipts. His stake in the French company is now worth over $36m.As expected, Mr Buffett rebuffed demands from human rights groups and kept his stake in the Chinese oil group Petrochina.
85;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-05-16T20:36:48Z;Wall St rallies on billionaires’ bets;;Wall Street rallied strongly on Wednesday with trading influenced by a number of well-known investors revealing their latest purchases in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Early on Wednesday, stocks traded in a choppy fashion as a better-than-expected rise for industrial production in April was offset by news that building permits last month fell at their fastest pace since 1990.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was boosted by the disclosure that its constituents, Citigroup, and Johnson & Johnson were in favour among leading investors.The Dow closed up 0.8 p+er cent at 13,487.53, and set its 23rd record close for the year. The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,514.14 and edged closer to its record level of 1,527.46 set in March 2000.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research said good earnings and guidance for the coming quarter should support stocks and that the S&P was building up to moving higher towards its 2000 record peak.Within the S&P, telecom, and financial stocks led the major sectors higher, while materials lagged.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that while all 10 major S&P sectors were still trading near their recent highs, “many seem to be rolling over a bit.”They said: “Financials, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and health care have all had slight declines after hitting overbought levels, and it will be key to see how they react to resistance levels.”The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9 per cent to 2,547.42, and shrugged off weakness among semiconductors stocks. Earnings and lower guidance from Applied Materials did weigh upon technology for much of on Wednesday and the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.2 per cent, following a slide of 1.1 per cent on Tuesday.Applied Materials, a chipmaker, reported better-than-expected earnings, but its guidance for sales disappointed investors. Its shares were down 3.1 per cent at $19.17.Meanwhile the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose 0.7 per cent at 820.29 and rebounded from its lowest closing level in more than a month on Tuesday.A number of stocks were in the spotlight on Wednesday when Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s investment company, said it had invested in Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, two railroads, and also bought stock in Wellpoint and raised its holding in Johnson & Johnson, two healthcare companies.Norfolk Southern rose 1.65 per cent to $56.79, Union Pacific gained 0.9 per cent to $119.39 and the S&P railroad index rallied 1.3 per cent, taking its gain for the year to 25.1 per cent.Wellpoint gained 1.6 per cent at $84.86, while Johnson & Johnson rallied 2 per cent to $63.05.Edward Lampert, the hedge fund manager, said late on Tuesday that he had purchased 15m shares of Citigroup. This prompted the shares to jump 4 per cent to $54.91. Analysts believe that the banking conglomerate could now become the next high-profile target for activist investors, given its underperforming share price in recent years. Such a move would show that even the biggest companies were not immune to activist pressure.Meanwhile, George Soros, another of the most famous hedge fund managers, said his stake in Microsoft had doubled, and the stock rose 0.55 per cent to $31.07. Mr Soros had lowered his holdings in Oracle, and shares were up 0.8 per cent at $18.99, while he had sold shares in Ebay, down 0.75 per cent at $33.25, and Take-Two Interactive, and shares in the video game maker slid 0.2 per cent at $19.08.Another big investor, Carl Icahn, a well-known activist, said he had purchased a large slice of Anadarko Petroleum, boosting its shares by 1.6 per cent to $47.20, and also bought shares in CSX, the railroad finished up 1.4 per cent at $46.40. Mr Icahn also disclosed that his stake in Time Warner, had been cut by nearly half. Its shares in the media group rallied 1.55 per cent to $21.60.In takeover news, Bausch & Lomb agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.7bn in cash. Shares in the the maker of eye-care products jumped 9.8 per cent to $67.50.“We believe pressure on operating cash flow, as the company struggles to recapture lost market share, creates significant risks in terms of return on capital for an acquiring firm and we do not expect any higher offers,” said Robert Gold, medical devices analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.After the closing bell, Hewlett-Packard said second-quarter profit fell 6.5 per cent after a tax gain in the year- earlier period. In after-hours trade, shares in the computer maker were 0.7 per cent lower at $44.86, after a rise of 1 per cent in regular trade.Shares in Amazon closed 4.4 per cent higher at $63.22, after the online retailer said it plans to launch a digital music store later this year and sell songs without copy protection restrictions.In earnings news, Compuware reported a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings and its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $10.67.Shares in Federated Department stores rose 1.2 per cent to $62.69 after its first-quarter profit rose more than 5 per cent, but missed analysts’ estimates.
86;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-04-20T13:02:38Z;Wall St advances to new highs;;Solid earnings and speculation about buy-outs of financial groups pushed US stocks into record territory this week as the leading indices recouped all the losses from the slump that began in late February.Boosted by bullish earnings updates from Caterpillar and Honeywell on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record level for a third successive day, climbing 1.2 per cent to 12,961.98.The S&P 500 index broke through its high for the year reached before the plunge in equities two months ago, rising 0.9 per cent to 1,484.35 on Friday to stand 2.2 per cent up this week.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3 per cent this week to 2,526.39.While the advance gathered pace on Friday, the rally earlier in the week was driven by a relatively narrow base of stocks. Blue chips had the best of the gains: the Dow Jones advanced 2.8 per cent this week while the Russell 2000 index of small companies rose just 1.2 per cent.“The big driver has been earnings, which have been much better than anticipated – we set the bar so low,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.“It is a ‘Chicken Little’ recovery – the market rises yet never seems able to generate confidence.”Google led the way up after beating analysts’ expectations with a sharp rise in profits on the back of strong search engine revenues. Its shares rose 2.3 per cent to $482.48.This rise was in stark contrast to Yahoo, which slid 12.6 per cent to $27.46 this week after the introduction of Panama, its new online advertising system, failed to stem the deterioration in profits and sales. Caterpillar, a Dow component, surged 4.7 per cent to $71.82 on Friday after the heavy machinery maker reported profits in excess of analysts’ estimates and raised its earnings forecasts.Shares in Honeywell International rose 4.8 per cent to $51.40 on Friday after the industrial conglomerate raised its earnings forecasts for the year and beat Wall Street profit estimates.The financial sector came in from the cold this week, with the S&P Financial index up 3.9 per cent to break past its 50-day moving average and stand in positive territory for the year.The rise came amid a burst of takeover speculation after a $25bn agreed buy-out of Sallie Mae, the student loan group, by a JC Flowers-led consortium that sent shares in Sallie Mae up 15.5 per cent to $54 this week.The groundbreaking deal, which is structured to make it unnecessary for Sallie Mae to hold its own capital, turned attention to financial groups that were previously considered improbable buy-out targets. Foremost among those was Countrywide Financial, the biggest home lender, which jumped 11.1 per cent to $37.36.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Merrill Lynch, which has made bullish comments about the subprime mortgage market.Merrill rose 6.7 per cent to $92.02 this week after reporting a four-fold rise in profits.In the latest example of the growing appetite for financial deals, H&R Block agreed to sell Option One Mortgage, its subprime mortgage unit, to a company affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group. Shares in H&R Block rose 3.3 per cent to $22.56 on Friday.Intel made big gains this week, rising 8.3 per cent to $21.16, as the chipmaker raised its revenue forecasts after a successful overhaul of its product line.Rival AMD fared less well, easing 0.8 per cent to $14.16 on Friday after what Robert Rivet, chief executive, described as a “disappointing and unacceptable” first quarter, with lower sales and deteriorating margins.The rally in railway stocks gathered steam as TCI, the activist hedge fund, built a stake in CSX, highlighting the potential for takeovers and asset sales in this cash-generative sector.Shares in CSX jumped 6.1 per cent to $4504.Atticus, a hedge fund that has worked with TCI in the past, already holds big stakes in railway groups, including Union Pacific, which rose 6.8 per cent this week to $117.21.Homebuilders bounced off their lows for the year as fears eased about the severity of the housing market downturn. The S&P Homebuilders index jumped 8.6 per cent while DR Horton rose 8.9 per cent to $23.39.
87;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-04-10T21:14:50Z;Buffett hears the train a comin’ down the track;;When the southern Californian ports and railroad yards handling Asian container imports were overwhelmed by a sudden surge in volumes in the summer and autumn 2004, there was a telling difference between the yards of the area’s two main rail operators.At those of Union Pacific, which runs North America’s largest track network, chaos was nearly complete, with customers’ containers often left for many days before a train could be found to take them to distribution centres and retailers in the eastern US.At the yards of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which has the second-biggest network, trains ran much more smoothly, even if many goods still suffered some delays.BNSF’s superior handling of the 2004 crisis resulted from an investment programme which had been criticised by many investors as over-expensive but meant the company had more double-track lines, sidings and other facilities than Union Pacific at the key moment.It is the kind of superior management which, many observers believe, has encouraged Warren Buffett, the world’s most famous investor, to make BNSF the biggest of several investments in North America’s once-unfashionable railroad sector. It emerged over the weekend that Mr Buffett had invested $3bn to buy a 10.9 per cent stake in BNSF, based in Fort Worth, Texas.The 2004 traffic surge – which has continued at a less dramatic rate since as the global outsourcing boom has continued – also illustrates why BNSF is not the only attractive investment in the sector.Alongside BNSF, Mr Buffett has confirmed that he has invested $1.4bn in two other rail operators – presumably others among the seven large operators known as the Class I Railroads, although he has not identified the companies involved.Anthony Hatch, a New York-based independent railroad analyst, says there is strong growth in several traffic areas, including chemicals, grain and coal – where the construction of new coal-fired power stations has boosted demand for low-sulphur coal from regions such as Wyoming’s Powder River Basin.The railroads have also benefited from increasing competitiveness against trucking, which for decades ate away at their freight business. Trucks – which consume more fuel for a given cargo than rail – have been worse affected than rail operators by rising oil prices. Truck operators have also suffered worse from the tightness of supply in the US labour market.The surge in volumes of container traffic – known as intermodal traffic – following the boom in manufacturing outsourcing to Asia has been the most important growth factor, however.“The change in intermodal traffic from being marginal to being the star performer is really the single story that has been driving [the surge in investor interest],” Mr Hatch says.According to Henry Posner, a US-based international railroad investor, BNSF’s achievement has been to make the highly competitive intermodal market profitable – a sign of its generally excellent management. Mr Buffett is known to target strong management teams for his investments.“Everybody talks about intermodal as being the big growth area and having the big potential and that’s true,” Mr Posner says. “But it’s also by definition a low-margin business because every trucker is your competition and every other railroad is also in that market.”However, the most important change for railroads – and Mr Buffett – may be a less obvious one. According to Ken Hoexter, a transport analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, the past few months have for the first time in many decades seen three Class I railroads – BNSF, Canadian National and Norfolk Southern – boost their returns on investment to above their cost of capital. Another two operators – CSX and Union Pacific – are expected to meet the measure soon.The change should mean investment in growth should become far easier.“That’s a monumental achievement,” Mr Hoexter says. “[Railroads] have not achieved that [return] for almost 90 years as a group. It’s allowing them to reinvest in their core business.”
88;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2007-04-09T22:09:29Z;Buffet buys heavily into US railroad sector;;The value of the largest North American railroad companies was boosted on Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway emerged as a big investor in the sector.Over the weekend, Mr Buffett’s conglomerate disclosed that it had amassed a 10.9 per cent stake, worth more than $3bn, in Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the Texas-based freight company. The news sent Burlington shares soaring to close up 6.6 per cent at $88.17 on Monday.The effect of Mr Buffett’s investment in Burlington quickly spread to other big railroad companies, particularly after a Berkshire Hathaway spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters that the company was also investing nearly $1.4bn in two other railroad groups.The biggest gain came at Canadian National Railway, whose shares rose 5.3 per cent. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern rose 3.8 per cent, while Canadian Pacific gained 3.1 per cent and CSX was up 2.2 per cent. The companies being targeted by Berkshire have not been identified.The North American railroad industry has for several months been considered a prime candidate for investment by buy-out groups. This is because freight operators generally have little debt on their balance sheets given the steady cashflows they are generating. Moreover, railroad businesses have been performing relatively well amid tight supply in the trucking industry.However, the first quarter brought signs of a slowdown, as a series of winter storms and the slowdown in the housing market brought fears of lower volumes.CNBC first reported Berkshire’s plans to invest in the two railroad groups besides Burlington.Burlington generated $1.9bn in net income last year from about $15bn in revenues. One of the main business of the company, which has a market value of nearly $31bn, is to transport coal and other commodities.The disclosure of Mr Buffett’s interest in the railroad sector comes only three weeks ahead of Berkshire’s annual meeting with shareholders, a two-day pilgrimage by investors to the company’s hometown of Omaha, Nebraska.Berkshire has made a number of large investments in recent years, including acquisitions of PacifiCorp, the electrical utility, Russell, the clothing manufacturer, and Iscar, the Israeli tool manufacturer. Because of Mr Buffett’s long and successful track record, the destination of Berkshire’s money is closely followed on Wall Street and around the world.A Berkshire spokeswoman declined any further comment on the company’s acquisition plans.
89;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2006-10-26T17:11:02Z;The Short View: Corporate America - red or blue?;;Should investors care about the political beliefs of executives? According to the managers of the Blue Fund, a mutual fund launched in the US in time for the mid-term elections, they should. The name (as in “blue states”) shows it is designed for Democrats. But its also shows republicans how to invest in line with their politics.Blue Fund looks at the political donations a company has made from corporate political action committees, and from the pockets of its three most senior executives. It argues that companies that consistently give the bulk of their political donations to one party, even when they are out of power (excluding those bidding for a share of the pork barrel), show true commitment.The research has yielded lists of “red” and “blue” companies, which gave 95 per cent of their donations to Republicans and Democrats respectively over the past 10 years. The bluest include Google, Apple Computer, Starbucks and Costco. The reddest include Exxon Mobil, Union Pacific, International Paper, Halliburton and Dell.Democrats will be pleased to know that the index of 76 “blue” companies has thrashed its “red” rivals under the Bush administration. Over the five years to June this year, the blue index gained 139 per cent, compared with 34 per cent for the S&P 500, which in turn beat the red index. Even excluding recent stars Google and Apple, the blues are easily ahead.How seriously should we take this? It may be a fluke. Republicans could argue that after such a rally it looks time to sell blue stocks, and they should dispute the Blue Fund’s contention that Apple’s principles have helped it to be more innovative than Dell. Dell’s political conservatism did not stop it from revolutionising its industry in the 1990s.Over a longer period, Dell and Apple do look principled. Both have been donating against their apparent self-interest. Under President Bill Clinton, Dell grew at 93.8 per cent per year, according to Bloomberg data, while Apple fell at a 4.6 per cent annual clip. Under President George W. Bush, Dell has limped along at 3.8 per cent a year, while Apple grew at 47.5 per cent. Go figure.
90;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2006-07-27T19:49:53Z;Former Bush aide joins Union Pacific;;Andrew Card, former chief of staff for President George W. Bush, has joined the board of Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, reinforcing the close relationship between the Bush administration and big business.Mr Card left the White House in March as part of a staff shake-up designed to reinvigorate Mr Bush’s stalling second term agenda and stem decline in his poll ratings.Before joining the Bush administration in 2000, he served as head of government relations for General Motors, the carmaker, and was secretary of transportation under Mr Bush’s father in the early 1990s.His recruitment by Union Pacific comes at a time when rail operators are lobbying Congress for tax breaks and fighting calls from customers for tougher regulation of the industry.Mr Card is following in the footsteps of Vice President Dick Cheney, who served on the Union Pacific board until the 2000 election, underlining the Nebraska-based company’s stellar political connections.John Snow, who resigned as US Treasury Secretary in May, also had a history in the rail industry, having previously been chief executive of CSX, one of Union Pacific’s biggest rivals.Rail operators have worked hard to forge good relations with the White House and Capitol Hill over the past few decades as the industry lobbied for deregulation and then underwent a wave of consolidation.The industry has faced mounting political scrutiny over recent months as rail prices have soared while service has deteriorated because of severe congestion throughout the network. Rail operators have asked Congress for tax incentives to spur investment in additional capacity.Union Pacific last week announced a 64 per cent increase in second quarter net profits, amid record demand for its services.The company is a large political donor to the Republican party, having given $674,785 to its candidates during the current election cycle, compared with less than $200,000 to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a political funding watchdog.Before his spell with GM, Mr Card was head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the lobby group for the US car industry.As White House chief of staff, he was one of Mr Bush’s most trusted and influential aides, having been close to the Bush family for two decades.He became more widely known in September 2001 as the man who whispered to Mr Bush news of the terrorist attacks on New York as the president read a story to schoolchildren.

91;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:14:34+0000;UPS battered by retail weakness;;Shares in UPS plunged nearly 16 per cent in early trading on Tuesday after the package delivery group reported disappointing second-quarter earnings and warned of a worsening economic outlook for the remainder of the year.UPS and other express delivery groups are viewed as important economic bellwethers because of their increasingly central role in global supply chains.Scott Davis, chief financial officer, said the group did not expect a severe downturn but it was becoming clear that a slowdown was under way.“Every indication says there are some challenges and headwinds out there, but we’re not saying the sky is falling in,” he told investors. “We’re saying that growth is going to moderate from the levels we’ve seen.”Mr Davis said shipments by manufacturers remained strong but some of the group’s retail customers were showing signs of weakness.Express delivery groups such as UPS and FedEx have enjoyed several years of rapid expansion on the back of soaring global trade and increasing demand for just-in-time services.But Tuesday’s results and guidance from UPS triggered a sell-off throughout the US freight transportation sector in expectation of slower growth.BNSF, the second-largest US rail operator, saw its stock fall nearly 5 per cent despite reporting a forecast-beating 28 per cent increase in second-quarter net profits.All the other big US rail companies, such as Union Pacific and CSX, have also reported strong results over the past week, but investors have preferred to focus on the uncertain outlook.UPS’s net earnings were up 7 per cent at $1.06bn, or 97 cents a share, but missed Wall Street’s consensus forecast of $1 a share, in part because of surging fuel prices.Jet fuel prices increased by 14 per cent and diesel fuel by 11 per cent during the quarter, causing $21m in unexpected costs, according to Mr Davis.Like most freight carriers, UPS recovers some of its fuel costs through a customer surcharge, but there is a 41-day lag before increased prices are factored into the rate.Mr Davis warned that full-year earnings growth would be at the lower end of the group’s 11-16 per cent target, but stressed that demand for express delivery services remained solid.Mr Davis indicated that he did not expect a prolonged economic slowdown and forecast that UPS would return to stronger growth next year.Shares in UPS closed 10.25 per cent lower on Tuesday at $71.80 - up from an intraday low of $67.25.
92;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2006-03-17T18:39:41Z;Wall Street bulls come out in force;;"An explosive start to the bank reporting season and fading concerns over interest rates brought out the bulls on Wall Street this week, with the main indices hitting their highest levels for nearly five years.Benign US inflation and housing data helped relieve worries about the outlook for US interest rates. After racking up three consecutive days of gains, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its advance yesterday, rising 0.2 per cent to close at 11,279.65.The S&P 500, which broke through the 1,300 mark on Wednesday for the first time since May 2001, edged up another 0.2 per cent to 1,307.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to settle at 2,306.48.This took the weekly gain for the Dow to 1.8 per cent, for the S&P to 2 per cent and for the Nasdaq to 2 per cent.The week produced record quarterly figures from Wall Street’s top investment banks, which defied expectations that their trading businesses would suffer as US short-term interest rates increased.Goldman Sachs set the bar for its peers on Tuesday as it delivered first-quarter net profits 50 per cent ahead of analyst forecasts.The stellar performance was followed by Lehman Brothers, which unveiled a 24 per cent jump in quarterly earnings and Bear Stearns, which reported a
34 per cent earnings increase on the back of strong performances in trading, derivatives, investment banking and wealth management.Brad Hintz, analyst at Bernstein Research, said he expected merchant banking “to remain an exceptional business in 2006”.Goldman Sachs ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $150.36, while Lehman and Bear Stearns inched up 0.5 per cent to $142.80 and 0.5 per cent to $132.87 respectively, having seen their gains pared by profit-taking.Investment banks were not the only ones doing brisk business. Charles Schwab shot up 11 per cent to $18.13 after the discount broker issued a bullish first-quarter forecast, saying client trade was up 52 per cent last month, compared with the same period a year before.Railroad stocks also chugged ahead after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit guidance by 20 per cent, and CSX, the third-
biggest, was upgraded by analysts at UBS.Separately, Merrill Lynch raised its price estimates on Union and four other rail companies, saying railroads had benefited from increased shipping of commodities such as coal.The Dow Jones transportation index gained 2.2 per cent for the week. The S&P railroads index jumped 6.2 per cent, led by Union, up 6.2 per cent to $91.07 and CSX, up 7.6 per cent to $59.46.Energy stocks had a lacklustre start to the week, thanks to data which revealed rising crude inventory levels in the US. However, that news was overshadowed by mounting tensions in Iraq.The announcement by the US military of the start of “Operation Swarmer” – the largest aerial bombing campaign since the 2003 invasion – saw traders rush to cover short positions.Heavyweight oil stocks felt the benefit of heightened worries over the sustainability of crude supplies, with ExxonMobil climbing 3.2 per cent to $61.05, Chevron up 5.7 per cent to $57.18 and Marathon Oil putting on
9.9 per cent to $76.36.The upswing in crude prices weighed on chipmakers. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, which tumbled 3.2 per cent on Thursday, ended the week with a loss of 1.2 per cent. Advanced Micro Devices led the way with a 7.3 per cent fall to $33.95 as investors exited the sector to jump on the energy bandwagon.Merrill Lynch said it believed investors were factoring in the reality that there was little additional volume growth upside or margin leverage left in the semiconductor sector.North Fork Bancorp climbed 14.8 per cent to $29.10 after credit card issuer Capital One Financial said it had agreed to buy the company in a $14.6bn cash-and-shares deal. Calyon Securities said the deal came as a surprise, but it was a good acquisition at a reasonable price. Shares in Capital One fell 8.9 per cent to $81.90.General Motors, which tumbled nearly 5 per cent yesterday after announcing 2005 losses were $2bn deeper than previously thought, ended the week 2.4 per cent lower at $21.13."
93;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-23T23:01:00+0000;Overview: US equities rally on Fed’s upbeat economic survey;;US equities rallied strongly again on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index passing 1,300 for the first time in almost five years, as the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey helped to relieve fears about the economy.The Beige Book, a round-up of anecdotal evidence from the bank’s regions, suggested the economy had expanded at a “moderate or steady” pace in January and February, with little sign that wages were creating inflationary pressure. It said: “Contacts noted ongoing input cost pressures, but prices at the retail level increased at only a moderate rate.”Deutsche Bank said: “The bottom line is that the underlying picture of above-trend growth and contained inflation remains intact.” It said labour cost pressures “remain more or less contained”.The release was taken as evidence that the risk of further Fed tightening might have been overdone, and triggered a rally for the S&P 500, which had been trading fractionally lower when the report was released. By the close, the S&P had gained 0.43 per cent for the day. It is now up more than 4.5 per cent for the year, amid hopes by dealers that the stock market has broken out of its trading range of the last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.52 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.69 per cent.The rise in stocks was broadly based, but received extra fuel from gains in the railroad sector, which was boosted by a bullish profit outlook from Union Pacific.A dip in oil prices following the release of weekly US inventories data also helped the stock market. The figures showed that crude inventories had increased for a fifth consecutive week and to their highest level since May 1999.Benchmark US crude futures, which had risen 5 per cent since the end of last week, dipped back below the $63 a barrel mark.However, the Beige Book only marginally assuaged concerns on the bond market raised by a surprisingly strong survey of manufacturing in New York state. The yield on the 10-year note had risen to 4.74 per cent from 4.7 per cent at Tuesday’s close, and only fell marginally on the publication of the Beige Book, retreating to 4.73 per cent.The currency markets instead focused on Treasury data showing that net capital inflows into the US in January were insufficient to cover that month’s record trade deficit. The dollar slipped to its lowest level against the euro for more than a week, and also lost ground against the Swiss franc. It was little changed against the yen.Elsewhere equities enjoyed a strong day. European stocks eased back from the day’s best levels but still closed at a fresh four-and-a-half year high as bid and merger rumours continued to bubble around the markets. The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index finally settled at 1,368.44, up 0.2 per cent, having earlier touched 1,371.65.In Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average rose 0.5 per cent as securities stocks received a boost from hopes of continued interest in the stock market from retail investors.The rest of the region was broadly higher, with Hong Kong climbing 1.3 per cent, its best one-day gain for almost seven weeks, and Taipei firming 0.9 per cent.Among precious metals, silver touched a new 22-year high of $10.37 an ounce, according to Reuters data, amid talk that an exchange- traded silver fund could soon be launched. Gold rose to a one-week peak of $556.90 before paring its advance by the close of trade.
94;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2006-03-15T22:05:28Z;Wall Street powers ahead to 5-year highs;;The S&P 500 broke the 1,300 mark on Wednesday as fading concerns about US interest rates helped propel the index above the psychologically important resistance barrier. It prompted hopes that stocks have broken out of their recent trading range.The rally started in afternoon trade after the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report said the US economy was growing at a steady, moderate pace with inflationary pressures contained. The report was widely taken as evidence that the central bank would soon be done with its cycle of monetary tightening.The news triggered a rally among industrial blue chips. Caterpillar surged 3.3 per cent to $74.29, while Honeywell gained 1.2 per cent to $42.85. The blue chip index also found support in DuPont, which rose 2.7 per cent to $42.81 after the chemicals manufacturer increased its first-quarter profit forecast and announced a restructuring plan.This, along with a dip in crude prices, sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.52 per cent higher to 11,209.77, while the S&P 500 gained 0.43 per cent to 1,303.02 – its highest close in almost five years – and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.69 per cent to 2,311.84.“This is the first time in recent memory we have had a two-day rally,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The follow-through is important because it gets a lot of people to wake to the fact that this market is getting some life.”The railways sector was in focus after Union Pacific, the largest US rail operator, raised first-quarter profit estimates by 20 per cent.The revised guidance prompted Merrill Lynch to raise its price estimates for Union and four other rail companies. “We believe this is a clear signal that the rail industry continues to benefit from record pricing gains and subsequent earnings leverage,” Merrill said.The S&P transportation index jumped 1.8 per cent, boosted by shares of Union, up 5.9 per cent at $90.25, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, up 6.3 per cent at $81.30 and Norfolk Southern, up 4.7 per cent at $53.92.Investors also had their eyes on the banking sector after Lehman Brothers became the second major investment bank to report record quarterly profits and revenue. First-quarter earnings rose 24 per cent but Lehman shares fell 0.8 per cent to $144.15 as investors took profits after the previous session’s gains.Bear Stearns, due to report its results today, was down 0.2 per cent to $134.21 while Morgan Stanley, which will release its figures next week, fell 0.7 per cent to $59.64.Elsewhere, Sears Holdingssurged 12.8 per cent to $132.29 after it delivered first-quarter profits that beat market expectations.Shares in CVS fell 2.8 per cent to $29.71 after the pharmacy chain said the Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an informal investigation into its accounting practices.Shares in H&R Block dropped 6.2 per cent to $20.63 as the biggest tax preparer in the US became the latest company to draw the attention of the New York state attorney, Eliot Spitzer. Mr Spitzer said his office has charged the company with fraud, alleging that H&R Block duped clients into investing their tax refunds in retirement accounts that cost more in fees than they generated in interest.
95;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2005-08-14T15:58:31Z;US grapples with rails' heavy load;;US railroad operators are increasing investment in infrastructure and labour as they seek to overcome chronic congestion across the system.CSX, one of the biggest US rail freight carriers, last week became the latest to lift capital expenditure, with some of the additional cash earmarked for urgently-needed capacity expansion.Congestion on the railroads is part of a broader capacity crisis gripping the country's freight transportation system, with ocean ports and truck operators also under strain.Railroad operators have sought to tackle the problem by hiring thousands of new workers, leasing more rolling stock and building new tracks and rail yards.CSX said annual capital expenditure over the next two years would be $1.3bn-$1.4bn, up from an average of $1bn over the past three years. The increase will fund large-scale infrastructure improvement projects on two of the company's busiest lines: those between Chicago and Florida and between Albany and New York City.“These investments will enable CSX to meet demand for freight service to the rapidly growing south-east while continuing to improve service in the populous north-east,” said Michael Ward, chief executive.However, with construction not scheduled to start until 2006, the investment will do nothing to ease congestion this year.Most operators, among them Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and BNSF, have improved service levels compared with last year.But delays continue to blight the rail network, especially around large ocean ports and coal mining regions. A combination of record demand for energy and rail bottlenecks have caused some power stations to run short of coal.Analysts blame the railroad capacity crunch on years of under-investment in infrastructure and reductions in workforce.Many critics believe this year's increases in spending fall far short of what is needed. Railroads, scarred by decades of boom-to-bust cycles, are reluctant to invest too much for fear of being left with surplus capacity should the economy falter.Soaring demand and capacity shortages helped railroad operators achieve record profits over recent quarters. Share prices in the sector have also risen.CSX's Mr Ward said a co-operative relationship was developing between road and rail services, with long distance freight shipments increasingly being made by rail while local deliveries were made by road.Mr Ward predicted that US freight hauling demand would increase by 40 per cent over the next 15 years, assuming average annual increases in industrial production and consumer spending of at least 3 per cent.
96;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2005-03-22T21:21:22Z;Wall St dives as Fed hints at faster rate rises;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday after investors interpreted comments that accompanied a widely expected quarter-point interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve to mean that the US central bank may quicken the pace of its inflation-fighting moves.The leading US indices gave up earlier gains to fall sharply in the wake of the announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 10,470.43. The S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,171.87, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9 per cent to 1,985.50.Market-watchers had long expected the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter point to 2.75 per cent. But stocks turned lower minutes after the Fed announced the change, as investors interpreted the wording of the announcement to mean that a more agressive programme of interest rate rises could be on the way.Jack Caffrey, equity analyst at JPMorgan Private Bank, said the Fed’s programme of slow and steady quarter-point rate rises was beginning to take effect.“People are being forced to make economic decisions, rather than just dig into savings,” he said.Traders were also digesting new data on producer prices showing that headline prices rose 0.4 per cent in February – slightly ahead of forecasts. Meanwhile, the price of oil retreated from near-record highs.Mergers and acquisitions continued to grab attention after Retek, the US software group, agreed to a $643m takeover by Oracle, the business software company.Retek shares slipped 2.3 per cent to $11.20 as investors gave up on the prospect of a counterbid from SAP, Oracle’s European arch-rival. Oracle shares fell 1 per cent to $12.53.Elsewhere, Electronic Arts, the video game company, fell 16.4 per cent to $55.45 after a profit warning.General Mills, maker of Cheerios cereal, fell 3.5 per cent to $49.73 after its quarterly earnings fell.Shares in Lennar, the housebuilder, rose 1.6 per cent to $55.77 after it reported higher quarterly profits.Wyeth, the drugs group, rose 3.7 per cent to $40.36 after it raised its quarterly guidance.Transport stocks led gainers on the S&P 500 after Union Pacific, the railroad group, raised its earnings forecasts. The company said it expected to earn 43-48 cents a share in the first quarter, up substantially from its previous estimate of 25-35 cents a share. UP shares rose 4.7 per cent to $69.18.UP shares, which fell in January after a bout of profit-taking, rose 3.5 per cent to $68.40 by midday – a new high for the year.Alcoa fell 1.4 per cent to $31.02 after the aluminium producer announced the sale of a Norwegian subsidiary. Alcoa also said it would cut 2000 jobs in an effort to cut down on costs.Insurers were among the day’s biggest losers. AIG, the biggest US insurer, fell 2.8 per cent to $56.30 as the departure of its chief executive last week amid a government probe continued to reverberate through the market.Consumer products groups fell after the Federal Trade Commission requested information about Procter & Gamble’s planned $57bn merger with Gillette. P&G shares fell 1.2 per cent to $52.13. Gillette fell 1.3 per cent to $49.66. Colgate-
Palmolive, P&G’s chief rival, fell 1.9 per cent to $50.68.Among retailers,Wal-Mart fell 0.4 per cent to $50.98. KMart slipped 1.2 per cent to $127.25."
97;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2004-12-21T21:40:51Z;Wall St hits three-and-a-half year high;;"Wall Street steamed ahead on Tuesday, boosted by strong gains in transportation stocks and an upbeat report from the chip sector. Pharmaceuticals were also in the spotlight after a new study raised fresh questions about painkiller safety.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.9 per cent to 10,759.43 - a 3½-year high - while the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent at 1,205.45. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,150.91.A strong rally in October and November has left shares in the leading US indices hovering near their highest levels since 2001, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq touching 3½-year highs last week. The strong gains that came in the wake of the US presidential election have given way this month to slower progress on Wall Street, however, leaving stocks trading mostly flat in spite of a slew of year-end merger and acquisition activity.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries & Co, said an expected slowdown in corporate earnings growth seemed to be the biggest factor keeping gains in check.Earnings among companies in the S&P 500 grew by 19 per cent this year, while forecasts for next year are 10 per cent.""I would argue that stock valuations still are relatively attractive, especially given the interest rate environment,"" said Mr Hogan.Most analysts predict that the stock market will continue to creep higher until the year's end, as bullish investors look to the first post-Christmas trading sessions for signs of sustained vigour. One analyst said he expected to increased volatility in share prices this week as Wall Street gradually empties ahead of the Christmas holiday.Transport stocks led gainers on what is traditionally the busiest shipping day of the year. FedEx, the biggest express shipper, rose 0.4 per cent to $100.53, while rival UPS climbed 1 per cent to $86.48.Railroad shares rallied as Union Pacific, the country's biggest independent rail operator, raised its fourth-quarter outlook. Union Pacific shares jumped 5.5 per cent to $65.67. Shares in Norfolk Southern, the third-biggest rail operator by market capitalisation, were up 3 per cent at $36.21, while CSX, the rail freight group, rose 2 per cent to $39.82.Railroads have seen record shipping volumes this year, driven by a booming harvest in the midwest and soaring demand for US exports.Semiconductor stocks jumped as investors welcomed a report from Gartner saying that worldwide chipmaker revenue should grow by 23 per cent this year in spite of a slowdown in growth in the second half. The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 0.7 per cent to 422.48. Intel, the world's biggest microchip company, received an additional boost following a Lehman Brothers upgrade. Intel's shares rose 3.5 per cent to $23.49. Intel's chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 0.5 per cent to $21.73.Pharmaceutical stocks remained in the spotlight after clinical studies raised new questions about the safety of two popular painkillers. Pfizer rebounded after falling more than 16 per cent following Friday's news that its Celebrex arthritis drug increased the risk of heart attacks in patients. Shares in the drugs group rose 2.8 per cent to $24.97 after US health regulators said that Alzheimer's patients taking Celebrex in a separate study did not show elevated cardiac risk. Merck, whose withdrawn Vioxx painkiller uses an active ingredient similar to the one in Celebrex, rose 1.5 per cent to $31.98.The US-listed shares of Bayer, the German drugs group, rose 0.5 per cent in spite of warnings that Naproxen, the active ingredient in Bayer's Aleve painkiller, had increased the risk of heart attacks in the same Alzheimer's trials.Elsewhere, IAC InterActivecorp, the media and travel group run by Barry Diller, jumped 5.9 per cent to $27.41 after it said it would spin off its Expedia online travel service.Investors were also focused on financial stocks on Tuesday after earnings reports by two big US investment banks. Morgan Stanley, the biggest US investment bank by volume, rose 1.6 per cent to $54.50 as earnings beat expectations. Bear Stearns gave up early gains to fall 1.7 per cent to $102.70 after it reported sharply higher quarterly profits.Energy stocks were the laggards among the S&P 500, with Sunoco shares down 0.1 per cent to $82.88. John Herrlin, vice president at Merrill Lynch, said petroleum prices were likely to remain volatile in the short term."
98;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2004-11-14T22:37:51Z;Freight prices expected to boost US rail industry;;North America's railway companies are likely to remain buoyed by higher rail freight prices as an acute driver shortage afflicts the trucking industry and as record demand for coal and agricultural shipments drives rail freight volumes.But the industry remains bedevilled by rail bottlenecks, high fuel prices and high employee attrition rates, posing difficulties for some of the less efficient operators.James Valentine, transportation analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report: “We have increased confidence that the recent pricing gains by the railroads are likely to persist into 2005, especially for those railroads that can provide strong service levels.”The four largest US-based companies recently reported generally higher than expected third-quarter earnings and record revenues amid strong demand for coal, chemicals and agricultural goods. The demand is being driven by an improving US economy and demand from China.With rail and trucking capacity forecast to remain under strain for at least the next 12 months, the current high pricing environment is likely to stay robust, analysts say.But not all railways have made equal progress overcoming network congestion and slowing train speeds a key measure of efficiency.Companies are also in the midst of hiring programmes after 2001 legislation allowing early retirement. Dave Dealy, vice president of transportation at Burlington Northern Sante Fe, told analysts on Friday: “We could possibly lose about half our current transportation employee base in the next five to six years.”BNSF, which operates a network in the western US, said third-quarter freight revenues were up 16 per cent year-on-year. Excluding a charge related to asbestos liability accounting, earnings per share were 77 cents, compared with 55 cents last time.Mr Valentine said BNSF's operating results were “impressive”.Union Pacific, which serves two-thirds of the US west of the Mississippi river, reported the same earnings per share. Gregory Burns, US air freight and surface transportation analyst at JP Morgan, said Union Pacific's third-quarter pricing growth was “lacklustre” and that margins contracted due to high fuel costs and network congestion.CSX Corporation, which operates the largest network in the eastern US, is in the midst of a turnround plan.While it reported earnings per share of 50 cents, excluding a restructuring charge, compared with a loss last year of minus 48 cents, Mr Valentine said: “We continue to believe that there is considerably more execution risk at CSX than its competitors, given the uncertainty surrounding the turnround of its operations.”
99;UNP;Union Pacific Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
