0;MET;Metlife Inc;2019-02-06T22:05:51Z;MetLife earnings nearly double on US strength;;US-based insurer MetLife said that its adjusted earnings almost doubled in the fourth quarter of last year as the impact of tax changes and volume growth more than offset weaker investment markets and lower margins.The company said on Wednesday that adjusted earnings rose 97 per cent to $1.3bn, or $1.35 per share, in the period.The performance was driven by the core US business, where earnings grew 38 per cent. Latin American earnings were up 10 per cent, although profits from Asia slipped by a similar amount.Steven Kandarian, MetLife’s chief executive, said: “While market conditions were challenging in the fourth quarter, our businesses performed exceptionally well overall in 2018,” adding that the company had returned $5.7bn to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.The company announced last month that Michel Khalaf, who has been president of the US business since 2017, will replace Mr Kandarian in May.Shares in MetLife were down 2.7 per cent in after-hours trading.
1;MET;Metlife Inc;2019-01-08T13:57:40Z;MetLife names Michel Khalaf as chief executive;Head of US business to take helm with insurer’s share price having disappointed the market;MetLife has announced Michel Khalaf will become chief executive, replacing Steven Kandarian, who will retire after eight years running the large, diversified US insurer.Mr Khalaf, 54, has been president of the company’s US business, its largest unit, since 2017. He has also led the company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa operations since 2011.Under Mr Kandarian the company cut costs, returned capital to shareholders, and closed significant mergers — but his tenure was also marked by painful mis-steps in its pension business and a spin-off that has been a stock market disappointment.Shares in MetLife have returned 32 per cent since Mr Kandarian started in the top job in 2011, significantly less than the broader market, insurance industry indices and MetLife’s rival Prudential Financial.“[MetLife] is long overdue for a well-articulated vision and strategy,” said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA, an independent research house. She noted that Mr Khalaf’s background in global insurance fitted the role well. “We think there will be heightened pressure on Khalaf to stretch the organisation for future growth, while also ensuring its day to day operations remain on track.”Mr Kandarian objected to the systemically important financial institution designation imposed by US regulators and, hoping to shed it, MetLife spun off Brighthouse Financial, which includes MetLife’s market-sensitive annuities business, last year.Brighthouse shares have lost more than 50 per cent of their value since their debut. A federal appeals court dismissed MetLife’s Sifi status last year.In late 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to pay benefits it owed to thousands of “lost” pensioners. Last January it announced a $575m charge in connection with the unpaid benefits and warned of “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting. John Hele, the insurer’s chief financial officer at the time, was replaced in the wake of the debacle.“[Kandarian] was there when the restatement happened and they needed to move beyond that, and the stock hasn’t done well — but last year was also a very bad year for life insurance stocks in general,” said Elyse Greenspan, insurance analyst at Wells Fargo.Mr Khalaf, who joined MetLife in 2010 through its acquisition of Alico from American International Group, will take up his new role in May. Glenn Hubbard, the company’s independent lead director, will become non-executive chairman when Mr Kandarian vacates that post, also at the end of April.MetLife shares closed 0.5 per cent higher at $42.77 in New York on Tuesday.
2;MET;Metlife Inc;2018-06-19T04:00:37Z;Loosening the law that haunts bankers puts us at risk;The powerful Martin Act targeted fraud but a new ruling has curbed its reach;For the past 15 years, global banks and other big financial services groups have lived in fear of an old New York state anti-fraud law. The Martin Act has been used to crack down on biased Wall Street research, insurance bid-rigging and “dark pools” said to mislead traders, among many things.Unlike federal and other state laws, the 1921 Martin Act does not require its enforcers to prove that their target intended to deceive, or ever sold or bought securities. It also gives civil and criminal enforcement authority to the New York attorney-general’s office, a powerful combination that terrifies its targets and prompts most of them to pull out their cheque books and settle. Not Credit Suisse. Last week the Swiss bank fought an $11bn mortgage fraud case all the way to New York’s highest court and won. The court held, 4-1, that cases must be brought within three years of alleged wrongdoing rather than six as previously thought.Credit Suisse was quick to crow that its victory was “significant not only for this case but for all future industry proceedings”. The attorney-general’s office, now headed by Barbara Underwood, countered that the impact was limited because most of the big cases under the act have been brought within three years. Still, legal analysts concluded that the ruling would significantly curb the Martin Act’s reach, making it a less effective weapon against new types of fraud or unethical behaviour that do not naturally fit under traditional laws. The Credit Suisse case is the latest in a string of successful challenges to US financial services watchdogs. Earlier this year, Barclays won its multibillion dollar gamble by settling a mortgage-backed securities case for $2bn. It had refused an earlier demand for $5bn, saying it would rather go to court. In 2016, MetLife sued over a decision to designate it a “systemically important” institution and subject it to higher scrutiny. The insurer won. And former AIG chief executive Hank Greenberg last year settled a $50m false accounting claim for $9m after 12 years of legal wrangling. As the 2008 financial crisis recedes, the industry is becoming emboldened, both in terms of lobbying to loosen regulations and in fighting back against the enforcement agencies. Often these judicial challenges are appropriate. The MetLife designation was one of the first of its kind, and it makes sense to test new rules. For their part, the Credit Suisse and Barclays matters help counter the view, especially in Europe, that American financial watchdogs use their legal system to weaken and extract fines from large overseas competitors. Strict court oversight helps restore faith in the system.But there is a potential risk to hemming in US enforcers. The American system relies on fears of criminal prosecution and giant fines to help keep banks and insurers honest. If financial executives believe they can successfully challenge enforcement actions in court, they may be more willing to countenance risky or unethical behaviour in the name of boosting profits.The latest court challenges coincide with a resurgence of profits at many of the world’s largest investment banks and new plans to loosen the “Volcker rule” ban on banks trading with their own money. Taken all together, these developments will provide the industry with much more freedom. That will serve as a genuine test of bankers’ claims that they have changed their industry’s culture for the better since the financial crisis. We have to hope that they pass.It is also worth remembering why the Martin Act exists. Eric Dinallo, who, at the attorney-general’s office, helped pioneer its modern use, points out that it was written to give authorities the power to intervene. “The AG’s office would literally seize a boiler room’s marketing material before it hit the streets,” he says. “With the internet, that aspect of the act may be more relevant than ever. In law enforcement’s eyes, once you hit the send button, the money is gone.”brooke.masters@ft.com
3;MET;Metlife Inc;2018-05-01T16:48:19Z;MetLife finance chief leaves after reserves debacle;Insurer is dealing with fallout of failure to pay pensions to 13,500 people;MetLife’s chief financial officer has been replaced with immediate effect, months after the second-biggest US insurer by assets warned of problems with its reserves and financial reporting.Just a day before MetLife is due to publish its first-quarter financial results on Wednesday, the life and pensions group said John Hele was leaving after six years.The Canadian, 59, was retiring, MetLife said. He was replaced on Tuesday by John McCallion, the company’s treasurer, although Mr Hele would stay on as an adviser until September.The departure comes after the insurer acknowledged that over a period of about 25 years, it failed to make hundreds of millions of dollars of pension payments to about 13,500 people.MetLife had presumed individuals who were entitled to the payouts “would never respond” if the company’s employees made only two attempts to reach them without success.The practice allowed executives to boost past profits because the insurer released funds from financial reserves that were supposed to support the pension payouts.Earlier this year the company booked a $550m charge to cover the unpaid obligations. Then, in March, it disclosed new problems. The company had over-reserved for annuity payouts in Japan by almost $900m.“A series of issues that fell within the financial reporting function have been a source of investor frustration,” said Sean Dargan, analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.Jay Gelb, at Barclays, said in a note to clients that the timing of the departure — so close to the company’s earnings — “raises obvious questions” about “whether MetLife’s string of various charges is over, or if there are more to come”.Investors have speculated that the episode could lead to broad management changes at MetLife, whose chief executive Steven Kandarian has been in his position for seven years.Before the missing pensions debacle, Mr Hele had won admiration from investors. The keen sailor is a former chief financial officer of the Dutch financial services group ING and joined MetLife from Arch Capital in 2012.Under Mr Kandarian, Mr Hele helped steer MetLife through a spin-off of its consumer business and its successful fight with financial regulators over its too-big-to-fail label.His departure comes less than a week after MetLife disclosed it had cut Mr Hele’s pay, citing “performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting”.In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Kandarian said: “I want to thank John Hele for his service as CFO and for bringing a sharper focus on the true economics of the business we write.”Regulators including at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Department of Financial Services have been probing the missing pensions episode at MetLife.The company’s shares have lost about 15 per cent since the start of November. They slipped 0.8 per cent on Tuesday.

Mr Hele, appointed in 2012, will stay on as an adviser until September.His departure comes just a day before MetLife is due to publish first-quarter earnings.The second-biggest US insurer by assets has been embroiled in a debacle over missing pension payouts to thousands of Americans. Earlier this year the company said it had failed to pay pensions to some individuals who had “moved jobs, relocated or otherwise could not be located.”The group warned of “material weakness” in its financial reporting, forcing it to boost its reserves by hundreds of millions of dollars.Regulators including at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Department of Financial Services were probing the matter.
5;MET;Metlife Inc;2018-03-26T04:00:34Z;Big insurers convert disrupters to collaborators;Companies are joining forces with start-ups to stay ahead of rivals;"It has become fashionable in the insurance world to say that the industry is ripe for disruption.The combination of an age-old business model, traditional ways of working and high profit margins in some areas have, so the theory goes, made it a certainty that new entrants will come in to shake things up. A recent survey from PwC found that more business leaders from the sector are concerned about the pace of technological change than in any other industry. And yet the sector manages to sail serenely on. There has been no Amazon or Uber equivalent to revolutionise the way insurance works. The world’s biggest names are largely the same ones that were dominating 10 or 20 years ago. Insurance start-ups have yet to make a big impression even though there are plenty of them — around 1,000 globally, according to Oxbow Partners, a consultancy. They will eventually have an impact on the big players, says Roy Jubraj, a managing director at Accenture. “The disruption creeps up on you . . . You are possibly losing market share, there is a lack of productivity and you face competition on price.” There are plenty of areas where disruption could hit unwary companies and technology could give new entrants an edge. Big data gives insurers more information that they can use to assess risk, while artificial intelligence could allow them to make smarter decisions about those risks. The internet of things— smart devices in homes, for example — might allow insurers to spot problems before they happen, so cutting the cost of claims. And blockchain, say some in the industry, will be one of the most disruptive changes of all, giving buyers of insurance more direct access to the people that take on the risks. Chris Sandilands, a partner at Oxbow, says: “The impact of disruption will be felt by insurers jockeying for position as they introduce new technologies. If you don’t focus, you will be less efficient, or have a less accurate understanding of risk.” Some of the start-ups are using technology to challenge incumbents. New York-based Lemonade, which provides home insurance to renters, sold $10m of policies last year and says that it managed to pay one claim within three seconds of it being made. This is a difficult path, though. “Getting traction in a consumer market is tough,” says Mr Sandilands. “It is hard to get the attention of consumers.” Many of the new entrants are not trying to challenge incumbents head-on. Instead, they are developing technologies or techniques that they can sell to the established insurers. For instance, a recent report from Oxbow cited Atidot, which helps insurers to use data; Cytora, which uses AI to select and price risks; and Digital Fineprint, which provides social media analytics, as some of the start-ups that could do well with this model. If minority stakes do not do the trick, the next step is to buy out the start-upIn response to the threats — or opportunities — insurers have tried a variety of strategies, often combining several in an effort to find the formula that will keep them ahead of the competition. One is to develop new products and services in-house. Most insurers do this to some extent, but UK-based Aviva has gone further than many of its rivals. It has set up what it calls a “ digital garage” in London, and another in Singapore, where it puts product teams to work on new ideas. One result is a system that allows Aviva to cut down the number of questions it asks new customers. Setting up internal start-ups is another option, albeit a difficult one. “It is hard to think of many insurers who have successfully launched start-up businesses,” says Mr Sandilands. “The incentives are so different being an entrepreneur and being an employee.” A variation on that theme is for the insurer to set up a venture capital fund to invest in start-ups that look promising, opening the way for co-operation down the line. A clutch of insurers, including Aviva, Axa, Allianz, XL Catlin and MetLife, have their own funds, although there is some scepticism over whether these minority investments really give the insurers much benefit. If minority stakes do not do the trick, the next logical step is to buy out the start-up entirely. Last year, for example, US-based Travelers bought Simply Business, which sells insurance to small businesses, for £400m, more than three times the price that Simply Business was sold for a year earlier. Some insurers provide services to start-ups and make money from their development that way. Munich Re is a prominent example: the reinsurer has teamed up with start-ups including Bought by Many, Neos and Wefox. The start-ups sell the policies, but Munich Re ultimately takes on the risk. The deal works for both parties — the start-ups get access to capital that might otherwise be expensive to find, while Munich Re gets a new business stream. Whatever the strategy, experts say insurers also have to change their culture and staffing if they are to see off the threat from start-ups. “It is critical for traditional organisations to create an environment where they can move at pace,” says Arjen van den Berg, a partner at consultancy Heidrick & Struggles, which has been working with Aviva. Mr Jubraj says staffing is an area where insurers need to take action. “They really need to rethink their workforce, and think about what the workforce of the future will look like . . . There is still quite a lot of work to be done there.”"
6;MET;Metlife Inc;2018-03-02T00:36:55Z;MetLife warns of new reserving problems;US insurer reveals SEC investigation after it over-reserved for annuities in Japan;MetLife, the US life insurer that failed to make pension payments to about 13,500 Americans, has warned of new problems with its reserving — this time in Japan, its biggest overseas market.MetLife disclosed in an annual securities filing on Thursday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating a second “material weakness” after it over-reserved for annuity payouts in the country by almost $900m.The second-largest US life insurer by assets set aside more than was necessary to support guarantees it had offered on variable annuities, a retirement savings product.The episode had no impact on the Japanese policyholders — indeed it meant they had greater financial protection than was necessary — but it could leave MetLife vulnerable to legal action from investors who sold shares before it came to light.Insurance regulators also frown upon overly-conservative reserving, which can allow executives to flatter future financial results by releasing the reserves.Management of the company has determined that the over-reserving represents a material weakness in internal control over financial reportingMetLife’s mistake meant its reported profits in past years were lower than they should have been, and the company on Thursday revised upwards its net income for 2017 by $264m.“Management of the company has determined that the over-reserving represents a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting,” MetLife said in a statement.The latest mishap will add to concerns about oversight at the insurer, which said last month that it had failed to make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of pension payments over 25 years.The problems in the US resulted from MetLife’s practice of presuming customers “would never respond” if staff had made two attempts to reach them without success. The SEC and other regulators are investigating the company over that episode.Executives are trying to resolve the missing US pensions scandal, hiring investigators to track down pensioners who are owed on average $20,000 each.Despite the problem in Japan, shares in MetLife rose 1.3 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday as executives said the resulting release of reserves was expected to free up capital and improve its cash flows.MetLife said it arose because the way it calculated the reserve requirements did not take adequate account of customer withdrawals. It had informed other regulators about the matter as well as the SEC and was “fully co-operating” with them.The affected business in Japan is in “run off”, meaning it no longer sells new policies.
7;MET;Metlife Inc;2018-02-14T18:10:27Z;MetLife hires investigators in search for missing pensioners;US insurer sets aside $510m for missing payments for almost 13,500 people;US insurer MetLife has hired investigators to track down thousands of pensioners as the company seeks to resolve a scandal over missing payouts that has wiped about $8.5bn off its market capitalisation.Executives on Wednesday said they were doing “everything humanly possible” to locate almost 13,500 people— owed on average $20,000 each — after they acknowledged MetLife failed to make proper efforts to find them over 25 years.The failure arose because of practices dating back to the 1990s at MetLife’s pensions “ risk transfer” business, under which companies transfer their retirement liabilities to insurers.MetLife sought to contact eligible pensioners only twice: when they turned 65, and again a few months after the age of 70. If these efforts were unsuccessful, the company presumed the individuals would never be found.As a result, the insurer mistakenly released funds from reserves that support future annuity payouts. The problem was brought to the attention of Michel Khalaf, recently appointed head of Metlife’s US division, in October.The second-biggest US insurer by assets has had to provision $510m to account for the unpaid annuities. It has turned to location professionals at California-based Pension Benefit Information to help find the lost retirees by the summer.Staff are also using the public records specialist Accurint, a division of LexisNexis, and have launched a campaign of phone calls and certified mailings. Retirees who they manage to locate will be due a lump sum to compensate for missing back payments.In a hint that employees might lose jobs over the episode, Steven Kandarian, chairman and chief executive, said managers were “taking action to hold people accountable”.To date, MetLife has not found any evidence of intentional wrongdoing. We are undertaking a thorough review of our practices, processes and people to understand where we fell shortMr Kandarian — the former head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency that safeguards retirement schemes — said the episode was “especially distressing to me” and “deeply embarrassing”.Shareholders in MetLife have taken fright at the reserve charge and the threat to its reputation. Shares have fallen 14 per cent since the company warned two weeks ago it would need to book a charge of more than half a billion dollars to cover the unmet obligations.The mishap has prompted investors to question other US insurers about their practices. Mark Grier, vice-chairman of Prudential Financial, said last week that the debacle at MetLife was “certainly getting a lot of attention”.“There are inevitably some customers we can’t locate for a number of reasons, but that number is small,” he said, adding he was “comfortable” the company was “meeting our obligations”.As part of efforts to ensure the episode does not happen again, MetLife said it would now start sending annual letters to workers once they turned 55. They would send three letters as soon as they reached 65, including a certified mailing.Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Department of Financial Services are investigating.Mr Kandarian said: “To date, MetLife has not found any evidence of intentional wrongdoing. We are undertaking a thorough review of our practices, processes and people to understand where we fell short.”
8;MET;Metlife Inc;2018-02-13T23:03:15Z;MetLife failed to make pension payments to about 13,500 people;Chief executive calls blunder ‘deeply disappointing’;MetLife failed to make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of pension payments to about 13,500 people over 25 years, the insurer acknowledged on Tuesday. The missing payouts came to almost $20,000 per head on average.The second-biggest US insurer by assets said on Tuesday the failure resulted from its practice of presuming customers “would never respond” if staff had made two attempts to reach them without success.“Following a detailed review, management concluded that such administrative practices were not sufficient,” it said in a statement. Steven Kandarian, chief executive and chairman, said the blunder was “unacceptable and deeply disappointing”. The life and pensions company “can and will do better”, he added.The mishap occurred at MetLife’s pensions “risk transfer” business, in which companies transfer their retirement liabilities to insurers. MetLife warned in December that it had failed to take adequate steps to track down former employees of its corporate clients. On Tuesday, the company said it would need to boost reserves by $510m on a pre-tax basis.Shares in MetLife are down 17 per cent since the company two weeks ago warned it would need to book a charge of more than half a billion dollars to cover the unpaid obligations. They ticked up 0.7 per cent after hours on Tuesday.“We are rigorously addressing the situation and are committed to significantly improving our operational performance to better serve our customers and strengthen shareholders’ confidence,” Mr Kandarian said.
9;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com

Shares in the second-biggest US insurer by assets were down more than 7 per cent to about $50.70 in after-hours trading.The disclosure came less than two weeks after the Trump administration dropped an appeal against a legal ruling removing MetLife from a federal list of financial institutions considered systemically important.The MetLife blunder was the latest sign of accounting woes in the insurance sector. Last week, General Electric revealed that the SEC was investigating its accounting for long-term care liabilities.The problems at MetLife — which is headed by Steven Kandarian, former head of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency that safeguards retirement schemes — involve pensions risk transfer deals, under which companies with defined benefit retirement plans offload the liabilities to insurers.In December, MetLife said it may have failed to pay thousands of pensions to people who had “moved jobs, relocated or otherwise could not be located”. As many as 30,000 individuals could be affected, it saidOn Monday, MetLife said that over the years it had inappropriately released funds from its financial reserves, assuming it would not need to make the payouts because it had not tracked down the individuals.To make up the shortfall, it said it would be forced to take an estimated hit to net income of as much as $195m for 2017, and would also be required to make “prior period revisions”.It expected to need to increase its reserves between $525m and $575m on a pre-tax basis. The company also said it was postponing the release of its full-year results by two weeks.In response to the episode, MetLife said it had launched a review of how it identified “unresponsive and missing” policyholders across its global business.“To date, MetLife is not aware of any intentional wrongdoing in connection with this matter,” it said in a statement.

12;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Trump administration drops appeal in Metlife ‘too big to fail’ case;;The Trump administration is dropping an appeal against a contentious legal ruling that ended Metlife’s designation as “too big to fail”, further undermining a financial safety regime established under President Obama.Almost two years ago a district court sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Washington when it threw out the authorities’ labelling of MetLife as a “systemically important financial institution” (Sifi) that needed tougher regulation.The government appealed, arguing Metlife was clearly a large, interconnected financial institution whose failure would threaten financial stability.However, the Trump administration has targetted the Sifi regime as part of its deregulatory push. On Thursday a council led by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin filed a motion to dismiss the case.Last year it dropped AIG’s designation. Prudential Financial is the only remaining non-bank Sifi in the US.Ian Katz, policy analyst at Capital Alpha, said he also sees Prudential’s “escape from the Sifi dungeon” as “inevitable”.“It’s mainly a matter of Prudential going through the bureaucratic process required by [the council's]rules.”In a sign officials want to limit the wider legal ramifications of the original Metlife judgement, however, both the company and the government asked the court to “vacate” a part of its ruling. The court had concluded officials should have undertaken a “cost-benefit analysis” when designating MetLife, a decision lawyers warned could undermine bureaucratic decision making.

14;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-08-07T16:58:54Z;Shares in MetLife spin-off fall on trading debut;Brighthouse Financial launches on Nasdaq after extensive regulatory scrutiny;Brighthouse Financial, the company spun off from MetLife, made an underwhelming stock market debut on Monday as it launches as an independent business at a tough time for the US life and pensions sector.MetLife, the biggest US insurer by assets before the separation, has completed the carve out of its domestic consumer business — the latest strategic move in an industry trying to offset the profit-sapping effects of low interest rates.Eric Steigerwalt, Brighthouse’s chief executive, joined his MetLife counterpart, Steve Kandarian, in ringing Nasdaq’s opening bell in New York’s Times Square.At the close of trade in New York on Monday, shares in the new company — seen as especially sensitive to long-term interest rates — were down 4.4 per cent, giving it a market capitalisation of $7.57bn.Analysts said income funds and other MetLife investors had sold shares in the new company because it did not pay a dividend. Investors in the parent group were allocated one Brighthouse share for every 11 MetLife shares they owned.Low interest rates have made it harder for such companies to generate adequate returns on their investment portfolios, which are dominated by low yielding fixed-income assets.“We would all prefer a higher-rate environment,” Mr Steigerwalt told the Financial Times.He added, however, that the company had the balance sheet strength to withstand a protracted period of depressed rates. “We can put up with it forever, because we’ve built this company whatever the market environment,” said the former MetLife executive.Mr Steigerwalt said that Brighthouse was pushing to improve its financial performance in part through cutting about $150m worth of costs. The group is also implementing a new hedging strategy to reduce expenses. It is targeting an operating return on equity of about 9 per cent.A lower price tag could also entice investors. The $61.47 trading price on Monday is equivalent to only about two-thirds of the group’s estimated adjusted book value of $92, according to Sean Dargan, analyst at Wells Fargo.The landmark separation of MetLife, whose history stretches back to 1863, is going ahead after a protracted period of regulatory scrutiny.Brighthouse has 2.7m annuity contracts and insurance policies, and more than $220bn in assets — about a quarter of the parent group’s total, putting it in the ranks of the largest 15 US insurance companies.MetLife laid down plans for the split at the start of last year. A big part of its initial rationale was to reduce the burden from being designated a “too big to fail” financial institution.The group has since successfully challenged US regulators in the courts over its designation, but nevertheless is going ahead with the spin-off, saying that there are other business reasons to pursue it.MetLife is expected to retain a stake of about 20 per cent in the new business. It is retaining a US group pensions and benefits business, overseas interests and an asset management operation.

It will focus on life insurance and annuities.Florida-based AutoNation, meanwhile, will be removed from the S&P 500 before the opening bell on August 8 and move to the S&P MidCap 400′s automotive retail sub-industry index.
16;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-06-15T15:00:15Z;MetLife shakes up senior management team;;US insurer MetLife has shaken up its senior management team, appointing a new head for its biggest business and a new chief risk officer.Michel Khalaf, who has been running MetLife’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business since 2011, will add the US operation to his remit. He will move from Dubai to New York as part of the change. He replaces Maria Morris, who has been leading the US business and is due to retire later this year.The US business includes employee benefits, retirement and savings, and property and casualty operations.MetLife chief executive Steve Kandarian said: “Michel has been a tremendous asset to MetLife…managing EMEA with a strong focus on value creation and expense discipline.”MetLife’s chief risk officer, Stan Talbi, is also due to retire later this year. He will be replaced by Ramy Tadros, the global head of insurance at consultant Oliver Wyman, joining in September.The changes come as MetLife prepares to complete the $10bn spin-off of Brighthouse, its consumer business. The split was originally due to be finished by the end of this month, but the regulatory process took longer than expected. The deal is likely to be tied up over the next few months.
17;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-05-04T17:50:29Z;MetLife warns of delay to $10bn consumer division spin-off;Newly elected regulator is scrutinising ‘complex’ insurance deal;The expected $10bn spin-off of MetLife’s consumer business is being delayed by regulators in its home state, the insurer said on Thursday.Steve Kandarian, MetLife chief executive, told analysts that the company was unlikely to “have the necessary approvals” to complete the separation of the division, called Brighthouse, by the end of June, as previously advised.The transaction is being scrutinised in Delaware, where Brighthouse — and MetLife’s holding company — is incorporated. It needs to be approved by the state’s insurance commissioner, Trinidad Navarro, who took office in January.Presenting first-quarter earnings, Mr Kandarian said that the deal was “complex”. “We’re working closely with our regulator. There’s a lot of information to impart. We’re working very diligently and provide the information as fast as humanly possible, but it is a large volume of information and analysis that is going on.”MetLife, the biggest US insurer by assets, set out plans to carve out its consumer division almost 18 months ago. The spin-off is effectively a break-up of the company, which has a market capitalisation of $57bn.It would leave the remaining entity, a household name in the US life insurance sector whose history stretches back to 1863, focused on selling to companies not consumers.The planned deal is being closely watched in the sector as companies grapple with low interest rates and toughened regulation.Mr Navarro previously spent two decades with New Castle County Police and was elected the County Sheriff. Before that he worked as a licensed insurance agent. After his election the Democrat said “there is much we need to accomplish for the consumer”.His office, which is also examining China Oceanwide’s planned purchase of MetLife’s smaller rival Genworth Financial, said on Thursday that it was not its policy to comment on pending transactions.We’re working very diligently and provide the information as fast as humanly possible,Brighthouse has already begun to operate as an independent entity and last month it launched a broadcast advertising campaign to publicise the business.“While we do not have an exact estimate of when that work will be complete, we are hopeful it will be in the coming months,” Mr Kandarian saidJay Gelb, analyst at Barclays, said: “We view this simply as a timing issue and not due to any problems or operational issues at Brighthouse.”The disposal was originally seen as part of the reordering of US finance under the influence of post-crisis regulation. A big part of MetLife’s initial rationale for the deal was to reduce the burden from being designated a “too big to fail” financial institution.However, the company has since successfully challenged US regulators in the courts over its designation. MetLife wants to press ahead with the carve out of Brighthouse, a capital-intensive operation, in any case, saying there are other business reasons to pursue it.Shares in MetLife rose 2 per cent to $52.75 by lunchtime in New York, helped by better than expected financial results released after markets closed on Wednesday.
18;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-03-19T11:05:28Z;Athene on the hunt for deals among hard-pressed European insurers;A lot of challenged companies out there, says chief executive James Belardi;Athene is on the hunt for deals in Europe as the recently floated US pensions provider looks to take advantage of the pressure on life insurance companies caused by ultra low interest rates.James Belardi, chief executive, said Athene, backed by private equity group Apollo, was eyeing acquisitions in Germany as well as reinsurance transactions in the UK.“There’s a reason we’ve received a lot of calls about potential acquisition opportunities,” he said. “There’s a lot of challenged companies out there that would like a well-capitalised parent to come in.”Mr Belardi’s comments signal that prospective buyers are gearing up to consolidate the fragmented industry. Clive Cowdery, the British life insurance dealmaker, is also known to be interested in pursuing deals in Europe.Life and pension companies globally are suffering as their business models require them to invest heavily in bonds, whose prospective returns have dropped in the easy money era.The difficulties are particularly acute in European markets including Germany, where until recently the industry has been making generous long-term promises on payouts to customers.German life companies must generate an average return on their investments of 2.4 per cent to meet the promises, which typically stretch out over 16 years, according to rating agency Fitch.Although the companies are making returns at 3.3 per cent on investments made when yields were higher, they face a tightening squeeze because of low rates.Backers of Athene say it has an advantage over rivals because it is based in low-tax Bermuda, has picked up other acquisitions — including the US business of UK insurer Aviva — on the cheap, and gets Apollo to manage its investments.The group was valued at $7.4bn in a New York listing in December that raised about $1.1bn for selling shareholders led by Apollo. Its shares have since risen to value it at $10.9bn.Athene has been expanding rapidly since it was formed in 2009 to capitalise on problems in the US market after the financial crisis. Figures published on Friday by trade body Limra show it has become the third-biggest provider of “fixed indexed annuities” in the US.The group purchased Delta Lloyd’s German unit in 2015 but has yet to expand further in Europe. “There’s a lot of opportunities for additional acquisitions in Germany, as well as reinsurance opportunities in the UK,” Mr Belardi said.The group would be taking on so-called longevity risk — the risk that customers live longer than expected. Mr Belardi added that Athene was planning to raise capital from third-party investors “to pursue opportunities” in Germany but would not provide further details.The M&A market for European annuities is growing. Regulatory changes and rising life expectancy are encouraging corporate pension schemes, as well as insurers, to pass on these liabilities to specialists. Last year Dutch insurer Aegon sold £9bn worth of UK annuities to Rothesay Life and Legal & General.There’s a lot of opportunities for additional acquisitions in Germany, as well as reinsurance opportunities in the UKEuropean insurers complain that the introduction of the EU’s Solvency II capital rules has made it more difficult to sell such long-term products. They are looking at passing risks over to counterparts based in Bermuda and the US, where Solvency II does not apply.Athene’s chief has said the group has $2.5bn of firepower for acquisitions. It has been linked with a possible purchase of the US insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life, and is also seeking to take on risks from pension plans in the US.John Barnidge, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said Athene was unusual in the US sector in eyeing European expansion. He noted the bigger operators MetLife and Prudential Financial had been grappling with toughened regulations that have curtailed their M&A ambitions.“There aren’t a lot of people going over there,” he said.
19;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-03-08T13:57:12Z;MetLife: Brighthouse’s dark day;Mismatched accounting explains losses but bad timing is responsible for magnitude;Hedging matters, but so does timing. Take MetLife. It made a $5bn pre-tax loss on derivatives in its most recent quarter after the insurer increased positions that would gain in value if interest rates remained low. Rates surprisingly spiked in November.There is a double irony here. First, insurers tend to thrive when interest rates are high. Steep bond yields produce better returns for insurers’ low-risk investment portfolios. At the same time, the value of potential future claims is discounted more steeply, reducing their liabilities. Second, the derivatives in question were designed to protect capital in a block of “universal life” business at Brighthouse Financial, a division that MetLife intends to spin off and a business line that it has been phasing out.Fear of the ill effects of low rates is what prompts risk managers to pay up for insurance against them. A recent filing shows MetLife more than doubled its exposure to a 10 per cent increase in rates across all maturities over the past year. As of December, the derivatives would have lost $2bn if that scenario had come to pass. The actual post-election move, during which ten-year rates moved by much more, lumbered MetLife with its $5bn loss.Accounting rules are harsh on insurers. They treat insurance liabilities differently from investments in derivatives. The latter have to be marked to market immediately, while higher or lower profits from the former flow through to net income over time.For hedges to preserve a policy’s profitability, both must be struck in similar markets. But shorter-dated protection tends to be cheaper. Delay buying it to save money and one risks locking in less favourable economics.In striking hedges at yields just off last year’s record lows, MetLife obtained relief from lower-for-longer rates in exchange for giving up gains in the opposite scenario. That is a legitimate business decision. But while accounting mismatches highlight the losses, bad timing is responsible for their magnitude.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
20;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-02-15T06:24:05Z;Accounting standards in the spotlight as life insurers take strain;Charges at MetLife and Prudential Financial have put emphasis on need for reform;Life insurers were supposed to win big from the US election result in November. So investors were taken off guard when MetLife, the largest US life insurer by assets, this month unveiled its biggest quarterly loss in at least a decade.Donald Trump’s victory and the prospect of reflationary economic policies sent long-term interest rates sharply higher — offering relief to insurers, whose profits have been hurt by ultra-low bond yields.But instead of bolstering MetLife’s earnings, the swings in financial markets forced the company to book a $3.2bn hit in its derivatives portfolio and pushed it to a $2.1bn net loss for the fourth quarter.John Hele, chief financial officer, sought to reassure investors that accounting “noise” was largely to blame.“Rising interest rates remain favourable for MetLife over the longer term,” he said. The results nevertheless knocked $3.1bn off the group’s market capitalisation.MetLife was not the only US life insurer whose earnings were hurt by the post-election market movements.Prudential Financial, the second biggest, took a $1.28bn hit, largely related to an opaque charge in its annuities business that several analysts said had little or no real bearing on the business. It pushed net income down from $740m a year ago to $293m.The red ink throws into sharp relief problems with accounting in the sector. Fund managers, analysts and executives complain financial results are often not very meaningful — especially as measured by the standard US framework, generally accepted accounting principles.“A lot depends on assumptions — such as how long people are going to live, and the return on the assets,” said Chris Davis, chairman of Davis Advisors, an investment management house with more than $25bn in assets under management.“A lot of investors don’t want to do the work to understand insurance accounting, especially in life.”Rick Sojkowski, insurance partner at Deloitte & Touche, said: “There’s some level of apprehension about investing in the industry, given the models and complexity of understanding the accounting.”To be sure, MetLife’s loss, which was much bigger than anything it booked during the financial crisis, cannot be dismissed entirely as an accounting eccentricity. The difficulty for investors is working out how much of it reflects reality.The $3.2bn charge arose because the insurer has made extensive use of derivatives to minimise the pain caused by depressed bond yields.These hedging positions have protected MetLife’s profits in the post-crisis era of easy money and generate about $200m of pre-tax income per quarter, according to Wells Fargo Securities. As yields rise, however, the derivatives produce less income.Mr Hele told investors that even if interest rates were to increase 1 percentage point, which should boost insurers’ bottom lines by increasing the income they get from their investments, MetLife’s operating profits would be flat this year.Earnings would not benefit from such a rate rise until 2018. For critics, that is a problem. The company is now reviewing its hedging strategy.At the same time, there is no dispute that the accounting has made the phenomenon appear much bigger than it actually is.Different accounting standards apply to insurers’ derivatives and their liabilities — the policies they have written, such as life insurance and annuities.There’s some level of apprehension about investing in the industry, given the models and complexity of understanding the accountingDerivatives are marked to market, meaning the values booked on insurers’ balance sheets can swing from quarter to quarter.In contrast, liabilities appear on the books to be a lot more static. In accounting for liabilities, insurers are required to lock in assumptions that were made when the contracts were written, on a range of variables ranging from death rates to interest rates.The discrepancy means that when interest rates rise, the costs to insurers — lower derivative values — show up in GAAP net income, but the benefits do not. In reality, insurers benefit from rising interest rates, but the accounts may not reflect it.Such is the indifference on Wall Street about the value of insurers’ GAAP net income that few sellside analysts normally pay much attention to it.For MetLife, only one broker provided estimates for the metric to Bloomberg for the quarter. The analyst had pencilled in a profit of $1.38bn — a forecast that turned out to be wildly inaccurate.In contrast, 10 sellside brokers gave figures for “adjusted” fourth quarter net income, which strips out several accounting items.“There’s so many things that cause swings and in some cases they are not representative of the real earnings power of the company,” said Ryan Krueger, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Still, Erik Bass, partner at Autonomous Research, said: “This past quarter, below-the-line noise has re-emerged as a concern for some insurance investors.”[New proposals to revamp accounting practices could end up replacing] one level of noise for anotherReforms are on the cards that could make GAAP figures more meaningful. The Financial Accounting Standards Board put forward proposals in September that would revamp accounting practices in the sector.Under the mooted changes, the assumptions that underpin the value of the insurance liabilities would need to be tracked in the accounts on a more regular basis.Big questions remain about how that would work in practice, however — particularly how the assumptions should be calculated.The danger, said Robert Falzon, Prudential Financial’s chief financial officer, is that the proposals could end up replacing “one level of noise for another”.“The concept makes a lot of sense,” Mr Hele of MetLife added. “The devil’s in the details.”
21;MET;Metlife Inc;2017-02-02T19:43:30Z;MetLife to review hedging strategy after $2.1bn loss;Insurer reports its worst quarterly result in a decade because of derivatives losses;MetLife posted its biggest quarterly loss in at least a decade after shifts in financial markets fuelled by Donald Trump’s election victory triggered a $3.2bn hit to its derivatives portfolio.Steven Kandarian, chairman and chief executive, said the biggest US insurer by assets was reviewing protection it had taken out against low interest rates after the company appeared to be taken off guard by rising bond yields.MetLife bought hedges to soften the impact of low rates, which hurt insurers by reducing the income they can generate from investments.Mr Kandarian has long positioned MetLife for persistently low rates. “‘Lower for longer’ is not going away anytime soon,” he said in the summer.But with yields on 10-year government bonds having risen markedly after Mr Trump’s election victory in November, MetLife’s hedges against low interest rates have become less valuable.The company late on Wednesday reported a $2.1bn net loss for the three months to December 31, compared to $785m profit during the same period in 2015. The quarterly loss was the biggest in at least 10 years, according to data tracked by BloombergMetLife recorded $3.2bn in net derivative losses in the fourth quarter, which it said reflected changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and equity markets.Despite this accounting-related volatility [in the fourth quarter], rising interest rates remain favourable for MetLife over the longer termThe company’s operating earnings — which exclude the impact of the derivatives losses — rose 3 per cent to $1.4bn.The loss at MetLife was triggered because generally accepted accounting principles — GAAP, the standard US framework for financial accounting — require insurers to mark the value of their derivatives to market.Mr Kandarian sought to reassure the market that MetLife would benefit from rising interest rates.Rising bond yields benefit insurers by reducing the value of their liabilities. However, the accounting rules do not allow insurers to mark their liabilities to market. This means the costs of rising rates show up in GAAP net income while the benefits of falling liabilities do not.“Despite this accounting-related volatility [in the fourth quarter], rising interest rates remain favourable for MetLife over the longer term,” Mr Kandarian told analysts.Mr Kandarian said the company may modify its hedging strategy. “We’re examining various options,” he added.Some analysts questioned whether the $3.2bn hit to MetLife’s derivatives portfolio had an impact on the company’s underlying business. They noted several other life insurers, which also reported this results this week, had not posted heavy losses.Sean Dargan, analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the hedges against low interest rates had benefited MetLife over the years. However, he added: “There are a lot of investors who now want MetLife to unwind these hedges.”Shares in MetLife were down 4.3 per cent on Thursday lunchtime in New York, giving the company a market capitalisation of $57.2bn.
22;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MetLife’s Kandarian latest finance chief to talk up prospects under Trump;;The head of MetLife has become the latest finance chief to talk up the prospects of his company under Donald Trump.Steve Kandarian, president and chief executive of the biggest US insurer by assets, has been critical of tighter regulation – and even took the Obama administration to court to fight the group’s designation as a too-big-to-fail institution.He has also been cautious about the consequences of persistently low interest rates, which hurt insurers’ investment returns and push up the value of their liabilities.But presenting fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, he said: “The prospect of higher interest rates and a more favorable regulatory environment, together with our new enterprise strategy, capital management and expense discipline, position us for value creation.”His comments came as MetLife posted a $2.13bn quarterly loss after higher interest rates caused a mark-to-market hit to its derivatives portfolio. The results point to the sector’s quirky accounting rules, as rising interest rates should benefit insurance companies.Shares in MetLife, which have rallied 13 per cent since the US election, fell 1.5 per cent in after hours trading.On an operating basis, however, MetLife’s earnings rose 3 per cent from a year ago to $1.4bn.MetLife won its legal fight against the Obama administration, which removed its too big to fail label. However, it is still pressing ahead with a planned break-up of the group by spinning off US retail assets.
23;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-10-30T15:34:04Z;Big three US insurers set for earnings recovery;Low interest rates remain challenge for AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial;All three of the biggest US insurers, AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial, are poised to post improved earnings for the first time in five quarters, giving some relief to a sector hurt by persistently low interest ratesThe numbers provide some evidence that the industry can improve returns despite the Federal Reserve’s ultra-loose monetary policy, which has reduced the income insurers can produce from their vast bond-dominated investment portfolios.Insurance earnings season gets into full swing this week after a relatively upbeat batch of results from US banks.The three largest US insurers, which control a combined $2.2tn in assets, are all due to post rises in adjusted earnings per share, according to forecasts collated by Bloomberg.Analysts point to better returns from hedge funds. Weak returns from alternative investments have weighed on results from all three companies in recent quarters.Stronger stock markets, which bolster fees for insurers’ asset management operations, and efforts to trim expenses are also expected to improve the sector’s profits.Big challenges remain, however. Shares in AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial have rallied since the summer but they all trade at less than 70 per cent of the companies’ prospective book values — a sign of investor pessimism.“The earnings set up this quarter is pretty good but these aren’t secular trends,” cautioned Randy Binner, at Virginia-based FBR Capital Markets. “The companies are benefiting from improvements in alternative investments but the year-on-year comparisons also reflect one-off items.”Another risk for the sector are annual reviews that insurers make to their financial assumptions.Ryan Krueger, at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said several insurers, including Lincoln National and Voya, conducted actuarial reviews in the third quarter.The biggest forecast profits rise is for AIG. Peter Hancock, chief executive, is remodelling the company after he faced demands this year from activists Carl Icahn and John Paulson to consider a break-up of AIG’s life and non-life businesses.Since the crisis, AIG has slimmed radically, jettisoning businesses from aircraft leasing to consumer finance, and in recent months it has sold both its mortgage insurance arm and a Lloyd’s of London franchise.The biggest US insurer by market capitalisation, which has brushed aside the calls for a split, is expected on Wednesday to unveil that quarterly adjusted earnings per share have more than doubled on last year, according to the Bloomberg data.AIG’s earnings a year ago were hit by restructuring charges and a negative performance from alternative investments.Mr Binner added that AIG’s results this time would also benefit from a low level of losses across the property and casualty insurance industry.MetLife, which in the summer set out plans to cut costs by more than a tenth in the face of low interest rates, is forecast to post a year-on-year rise in adjusted EPS of 82 per cent in the third quarter.The anticipated improvement at Prudential Financial, which is focused on life insurance and asset management, is a more modest 4 per cent.
24;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-10-05T23:52:15Z;MetLife eyes business disposal over IPO;Insurer lays out plans for Brighthouse Financial unit in further blow to listings market;MetLife has set out plans to spin off about a quarter of its business, with the insurer eschewing a flotation in another blow to the market for initial public offerings.At least four-fifths of the equity in the new business, to be named Brighthouse Financial, would go to the parent company’s existing shareholders, MetLife said in a filing on Wednesday.MetLife, which has a market capitalisation of $51bn and whose history stretches back to 1863, disclosed initial plans in January to break itself up. The business to be disposed of accounts for about $240bn in assets, about a quarter of the parent company’s total.At the time, the life insurer warned that plans from US authorities to subject it to tougher regulations as a “too big to fail” institution threatened to make a big slice of its business uncompetitive.Since then, MetLife — which has been fighting federal regulators over their plans — has secured a legal victory. The courtroom decision removes its “systemically important” label, at least for now. Even so, the insurer is pressing ahead with the split, citing other strategic reasons for the divestiture.John Hele, chief financial officer, told a conference last month that MetLife was still weighing up whether to spin off or float Brighthouse. But he highlighted: “A spin can generally happen even if the IPO markets are a bit choppy.”US-listed IPOs are running at the slowest pace this year since 2009, both in dollar amount issued and number of deals sold, according to Dealogic.Market volatility has kept listings at bay while technology companies have been able to raise large sums at attractive valuations privately.Momentum has been building and deal flow has picked up from a frozen market at the start of the year, but uncertainty remains. Investors fret that factors including the forthcoming US election, and a potential rise in interest rates, could still rattle the underlying market.“Tech IPOs are hot again but that doesn’t mean a multibillion-dollar insurer will be able to attract the same level of excitement,” said Matthew Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange traded funds.Meanwhile, the number of prospective buyers for Brighthouse is limited by the size of the business, which accounts for about a fifth of the parent company’s profits, and capital requirements associated with the type of policies it writes.The advantage of a spin-off can include tax benefits and a speedy divestiture. Several companies including Johnson Controls and General Electric have pursued this route as they have reshaped their businesses.On Wednesday, MetLife filed documents with securities regulators that pave the way for a spin-off, although the insurer left open the possibility that it could still float or sell Brighthouse outright.The company said it “continues to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives” and the “ultimate form and timing” of the divestiture would depend on factors including “regulatory considerations and economic condition”.Brighthouse will become one of the largest providers of annuities and life cover in the US, selling products such as variable annuities, which cater for the over-50s.The disposal will leave MetLife as the second-largest US insurer by assets, behind Prudential Financial. It will sell very few new life policies to everyday Americans, allowing it to focus on areas of higher growth and lighter capital requirements.Shares in MetLife rallied 4.4 per cent in after-hours trading.
25;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-08-14T16:36:59Z;Insurers elicit fury over increases in elderly care premiums;Customers accuse companies of ‘obscene’ price rise demands for elderly;US insurance executives have been accused of making “obscene” demands to suddenly double care policy premiums for the elderly in clashes that highlight growing tensions over who pays for ageing societies.Angry customers of MetLife, the biggest US insurer by assets, and Unum, another provider, who have paid into long-term care policies for years complain they would be forced to stump up thousands of additional dollars or be left with inferior care in old age.Audrey Kennedy, who expects to begin claiming on a MetLife policy for her husband, who has Alzheimer’s, faces a rise in her annual premium from $8,000 to $16,000 a year.“[The threatened 95 per cent rise] is just unconscionable,” she said at a hearing last Friday in Florida, where the latest premium increases are set to apply pending approval by the state’s regulator.Insurers argue the increases are necessary as people live longer, causing claims costs to soar. Ultra-low interest rates have tightened the squeeze by eroding investment returns.Many companies, including Prudential Financial, AIG and Allianz, have been pushing through premium rises for the insurance, which pays out if policyholders become incapacitated through conditions such as dementia and need professional care.About $8.15bn in claims were paid out to 260,000 individuals last year, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance. Much of the industry has stopped selling new policies. Insurers are allowed to increase premiums for existing customers if they secure approval from regulators in each state.In Florida, thousands of customers could be hit by premium increases by MetLife, which is seeking rises of as much as 95 per cent, and Unum, which wants to push up premiums as much as 114 per cent. Elsewhere, federal government workers and pensioners are also facing big increases through an employer insurance scheme.Regulators typically grant insurers permission to increase premiums by significantly less than the companies have requested. Nevertheless, the hearings highlighted policyholders’ anxiety around the large increases.If we cannot force the Federal Reserve to increase the returns that we receive on our investments, insurance companies should not be able to increase our premiums to make up for the return that they did not receiveSeveral policyholders complained sales agents had failed to warn them properly about the threat of increased premiums — and that they had been left to pay the price for big miscalculations made by the companies.Jose Aragon, a resident of Coral Gables, said the “extreme increase” proposed by Unum was “simply unaffordable”.“If we cannot force the Federal Reserve to increase the returns that we receive on our investments, insurance companies should not be able to increase our premiums to make up for the return that they did not receive.”Noel Weinstock, who has paid $30,000 into a MetLife policy, said it was an “obscenity” for the insurer to call for such large rises after it paid out $1.7bn worth of dividends to shareholders last year.But defenders of the industry argue the policies still provide a good deal, and the stability of the insurance sector could be undermined if it was required to meet the obligations in full without increasing premiums.$8.15bnAmount in claims paid out to 260,000 individuals last yearGeorge Braddock, a long-term insurance sales specialist based in Florida, said customers had been forewarned prices could rise. He added that nearly all the companies operating when he began his career in 2000 were no longer selling new policies. “We need them to stay in the business.”MetLife and Unum acknowledged the impact of the premium increases on customers. But Jonathan Trend, actuary at MetLife, said the “increases are needed because the experience relating to these policies has been, and is expected to remain, materially worse than initially anticipated.”Steve Zabel, an executive at Unum who manages the insurer’s historic policies, said: “Long-term care losses have had and will continue to have significant adverse impacts on our company.”

Shares in the US’s largest life insurer tumbled 8.7 per cent to $39.54 after it was forced to announce $1bn — or 11 per cent — in cuts to costs as low rates continued to squeeze earnings.News of the cost cutting come just a day after the company delivered a 90 per cent drop in second-quarter profit and weighed on the shares of rival insurers. Prudential Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $72.84, Canada-based, US-listed Manulife Financial dropped 5.4 per cent to $13.01 and American International Group retreated 0.8 per cent to $57.61.Big banks also sold off, continuing their dreadful run this year. Morgan Stanley fell 0.5 per cent to $28.28, JPMorgan Chase dropped 0.2 per cent to $64.56 and Goldman Sachs declined 0.2 per cent to $158.05.Financials dropped 0.3 per cent as the broader S&P 500 remained nearly unchanged at 2,164.25 by close of trading in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat with the Nasdaq Composite 0.1 per cent firmer.Elsewhere, SeaWorld Entertainment slumped 13 per cent, briefly hitting a record low of $12.58 after the theme park operator slashed its earnings guidance for the year following a sharp drop in attendance numbers during the second quarter.The company, which has been struggling to turnround its performance following negative publicity generated by the 2013 documentary Blackfish, blamed weakness in its key Florida market for the revisions. The market has seen “an accelerated decline” in visitors from Latin America because of the region’s economic woes and the strong dollar while business in Orlando has been affected by the recent terrorist attacks, the company said.Elsewhere, investors took a dim view on the latest writedown announced by Chesapeake Energy.Shares in the US natural gas producer fell 2.9 per cent to $5.13 after the company reported a bigger than expected loss for the second quarter and wrote down the value of its oil and gasfields by another $1.04bn.The Oklahoma City-based company has already taken an $18.2bn impairment charge last year on its assets amid the protracted slump in energy prices.The prospect of further writedowns has unnerved the market given the company’s high debt burden — which stood at $8.7bn at the end of June, or two times its market capitalisation. While Chesapeake has sought to pay down a portion of this debt through asset disposals, any writedown is inevitably going to have an impact on the amount the company can raise from these sales.Ford Motor was down 0.5 per cent after it announced a recall of 830,000 vehicles at a cost of about $270m, as a result of a door latching issue that poses the risk of causing injuries.Among the gainers, Kellogg, the world’s largest cereal company, rose 1.7 per cent to $82.42 after raising its full-year guidance
27;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-08-04T16:49:49Z;MetLife squeezed by low interest rates;US insurer’s shares fall a tenth as net income tumbles 94%;MetLife shares tumbled 10 per cent on Thursday even after it set out plans to protect profits with further cost cuts, as investor concerns mount about the impact of central banks’ easy-money policies on the insurance industry.The largest US insurer by assets warned in quarterly results it needed to bolster its reserves by $2bn in large part because of a squeeze caused by low interest rates — wiping almost $5bn off its stock market value.Steven Kandarian, chief executive of the life insurance and pensions group, cautioned about the impact of the UK’s vote for Brexit, which meant “‘lower for longer’ is not going away anytime soon”.While the group has limited direct exposure to Britain, he said, “more troubling is the referendum’s residual impact — namely, a global flight to safety that has put further downward pressure on interest rates”.“Life insurance companies will need to adapt to the low-rate environment.”He said MetLife would reduce its expenses by $1bn, equivalent to 11 per cent of total costs.MetLife hopes to meet the target by the end of 2019. The New York-based company employs about 65,000 people globally but would not say how many positions would go.Low rates make it harder for insurers to produce adequate returns on fixed-income dominated investment portfolios.MetLife also warned that a lack of attractive investments on offer from financial markets meant fewer customers than expected were lapsing their “variable annuity” contracts, which have a minimum guaranteed return.Low rates also meant fewer customers were annuitising, converting savings into steady income streams, causing further pressure.The resulting non-cash reserve charge helped push net income down from $1.04bn a year ago to $64m in the second quarter — a decline of 94 per cent.On an operating basis, earnings fell almost a half to $924m. By midday in New York shares in MetLife were down 10 per cent at $39.43.About 75 per cent of the business affected by the reserve charge is expected to be spun off from the rest of the group. There were signs the timetable for the separation was slipping because MetLife said it would not file documents relating to the deal until late this year. The new business is to be named Brighthouse Financial.It is the latest downbeat result in the sector. Shares in Canada’s biggest life insurer, Manulife, fell 5 per cent on disappointing financial results.Despite the pressures, analysts said there were few concerns about the industry’s solvency as the big companies — in North America, at least — tended to be well capitalised.
28;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-07-26T18:57:22Z;Hedge funds suffer $20.7bn net outflows in June;Industry endures its longest sequence of quarterly withdrawals since 2009;Global hedge funds suffered net outflows of $20.7bn in June, as investors pulled more of their money out despite improved performance from most managers.After inflows in April and May, the withdrawals took total aggregate net redemptions for the second quarter to $10.7bn, according to data from eVestment, marking the third consecutive quarter in which money has left the sector. This represents the longest sequence of quarterly outflows since the second quarter of 2009, suggesting that investor dissatisfaction with managers’ performance and fees may be intensifying. In the first three months of 2016, hedge fund redemptions were the worst seen in any quarter for seven years, as investors withdrew more than $15bn, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Large insurers such as AIG and MetLife and pension funds including the New York City Employees’ Retirement System have all recently cut or reduced their hedge fund allocations.However, the industry produced positive returns in June amid the market volatility surrounding the UK referendum on leaving the EU. Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Fund Weighted Composite index gained 0.8 per cent, recording its fourth straight month of gains. June’s redemption figures do not take into account the aftermath of the Brexit vote, however, as hedge fund investors must typically give at least one month’s notice to withdraw cash. Popular sectors bucking the withdrawals trend in June included commodity funds, which recorded net inflows for the ninth month out of the past 10, the eVestment numbers show. Commodity-focused funds have returned 5.8 per cent this year, based on the HFR indices.And not all investors are racing for the exits. Sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations — as well as some pension funds — are still adding to their hedge fund allocation.Many have turned to hedge funds as low interest rates and high valuations in equities and fixed income markets make it harder to generate returns through conventional long-only mutual funds.But expectations remain low: 70 per cent of managers recently surveyed by Preqin expect returns of 3 per cent or less across the hedge fund industry this year. Many hedge funds were wrongfooted by the sharp market swings at the start of the year. HFR’s asset-weighted index fell more than 2 per cent in the first quarter before rebounding 1.1 per cent over the next three months. This was enough to draw criticism from some investors already sceptical of a fee structure that historically charges 2 per cent a year for management plus 20 per cent of any profits. In recent quarters, more hedge funds have shut down and liquidated than have opened. In the first three months of 2016, 291 funds closed their doors and just 206 new ones started up, according to HFR data. Last year, more hedge funds closed than in any year since the financial crisis.Pressure from investors and the threat of redemptions have pushed managers to negotiate on their fees, especially where performance is eaten up too much by charges. They are also offering more transparency about their positions and risk profiles.
29;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-06-30T17:50:55Z;Watch the interest rate outlook shift following Brexit vote;Future historians may conclude this is one of the most important ripple effects of the poll;When the results of the UK’s EU referendum emerged last Friday morning, the share price of MetLife, the stolid American insurance group, tumbled. In the course of two days its stock fell 14 per cent, making it one of the worst performers on the American indices.At first glance, that seems bizarre. MetLife has limited business in the UK and its exposure to Europe is small. So it should be shielded from the more obvious potential effects of the vote that are looming over UK companies, eurozone banks and Wall Street giants, such as a European recession or a loss of business and influence for the City of London.But MetLife has a vulnerability that highlights one impact of Brexit that will have further-reaching consequences. Market actors have turned their attention to the wider outlook for interest rates. Most notably, in recent days, investors have sharply downgraded their expectations for inflation and interest rates, not just in the UK but across the west.That has nasty implications for asset managers of all stripes, including insurance companies, which need to earn decent returns to pay policyholders. It is also painful for banks, since low rates typically hurt their earnings.When future historians look back at the Brexit shock, they may conclude that this shifting rate outlook is one of the most important ripple effects of the Leave vote — even if the implications of a Brexit for bond prices look less thrilling than, say, the political soap opera around Boris Johnson, the leading Leave campaigner who has pulled out of the race to be UK prime minister.To understand this, take a look at the numbers. A couple of years ago negative-yielding bonds — which, in nominal terms, pay less at maturity than investors initially paid — were rare. But this week, Fitch Ratings agency calculated that there is now $11.7tn worth of sovereign debt in the global market that carries negative nominal interest rates.That is extraordinary. Furthermore, this pile has swelled by $1.3tn in the past month alone, and includes $2.6tn of long-term bonds (those with more than seven years of maturity). Meanwhile, the pile of bonds with a yield that investors used to consider normal — above 2 per cent — is barely worth $2tn.Most of this negative debt sits in Japan and the eurozone. But rate expectations in the UK and US are sliding, too. The US Treasuries market, for example, now expects a mere 125 basis points of rate rises in the next decade, with barely any hikes in the next two years. Indeed, one of America’s largest hedge funds is now warning its clients that “markets in aggregate are discounting . . . effectively no monetary tightening for a decade across the developed world”.Can this gloomy market prognosis be believed? Maybe not. After all, the global economy is still growing overall, with lacklustre expansion in the US. A dash to havens may also have influenced some of the recent bond price swings. If the political climate stabilises and the Remain camp’s prediction of economic disaster in Europe turns out to be overblown, the downbeat outlook of the markets could be reversed.But, there again, it is also possible to draw an even gloomier conclusion: that Brexit has crystallised and intensified more fundamental investor fears that the west is slipping ever-deeper into economic stagnation. After all, that $11.7tn negative-yield bond pile did not just emerge after the referendum but has in fact been swelling for many months.Either way, the one thing that is clear is that unless that pile suddenly and unexpectedly shrinks, investors and policymakers need to prepare for yet more ripple effects in the months ahead. For one thing, asset managers and insurance companies will see their earnings slide unless they start buying more risky debt — which will bring dangers of its own.Second, the central banks’ policy dilemma will intensify since they will face pressure to engage in further loosening monetary experiments — even though it is unclear that these unprecedented measures are actually boosting growth.And there is another nasty twist. Negative, or low, rates may exacerbate income inequality, too, since these typically raise the value of assets that wealthy people own, such as property and stocks. If so, that might create even more political populism, sparking more political uncertainty and economic gloom.The real ripple effects of Brexit, in other words, may have barely been seen yet. All eyes are on the political polls and trade flows, and on those bond prices.gillian.tett@ft.com
30;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-06-29T23:06:40Z;Bosses must learn to master remote control;Distant staff need careful attention from corporate leaders;A quiz on arcane facts about Bollywood and cricket might seem an unusual way to start a teleconference between workers in the US and India. But the game, used by US insurer MetLife when training its Indian IT team in new processes, has proved powerful in breaking down cultural barriers and building trust.“We heard them laughing and joking with each other about the questions,” says Janet Conn, who led the virtual training at MetLife and now works at technology company Cisco. As an American unversed in cricket and Bollywood minutiae, she consulted Indian contacts to make sure the questions were suitably challenging.“In India, people are less likely to jump in and ask questions than in the US, and we wanted them to feel comfortable enough to begin to speak up and give us the feedback needed for successful collaboration,” she says. The questions sparked the Indian workers’ curiosity.The importance of the human element cannot be overstated. Ms Conn says the Bollywood-infused training increased connection and discussion between far-flung colleagues. “Too often, offshore teams are treated like a machine rather than a group of people who have useful input. We’re all humans . . . and you have to figure out how to find the commonalities in order to build collaboration.”The role of today’s manager is becoming more demanding with teams dispersed across locations, time zones and cultures. Not only do they need the skills of a good “people manager”, such as empathy and adaptability, they also have to put more effort into planning, communicating and thinking creatively.“I see it as increasing the level of good management across the company,” says Isla Ramos Chaves, a senior executive at Lenovo, the computer company. Keeping people motivated is even more important if they are remote than if they see each other every day, says Ms Chaves, who has led virtual teams of between five and 200 people across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.She says managers need to articulate clearly, both to individuals and the team, how they are contributing to the results of the business unit or wider organisation. Failing to do so can lead to staff feeling isolated or unimportant.She emphasises carving out dedicated time for each team member. “You have to create a virtual space with people, so you say, for example: ‘On Monday between 9am and 10am, I’m all yours. Whatever happens, this is the time we spend together.”Hybrid teams, where some members are in the same office and others work remotely, pose particular challenges. Managers may allocate lesser tasks to the remote members — but the opposite can happen too.The team needs a clear vision so they know what direction to go in without being micromanagedIn conference calls with hybrid teams, Ms Chaves asks everyone to use the phone, including those who are in the office, so they have the same experience and there is less sense of “them and us”.Virtual team leaders have to manage by results, rather than how many hours employees are tied to their desks. Objectives need to be clear from the outset, and methods agreed between manager and employee on tracking progress and giving each other feedback.“The team needs a clear vision so they know what direction to go in without having to be micromanaged,” says Marc Decorte, vice-president of connected digital technologies at Royal Dutch Shell, the energy group. His team is dispersed around the world. “Performance contracts need to be based on the value of what people deliver, because that’s the value to the bottom line, not the quantity of work or the way it’s done.”The introduction of technology to virtual teams also has to be handled carefully. Trust can be undermined if remote workers perceive new requirements, such as use of a webcam, as a form of surveillance.Managers with no intention of spying on their teams need to make that crystal clear, says Wayne Turmel, co-founder of the Remote Leadership Institute, a US consultancy. “An open and honest discussion about why these tools are valuable, as well as how and when the team should use them, will go a long way to lowering the fear level. On the other hand, if you are using webcams to ‘bust’ your people, or make sure they are where they are supposed to be, maybe they aren’t the ones with the issue.”
31;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-06-27T21:35:41Z;Brexit fears also batter US insurers with limited UK exposure;Investors worry interest rates will stay lower for longer;US insurers with limited exposure to the UK have been among the hardest hit stocks in the Brexit markets rout, as investors fret there is now no end in sight to the very low interest rates that are hurting their profits.Since Friday morning, MetLife, Prudential Financial and Lincoln National have all been hit harder than banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, even though the latter group’s UK businesses are expected to be heavily disrupted by Britain’s departure from the EU.Brokers and asset managers have also been caught in the two-day sell-off, which has knocked $160bn off the value of the biggest 92 US-listed financial companies.The UK referendum result has led many investors to believe that central bankers will respond to the uncertainty by extending the extraordinary period of loose monetary policy, including quantitative easing and ultra-low or even negative interest rates.The wave of cheap money has been making it harder for insurers to produce adequate returns on their multibillion dollar investment portfolios, which are dominated by bonds.Since Thursday, shares in MetLife, whose UK exposure is not material to its global business, have tumbled 17 per cent. By the close on Monday, its share price was within 4 per cent of the lows it touched during the markets meltdown in February.Prudential Financial, which makes about half of its profits in Japan, was off 13 per cent, while Lincoln National was down 20 per cent after a second consecutive day of heavy selling.John Heagarty, insurance analyst at Atlantic Equities, said the sell-off in the sector had been driven largely by concerns about lower-for-longer interest rates. “The likelihood now of a rate rise this year has plummeted.”Randy Binner at FBR Capital Markets said insurers might need to add to their reserves, hitting profits. “The risk of that has increased,” he said.“Everything will be fine from a policyholders perspective . . . [but] the companies have to set aside more money to pay claims.”Also hard hit have been electronic brokerages including Charles Schwab and E*Trade Financial, whose shares are down 19 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively.Such companies earn profits from lending to clients to make investments, and lower interest rates cut into the margin between lending and borrowing costs. Brokers also generate income on securities purchased with client cash balances.E*Trade has 60 per cent of its revenues tied to the interest margin, according to Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo. “We expect Brexit to keep the Fed on hold for a long while,” he wrote in a note to clients.More investors now believe that the US Federal Reserve will hold off on raising interest rates this year. Before last Thursday’s referendum, financial markets showed a greater than 50 per cent chance of a rate increase in 2016, but in early trading this week, the probability had fallen below 10 per cent.
32;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-06-24T15:07:14Z;US bank stocks clobbered in Brexit rout;;Shares in big US banks followed their global peers sharply lower on concerns about how they would cope with market instability as well as the potential loss of access to the European single market from their bases in London.Among the big investment banks, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were the hardest hit in early trading in New York, down 9.1 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. Bank of America dropped 6 per cent, JPMorgan Chase 4.7 per cent and Goldman Sachs 5.7 per cent, reports Alistair Gray in New York.Big US investment banks use London as a base from which to access the European single market, which is now threatened by Brexit.Yet also hit was the US-focused Wells Fargo, which has only a very small business in the UK. Its shares were down 4.1 per cent, in a sign markets are concerned about the wider fall-out of Brexit on the US economy.US insurers were also caught up in the markets rout. MetLife and Prudential Financial fell 8.5 per cent and 7.1 per cent respectively. American International Group, which has a sizeable operation in London, was down 4.9 per cent.Financials sharply underperformed the S&P 500 index, which was down 2.6 per cent soon after the open.As well as higher expenses arising from potential relocation out of London, analysts have the cautioned US financial institutions will need to deal with foreign exchange volatility and uncertainty putting clients off trading and dealmaking.
33;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-06-20T11:07:46Z;US government puts itself on the line in MetLife challenge;Failure in appeal against earlier case over insurer’s designation could embolden other companies;The US government has set up a high-stakes legal showdown by fighting back against the judge who criticised its labelling of the insurer MetLife as “ too big to fail”.A district court sent shockwaves through Wall Street and Washington earlier this year when it threw out the authorities’ designation of MetLife as a “systemically important financial institution” that needed tougher regulation.The MetLife case has become the most serious threat to post-crisis US financial reforms since the Dodd-Frank act — a signature achievement of the first Obama administration — was passed six years ago.Lawyers acting for the authorities last week filed appeal court documents that detail their case against the court that dealt them such an important setback. They argue US District Judge Rosemary Collyer “was profoundly mistaken”.If they are successful and the appeal court overturns her ruling, it would restore the credibility of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was set up as part of Dodd-Frank. Led by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, the FSOC is charged with identifying and managing emerging threats to the financial system.Yet the government has a lot to lose if its appeal fails. A higher court ruling against it would carry greater legal weight than the trial court’s decision and embolden the other insurers that have also been deemed Sifis — American International Group and Prudential Financial — to mount challenges of their own.That could more permanently damage the FSOC.“If the government were to lose on appeal it would be earthshaking,” says Robert Hockett, a Cornell Law professor. “It would set a significant [legal] precedent.”However, he added: “It’s unlikely that the government will lose. The decision by the lower court was a bit of an over-reach on the part of the judge.”Immediately after government officials reviewed her judgment, say people familiar with the FSOC’s thinking, the authorities decided to launch an appeal.“Ordinarily it takes the federal government months to decide whether they will appeal in such big cases — here they’ve decided the very same day,” says Robert Jackson, professor at Columbia Law School, who co-authored a brief supporting the government’s argument.He added: “If they lose on appeal they risk a much broader ruling, so there is a lot a stake. But this is an enormously wrong opinion.”If the government were to lose on appeal it would be earthshaking. It would set a significant [legal] precedentEugene Scalia, the lawyer son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin, who represented MetLife, argued in court that the FSOC had engaged in “total speculation” about the risks posed by MetLife.He complained the process was a “black box” and said that the group was often kept in the dark about how the council reached its decisions.In her ruling, Judge Collyer appeared to agree, finding that the FSOC failed to follow its own guidance when it was deciding whether MetLife posed a threat to the stability of the financial system.She questioned why the council assumed MetLife would come close to collapse in a financial meltdown, ruling that it failed to adequately consider the likelihood the company would be in financial distress.The judge found that US authorities “never projected what the losses would be, which financial institutions would have to actively manage their balance sheets, or how the market would destabilise” if the insurance company failed. Furthermore, she ruled it was a problem that the FSOC did not consider the costs of the Sifi label to MetLife.Yet the government argues that the essence of systemic risk is that large, interconnected financial institutions can fail suddenly and in an unpredictable manner. The government side also denies the FSOC did not follow its own guidance.“The 2008-2009 financial crisis demonstrated that the sudden, unforeseen failures of large financial companies can have sweeping, unpredictable ramifications,” the FSOC argues in a 98-page appeal document.“The Council did not set itself the impossible task of predicting the precise impact of a company’s distress on its counterparties and the broader market.”It went on: “The district court overturned the collective judgment of the heads of the nation’s financial regulatory agencies that material distress at MetLife could pose a threat to the country’s financial stability.“The court’s ruling leaves one of the largest, most complex, and most interconnected financial companies in the country without the regulatory oversight that Congress found essential,” it added.In the meantime MetLife, led by Steven Kandarian, is pressing ahead with plans to sell off a big slice of its business, partly because doing so would reduce the burden from being designated a Sifi.Despite its initial court victory, the company has acknowledged regulatory uncertainty persists — and that there are in any case other business reasons for pursuing the split.MetLife’s next legal riposte to the government is due by mid-August. No date is set for oral argument but the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit is expected to hear the case in the autumn.
34;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-06-03T22:14:07Z;Fed plots two-tier regime for insurer capital rules;;The US Federal Reserve has made a tentative step toward imposing tougher capital requirements on insurers, inviting comment on a proposal for a two-tier regime designed to shield the financial system from another Lehman-like shock.Under the proposal, endorsed by the Fed’s board on Friday afternoon, American International Group and Prudential Financial, the huge insurance conglomerate, would face more stringent rules, while the dozen insurance firms under supervision by the Fed due to their banking activities – the likes of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance and Nationwide Mutual Insurance – would be subject to lighter capital requirements linked to existing state-based standards, writes Ben McLannahan in New York.Governor Daniel Tarullo had previewed the twin-track regime during a speech two weeks ago. The proposals will now go through at least two rounds of public comment before being finalised.The proposal is the product of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which gave the Fed regulatory responsibilities both for insurance holding companies that own a federally insured bank, and for insurance companies designated as a “systemically important financial institution” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Since that law was passed, the industry and its state regulators have been urging the Fed to craft rules reflecting difference between the operations of insurance companies and the banks the Fed usually regulates.“I believe this proposal is an important step toward capital standards that are both appropriate for our supervised insurance firms and that enhance the resiliency and stability of our financial system,” Fed chair Janet Yellen said.MetLife, the largest US life insurer by assets, had been categorized as a SIFI, but a federal judge struck down that designation in March. The US government has appealed.AIG declined to comment.A Prudential spokesperson said the firm was “pleased to see the progress the Federal Reserve is making in designing capital, liquidity and supervisory standards tailored to insurance companies, and we look forward to the opportunity to provide input into the framework.“While there is still considerable work ahead and the details will be important, we view this as a positive step forward that recognizes the underlying economics of our businesses.”
35;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
36;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-05-24T13:20:09Z;Hedge funds: Overpriced, underperforming;The industry has ballooned thanks to pension funds. Now institutional investors are taking a look at costs and returns;It was the shot heard around the hedge fund world. After the New York City Employees’ Retirement System decided to cash all its investments inhedge funds, Letitia James, the city’s public advocate, delivered a message to the industry straight out of Occupy Wall Street: “Let them sell their summer homes and jets and return those fees to their investors.”Hedge funds, she said last month, “believe they can do no wrong, even as they are losing money”. If they truly cared about New York’s pensioners, “they would never charge large fees for failing to deliver on their promises”.New York City’s investment in hedge funds — $1.5bn in well-known firms such as DE Shaw and Brevan Howard — does not matter much for an industry that manages $3tn of assets. But worryingly for hedge funds, Nycers’ decision appears to be part of a trend.According to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research, pension funds and other big institutions now account for only 43.1 per cent of hedge funds’ assets, from 47 per cent three years ago. The reasons for moving their money mix populist politics — many are enraged by the fortunes that hedge fund managers can amass on the back of high fees — with disappointment in their performance.“Let’s face it: if you go back to the 1990s, hedge funds delivered something very special: high returns or very differentiated returns that you could not get elsewhere, and that is what hedge fund investors have been looking for,” said Neil Chriss, founder of Hutchin Hill Capital, a fund with more than $4bn in assets that caters for big institutions. “The problem is, since the crisis, a lot of hedge funds have not been delivering. Returns have been mediocre,” he told the Milken Global Conference this month.Flows of money from big institutions have transformed hedge funds, which were once primarily a vehicle for rich families. Today, large pension funds account for about a quarter of the money managed by hedge funds. Since the market hit its post-crisis bottom in March 2009, passive, low-cost equity fund investors have thrived while hedge fund returns have underperformed the S&P 500 by 51 percentage points.The first of the big institutions to openly split with hedge funds was the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the world’s largest public pension scheme. Calpers announced 20 months ago that it was scrapping hedge funds from its portfolio to reduce costs and complexity. At the time, many thought it would trigger a wave of redemptions, but with public boards tending to be deliberative, it is only now that the wave seems ready to break, hedge fund managers say.In New Jersey, legislators are considering a proposal to withdraw all alternative investments from the state pension fund. Massachusetts is cutting back its pension fund holdings in alternative investments, which include hedge funds, private equity and venture capital, and pressing hedge funds to reduce their fees. Illinois is preparing to take similar action. Even big insurers like AIG and MetLife have cut back on hedge funds, as have some of Europe’s biggest pension funds.Many investors are questioning the benefit of allocating chunks of their money to hedge funds after recent bouts of financial market turbulence and poor performance. The FT’s US financial correspondent Mary Childs joins Cardiff Garcia to discuss the big players and their idiosyncratic personalities, contentious issues like fees and benchmarking metrics, and the institutional lack of diversity among top fund managers. Visit FT.com/alphachat for show notes and links. Music by Minden.“The hedge fund community has had reduced and in some cases negative returns, and with high fees you are seeing a re-evaluation of how you’re going to allocate your money,” Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, recently told CNBC.Should this continue, it will mark the reversal of a decade-long investment trend. Hedge funds’ success in generating gains during the 2000-02 dotcom crashlured many institutions to invest in them for the first time. The success of university endowments — led by Yale, which used investments in hedge funds and other alternatives to generate returns of 13.9 per cent annually for two decades — prompted many institutions to dive into the sector.“In 2005, the number of times Yale and Harvard were mentioned [as a model for other institutional investors] was incredible,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create-Research, and an expert on the fund management industry. “But they had the governance and the skills to go after risky asset classes. Big pension plans didn’t.”More recently, hedge funds started to look attractive after US markets rebounded from their post-crisis lows in 2009. With bonds and equities, the traditional staples of pension fund portfolios, both looking very expensive, hedge funds appeared to be one of the few viable options. The hope was that hedge funds would generate strong returns while also helping to manage risks by using strategies that were not correlated with the stock or bond markets.The effect has been transformative for the hedge fund industry. Entering 2000, there were 3,102 hedge funds managing $456bn, mostly for wealthy families, according to HFR. This year, it counted 8,474 funds managing $2.89tn, mostly for institutions.Against such growth, the exit looks like more of trickle than a flood. Investors withdrew $1.5bn in the fourth quarter of last year, accelerating this year to $15bn, according to HFR. High-profile flame-outs in companies championed by hedge funds, including Valeant, Allergan and SunEdison, have not helped their reputations.But many fear that worse is to follow. Daniel Loeb of Third Point, one of the most powerful hedge fund managers, says the first quarter was “one of the most catastrophic periods of hedge fund performance that we can remember since the inception of this fund”.He says: “There is no doubt that we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds and certain strategies.”.The hedge fund market is far more crowded than when industry pioneers such as George Soros, Julian Robertson and Paul Tudor Jones made their names. With so many assets and so many funds, beating the market becomes far harder. Exploiting a market anomaly or scouting out a stock poised for a bounce makes less difference to the performance of a big institution than a hedge fund with a handful of wealthy clients. And inevitably the skill and quality of the people involved in hedge funds has been diluted.As Mr Rajan puts it, there is a Darwinian process at work. Hedge funds that lack the skill to add value are being slowly forced out of business.“Maybe 20 years ago, projects involving leveraged buyout funds did much better than the general stock market, but all the excess returns have been competed out,” says Jeff Hooke, a consultant to the New Jersey Public Pension Coalition attempting to force the state to divest from all alternatives. “There’s just too much competition.”The trend is not all in one direction, however. US endowments, which are hugely influential because their long-time horizons allow them to experiment, slightly increased their allocations to hedge fund managers last year. So did the similarly influential sovereign wealth funds. According to Preqin, a research group, the proportion of SWFs investing in hedge funds has held steady at 32 per cent, while the proportion investing in private equity — another alternative asset class under fire over fees — has risen from 47 per cent last year to 55 per cent this year.Indeed, several big investors have boosted their exposure to hedge funds. Finland’s state pension scheme plans to invest another $500m this year, and the State Universities Retirement System of Illinois is jumping in with $500m for its first hedge fund allocation.The actuarial consultants, who wield huge influence over how pension funds deploy their money, continue to recommend enthusiastically buying into hedge funds. “The key is that they are structured to protect capital,” says Deb Clarke, Mercer’s global head of investment research. “The danger is that pension funds move into beta [passive funds that track equity indices] at the wrong time and miss the point where idiosyncratic hedge funds should deliver returns.”The critical factor keeping institutional money in hedge funds may be the sheer lack of anything else in which to invest. As Ms Clarke puts it: “Plainly people want something different from equities and bonds — bonds are expensive, and equities are not cheap.”Yogesh Dewan of Hassium Asset Management, which advises family offices on investments and is strongly critical of hedge funds, says they have benefited from quantitative easing and other tactics employed by central banks.“I suspect hedge funds are doing OK because interest rates are so low,” he says. “What would usually go into fixed income assets doesn’t really want to go into fixed income. And everyone thinks they can find that brilliant manager.”Then there is the emotive issue of fees, which are typically referred to as “2 and 20” — a 2 per cent fee levied on assets, regardless of any performance, plus 20 per cent of fund profits. Such fees are far higher than those charged by mutual funds or other options open to large pension managers.With returns coming down, such fees look ever harder to justify. Many institutions are losing patience.“I see the herd mentality among hedge funds every day,” said Roslyn Zhang, managing director of fixed income and alternatives at one of China’s SWFs, China Investment Corporation, at SkyBridge Capital’s annual meeting in Nevada this month. She cited the popular idea to short the Chinese currency. “They spend two seconds on this theme, and they put on the trade. We pay two and 20 for treatment like this. I am reflecting [that] maybe we are not making the right decision.”While hedge funds do not advertise this, their fees are generally negotiable. This is particularly true if the client is a large institution with plenty of money to invest, or if the investor is willing to commit their capital for a longer period of time. Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of SkyBridge, which manages a fund of funds, says paying less in fees is their “job on behalf of investors”. It has negotiated the average fees it pays to about 1.3 per cent for management and an incentive fee of less than 15 per cent.“Performance numbers on an absolute basis are coming down, so fees on a percentage have actually gone up,” he says, and “managers are waking up” to the fact that the days of 20 per cent returns are over.However, Mr Rajan of Create-Research suggests that cutting fees may not resolve hedge funds’ problems.“The immediate cause, fees, is appealing and grabs attention,” he says. “It means you didn’t make a bad choice, you got ripped off. But the main reason is that the hedge funds failed to deliver what it said on the tin.”Should New Jersey keep 35 per cent of its $79bn pension fund in hedge funds and private equity, or sell up and return to a traditional model of only stocks and bonds, as a coalition led by unions wants?The critics’ main argument: hedge funds are not worth the money. “The costs are exorbitant,” wrote Philip Murphy, a former head of Goldman Sachs’ Frankfurt office and a Democrat who is in the running to be New Jersey’s next governor, in the Star-Ledger newspaper. He has complained that “fees and performance bonuses paid to alternatives managers have totalled roughly $1.3bn” over the past two years, while it costs “roughly 30 times as much to manage the 35 per cent of the portfolio that is invested in alternatives as it does to manage the 65 per cent in traditional investments”.New Jersey’s alternative assets programme involves investments in 53 separate hedge funds, according to its official report as of the end of January, and more than 100 separate private equity funds. New Jersey’s treasury says it has enjoyed good performance. Since 2000, it has managed an annualised return of 5.45 per cent, compared with 4.85 per cent in its benchmark of 60 per cent in global equities and 40 per cent in bonds.Its performance is also slightly ahead of the average for large public pension funds. The state’s investment council contends that “a diverse portfolio, including hedge fund investments, mitigates risk and produces the best returns for beneficiaries over a substantial period of time”.But Jeff Hooke, an investment banker with Focus who is working on the case for the New Jersey Public Pension Coalition, pointed to the state’s analysis of the returns that would have been generated over the past 10 years by the new asset allocation proposed by the critics, all indexed, which would include US and non-US stocks and bonds, and some US real estate investment trusts. Over the 10 years to the end of December, this formula would have made 6.25 per cent a year — albeit with noticeably higher volatility — against the 6.08 per cent that the pension fund realised.“They burnt through those fees to achieve nothing except less transparency and liquidity,” Mr Hooke says.

37;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BofA’s $1.3bn penalty dismissed by appeals court;Decision reverses government victory in case over defective home loans known as ‘the Hustle’;US authorities on Monday were dealt a setback in their efforts to hold banks accountable for the financial crisis when an appeals court dismissed a judgment and $1.3bn penalty against Bank of America.The decision reversed an important victory that the government secured three years ago in a high-profile case over defective home loans known as “the Hustle”.The authorities had alleged that Bank of America and Countrywide Financial, the lender it acquired in 2008, defrauded the government-sponsored mortgage groups Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by selling them troublesome loans.In a lawsuit they claimed that in the run-up to the crisis the bank allowed loans to be processed without checking their quality — rushing them through in a “high-speed swim lane”, also referred to as the Hustle.Thousands of loans sold to Fannie and Freddie, which guarantee US mortgages, subsequently defaulted.Bank of America denied that any fraud had occurred. The dispute became one of the few cases over the banking industry’s pre-crisis conduct that went to trial.The jury found Countrywide liable for civil fraud. It also found that Rebecca Mairone, a former Countrywide executive and the only named defendant, was liable on a civil fraud charge.BofA was subsequently ordered to pay $1.3bn by Judge Jed Rakoff, who described the process as a “brazen fraud”.The bank appealed, arguing that the court prevented it from putting up a robust defence.On Monday, its decision to fight the ruling appeared to pay off. The Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York threw out the ruling of the lower court and ordered that the case be dismissed.It said that the government had lacked the evidence to prove that the bank had committed fraud by failing to establish that the misrepresentations were made at the point of sale.“The trial evidence fails to demonstrate the contemporaneous fraudulent intent necessary to prove a scheme to defraud,” it said.It is the second big post-crisis legal setback for the US government this year. In March, a court in Washington found that the authorities acted unlawfully by deciding that insurer MetLife deserved tougher regulation as a “systemically important” financial institution. The government plans to appeal.The trial evidence fails to demonstrate the contemporaneous fraudulent intent necessary to prove a scheme to defraudThe Hustle appeals ruling could embolden banks, which are generally quick to settle government lawsuits, to litigate in such cases.Since so few cases have gone to trial, the government’s legal theories have largely been untested.“This decision creates some litigation risk for the government,” said Robert Giuffra, a lawyer with Sullivan & Cromwell who has represented banks in crisis-related litigation.The $1.3bn penalty that arose from the case was small in comparison to the fines that the industry has paid to resolve other cases related to the housing market meltdown.BofA paid $9.5bn to settle with the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014. That came on top of the $16.7bn in cash and consumer relief it paid in another mortgage settlement with the Department of Justice.Lawyers said Monday’s ruling is unlikely to have broad implications since the government pursued the case on a contract theory of law that differed from allegations made in other mortgage cases.The US brought the Hustle case using the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, which was created after the 1980s savings and loan crisis.The act, which empowers the government to bring civil charges against any party that has committed certain crimes “affecting a federally insured financial institution”, is a useful tool for the authorities. It has a 10-year statute of limitations and potential for significant penalties.Bank of America questioned the use of the act in its appeal.The bank said on Monday: “We are pleased with the appellate court’s decision.” A spokesman for the US attorney’s office in Manhattan could not immediately be reached for comment.

The insurer’s net investment income fell 6 per cent to $4.7bn.Insurers are being tempted to invest in riskier asset classes as ultra-low and negative interest rates dent prospective returns from fixed income securities, which dominate their investment portfolios.Weak bond yields are making it more of a struggle for life companies and pension funds to generate adequate returns to meet their liabilities.Nevertheless, several insurance investment managers say hedge funds are failing to provide the answer.AIG, which has about $10bn invested in hedge funds, is planning to cut its exposure by about half over the next two quarters.MetLife said concerns about high fees were not part of its rationale for its withdrawal, but cited regulators’ rules that insurers have a relatively high amount of capital to withstand losses from volatile assets such as hedge funds.“It’ll continue to be challenging for hedge funds,” Mr Goulart added.Hedge funds account for less than half of 1 per cent of MetLife’s total investment fund portfolio. “This is going to become even smaller, but we will be left with a small portfolio of . . . the most consistently performing managers,” he said.The weaker returns helped push MetLife’s operating earnings in the first quarter down 19 per cent to $1.3bn from a year ago. The results were lower than analysts expected, pushing its shares down 1.5 per cent to $42.90 by midday in New York.Turbulent financial markets wrongfooted several hedge funds during the first quarter. According to the asset manager GAM, overall performance was better in April. The HFRX Global Hedge Fund index returned 0.4 per cent on the month.
39;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Insurers warned of downgrade risk from US retirement shake-up;S&P cautions new ‘fiduciary’ standard will hit sales of some principal products;US insurers have been put on notice over how the Obama administration’s shake-up of pensions advice will hurt their businesses after a leading credit agency warned the reforms could put their ratings at risk.Standard & Poor’s cautioned in a report that a new “fiduciary” retirement standard published this week would hit sales of some of life insurance companies’ principal products.The sweeping changes demand that financial professionals act in the best interests of retirement savers — toughening existing rules, which require only that they make “suitable” recommendations.S&P’s assessment underscores how the reforms could still reshape the US retail financial services landscape, even though the industry secured important concessions from regulators.The final version of the rules are not as strict as those regulators originally proposed. Nevertheless, industry lobbyists heavily criticised them — raising the prospect that they will launch a lawsuit to challenge the reforms.“Unless we see fundamental changes, this rule will remain unworkable,” said David Hirschmann, who runs the US Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.He added: “We will consider every approach to address our concerns.”Insurers are expected to be hit because the changes will apply to so-called variable annuities and fixed-indexed annuities — popular retirement products that generated about $190bn in revenues last year.“This could meaningfully affect sales of VAs and FIAs in the near term,” said Beth Campbell, an S&P credit analyst, of the new regime, which begins next April.S&P said it did not envision changing insurers’ credit ratings “at this time”. But the agency added it anticipated “potential rating implications in the next couple of years, depending on how life insurers adapt”.US-listed insurers AIG, MetLife and Prudential Financial are big sellers of such products, according to data from the trade body Limra.Their European rivals are also likely to be affected. American divisions of the UK’s Prudential, France’s Axa and Germany’s Allianz rank among the 10 largest US annuity writers.S&P added: “If insurers selling VAs and FIAs are unable to adapt to higher compliance costs and potential litigation liability, resulting in weaker profit margins, their credit quality could suffer.”Even so, several of the companies have said that even a particularly adverse scenario would be manageable and could also provide an opportunity to take market share from rivals.Fitch, another big rating agency, highlighted the rules were “less onerous than expected” — although it was cautious about the implications for companies that sell fixed indexed annuities.FIAs were one area in which officials toughened the rules since they published a draft last year. Shares in American Equity Investment Life — the fourth-largest seller of fixed indexed annuities according to Limra — dropped 15 per cent after the changes were unveiled.“Many of the negative aspects of the new regulations will have a greater impact on them,” Fitch said of FIAs, although it added that “over the longer term, both FIA and VA writers will be able to adapt”.The regulatory overhaul in the US comes at a delicate time for the global life insurance sector.Rock-bottom interest rates have pushed up the value of the companies’ liabilities and made it harder for them to generate adequate returns on their investment portfolios.
40;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-04-08T00:12:34Z;US government to challenge MetLife ‘too big to fail’ decision;Treasury to appeal court decision in which regulators were criticised for being ‘arbitrary’;The Obama administration is to launch a legal fightback after a federal court found it had acted unlawfully by deeming the insurer MetLife “ too big to fail”.Just hours after a judge delivered fierce criticism of the regulators that decided MetLife deserved tougher regulations as a “systemically important” financial institution (Sifi), the Treasury confirmed it would appeal.In a previously confidential ruling made public earlier on Thursday, the judge castigated the US government for failing to consider the cost of labelling the insurer as a threat to financial stability.The judgment from US District Judge Rosemary Collyer raises new questions about regulators’ procedures and cuts to the heart of post-crisis regulation.It will be devoured by other institutions looking to shake off their designations as Sifis.But Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, hit back. “This decision leaves one of the largest and most highly interconnected financial companies in the world subject to even less oversight than before the financial crisis,” he said.The Treasury subsequently added in a statement: “The government will appeal the district court’s decision.”The designation subjects Sifis to tougher regulation under the auspices of the Dodd-Frank Act, although regulators have not yet finalised their oversight regime for non-bank financial institutions.MetLife was the only financial group to fight the US government in the courts.GE Capital last week filed an official request to be struck off the list having downsized drastically. The other non-banks that have been designated are AIG and Prudential.Banks are designated under a less ambiguous system that has not yet been challenged in the courts.While the judge released a two-page summary of her ruling last week, her full reasoning centred on a charge that the government had been “arbitrary and capricious”.Judge Collyer wrote that regulators had “focused exclusively on the presumed benefits of [MetLife’s] designation and ignored the attendant costs, which is itself unreasonable”.The regulators include representatives of the Treasury and Federal Reserve, the most powerful members of a group of watchdogs known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was established after the last crisis to monitor threats to the financial system.Mr Lew said the judge was wrong to challenge the FSOC's duty to address low probability but high-impact events such as the failure of AIG or Lehman Brothers. “If the council only responds to risks after they are likely to threaten financial stability, we will pave the way for the next crisis,” he said.Judge Collyer also criticised the FSOC for abandoning its own standards on two issues — by failing to assess MetLife’s vulnerability to distress or explain how it could affect financial stability — while not acknowledging that it had done so.“The final determination hardly adhered to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife’s threat to US financial stability,” she wrote, adding in another passage: “Assumptions pervade the analysis.” MetLife said: “We remain pleased with the US District Court’s decision.”Shortly before the ruling was released, Peter Hancock, AIG’s chief executive, said: “We’re reserving judgment on our options.”@barneyjopson
41;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-04-04T09:03:47Z;MetLife ruling a spur to give Financial Stability Board teeth;Time to give global advisory body statutory powers to protect world from short-sighted political interests;Judge Rosemary Collyer has form. The US district court judge, who last Wednesday rescinded regulators’ “systemically important” designation of insurer MetLife, has shown barely disguised disdain for President Barack Obama and his administration before.Last May, in an Obamacare lawsuit relating to the technicalities of insurance contracts, she asked one witness how the president’s healthcare plan might be checked. “What about impeachment? Is that an option?” she said.In last week’s court case, brought by MetLife in protest at its systemic status, Judge Collyer, a George W Bush appointee, took another swipe at the president — and another at his landmark reforms.The label of “systemically important financial institution”, conceived at a global level by the Financial Stability Board, became a core element of Dodd-Frank, Mr Obama’s package of US legislation designed to de-risk the financial system in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Designation involves higher capital charges and enhanced supervision.Judge Collyer’s decision that MetLife’s Sifi label was “arbitrary and capricious” is a rebuke to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), the watchdog established by Dodd-Frank to stave off another crisis and run the Sifi list.The FSOC, which includes representatives of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, has been weakened as a result. Other smaller insurers could well rebel, too. Prudential Financial already seems to be hinting it could challenge its Sifi designation.This is absurd. The FSOC — with its expert mandate and responsibility for “identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability” — is being torpedoed by an inexpert judge.One of MetLife’s arguments against Sifi designation, apparently accepted by the court, was that life insurance was not the cause of the financial crisis. Quite true. But the FSOC, like any sensible financial watchdog, is looking forwards, not backwards. Besides banks, it must decide which other areas of finance have the potential to wreak havoc in the world. The growing scale of insurers, the mismatch between assets and liabilities and the systemic interlinkages, is ample cause for concern.The US court ruling on MetLife also augurs ill for any attempt to contain the mounting risks in asset management. The SEC’s proposals to counter the systemic risk in that industry have already retreated from designating asset management companies as systemic, focusing instead on the risks within funds. Yet, the pushback from the industry even on these proposals — relating to liquidity buffers and flexible exit pricing — has been strong. Similar FSB proposals, due in the summer, may now lack credibility. Regulators, under pressure from a resurgent financial sector and a political agenda for deregulation, are clearly on the back foot both in asset management and insurance.Undoing the safety catches on the US banking system will be trickier. While Sifi designation of non-banks was assigned to the discretion of the FSOC, the Dodd-Frank legislation directly designated any bank with more than $50bn of assets as systemically important. A Republican effort last year to raise that threshold tenfold failed.However, the US domestic debate over financial regulation evolves, a real test is brewing for the influence of the FSB, and its head, Bank of England governor Mark Carney.In Japan for G20 meetings last week, Mr Carney responded with frustration to the news of the MetLife court decision. The ruling has no bearing on the FSB’s list of global systemically important insurers — nine companies, including the same three US insurers designated by the FSOC as Sifis. But without national buy-in to implement FSB policies on the ground, this voluntary organisation, assembled by the G20, is powerless to protect the world from systemic risk.Since 2008, the FSB and its sister organisation, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, have led the overhaul of global financial regulation, with most countries agreed on the direction of its policies. The US rebellion over MetLife’s Sifi designation, assuming it is not overturned on appeal, could mark a dangerous change of heart. The time may have come for the G20 to give the FSB proper statutory powers to ensure short-sighted political interests do not put the world on the road to financial ruin once more.This article has been amended since publication to correct name of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.patrick.jenkins@ft.comCourt’s rebuke to FSOC was well deserved / From Alex J Pollock.
42;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-04-01T16:26:40Z;Dangers would lurk within an appeal against MetLife ruling;Hedge fund industry’s pyrrhic victory a decade ago offers salutary lessons;US insurer MetLife is celebrating a big victory this week. It convinced a federal judge that US regulators acted unlawfully when they singled it out for tougher supervision, by designating it a “systemically important financial institution” whose failure could destabilise the economy.Although AIG and Prudential were also tagged with the “Sifi” label, MetLife, the US’s largest insurer by assets, was the only one to fight back. And it has paid off, at least for now.US District Judge Rosemary Collyer has not made her reasoning public, but she has ruled that the decision by the Federal Stability Oversight Council — which includes all the big American watchdogs — was “arbitrary and capricious”. Among other things, she found that the FSOC failed to take a detailed look at MetLife’s vulnerability to financial distress and consider the financial impact of designating it a Sifi. At a hearing, Judge Collyer had openly criticised the designation process, saying, “that’s not a risk analysis. That’s assuming the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst.”Her focus on the lack of an economic impact study is also not surprising. The FSOC has not yet said exactly what the Sifi designation will mean in practice, so there is no way to tell how much extra capital MetLife might have to have, or what other regulatory strictures it might face.The US Treasury department, which heads the FSOC, has said it “disagrees” with the decision but has not disclosed whether it will appeal. This hesitation may stem from what it knows is in the still-sealed ruling.Judge Collyer is widely viewed as conservative but if she has identified flaws in the designation process, the country — and the industry — might be better served if the FSOC went back to the drawing board. After conducting better risk and financial impact studies, the FSOC would be better placed to justify its decision. As a side benefit, the effort would add teeth and clarity to the new Sifi regime. Investors and managers would know what makes a financial company too big to fail and what extra costs a Sifi should expect to incur to protect the broader economy.As it stands, there are risks for both sides in any appeal process. A higher court ruling for MetLife could permanently undermine what has been seen as a critical plank of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. US judges have a history of beating back financial reforms when they are insufficiently justified. Back in 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission ran into trouble when it tried to bring tighter supervision to hedge funds. It adopted a new rule requiring hedge fund managers to register as investment advisers and submit to direct oversight. A New York fund manager went to court and argued that the rule was too burdensome. An appeals court agreed, and the requirement was dropped. The industry celebrated.But their victory proved pyrrhic. During the financial crisis, the largely unregulated status of US hedge funds caught the attention of European Parliament members who had no fondness for overseas financiers. While global regulators focused on banks, the legislators in Strasbourg put reining in hedge funds at the top of their agenda and came up with a much more intrusive regime than the SEC had envisioned. Thus the much hated Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive was born.Be careful what you wish for.

He argued that the Obama administration had gone too far when it identified his company as a potential threat to the financial system that needed extra supervision.This week a federal judge sent ripples through Washington and New York by ruling that Mr Kandarian was right and revoking the insurer’s designation.The decision has shaken a pillar of post-crisis regulation, raising questions about how the US handles “ too big to fail” institutions and whether other groups will follow MetLife and try to throw off the government’s yoke.On Thursday GE Capital, which has chafed at its tagging as a “systemically important financial institution”, filed an official request to be struck off the government’s list having downsized drastically.The judge’s decision is putting pressure on American International Group — whose near collapse in 2008 helped fuel the drive to identify and rein in systemic institutions — to say whether it will now try to escape the scrutiny that goes with being on the Sifi list.Peter Hancock, the insurer’s chief executive, told CNBC on Thursday: “It certainly opens that opportunity, but I think it’s something we want to reserve judgment [on].”The full impact of US District Judge Rosemary Collyer’s ruling is not yet clear. That is partly because US Treasury is widely expected to appeal to the higher courts, although so far it has only said it will “continue to defend [the] designation process vigorously”.In addition, the reasoning behind her ruling has not yet been revealed. Ironically for a case in which MetLife accused regulators of lacking transparency, the two parties asked for the details of the judgment to be confidential. MetLife and Treasury are due to decide with the judge next week how much of the ruling will be released.“It’s intolerable that a case that is so important to the financial stability of the country is almost entirely secret,” said Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a group that lobbies for tougher regulation.MetLife argued — and Judge Collyer appears to have agreed — that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators that includes representatives of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, mishandled the Sifi decision.The council made unsubstantiated assumptions, failed to take into account the costs of Sifi designation on the company and ultimately reached an “arbitrary and capricious” decision, the insurer argued.“It’s a profound embarrassment to the FSOC,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at the Washington-based consultancy Federal Financial Analytics.The ruling “seems to validate management’s decision to pursue this lawsuit, which we had previously questioned”, said analysts at UBS in a note to clients.But several lawyers said they would need to see the court’s full legal opinion before being able to assess the government’s chances of success in a higher court.Not surprisingly, some of the staunchest Republican opponents of Dodd-Frank in Congress immediately praised the ruling.“FSOC’s perfect storm of secrecy and intimidation has created a shadow regulatory system that concentrates power in Washington at the expense of hardworking Americans,” said congressman Scott Garrett. “I’m pleased to see the judicial branch took a stand for the Constitution with their decision.”FT’s Alistair Gray tells Ben McLannahan which other companies might come forward to challenge the “too big to fail” designation, how the ruling could affect insurance groups like AIG, and what steps Washington could take to contest the ruling.The other big insurer on the “too big to fail” list is Prudential Financial. Asked about its next move, it said: “We continuously review developments that impact our company, and we are evaluating what is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders.”The MetLife decision will have much less impact on banks because the Sifi rules are already much clearer for them. The Dodd Frank law specifically states that any bank with assets of $50bn or more will be considered systemically important.That cut-off has been hugely unpopular with some of the midsized institutions that were captured by the designation. But their only hope of escape is a change in the law, and enduring partisan acrimony in Congress makes that unlikely.So far, large asset managers such as Fidelity and BlackRock have gotten off relatively lightly in the systemic debate. They headed off an early move by regulators to designate specific companies as systemic threats, and instead persuading FSOC and global bodies to focus on risks emanating from particular markets and activities.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate who could be in the White House while the MetLife case finishes its journey through the courts, has consistently highlighted the stability risks posed by non-banks.Her campaign was quick to criticise the MetLife ruling. “When Treasury, the SEC, the Fed, and other top financial regulators all agree an institution poses systemic risks to our economy, it’s deeply concerning when a lower court judge unilaterally rejects their decision,” a Clinton spokesman said.
44;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-03-31T07:47:47Z;MetLife: the earnestness of being unimportant;Regulators are struggling to oversee big non-banks;In the US’s courts, even the little guy can take on the government and prove that he is, well, the little guy. Huge US insurance company MetLife makes an odd underdog, admittedly, but it was the lone group to fight the Feds when it was labelled “systemically important”. On Wednesday its pugnacity was rewarded. A federal judge reversed the Financial Stability Oversight’s Council’s 2014 decision on MetLife. The government can appeal.While the exact rules for non-bank Sifis are yet to be determined, the threat of heavier oversight and capital requirements has already prompted change. General Electric is shedding $200bn of assets from GE Capital. Carl Icahn has called for AIG to break up to avoid becoming a Sifi. MetLife itself said it would separate its US retail business and its $240bn in assets.The FSOC’s determination rests on six criteria including size, leverage, interconnectedness, liquidity, maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities, and the existing regulatory regime. There is little disagreement on MetLife’s scale: it has nearly $900bn in total assets. The contested question is how any distress at MetLife would ripple through the financial system. The regulators believe trouble would filter through the economy as policyholders wrote down the value of their claims, its funding in short-term financing markets dried up and it became a forced seller of assets. Havoc across widely dispersed counterparties would follow, the government reckons.MetLife argues that life assurance was not the cause of the financial crisis and existing state-by-state regulation is onerous enough. Its core liability, potential payouts of insurance awards, come due over long timeframes — in contrast to its liquid bank deposits.The full decision remains under seal for now but the court’s order did suggest that it did not quite believe that a MetLife implosion would create the chaos the regulators foresee. Moreover, the court seemed sympathetic to worries about the economic harm enhanced scrutiny could do to MetLife.Regulators, keen to avoid refighting the last war, are mindful of new threats. Insurance companies are the first non-bank target but questions have also been raised about risks embedded in big asset managers, such as BlackRock, and even private equity firms, such as Blackstone. Neither group is too small to afford lots of good lawyers.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 80 cents a share on sales of $693m.Same-store sales, an important industry metric, advanced 5 per cent, above forecasts for a 4.7 per cent gain.Lululemon, which has benefited from the “athleisure” trend for sports clothing to be worn outside the gym, said its inventories “may even begin to look lean”.Gross margin decreased by 120 basis points, a more modest decline than feared.“Perhaps more importantly, inventory levels are leaner than expected [nearly in line with comparable sales growth] and at the same time gross margin came in well better than consensus,” said Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Citigroup.“This combination helps discredit the bear thesis that Lululemon would need to take a big gross margin hit to get its elevated inventories in line.”Lululemon has made headway since 2013 when it recalled yoga pants that were judged to be too sheer.For fiscal 2017 the company expects sales in the range of $2.29bn to $2.34bn, compared with estimates of $2.33bn. In the current quarter sales look likely to be between $483m and $488m, against expectations of $485.4m.Lululemon’s advance came alongside a broader, if moderate, stock rally. At the close, the S&P 500 had climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,063.95, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 17,716.66, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 4,869.29.Global markets advanced after dovish remarks on Tuesday by Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve chair, as hopes that US rates will remain lower for longer drummed up demand for risk assets.Carnival shares rose 5.5 per cent to $52.37 after upbeat fiscal first-quarter results, aided by a decline in fuel costs.The cruise operator said profits had nearly tripled to $142m, or 18 cents a share, in the three months to the end of February.Adjusting for one-off items, however, earnings of 38 cents a share eclipsed Wall Street estimates for 32 cents. Total revenue climbed 3.4 per cent to $3.7bn.Carnival said its fuel costs had fallen 41 per cent year-on-year to $187m in the previous quarter.Shake Shack climbed 2.5 per cent to $35.75 after analysts at Longbow Research upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy” with a price target of $46.MetLife was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, advancing 5.2 per cent to $44.66, after the insurer won a fight against US authorities over its designation as a systemically important financial institution.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
46;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-03-30T16:43:37Z;MetLife wins ‘too big to fail’ court battle;Insurer defeats US government’s ‘systemically important’ financial institution designation;MetLife has secured a victory in its battle against US regulators that deemed it ‘too big to fail’, a legal ruling that may have far-reaching implications for the country’s financial system.In a blow to the Obama administration, a court in Washington on Wednesday found it had acted unlawfully by deciding the insurance group deserved tougher regulation as a “systemically important” financial institution (Sifi). The government can appeal.The ruling will shake an important pillar of the Dodd-Frank legislative reforms drawn up after the financial crisis and could encourage legal challenges from the other insurers deemed to be Sifis — American International Group and Prudential Financial.The banks already classed as systemically important have less chance of escaping via the courts because the criteria for their designation — unlike that of non-banks — is written directly into the law.Members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) had voted nine to one in favour of designating MetLife a Sifi, a label that leads to additional regulatory scrutiny and higher capital requirements.FSOC’s members include Janet Yellen, Fed chair, and Jack Lew, treasury secretary.A Treasury spokesman said: “We strongly disagree with the court’s decision. We are confident that FSOC’s determination was lawful and will continue to defend the council’s designations process vigorously.”But the district court found FSOC had acted unlawfully, giving MetLife an amnesty.The decision pushed up shares in MetLife — the largest US insurer by assets — 5.2 per cent on Wednesday. It is an important breakthrough for Steven Kandarian, the MetLife chief executive who took on the authorities a year ago.“Today’s ruling validates MetLife’s decision to seek judicial review,” he said in a statement. “From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.”Eugene Scalia, the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin and a lawyer who represented MetLife in court, had argued the process that led to MetLife being deemed a Sifi was a “black box”.MetLife challenged the decision even though the consequences of designation were unclear. The regime has yet to take effect, with regulators yet to quantify the additional capital requirements.Today’s ruling validates MetLife’s decision to seek judicial review. From the beginning, MetLife has said that its business model does not pose a threat to the financial stability of the United StatesGovernment lawyers had come under tough questioning from Rosemary Collyer, the district judge in Washington, earlier this year as they sought to defend their deliberations.The full legal judgment was not immediately available.Despite the ruling in its favour, MetLife is expected to press ahead with plans to sell off a big slice of its business — for which part of the rationale was to reduce the burden from being designated a Sifi.People familiar with the matter acknowledged the government’s scope to appeal could drag the process on for months or years. They also pointed out that there were other business reasons for a split.Weston Bloomer, analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said most investors had expected the government to win the case. “The final ruling is still up in the air, but this is a clear positive and gives them [MetLife] a fighting chance.”Steve Myrow, a former US Treasury official now at Beacon Policy Advisors, said: “It’s more of a political black eye for the Obama administration than anything else. It will play into the broader theme of the administration overstepping its executive authority.”MetLife is planning to float or sell part of its retail division in a deal expected to be worth about $10bn.AIG has come under pressure from activist investors to split into smaller companies in large part because of its Sifi designation.

48;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-03-02T16:43:50Z;US life insurers shaken by rock-bottom rates;Industry titans hit almost as hard as banks amid macroeconomic concerns;Life insurers are supposed to be bedrocks of financial stability, dependable institutions whose long-term business models set them apart from scandal-hit banks.Yet shares in the leading US insurers, which help millions of Americans through retirement, have been anything but stable in recent weeks. Titans of the industry have been hit almost as hard as lenders in this year’s stock market rout.Shares in Lincoln National, the third largest listed US life insurer by assets, have dropped 23 per cent — more than any S&P 500 bank. The two biggest, MetLife and Prudential Financial, have lost more than 13 per cent even after a partial recovery this week.Many of the macroeconomic woes that have led investors to sell bank stocks have also made them nervous about life insurers.The biggest worry is rock-bottom interest rates, which push up the value of the insurers’ liabilities and make it a struggle for them to generate adequate returns on their vast investment portfolios.Stock market volatility, energy sector fragility and regulatory uncertainty have added to the pressure.For seasoned insurance analysts it is little wonder the sector has been battered. Life insurers’ valuations track closely 10-year bond yields, which have been at or near record lows for years.“You can usually tell how the industry is going to trade based on what the 10-year is doing,” says Steven Schwartz an analyst at Raymond James.This week Japan became the second country to sell such bonds at a negative yield, following Switzerland. Yet yields do not need to be sub zero to cause big problems for insurers. Ultra low is bad enough.Insurers traditionally invest the cash they get from policyholders largely in corporate and government bonds. Too much allocated to racier asset classes, such as equities, would threaten their ability to pay claims.However, the era of depressed bond yields has made the sector’s conservative approach to investments increasingly perilous.Life insurers are constrained in how much pain they can pass on to customers. They have sold savings and retirement policies that offer consumers minimum returns — and need to meet promises made years ago when interest rates were higher.Products with guarantees account for between 60 and 80 per cent of US life insurers’ balance sheets, Moody’s estimates. The average outstanding guarantee is between 2 and 4 per cent.The companies seek to match their liabilities by investing in long-term assets. But the match is often far from perfect.“There are some products where it’s almost impossible to find investments that go out as far as the cash flow on the policies,” says Scott Robinson at Moody’s. Liabilities associated with long-term care insurance stretch out for decades, for instance.Rating agencies are concerned insurers are being tempted to turn to riskier asset classes to deal with the problem. Fitch says it “remains concerned about the strategies that life insurers may use to reach for additional yield.”Downgrades of energy bonds caused by the oil price fall are another concern. As of the start of the year 13 of the largest US life insurers held $67.2bn of energy assets, according to Morgan Stanley. Energy accounts for about 7 per cent of the typical insurer’s investment portfolio.It is not only fixed-income markets that are causing a headache. Turbulence in equities is also bad news for the sector.Lower stock prices mean lower fees for insurers’ asset management arms.Stock market downturns also make variable annuities (VAs) — popular retirement-income products in the US — harder to manage.VAs are backed by equities, which can give consumers stock market-like returns. But they also offer lifetime guarantees, protecting policyholders against heavy losses.To meet the guarantees the insurers attempt to hedge their exposures. But they have had mixed success in doing so. “Does the hedging work? There’s always concern about that,” says Mr Schwartz of Raymond James.VAs are forecast to generate an average 14 per cent of earnings this year at seven US life insurers tracked by Morgan Stanley. Some companies have far greater exposure. They are set to account for almost half of Lincoln Financial’s 2016 profits — helping explain why its shares have been hit particularly hard.On top of unfavourable financial markets, the industry is also facing regulatory challenges.VAs, which tend to be sold through financial advisers, are expected to be hit by proposals from the US Labor Department to tighten standards for distributors.The rule would require brokers and advisers to act as “fiduciaries” — putting their consumers’ interests first.The change could put financial middlemen at greater risk of legal challenges for alleged mis-selling — and reduce incentives for them to sell complex products such as VAs in the first place.Dennis Glass, Lincoln’s chief executive, moved to reassure Wall Street on a recent call with analysts. Even the most “adverse scenario” would be “manageable”, he said. Only 30 per cent of the company’s annuity sales in the fourth quarter came from products it expected to be impacted by the Labor Department’s crackdown.Meanwhile, Prudential, MetLife and AIG are also facing higher capital requirements after officials deemed them “ systemically important” financial institutions.Supervisors have yet to quantify the consequences of designation, but that has not stopped MetLife from setting out plans to break itself up to soften the anticipated regulatory blow.Despite the pressures, few analysts are worried about the sector’s financial strength. The industry-wide “risk-based capital” ratio — which compares the amount of capital with the minimum required — had improved from 413 per cent in 2009 to 491 per cent at the end of last year, according to Morgan Stanley.The businesses are still throwing off plenty of cash, helping them return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Prudential Financial has paid out $9bn since the start of 2011. In December it raised its dividend by a fifth. MetLife increased its dividend 7 per cent last year. In total the insurer distributed $3.5bn to shareholders in 2015.The three largest life insurers by assets are trading at discounts of about 30 per cent of their respective book values. Many analysts argue this presents a big buying opportunity.“The industry is very well capitalised,” says Mr Schwartz, adding of the sell-off: “It’s way, way, way over done.”European life insurers have had just as tough a start to 2016 as their US counterparts. Share prices of the largest companies are down heavily, writes Oliver Ralph in London.Allianz, Aviva, Legal & General and Prudential are all down between 10 and 15 per cent in the year to date. The Southern Europeans have had it worse — Italy’s Generali and Unipol, and Spain’s Mapfre, are all down by more than a fifth.Like the US life insurers, the Europeans have had to cope with low interest rates and, since January, volatile capital markets. Low interest rates are especially painful because in some markets — notably Germany — the insurers have sold products that guarantee investment returns well above what is available in the market today.The Europeans have also had to deal with the added complication of the EU’s Solvency II rules, which were introduced at the start of January and force them to make tough decisions about the assets they hold.“Under Solvency II, the insurers need to optimise their assets for risk, return and capital consumption,” says Patrick Liedtke, a managing director in BlackRock’s insurance asset management team. “That’s not an easy equation to solve.”For some insurers, Solvency II has meant a move into government debt. “If your solvency capital level is not where you’d like it to be, then it is the asset class of choice,” says Mr Liedtke.But wherever possible, the insurers are looking for higher yields. “They are getting as much exposure to government debt as they need, then trying to use the risk budget to get more exposure to higher yields,” he adds. That is leading many of them into corporate bonds and infrastructure debt, where demand often exceeds supply.Solvency II has also forced the insurers to be more open about how fluctuating markets affect their capital. For example, when it reported its results last week, French insurer Axa said that its Solvency Capital Ratio (available capital as a percentage of the minimum required) was 205 per cent at the end of December, but that market movements had since pushed it down to about 190 per cent.

Payments due in the commonwealth’s 2016 fiscal year by Cofina have already been set aside with its bond trustee.The investors estimate the proposal would provide relief of between $2.6bn and $3.7bn over the next decade.Conceived in 2006, Cofina was structured to attract investors to the island’s paper at a time when Puerto Rico faced significant strain tapping debt markets.The independent debt authority, which has amassed roughly $17.2bn of debt, was guaranteed a certain portion of revenues generated by a new sales and use tax, separating it from the island’s general fund.However, nearly a decade of economic downturn have depleted the island’s cash reserves. Policymakers now argue that funds set aside for Cofina should be used to service Puerto Rico’s $49.2bn debt pile, including general obligation bondholders who enjoy a constitutional guarantee.$49.2bnPuerto Rico’s debt pileUnder the so-called working group’s proposal, the island sought to cut the government issued debt by 46 per cent, including a nominal haircut of more than 50 per cent on outstanding Cofina paper.The net present value of the proposed cut is far larger, as the bonds would be repaid over a longer time horizon than when they were originally issued, investors say.Susheel Kirpalani, a partner with Quinn Emanuel, the law firm representing the senior creditors of Cofina, said the group’s proposal would provide the commonwealth the much needed liquidity it has asked for.“We will wait and be patient until the commonwealth has the ability to repay and can build back up to health,” Mr Kirpalani said. “But at least we’re not sacrificing our principal and our rights.”The senior Cofina plan would prioritise their repayment over subordinated debt holders, with expectations of a full par return for the senior liens between 2034 and 2047 in three economic scenarios laid out by the working group.*Charts above are based on projections to 2060 and do not indicate the full impact on subordinated debt beyond that date*Mr Kirpalani notes that if the plan received backing from a majority of the roughly $7bn in senior note holders, subordinated holders would be bound by the agreement.“It’s a way to at least solve the Cofina part of the puzzle,” he added. “I don’t think it is in anyone’s interest to litigate. This provides liquidity that the general fund needs.”The plan would also amend how the sales and use tax revenues are divided between the commonwealth and Cofina bondholders — splitting the taxes as they are generated. Under the current set-up, Cofinas receive the entirety until a certain threshold is reached.The proposal also conceived a mechanism for subordinated retail investors, who cannot wait for the senior bondholders to be paid in full, to receive remedies earlier.At a panel for Congressional staff members last week, advisers to the commonwealth said they believed Puerto Rico could manage as much as $1.7bn in debt service a year, but that they needed time to push through economic reform.Investors and policymakers agree that the island is likely to default on some of its most senior debt this July if it is unable to agree to a restructuring. Puerto Rico has already defaulted on bonds issued by two of its agencies.‘We’ve run out of tricks, we’ve run out of emergency measures,” said Melba Acosta Febo, president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

The designation carries additional regulatory scrutiny and tougher capital requirements.“That’s not a risk analysis,” said the district judge, Rosemary Collyer, at one point. “That’s assuming the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst.”Eric Beckenhauer, the Department of Justice lawyer who represented the government, defended MetLife’s designation as the “considered judgment” of the heads of “major financial agencies of the country”.Members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council — a body set up in response to the crisis — voted nine to one in favour of determining that MetLife poses a potential threat to financial stability. Its members include Janet Yellen, Fed chair, and Jack Lew, treasury secretary.The judge noted that the authorities only had to pass a low bar in identifying what could threaten the financial system. She also challenged several arguments made by MetLife. Yet she gave the government side a tougher time.In particular she was critical of the way the council reached its decision, questioning the independence of the civil servants who had gathered the facts. The judge grilled Mr Beckenhauer on ""who decides what, and at what point"".""I'm having trouble with the term 'adjudication',"" she said. ""There's nobody neutral in the process.""Eugene Scalia, the partner at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher who represented MetLife, argued FSOC had engaged in “total speculation” about the risks posed by MetLife. He criticised the process as a “black box” and contended that MetLife was often kept in the dark about the basis for the council’s decisions.Mr Beckenhauer hit back. “The record clearly shows the opposite,” he said. MetLife had a “full and fair opportunity to be heard.”He said the authorities had engaged with the company for 17 months, held several meetings with its representatives and conducted a robust analysis.To succeed, MetLife needs to convince the judge that the authorities had acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner.Jaret Seiberg, analyst at Guggenheim, said he expected the government would prevail.""While there may be some comments during the hearing, it is important to always recall that some judges will play devil’s advocate with their questions,"" he said.AIG and Prudential Financial, two other non-bank institutions that have also been labelled Sifis, are watching the case closely as they could be affected by the outcome.AIG is coming under pressure from activist investors to break up to avoid the Sifi tag. MetLife last month unveiled plans to sell off a big chunk of its business as it attempts to soften the regulatory blow.The legal ruling is not expected for several months and an unfavourable outcome is likely to be appealed."

52;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-25T13:22:05Z;Banking can learn from insurance on systemic risk;The dynamic between insurers, regulators and shareholders should be instructive;When Italy’s Generali managed to get itself off the global list of systemically important insurance companies in November, there were cheers in Trieste.Removal from the nine-strong list of insurers, deemed systemically important financial institutions (Sifis), meant a huge administrative problem evaporated. So did the prospect of tougher Sifi capital requirements from 2019. Generali’s secret had been to shrink and simplify its business. First it sold its US life reinsurance business to France’s Scor. Then it sold Swiss private bank BSI to Brazil’s now troubled BTG Pactual.The moves convinced regulators at the Financial Stability Board that Generali was no longer a global Sifi (replacing it with another European insurer, Aegon).They also gave US peers — and their shareholders — ideas.MetLife, the biggest US insurance company by assets, has been on a mission to shake off its Sifi label ever since it got it. A year ago, it took legal action against the US regulatory body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, to challenge the designation. A couple of weeks ago, it announced plans to shrink, by spinning off a unit that generates 20 per cent of profits. This may have been a ruse to ditch a low-margin business but it may also prove a canny way to avoid the Sifi requirements, providing another route map for big rivals.AIG, and its agitator in chief, Carl Icahn, are watching closely. The US number four is barely half the size it was when it collapsed in 2008. But for Mr Icahn, and fellow rebel shareholder John Paulson, far more is needed. They have piled pressure on Peter Hancock, AIG’s chief executive, since launching a break-up campaign last autumn.Mr Hancock is this week set to outline a plan to ringfence troubled assets and other legacy business in an effort to see off the three-way split that Messrs Icahn and Paulson are championing.That idea was born of a desire to boost the group’s share price, which has come down 8 per cent since the rebel campaign began, though still up 8 per cent during the past year. But it could see AIG escape Sifi status, too. According to a recent Bernstein poll, 75 per cent of AIG shareholders would welcome that outcome.30The number of banks deemed systemically important by the FSBThe black-box exercise that the FSB and FSOC engage in when deciding on Sifi labelling is frustrating for insurance companies and puzzling for everyone else. Generali escaped the designation more than two years after it sold the US business that looked like a principal risk, and only after it had also sold a pretty banal private bank.Quite why Aegon has suddenly been included is similarly mysterious. The Dutch group only scrapes into the top 20 insurers in the world, ranked by market capitalisation, and is barely a tenth the size of the biggest, China Life, which is not designated a Sifi.Most illogical of all is the absence of any reinsurers on the Sifi list, particularly the likes of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, Munich Re or Swiss Re.All the same, the regulators are right in their aims. Basing their assessments on both size and complexity makes sense, and penalises the kind of balance sheet risk — and financial market complexity — intrinsic to, for example, annuity guarantees underpinned by elaborate derivatives contracts.It is also a useful check on the merger and acquisition fever that gripped insurers — like other hot sectors — last year. Get too big and the economics no longer add up.The dynamic between insurers, their regulators and their shareholders should be instructive for the banking industry, 30 of whose number are deemed systemically important by the FSB.Despite the turmoil, and all the talk of banks being under pressure, there has been little sign of the biggest balance sheets shrinking on either side of the Atlantic. With a few blips, JPMorgan has grown consistently since the financial crisis and now has a $2.4tn balance sheet. The same goes for BNP Paribas, with €2.1tn of assets. Over a similar period, HSBC’s assets of $2.5tn are almost unchanged.All three attract the highest capital surcharges of 2 or 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets. Share price performance has been poor. HSBC is down 24 per cent over the past year. BNP is down 10 per cent. JP is down 1 per cent. And yet, there has been almost no pressure from big activist investors on the behemoths of banking. That needs to change.
53;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-24T23:23:38Z;AIG forced to turn up the heat in battle to repel Icahn;Chief executive Peter Hancock likely to come out fighting with long-awaited strategic update;Carl Icahn’s fight with executives at American International Group over the activist investor’s push to split apart the most valuable US insurance company is becoming increasingly ugly.A slide deck distributed by financiers sympathetic to AIG claims that the septuagenarian’s previous efforts to make changes at regulated financial services companies have “often yielded disastrous results for shareholders”.For his part, in his latest open letter to the board, Mr Icahn accused AIG’s executives of “misleading” investors by putting financial information that he believes to be “materially inaccurate” in the public domain.The billionaire — who has received support from hedge fund manager John Paulson — also alleges that top managers, led by chief executive Peter Hancock, are resisting a break-up partly to protect their own bonuses.The activists, who claim to have backing from other shareholders, believe that Mr Hancock may yet abandon his opposition to their proposal to separate AIG’s life and general insurance arms.Mr Hancock is in no mood to do so, according to people familiar with his thinking. They say that he is likely to come out fighting when he presents a long-awaited strategic update on Tuesday.He is expected to detail his own scheme to narrow AIG’s focus, improve its efficiency and become more transparent to investors — a less radical course, but one that his backers say should produce superior returns.The company is in need of some. Shares in AIG trade at about 30 per cent less than their book value, a discount to rivals.Activists contend that the valuation gap can be closed if the insurer, which has a market capitalisation of $68bn, be split up. They say federal regulations that classify AIG — along with MetLife, GE and Prudential Financial — as a “systemically important” financial institution, or Sifi, make its conglomerate corporate structure untenable.Such arguments were given more weight this month when MetLife set out a plan to divest large chunks of its life assurance business, citing the Sifi regime. Shares in MetLife have since outperformed the US financial sector by 10 per cent.It echoed a historic decision last year by GE to hive off its banking business. For critics, AIG looks isolated in not taking such radical steps.However, the logic that prompted MetLife’s move does not necessarily apply to AIG.The business MetLife plans to shed is especially hard hit by the Sifi rules. It is a big writer of “variable annuities”, which guarantee minimum returns to policyholders. Companies that sell such products bear the risks of volatility in financial markets, so regulators insist they have more capital to back them than traditional underwriters.Joshua Shanker, at Deutsche Bank, says he is “not convinced that what is good for MetLife is an obvious prescription for AIG”.Washington has yet to quantify the consequences of Sifi designation. Still, critical AIG shareholders say that whatever rules are finalised, the direction of travel is clear.“They’re going to have to serve a life sentence [for the crisis],” says one of the company’s largest 30 investors. “The Fed wants them to break up. It’s very clear that now Washington would see that as a victory.”People close to AIG reject that assertion. AIG has played a big part in the post-crisis reordering of US finance.Since its $185bn taxpayer rescue, the insurer has transformed itself, shedding about $93bn worth of assets from aircraft leasing to consumer finance. The group, which has returned to profitability and repaid the bailout funds, is confident that the Sifi rules will be manageable.That said, this week Mr Hancock is expected to signal his willingness to walk away from underperforming or non-core businesses — via disposals, if the price is right. AIG is preparing a partial listing of its mortgage insurance arm, estimated to be worth about $6bn. A much smaller subsidiary, a broker dealer network called Advisor, is also on the block.Josh Stirling, an analyst at Bernstein, says that other disposal candidates could include a retail insurance business in Japan, which could fetch about $5bn, and Valic, the public sector retirement provider worth an estimated $10bn.Mr Icahn has made clear he will not be satisfied with what he calls “incremental changes”. Yet such steps could be enough to quell a rebellion from the wider investor base — especially since Mr Hancock argues that an outright split would entail big costs.AIG pays virtually no tax, a legacy of the huge losses it racked up during the financial crisis and its aftermath. The insurer is not alone in applying losses to reduce its tax liability. But AIG is thought to have among the biggest such “deferred tax assets” in the world. The company has valued it at $15bn, meaning it expects to pay hardly any tax for several years.Those in the AIG camp say the group would forgo about a third of this benefit were it to prise apart its life and general insurance operations. The reasons cited are rather arcane, given the complex tax and accounting rules, but the impact is important.“He’s basically correct from a strategic point of view,” says Brett Horn, analyst at Morningstar of Mr Icahn. “The issue is the tax.”Mr Icahn disputes AIG’s analysis of the tax implications of a break-up. Several independent analysts say the picture is unclear.AIG could help itself by clarifying how it arrives at its calculations, says Meyer Shields of KBW. “They must provide more information to substantiate their claims.”For the KBW analyst, the debate effectively come down to one question. “Is the upside to any spin-off enough to compensate for the lost tax benefit?”
54;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-19T17:15:11Z;Carl Icahn sees lessons for AIG in MetLife shake-up;Activist investor seizes on rival’s move to slim down in push for insurer to break up;Carl Icahn has stepped up pressure on American International Group as the activist investor pushes for the insurer to break up, seizing on rival MetLife’s move to offload a chunk of its business.The Wall Street billionaire on Tuesday said a radical plan unveiled by MetLife last week to slim down was another sign that AIG needed to become a “smaller, simpler company”.In his latest open letter to the board, Mr Icahn moved to pre-empt AIG executives’ attempts to rally shareholder support with a long-awaited strategic update they plan to set out next week.“I suspect, after two months of waiting, management will release [an update] that fails to present a drastic strategic shift and instead is limited to only incremental changes such as small-scale asset sales and incremental cost cutting,” he wrote. “If this occurs then the little credibility management now has will be lost.”Mr Icahn argues a split of AIG’s life and general insurance arms would allow it to avoid US authorities’ “systemically important financial institution”, or Sifi, label — which brings with it higher capital requirements.MetLife, which has also been deemed a Sifi, highlighted the new regulations when it disclosed plans to shed a chunk of its retail arm, saying they threaten to make the combined business uncompetitive.However, AIG’s senior managers have rejected the break-up logic, arguing a split would result in a higher tax bill, fail to free up capital and “distract” from cost-cutting initiatives.In response to Mr Icahn’s latest missive, the company said: “AIG continues to take steps to narrow its focus, improve its financial performance and return capital to shareholders. AIG maintains an active dialogue with shareholders, including Carl Icahn.The insurer reiterated it would update on its strategy “and its proactive plan to drive shareholder value” next week.Mr Icahn, who joined the ranks of AIG’s five largest shareholders with a 3.4 per cent stake, also cited a recent poll by the broker Bernstein that found limited support for chief executive Peter Hancock.“I believe management’s credibility with shareholders is all but gone,” claimed the investor, adding he hoped the board would “take matters into its own hands if management still resists drastic change.”
55;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-18T13:16:26Z;Aviva opens ‘digital garage’ in technology push;Insurer invests in technology to harness big data analytics to help boost productivity;Few investors would associate exposed brick walls, table footie and vintage posters in London’s trendy Hoxton Square with insurance.But this “digital garage” is one of two sites set up by Aviva to explore and develop all things digital. The other, opened last month, is located in a 1930s art deco former art gallery in Singapore.“We’re being encouraged to break every rule in the book, and not feel constrained by traditional ways of doing things in the industry,” says Andrew Brem, the former Asda and Carphone Warehouse executive who was brought in to run Aviva’s digital strategy in December 2014. He manages about 100 people at the digital garage, from website creators to data analysts to games developers.The FTSE 100 insurer is one of several in the sector investing in technology in an effort to harness big data analytics to help remain competitive and boost profitability. By analysing data, for example, the company has found that pension savers tend to be better drivers, so it offers car insurance discounts to its pension customers.Germany’s Allianz announced the formation of a unit called Digital Transformation in November. Italy’s Generali is also investing heavily. And in the US, insurers such as MetLife and MassMutual have committed millions to tech start-ups.Compared with other industries, however, insurers are playing catch up. Free of stringent regulation and legacy IT systems, fintech is booming, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars of investment as they tap into new technology providing online financial services from payments and lending to digital currencies and cross-border transfers.“We are a little bit late to the game,” says Kurt Karl, chief economist at Swiss Re. “I’d say we are two to three years behind other industries but the interest has cranked up enormously.”A lot of the millennial generation are asking why technology hasn’t shown up in insurance, and who will be the first to do itHe attributes much of the tardiness to the nature of the industry. “It is a conservative industry. We buy ‘bads’ rather than ‘goods’ and the nature of the business makes us cautious.”That, however, is starting to change. Investors poured $2.6bn into insurance tech start-ups in 2015, according to data from CB Insights, which tracks private tech investing.“It is about now that a lot of the millennial generation are beginning to ask about insurance,” says Eric Emmons, a managing director at MassMutual’s venture capital fund. “They are asking why technology hasn’t shown up in insurance, and who will be the first to do it.”The need to digitise and innovate is being fuelled by low interest rates, pricing pressure, regulatory change and the need to diversify.“The industry has come under an enormous amount of earnings pressure, driven by the low interest rate environment,” says Marty Lippert, head of global technology at MetLife. “The industry has to take a different view of how it operates. Efficiencies are important and we have been working hard to take costs out.”The industry is focusing on two areas. The first is the relatively dowdy world of back-office systems. “Over the past two or three years, big insurers have been looking at legacy systems, which have been creaking at the edges,” says Nigel Walsh, head of UK insurance at Capgemini. “You can’t deliver modern, agile services on systems that were built 30 years ago.”Only once the basic systems have been fixed, analysts argue, can insurers really start to innovate and use “big data” to take a comprehensive look at risks across the business. Automation is also a part of the process. “There is a big opportunity in taking paper-based processes out,” says Mr Lippert.Customers are getting more savvy. Expectations have gone up but insurers are not meeting those expectationsThe second focus is customers. “Customers are getting more savvy,” says Mr Walsh. “Expectations have gone up but insurers are not meeting those expectations.”For many insurers customer contact comes once a year — when the policy renewal is due. And few customers relish that moment. A survey by Boston Consulting Group and Morgan Stanley in 2014 found that customers interacted less with insurers than with any other industry. They also rated their online experiences with insurers below those with other industries. This explains why so much effort has gone into doing the basics better.At the digital garage, for example, Aviva is developing a system that allows customers to see all their Aviva products on one screen, and is also cutting the number of questions that customers have to answer before buying a product.But the ambition to get closer to customers goes much further. Insurers see the much-hyped “internet of things” as a huge opportunity. By measuring how people drive (through telematics) or their physical activity (through wearable devices) the industry hopes that it can persuade its customers to cut out risks and so push down the cost of claims. And if they cannot be encouraged to do so, at least the insurers will be able to price risks better.
56;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-18T12:42:36Z;Insurers commit $1bn to tech start-ups;Industry moves to catch up with other financial services operators reaping digital dividends;Some of the world’s biggest insurers have committed more than $1bn to investing in technology start-ups as the industry attempts to play catch-up with other parts of the financial services sector and boost profitability.European insurers such as Axa, Aviva and Allianz, along with MassMutual and American Family in the US and Ping An in Asia have all set up specialist venture capital funds dedicated to investing in start-ups that may be relevant for their core businesses.The latest deal will be announced this week, with Aviva and other investors putting £1m into Appyparking, an app that helps find empty parking spaces.Analysts said insurance has lagged behind other parts of financial services when it comes to digital investment, but say that interest has picked up sharply in recent months in a bid to stay competitive and harness big data analytics.“We’ve been investing a lot in digital and encouraging people to be innovative, but it is also important to capture innovation externally,” says François Robinet, chairman of Axa Strategic Ventures.The Axa fund initially started in France with €10m to invest but now has €230m to put to work globally.Last year was a record one for such deals, according to research firm CB Insights. By November, start-up investments by insurers were 43 per cent higher than the whole of 2014 and 725 per cent ahead of 2013.“The priority is financial return,” says Eric Emmons, managing director at MassMutual Ventures. “We’re running a for profit venture capital firm. Once companies are in the portfolio, we’ll do what we can to make our colleagues at MassMutual aware of them.”Other insurers, such as MetLife and Generali, have taken a different route and invest in conjunction with existing venture capital firms. However last year Generali went further and bought full control of MyDrive, a UK-based telematics business.Insurers have taken a wide definition of what might be relevant investments to make. According to CB Insights, between 2010 and 2015 just 13 per cent of investments were in insurance technology companies. As well as the parking app, Aviva Ventures has invested in Cocoon, a home security business while Axa has backed a start-up that forecasts the price of airline tickets.“We are looking at technology that will be relevant in three to five years,” says Ben Luckett, managing director of Aviva Ventures, “especially around the internet of things”.Data have been a big focus for investment. “Big data is a buzzword that is thrown around a lot,” says Mr Robinet. “As an insurer, all we create is data and a lot of energy has gone into using it better not just to drive customer centricity but also to underwrite better.”
57;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-13T14:12:54Z;MetLife: Looming smaller;Insurers are breaking themselves up to escape tighter regulation. Banks could do likewise;"Citigroup and JPMorgan executives might step outside their New York headquarters today, look south along Park Avenue at the MetLife Building, and shake their fists at it. The insurance group’s decision to split its business is a blueprint for any activist wishing to pursue the same course of action at a major bank.MetLife is fighting its designation as a “systemically important financial institution” or Sifi, which brings with it return-crushing capital requirements. But the rewards of restructuring were too great to ignore. The division which sells life insurance to individuals and accounts for a fifth of operating profits, will be split off, escaping the Federal Reserve’s capital regime altogether. The remaining MetLife will remain under tight regulatory supervision, but should benefit from a lower minimum capital level. Returns on equity at both companies should improve. Shares in MetLife, which are 40 per cent below their pre-crisis peak and down 18 per cent in 12 months, rose 7 per cent in after-hours trading.The most obvious external impact is on fellow insurer AIG, itself fighting demands to split from activist Carl Icahn. According to a Bernstein poll,
75 per cent of its shareholders said they wanted AIG to shrink and escape its Sifi designation.Mr Icahn has proven with Apple, and may again with AIG, that no company is too big or complex to be immune from activists. So the fact that the biggest universal banks are not facing the same level of pressure is strange. Admittedly, unlike the insurers, they cannot escape the regulatory regime altogether; big banks are automatically Sifis. But there is a gradation based on size and complexity, with equity minimums between 7 and 11 per cent of risk-weighted assets. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citi could all expect higher returns from breaking up. They plead vaguely that the synergies of staying together are worth more. Activists could do everyone a favour by making them prove it."
58;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-13T01:21:52Z;MetLife unveils break-up plan;Life insurer says tougher rules could make it uncompetitive;MetLife has unveiled a plan to break itself up, warning that a move by US authorities to hit the life insurer with tougher regulations threatens to make a big slice of its business uncompetitive.The largest US insurer by assets on Tuesday laid out a proposal to float or sell a chunk of its retail arm in a deal expected to be worth about $10bn.The separation could put further pressure on rival AIG to make similarly radical changes as it comes under attack from Wall Street financiers Carl Icahn and John Paulson.They want AIG to take steps to remove its classification as a “systemically important” financial institution, or Sifi, which will subject it to higher capital requirements.Unlike AIG, MetLife is fighting its designation as a Sifi. MetLife disclosed its planned carveout just weeks before a court hearing in its legal battle with US authorities over its “systemically important” status.MetLife said it had not been approached by activists and had taken the decision to hive off the business itself.Investors appeared to welcome the plan. Shares in the S&P 500 insurer leapt 7 per cent in after-hours trading.Steven Kandarian, MetLife chairman and president, said in a statement that the business being shed would be put “at a significant competitive disadvantage” by the Sifi tag.“Even though we are appealing our Sifi designation in court and do not believe any part of MetLife is systemic, this risk of increased capital requirements contributed to our decision to pursue the separation of the business.”The new company is expected to be too small to merit classification as a Sifi, reducing its regulatory burden.Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays, said in a note that while the remaining business would probably still be subject to the Sifi regime, it would not be hit so hard. The remainder of MetLife would be smaller and its composition would be different.As a result of the split, MetLife — whose history stretches back to 1863 — would effectively stop selling life cover to everyday Americans, except in very small amounts.Even though we are appealing our Sifi designation in court and do not believe any part of MetLife is systemic, this risk of increased capital requirements contributed to our decision to pursue the separation of the businessInstead it would be focused on administrating the life cover that it has already written, serving corporate clients, property-casualty insurance and operating overseas.MetLife’s plan is the latest step in the reordering of US finance under the influence of post-crisis regulation.It echoes a move by the industrial conglomerate General Electric, which last year announced it was beginning a series of steps to shrink its GE Capital division before applying for “de-designation”.A sale of the MetLife assets could interest Japanese groups, which have been on a global buying spree, or possibly private equity houses, but they could be too big to be acquired by another global insurer.Meanwhile, MetLife is making preparations for a stock market launch.The business to be carved out has about $240bn of total assets, about a quarter of MetLife’s total. It is among the US’s largest providers of annuities and life cover, and generates about a fifth of the group’s annual profits.The business is a writer of so-called variable annuities (VA), which provide income for the over-50s. Regulators have signalled that such “capital-intensive” products could be hit with especially onerous requirements under the Sifi regime. However, MetLife has already scaled back its VA business.Mr Kandarian said the break-up would have strategic benefits.“This separation would also bring significant benefits to MetLife as we continue to execute our strategy to focus on businesses that have lower capital requirements and greater cash-generation potential,” he said.
59;MET;Metlife Inc;2016-01-12T21:31:28Z;MetLife mulls overhaul amid regulatory squeeze;;MetLife, the US insurer, is mulling plans to jettison a large swath of its retail operations as it looks to avoid higher capital requirements resulting from its designation as a systemically important financial institution.The New York-based company said on Tuesday that it’s “evaluating structural alternatives” for the business, including an initial public offering or a sale. The newly-formed company would represent about 20 per cent of MetLife’s overall operating earnings, and 50 per cent of operating earnings of MetLife’s retail segment.One of the reasons for the potential move is because the retail division is currently part of a SIFI business and therefore subject to significant capital requirements, according to Steven Kandarian, Metlife’s chief executive.The SIFI designation is a central part of a new US regulatory regime put in place after the financial crisis designed to reduce the systemic risk posed by institutions that are “too big to fail” and avoid future bailouts by taxpayers.Metlife is appealing the SIFI designation in court, arguing that unlike counterparts, such as the largest US banks, it shouldn’t be subject to the stringent, and costly, requirements.However, Mr Kandarian said breaking MetLife up would give the unit “greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations, and a reduced capital and compliance burden”.
60;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-12-28T16:31:11Z;AIG’s chief executive begins fightback against activist investors;Critics say insurer needs to deliver something extraordinary to satisfy rebellious shareholders;Peter Hancock’s fightback began in the middle of last month, with a gathering of investors at American International Group’s low-key headquarters overlooking New York’s East River.The chief executive, accused of a catalogue of failings by Carl Icahn, the veteran activist investor, spoke of years of under-investment in technology at the insurer, even before the grim years following the rescue by the US government at the height of the financial crisis. He complained of being dealt a bad hand, according to people familiar with discussions, noting that AIG had to dump 30 businesses in short order to pay back the government.One investor is left unimpressed, but sympathetic. “He’s under a lot of pressure, and he didn’t have a lot of good answers,” he says. “Let’s give him until January to see if he does. Even the greatest CEO in the world would have a hard time fixing [AIG], as is.”Other outsiders agree that Mr Hancock will have to come up with something extraordinary at a strategy update next month, if he wants to head off a rebellion among shareholders. So far, the measures have left many of them underwhelmed.The burly 57-year-old Briton has promised to dismiss almost a quarter of the top 1,400 members of senior management, while ditching old technology and pledging to buy back shares. But the three main business areas — life, property-casualty and mortgage insurance — remain.The most recent share buyback announcement came this month, on the same day that the US Federal Reserve signalled an end to the crisis era by putting up interest rates after a nine-year freeze. But critics argue that AIG has yet to pull off a similar exit from its own troubled past.The group’s return on equity over the past 12 months was 6.9 per cent, well short of the low teens ROEs of peers and AIG’s own target of 10 per cent.The core of the problem, says Josh Stirling, an analyst at Bernstein, is AIG’s status as a “globally significant financial institution”, which means it is subject to the most intense level of supervision by the Fed. AIG was the first non-bank to be designated as such in July 2013, after regulators judged that it could pose a serious threat to the stability of the financial system if it ran into trouble.According to Mr Stirling, this status has created a culture of “comfortable deference” to the Fed and an “overwhelming focus on de-risking,” as well as an extra billion dollars or so of annual compliance costs.He points to a lawsuit from MetLife, another big insurer, to rid itself of the designation, and efforts by General Electric to shake off the tag by selling about $200bn of financial assets. AIG should do likewise, he says, and “shrink itself to greatness” by selling itself — piece by piece — to competitors.“It’s a tremendous pain in the neck to be a Sifi, and that point can’t be argued with,” says one major shareholder. “If it was easy to be a Sifi, GE would still have its financial services division.”According to Mr Hancock, however, the Sifi designation is irrelevant. He has argued that the only practical constraint on AIG’s returns is the attitude of the credit rating agencies, which have always rewarded diverse businesses with conservative balance sheets.If Sifi peers such as MetLife and Prudential are achieving higher ROEs, it is because they choose to run their operations with more leverage, and are willing to take more risk, including through derivatives. Because of its near-death experience just a few years ago, say insiders, AIG would rather play it safe.Insiders also argue that Mr Icahn — who declined to be interviewed for this story — has bitten off more than he can chew with this rare venture into financial services. They say he is mistaken, if he thinks he can apply the same playbook he used on Coca-Cola, Motorola or Dell to a complex, multi-line firm which is subject to oversight by about 200 regulators around the world, besides the Fed.But, for the time being, it is the activists who appear to be working harder to win over the neutrals. On Tuesday Bernstein hosted a conference call that attracted 140 institutional investors. One of them, Paulson & Co, is wholly supportive of Mr Stirling’s proposal to shrink AIG via asset sales, according to people familiar with the situation.Within a few days of Mr Hancock’s November meeting with investors, Mr Icahn had issued a direct challenge to the CEO, saying that shareholders might back the election of a new board member who could replace him, over time.One big investor notes that Mr Icahn retains the option of proposing a whole new slate of directors — which could prompt the current crop of 13 to review their support for the 14th, the CEO. “I doubt it is unconditional love, like for a firstborn child,” the shareholder says.For now, says another shareholder, “there is tremendous scepticism within the financial services industry as to whether [Mr Hancock] is the right person to lead AIG”.

Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Income rates depend on age, but would be 4 per cent at age 65. Customers can also opt for guarantees which protect their capital against market falls and have the certainty of a guaranteed amount at the end of their selected term.“It is good news that we’re seeing innovative new products being launched and products with guarantees could be of particular interest to those in retirement, for whom capital protection is likely to be at least as important as capital growth,” said Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner with Chase de Vere, the independent financial advisers.Automated service costs £199 — compared with £900 for a human adviserRead moreHowever, Mr Connolly said that while guarantees would be welcomed by some investors, they come at a cost.Income guarantee charges on the MetLife Isa start from 0.6 per cent and capital guarantee charges from 0.3 per cent.The total expense ratio (TER) for the asset allocation is 0.55 per cent and annual management charges range between 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent depending on the level of investment.Someone investing £50,000, for instance, would pay 1.85 per cent in the income guarantee and in the capital guarantee 1.55 per cent.“If people do require a guaranteed income as they get older, the most reliable and cost effective way to achieve this is likely to be through an annuity,” Mr Connolly.“If they want to remain invested then the extra charges of guaranteed products are likely to be a drag on performance over the long term.”
63;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-11-05T20:00:08Z;MetLife crashes the ‘lower for longer’ club;Top US insurer argues interest rates will not return to pre-crisis levels for at least a decade;MetLife joined the “lower for longer” club in dramatic fashion on Thursday, saying that a bleak economic outlook means that US interest rates are unlikely to return to pre-crisis levels for at least the next 10 years.Until now, the biggest US life insurer had assumed that it would take about three years for long-term interest rates to return to “normalised” levels. But on Thursday, when it presented third-quarter earnings, the insurer took analysts aback by extending that timetable radically — to 11 years, saying that low growth and subdued inflation would keep downward pressure on rates. Only in 2026, it said, will yields on 10-year government bonds reach its long-term assumption of 4.5 per cent.The move reflects a more pessimistic view of the global economy, explained John Hele, chief financial officer, on a call with analysts. Over the past 25 years, the 10-year Treasury — a benchmark for pricing trillions of dollars of car loans and mortgages — has yielded about 4.7 per cent.“I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future,” he said.The new forecast chimes with many issued by financial services companies during the latest earnings season, in which executives have signalled they expect rates — and thus returns — to remain near current levels for the foreseeable future.At Wells Fargo, for example, the world’s biggest bank by market capitalisation, chief financial officer John Shrewsberry gave colour on the bank’s “lower-for-longer” expectation for both short-term and long-term rates, saying that the bank was looking to squeeze out more income by adding more longer-term assets to its mix.Although Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has kept alive the prospect of “lift-off” in rates next month forecasters still expect 10-year yields to reach just 2.3 per cent by year-end, down from estimates of 3.06 per cent at the start of this year, according to Bloomberg data.When challenged by one analyst to justify such a “dramatic change” in MetLife’s interest-rate outlook, Mr Hele said he had consulted widely with economists and academics before making the switch, which is part of an annual actuarial review.We see much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable futureFalling rates are a drag for life insurers, which have to reinvest maturing bonds at lower yields. Returns on the new money invested by MetLife during the quarter were about 100 to 150 basis points below the yield on the rest of its portfolio, said Steven Kandarian, chief executive. He described persistently low rates, combined with the gradual expiration of hedges, as “ongoing headwinds”.American International Group, MetLife’s big domestic rival, said this week that its net investment income dropped about a third from a year earlier. Combined with a loss from underwriting, that meant the group posted its worst quarter since the financial crisis, according to Josh Stirling, an analyst at Bernstein.AIG has come under attack by activist investors who accuse it of reacting too slowly to a world of lower returns.Analysts said most insurers have increased the length of time they expect rates to get to their long-term assumptions. But MetLife has put itself out on a limb.“An 11-year glide path is definitely at the long end of expectations,” said Steven Schwartz, an analyst at Raymond James.

65;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-05-03T18:57:55Z;Global insurers should be supervised at scale;Berkshire Hathaway ought not to evade too-big-to-fail rules;As Warren Buffett hosted the jolly 50th anniversary shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway in Omaha, Nebraska, this weekend, tensions were rising over whether his company could imperil the world’s financial system. They are part of a tussle between US states, the federal government and global regulators over who should watch over the world’s largest insurers.The tensions have surfaced on both sides of the Atlantic, with Republicans in Washington protesting over the influence of the Financial Stability Board in Basel, and the Bank of England writing to the Federal Reserve to question Berkshire’s status. They are bound to grow as MetLife, the largest US life insurer, mounts a challenge to being designated as “too big to fail”.Some of this reflects a turf war. Insurance regulation is highly fragmented, with state insurance commissions traditionally supervising even large US insurers, rather than federal regulators such as the Federal Reserve. Both US insurers and their regulators want this to continue, and resent what they perceive as a power grab by Washington, encouraged from Basel.Much of it stems from the pivotal role of American International Group in the 2008 financial crisis. AIG, supervised by the defunct Office of Thrift Supervision and local insurance regulators, was belatedly found to have an insolvent derivatives trading unit, heavily intertwined with large banks and investment banks. Regulators and governments vowed that this should never happen again.It led to twin efforts to toughen supervision of non-bank financial institutions such as insurers. The first initiative is by the FSB to identify insurers whose collapse could imperil global financial stability. The second is by the US Financial Stability Oversight Council — a grand committee of regulators set up after the 2008 crisis — to pinpoint the most risky US insurers and to subject them to federal oversight.Each has come up with a list of “too big to fail insurers” on which AIG, Prudential Financial and MetLife appear. The FSB may add to its list reinsurers such as Munich Re, Swiss Re and Berkshire Hathaway, whose reinsurance operations include General Re. US regulators have not yet listed Berkshire, partly because it is such a large industrial enterprise that it may not qualify as a non-bank financial institution — it could be too big to be designated.State regulators are correct that insurers tend to be less fragile than banks because depositors cannot withdraw their money at will. In a crisis, insurers tend to have the luxury of time to run off their assets and liabilities. They are also right — as AIG showed — that good supervision means more than transforming insurers into financial fortresses with additional capital and liquidity rules.But the principle of consolidated supervision of large insurers is sound. MetLife operates in 50 countries through 359 subsidiaries and holds 25 per cent of its assets overseas, mostly in Asia. State regulators are effective in handling insurers with limited operations in a few states, but they can be overstretched by scale and scope. Group oversight makes as much sense for big entities in the US as it does for those in Asia and Europe.It is also vital for global reinsurers to be treated equally and to be covered by one framework. It would be absurd for one of the world’s largest reinsurers to receive a pass simply because its founder is revered as an investor and his company is so big that it can hold a sizeable reinsurer within it. Turf wars between Nebraska and Basel can hopefully be avoided, but if it comes to that, consistency should prevail.
66;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-04-28T18:04:11Z;Republicans attack new global insurance rules;Richard Shelby says international regime should not dictate how US companies are supervised;Global insurance rules face a revolt in the US as Republicans spearhead complaints that international regulators who they say lack accountability are imposing inappropriate standards on American companies.The financial crisis and the government rescue of US insurer AIG prompted a new regulatory regime for insurance, but the Republican takeover of Congress has brought to the surface deep unease over their development in the US.While the discontent in Washington is not universal, it signals trouble for the Financial Stability Board, a group of regulators and central bankers set up by the Group of 20 leading economies in 2009 to fortify the global financial system.At the head of the Republican attacks is Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate banking committee, who used a hearing on Tuesday to showcase a range of concerns about the FSB’s influence.“An international regulatory regime should not dictate how US regulators supervise American or US-based companies,” he said in comments consistent with longstanding Republican scepticism towards a variety of international forums.He lamented that decisions made by the FSB — which is based in Basel, Switzerland — had been adopted “with what appears to be little independent evaluation” by the US’s umbrella group of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council.The FSB decided that three US insurers — AIG, Prudential Financial and MetLife — are so critical to the financial system that they must be subject to tighter global regulation and potentially higher capital requirements. The FSOC has also designated the three as “ systemically important”.“The FSB is not a US regulator, and it is not accountable to Congress or the American people,” Mr Shelby said. “Therefore, the FSOC should not merely be a rubber stamp for the decisions made by an unaccountable international body like the FSB.”The FSB has no powers to enforce recommendations and instead relies on soft diplomacy of its members to ensure that its proposals are implemented by each country. The FSB declined to comment.An international regulatory regime should not dictate how US regulators supervise American or US-based companiesSix years after the crisis’s nadir, Mr Shelby’s comments come amid a wider debate over whether the FSB should be a treaty-based organisation such as the World Bank or IMF, which can sanction countries that do not implement measures. The US has also not signed up to certain IMF standards.Despite Republican concerns, signs of US sway at the FSB emerged this month with the revelation that the Bank of England had written to the US Treasury to ask why the reinsurance business of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was left off its list of “too big to fail” institutions.Mr Shelby controls what legislation emerges from the banking committee for a full vote in the Senate and is preparing a comprehensive financial reform bill.On Monday two Senators — Dean Heller, a Republican from Nevada, and Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana — introduced a bill to “bring more accountability and transparency to the international insurance process”.We work with our international counterparts to build a global consensus that works for the United StatesThe FSB is due to promulgate capital requirements for insurers, which are being written by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and “resolution” standards for winding up insurers in the event of failure.Roy Woodall, an independent member of the FSOC and an insurance expert, told the committee that a “contorted international framework” was “why I think we should be cautious about ongoing initiatives”.He said: “There is still time to ensure that any international agreement consented to by the FSB is reached through a more open process that is in the best interests of the US.”Warren Buffett company left off provisional ‘too big to fail’ listContinue readingMr Shelby noted that Jack Lew, US Treasury secretary, had previously told the committee that FSB decisions did not bind the FSOC. Michael McRaith, a Treasury director, said on Tuesday that international standards are “not self-executing in the US”, because state and federal regulators study and test their impact before any implementation.“We work with our international counterparts to build a global consensus that works for the United States,” he said.David Green, the former head of international policy at the UK’s financial watchdog, said Mr Shelby’s comments were consistent with the “long-held congressional tradition of sovereignty”.“It is a quite carefully worded statement that does not necessarily disagree with the substance of FSB decisions, just that they have not been independently evaluated to satisfy that they meet US requirements,” Mr Green said.
67;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-04-19T14:21:38Z;Rothesay Life gears up for a potential £3bn IPO;Pensions insurer shrugs off the heightened competition since the industry overhaul;Construction workers are still putting the finishing touches on the Leadenhall Building, the City of London high-rise nicknamed the Cheesegrater.But Rothesay Life has already moved in, weeks before other tenants. The pensions insurer set up by Goldman Sachs has chosen the 47-floor landmark to be its new headquarters — a symbol of its ambitions as the business gears up for a potential £3bn listing.In an interview interrupted by occasional drilling, Addy Loudiadis, the insurer’s cerebral Anglo-Greek co-founder, sets out how she is readying the fast-growing business for the public markets.The mother-of-two established Rothesay eight years ago after cutting her teeth as a banker at Goldman, where she gained experience arranging complex derivatives deals.Since then Rothesay has become a big force in the “bulk annuity” industry. Companies have turned to it to lift headaches caused by their volatile pensions liabilities in return for a fee.After striking a series of pensions megadeals, Rothesay now insures the lives of almost 200,000 people. Last year alone it paid £700m worth of pensions.Yet a listing would come just as analysts are warning about increased competition.The life assurance sector is being shaken up by chancellor George Osborne’s overhaul of the pensions regime, which has caused sales of individual annuities to collapse.To make up the shortfall, mainstream insurers have piled in to the corporate market, which Rothesay specialises in along with rival Pension Insurance Corporation.James Mullins, partner at the pensions consultants Hymans Robertson, is expecting more insurers to enter the bulk annuity market this year, which “will dramatically increase competition and push down prices”.Ms Loudiadis, 50, says 2014 was “probably our worst competition year” for Rothesay. Yet she adds its returns were nevertheless “spectacular” and forecasts the market will continue to grow.The company is set to publish annual results on Monday showing a 33 per cent jump in annual pre-tax profits to £244m. “The UK is one large pension fund, with a couple of banks and aeroplanes,” she says. “There’s enough supply.”Rothesay’s chief points out that companies have been striking pensions insurance deals even when interest rates have been at rock bottom, making the transactions relatively more expensive for them. “If rates were up another per cent or two, there would be a floodgate.”Bulk annuity providers bear two big types of risks: that the assets that back the payouts generate weaker returns than expected, and that pensioners live longer than forecast.“This is not a very easy business — you really need to know what you’re doing. We are disciplined about our return. We don’t chase business,” says Ms Loudiadis.Although born in Nigeria to Greek parents, Ms Loudiadis attended Cheltenham Ladies College and has spent most of her life in Britain. After joining Goldman in 1994 she climbed up the ranks, becoming a partner and co-head of its European investment banking division.In 2001, the Oxford maths graduate helped Greece meet European deficit rules by arranging a derivatives deal years before the country’s debt crisis.The cure for cancer is anecdotally the worst thing that could happen to a business like thisMs Loudiadis, who has a penchant for yoga, is matter-of-fact about the potential dangers facing the pensions de-risking industry. “The cure for cancer is anecdotally the worst thing that could happen to a business like this.”Rothesay’s insured pensioners are forecast to live 17 years beyond retirement. An unexpected leap forward in longevity would hurt the company’s profits.Still, by reinsuring about 70 per cent of the life expectancy risks it has taken on, the group has shielded shareholders from the brunt of them. The group also has a conservative investment strategy.And Rothesay has thrived while its rivals have run into trouble. Lucida, set up by former Prudential chief executive Jonathan Bloomer, warned of “unattractive economics” of pensions de-risking before selling itself to Rothesay’s FTSE 100-listed competitor Legal & General.Part of the answer is to be bigger, Ms Loudiadis believes.Already Rothesay itself has snapped up two of its largest rivals: Paternoster, run by another ex-Pru executive Mark Wood, and the UK bulk annuity arm of MetLife, the US insurer.She indicates Rothesay may acquire more businesses shaken out of the industry by so-called Solvency II capital requirements that regulators are forcing on insurers next year.“There are opportunities out there which could double our size,” she says.Ms Loudiadis would like Rothesay — whose other shareholders include Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund and investment house Blackstone — to increase its assets under management from £13bn to at least £15bn before floating.“Scale does matter here. We would like another year [before listing], where we have the chance to prove categorically that we’re profitable, and we’re consistent,” she says.However, she adds: “Our job is to make sure that our shareholders have that [flotation] option — that if they do want liquidity, we are IPO-ready.”
68;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-04-12T14:39:09Z;GE Capital succumbs to changing regulatory climate;Executives accepted that the financial arm was worth more detached from its parent;The dismembering of GE Capital, the sprawling financial arm of General Electric, marks the next stage in a great reordering of US finance, heavily influenced by the US government.At first blush, it seems like strong deal markets drove Friday’s dramatic announcement that GE — America’s best-known conglomerate — would sell down GE Capital’s assets from $363bn to about $90bn, and return to its industrial roots.Executives were keen to emphasise that they had been confronted with increasing evidence that GE Capital was worth more detached from its parent.First, the spin-off of Synchrony Financial, a private-label credit card business and consumer finance company. GE floated it last year at more than $19bn and it is now trading with a market value of $25bn.Second, GE managed to sell an Australian consumer finance business to a KKR-led consortium for A$8.2bn last year, about twice book value.Third, GE received a flurry of confidential enquiries, mainly from private equity groups, about its remaining businesses, which include a middle-market lending platform. “People came and offered valuations that we thought, ‘That’s different’,” said one person familiar with the situation.But the regulatory climate was always a factor. GE Capital has been earmarked for special supervision ever since it was bailed out during the financial crisis with $130bn of government loan guarantees.To reduce the risk of future bailouts, Congress in 2010 gave regulators responsibility for selecting non-bank financial groups — “systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)” — for tougher supervision.There had been debate over whether designation would be a “badge of honour” or a “scarlet letter” but the latter camp seems to have been correct. MetLife, the largest US insurer, is suing the government to try to escape its designation. Now GE Capital is planning to apply next year for “de-designation” after accomplishing more of the planned disposals.Even if all goes to plan, GE Capital will have to endure a brief period of strict oversight and the company has embarked on a massive recruitment drive to hire risk managers and financial modelling experts to help it prepare for annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve.People close to the matter said GE Capital had the most contentious relationship with regulators out of the four non-banks designated as SIFIs.In February, about the same time that he began drawing up a plan to dispose of most of his division, Keith Sherin, chief executive of GE Capital, wrote to the Fed to complain about the proposed oversight.In a 57-page letter, he said that “critical aspects” of the Fed’s plan “fail to satisfy . . . basic tests” to tailor supervision differently to that of banks. He argued the Fed was considering imposing capital requirements that were so stringent that they were “out of proportion” and would place GE Capital at “an unjustified competitive disadvantage”.The truth is that GE Capital was already at a competitive disadvantage, squeezed between banks which can borrow much more cheaply by paying depositors almost nothing for their funds, and more agile non-banks which have no limits on their leverage.Its performance has suffered. In 2008, looking — somewhat prematurely — to its post-crisis future, GE realised the world had changed but underestimated the magnitude. It estimated returns on equity would be down from 20 per cent to 15 to 20 per cent.In fact, the returns have been much worse. In 2014, return on equity was 8.6 per cent and would have been significantly worse without Synchrony. That is below GE’s cost of capital and a brake on the better performance of the industrial side of the company.Those returns are already hampered by regulatory capital requirements, which restrict the amount of debt the company uses, and could be worsened further if the Fed applies an even tougher regime that Mr Sherin railed against in his letter.Banks that buy some of GE Capital’s assets would also face the same problem of making good returns, although some might have the scale to do so.But buyers are expected to come predominantly from a pool of private equity groups that have invested heavily in growing their credit arms in recent years. Apollo, Ares, Fortress, Blackstone, GSO are already in the minds — some have already been on the phones — of GE and its advisers at Centerview and JPMorgan.The rise of those firms poses more questions about whether the focus of regulators on banks and a tiny handful of large non-banks, such as GE Capital, is distorting competition and whether it is making the overall system any safer.“The process was supposed to reduce risk in the system. This has to be the biggest question: are we reducing risk in the system or are we simply reducing risk in individual institutions?” says Mark Calabria, a former Senate banking committee aide now at the Cato Institute.Aaron Klein, a former Treasury official who is now a director at the Bipartisan Policy Center, asks: “Is financial risk like the law of thermodynamics? It can never be destroyed, it just moves around.”Additional reporting by James Fontanella in New YorkGE retreats from UK financial marketGeneral Electric is pulling out of the UK financial market, where it operates under the GE Money brand, in a move that will put billions of pounds of mortgage assets up for sale, writes Emma Dunkley.The US group revealed plans on Friday to shrink its global finance arm in order to return to its manufacturing roots. That move includes the retreat from the UK market and could lead to the sale of about £10bn of British mortgage assets.A number of specialist lenders and “challenger” banks in the UK are in talks with GE about potentially acquiring some of the assets, said people familiar with the situation.The group recently sold £250m of second mortgages to a specialist lender, but still has £10bn of primary mortgages on its balance sheet, the people said.“GE would’ve loved to have sold the UK mortgage business some time earlier, but there was no one around to buy, or the prices were unacceptable. But now, the price of the assets has gone up,” according to one source.Ray Boulger, of broker John Charcol, said: “Private equity firms have an interest in getting into higher margin parts of the mortgage business.”He said that GE Money was known for subprime lending before the financial crisis. The lender subsequently offered mortgages to customers that “represent good credit risk but do not have a perfect credit score”.“GE Money falls into this capital category, so it’s likely private equity funds will look at buying the existing mortgage book and using it as a launch pad to get into the UK market,” he added.1890Four companies representing inventor Thomas Edison’s interests merge to form the Edison General Electric Company1932GE Credit Corporation begins to offer credit to customers to buy General Electric appliances1981Under chief executive Jack Welch, GE Capital begins a dramatic ascent.

69;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-02-28T04:17:05Z;Chief who pulled AIG back from the brink;Robert Benmosche, who led insurer’s restructuring, dies aged 70;"Robert “Bob” Benmosche, who pulled the world’s largest insurance company back from the brink in the wake of the financial crisis, has died, aged 70.The former chief of MetLife was plucked from retirement in 2009 to lead the restructuring of AIG, the New York-based insurer rescued by the US government with about $180bn of taxpayers’ money.By the time he stood down in September last year, AIG had paid the state back in full and had restored its stock market value to almost $70bn. In November, becoming more ill with cancer, he watched with pride at Soldier Field in Chicago, as 60,000 rugby fans — many with AIG’s logo on their chests — watched the All Blacks beat the USA Eagles.Standing six feet four inches, Benmosche was a bearlike figure with soulful eyes and a slow-breaking smile. He died on Friday morning in New York, with his family by his side.“My mom taught me in life, don’t take yourself too seriously. And I don’t,” he said in a commencement address to the class of 2013 at Alfred University of New York state, his alma mater. “What she said was, in life, people will kiss your buns on the way up, and they’ll step on your throat on the way down. Don’t forget who you are.”Born in Brooklyn in May 1944, Robert Herman Benmosche moved when he was five to upstate Monticello, New York, with his parents, Lillian and Daniel, who ran a restaurant and rented out roadside cabins. The sudden death of his father five years later — without any life insurance — left his mother and three siblings $250,000 in debt and with a half-completed motel. To make ends meet, the eldest son put in shifts around the motel and later, as a teenager, drove trucks for Coca-Cola.After graduating from Alfred with a maths degree, Benmosche joined the US Army, serving as a lieutenant in South Korea until 1968. Starting out in finance at Chase Manhattan Bank in 1976, he later joined the brokerage, Paine Webber, overseeing the acquisition of Kidder Peabody. But it was at MetLife, where he arrived in 1995, that he became more broadly known as a formidable and sometimes fearsome operator.“He had an unshakeable true north, in terms of doing what was right,” says Brady Dougan, chief executive of Credit Suisse, where Benmosche sat on the board for 10 years to 2013.He took MetLife public in 2000 and retired six years later to spend more time at Villa Splendid, his home outside Dubrovnik. In 2009 he celebrated the first wine from his vineyard, an hour up the Croatian coast on the Pelješac peninsula.But then came the call from Jim Millstein, a former Lazard banker then at the Treasury department, and in charge of monitoring AIG. Then-Treasury secretary Tim Geithner had set the bar low, saying that AIG should be successful enough to allow the government to exit. Benmosche had other ideas, telling a congressional committee that he would make the state whole.My mom said, in life, people will kiss your buns on the way up, and they’ll step on your throat on the way down. Don’t forget who you are“At the time, sceptics thought he was crazy,” says Peter Hancock, AIG’s current chief executive. “He had utter conviction — and that conviction was contagious.”His spell at the top, which involved sales of many assets and deep restructurings of others, was not without friction. He clashed with Harvey Golub, AIG chairman, who left in July 2010. And while other AIG chiefs — there were three in 13 months before him — were prepared to work for small sums, Benmosche held out for $10.5m, saying that it was up to the chief executive to set the tone from the top.If AIG were to truly recover, he argued, staff needed to hold their heads high. That included the swaps-trading division at the heart of AIG’s troubles, where retention payments one year came to $165m, prompting one Democratic congressman to claim that the country was “at war” with the insurer.In a video interview with Bloomberg’s Betty Liu last summer, mostly filmed around his vineyard, Benmosche was unrepentant about his stance on pay and the trouble it stirred, noting that sales of its stake in AIG had netted the government profits of almost $23bn.“You have to take risks in life. You’re going to have to take a decision,” he said, jabbing a finger, dressed in khaki shorts and a navy polo shirt. “And if you take a risk and you win, you shouldn’t be blamed for winning because the people who lose didn’t do so well.”His wife Denise, daughter Nehama, son Ari, and longtime companion Lisa were at his bedside when he died. He is also survived by another daughter, Beth; three siblings, Judith, Jayne and Michael; and six grandchildren."

Such vehicles currently tend to have ranges shorter than 200 miles. Mr Musk insisted on Tuesday, during a rare visit to Detroit, that he welcomed such efforts by mainstream carmakers to make electric cars.He also predicted that his group would be selling “a few million” vehicles — on a par with BMW — by 2025, despite a slowdown of sales in China.News, commentary and analysis from this year’s event — the largest and most important annual showcase for US carmakers

But this week was different for the US’s largest insurer by assets, as it filed a lawsuit against regulators in efforts to downplay its significance, writes Barney Jopson in Washington.The insurer has been classed as an institution that could threaten financial stability if it fell into distress — a designation that would subject it to tougher oversight — and MetLife is desperate to escape the tag.The latest step was to file a challenge against its designation as a “systemically important financial institution” in a Washington DC court this week, having lost a previous appeal last year.Imposing tougher regulations on not just banks but also other financial groups was a central part of the US’s response to the financial crisis, as written into the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.But MetLife’s move added to a sense that Dodd-Frank is coming under renewed attack from the financial sector, where some people regard it as poorly designed and unduly onerous.Also this week, Barack Obama signed into law a bill that contained a provision to give agricultural businesses and others that hedge risks with derivatives an exemption from Dodd-Frank cash cushions imposed on banks.The following day the House of Representatives passed a bill to delay part of the Volcker rule, a provision that limits bank risk taking.MetLife said it supported strong rules but argued it was not as integral as regulators have concluded, despite its widely held insurance products and heavy involvement in capital markets.●Related Lex note: MetLife — fight the SystemCrude’s fall halts projects worth billions of dollarsBillions of dollars of spending on oil and petrochemical projects was scrapped or called into question this week, as industry operators outlined cost-cutting measures to cope with the collapse in the price of crude, writes Michael Kavanagh in London.Royal Dutch Shell confirmed on Wednesday it had abandoned plans for one of the world’s biggest petrochemical plants, a $6.5bn project with Qatar Petroleum, blaming “the current economic climate prevailing in the energy industry”.For the past few months Jamie Dimon’s voice was hoarse and softer than usual, a side-effect of his treatment for throat cancer.

71;MET;Metlife Inc;2015-01-13T22:57:15Z;MetLife to mount legal challenge to systemic risk label;Insurance group taking on FSOC to escape tougher regulation and oversight by Fed;MetLife is challenging a central part of the US’s response to the financial crisis by suing the government for classing it as an institution that could threaten financial stability if it fell into distress.The US’s largest insurer by assets, MetLife, on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against its designation by US regulators as a systemically important financial institution, which came last December after the company lost a previous appeal.The designation — based on MetLife’s widely-held insurance products and its involvement in capital markets — would subject the insurer to tougher oversight by the Federal Reserve.The insurer’s move is another attack from the financial services sector on the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislative reforms from 2010, which placed a priority on tightening the oversight of businesses that could jeopardise financial stability.The reforms are also under fire from Republicans who have this year taken control of Congress.While MetLife regularly champions its “leading market position” in the US, its opposition to the designation is based on an argument that, while big and important, it is not as integral to the financial system as regulators have concluded.Steven Kandarian, MetLife’s chief executive, told the Financial Times: “We’re not contesting the law. We’re simply contesting the application of the law as it applies to MetLife.”He said MetLife had hoped to avoid litigation by giving regulators evidence that his group was not systemically important, and stressed that it was now taking advantage of a provision for judicial review in the Dodd-Frank law.The insurance industry as a whole had lobbied hard to escape the net, arguing that it was much safer than banking and was being punished for the past sins of AIG, which came close to collapse because of risky derivatives contracts it wrote.MetLife’s legal challenge will be the first test of the powers of a panel of regulatory chiefs called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was created out of Dodd-Frank and includes Treasury secretary Jack Lew, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and Securities and Exchange Commission head Mary Jo White.We’re not contesting the law. We’re simply contesting the application of the law as it applies to MetLifeWhen it designated MetLife as systemically important, FSOC said: “[M]aterial financial distress at MetLife could lead to an impairment of financial intermediation or of financial market functioning that would be sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy.”It added that its conclusion did not signal that MetLife was experiencing, or was likely to experience, financial troubles.AIG, GE Capital and Prudential Financial have already been deemed systemic risks by the FSOC, and are now overseen by the Fed. Of those companies, only Prudential appealed the council’s decision but declined to pursue a legal challenge.A Treasury spokesperson said it had been notified of MetLife’s complaint: “The council’s decision to designate a nonbank financial company is reached only after a thorough analysis and extensive engagement with the company, both of which occurred in this case. We are confident in the council’s work.”MetLife has been the most aggressive opponent of the systemically important label, arguing it would put the company on an uneven playing field with its competitors.Mr Kandarian — a former regulator himself — said he was a supporter of strong rules and was not concerned that the challenge would harm MetLife’s relations with its supervisors.The lawsuit would take up time and money, he noted, but added: “That is a small cost compared to not getting this right and putting us on an unlevel playing field where a couple of large life insurers are regulated differently than the rest of the industry, putting us potentially at a real competitive disadvantage.”The FSOC has been criticised by Democrats and Republicans for lacking transparency, and some lawmakers have called on the body to put a hold on it issuing Sifi designations while its operating procedures are reviewed.However, the council’s defenders argue that it plays a crucial role in bringing regulators together to monitor risk in the financial system in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.MetLife has hired prominent legal counsel, including Eugene Scalia, who successfully challenged the SEC’s proxy access rule and is a son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Good luck, MetLife, you deserve to win on merit / From Alex J Pollock
72;MET;Metlife Inc;2014-11-10T18:29:03Z;MetLife: Sifi move;With $1tn of assets, the insurer cannot deny its systemic importance;Insurers are a touchy bunch. MetLife, America’s largest insurer by assets, is so outraged at being labelled a “systemically important financial institution” (Sifi) that it may take the US government to court. Big banks are used to the designation, while insurers are relatively new to it. But is it really so strange to argue that an insurer with nearly $1tn of financial assets could be systemically important?The Federal Reserve and US Treasury say that a run on a large insurer – for example a mass cash out of life policies – would disrupt the entire financial system. Insurers acting like banks is also a concern. AIG failed during the financial crisis because it insured bad mortgage-backed securities. The multibillion dollar taxpayer rescue that followed still resonates in the American psyche.MetLife disagrees. Insurers’ standard argument is simple: we are not banks and AIG was an outlier. MetLife also argues that, unlike banks, it invests in long-term assets to match its long-term liabilities. It says a mass surrender of its policies is not possible as 60 per cent of its contracts cannot be shut over night. Many annuities and life policies can only be disbursed through regular payments, not all in one go. The remaining 40 per cent can be cashed out but only at hefty penalties. MetLife points out that during the crisis it did fairly well. Surrender rates were below 10 per cent (the industry average was low single-digits). Benjamin Lawsky, New York’s banking regulator, has come to MetLife’s defence. He says the insurer is properly supervised (by him, as it happens) and if it were to fail the resolution would be orderly.Many of these arguments are fair and insurers should not be regulated like banks. But that does not absolve them from close scrutiny. Regulators should regulate for the next crisis, not the last one – that MetLife did well last time is irrelevant. The failure of any institution with $1tn in assets could do serious damage to the financial system. Met Life fully deserves its Sifi status.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
73;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Regulators propose systemic risk label for MetLife;;US regulators on Thursday recommended that life insurer MetLife be designated a systemic risk to the financial system, setting up a possible legal showdown between the company and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.Out of all the companies that the FSOC had been seriously considering for systemic risk designation, MetLife has been the most aggressive in fighting the possibility, including considering a lawsuit.The company will probably take its time before deciding whether to pursue a legal challenge against the FSOC, which is made up of the heads of the US financial regulatory agencies. The appeals process could last up to five months.AIG, GE Capital and Prudential Financial have already been deemed systemic risks by the FSOC, and they are now overseen by the Federal Reserve. Of those companies, only Prudential appealed against the council’s decision but declined to pursue a legal challenge.The designation, which carries tougher oversight and capital requirements, comes amid growing criticism of the FSOC by some lawmakers and business groups, which have called for it to put a hold on systemic risk designations.They point to the council’s recent decision to focus on potential risky activities in the asset management industry as a whole, rather than on specific company designations, as evidence of unfair treatment of the insurance sector. MetLife has long argued that the FSOC should assess the insurance industry in terms of general activities instead of looking at specific companies.In July, the FSOC announced that it would focus on activities in the asset management industry, rather than on company designations.“This disparate treatment has led to uncertainty in the insurance industry and raised concerns that the council’s approach to insurance company designation is to ‘designate first, ask questions later’,” Congressman Scott Garrett and six other lawmakers said in a letter to Treasury secretary Jack Lew. Mr Lew is head of the FSOC.MetLife chief executive Steve Kandarian said the company strongly disagreed with the FSOC’s decision and it was considering its options.Imposing bank-centric capital rules on life insurance companies will make it more difficult for Americans to buy products that help protect their financial futures“Imposing bank-centric capital rules on life insurance companies will make it more difficult for Americans to buy products that help protect their financial futures,” Mr Kandarian said. “At a time when government social safety nets are under increasing pressure and corporate pensions are disappearing, the goal of public policy should be to preserve and encourage competitively priced financial protection for consumers.”FSOC defenders say the council plays a crucial role in bringing regulators together to monitor risk in the financial system. Companies reviewed by the FSOC also have a chance to provide their views.For instance, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and other large asset managers lobbied heavily against any systemic risk designations, saying regulators should look at industry practices as opposed to focusing on the largest companies in the sector.Critics say that the tougher rules that come with designation as a systemically important financial institution (Sifi), including higher capital requirements, are designed with banks in mind, and may be inappropriate for other financial sectors.The Fed has argued that laws force the agency to impose bank capital requirements on companies designated as systemic risks. The Senate has approved a bipartisan bill that would give the Fed the flexibility to tailor capital requirements to the insurance industry.
74;MET;Metlife Inc;2014-05-23T16:57:14Z;The reinvention of pensions;Budget reforms could result in many new products;The U-shaped annuity. Deferred annuities that do not pay out for decades after they are bought and pensions that remain invested, but feel more like an annuity.Welcome to the retirement market of the future, where the array of products to deliver pension income is set to widen greatly in choice and complexity.Until now, most of the 400,000 people retiring in the UK each year have opted to turn their pension savings into a secure income for life in the form of an annuity. Far smaller numbers kept their funds invested in some form of income drawdown.But this is set to change from April, when pensioners will have new freedom to access these savings as a cash lump sum.“The old world, where the money was roughly divided into annuities for small pots, and income drawdown for bigger pots, that’s all swept away now,” says Billy Burrows of Annuity Line, an annuity broker. “People will have far more choice.”The government expects its reforms, announced in the Budget, will stimulate product innovation as pensioners are given freedom on how to spend their savings. But middle Britain – those savers with pension pots ranging between £30,000 and £250,000 – are expected to be most keenly targeted by providers with products that blend key features of an annuity and drawdown.“Until now, we have seen annuities that sit wholly at one end of the spectrum in terms of the guarantees and at the other end of the spectrum you have drawdown,” explains Tom McPhail, head of pensions research with Hargreaves Lansdown.“Product developers are now looking at this space and asking ‘where can we stop on the line between drawdown and an annuity’?”——————————————-Drawdown for the massesAnticipating a slump in core annuity business, pension providers are now switching their attention to developing products that will make drawdown more accessible and appealing to the mass market.In the past, according to data from the Association of British Insurers, fewer than one in 10 pensioners has opted to keep their funds invested in drawdown, with only 21,000 drawdown products sold in 2013 compared with more than 353,000 annuities, with only 7 per cent of these investment-linked.But keeping funds invested beyond retirement is expected to be recast as a mainstream option. Already, providers such as Standard Life and MetLife have lowered the minimum fund threshold for savers to enter drawdown.“Ultimately, it is our view that we will see a fundamental shift with fewer people buying an annuity at the traditional point of retirement,” explains Alastair Black, head of customer income solutions with Standard Life, one of the UK’s leading pension providers.“The key reason is that retirement can be a long period of 20 to 30 years. We see there being a shift towards some kind of ‘flexible income in retirement’ product, and in essence this is income drawdown.“Instead of simply choosing between an annuity and drawdown, people will ask ‘where am I invested and how much income do I take?’”——————————————-Capital and income guaranteesProducts which protect income, or capital, are expected to become more heavily promoted in the new pensions environment – particularly for pensioners who are not experienced or hands-on investors and who worry about outliving their capital.Two types of guarantees could become more widely marketed, including guarantees or insurance against future market falls and on income.News and comment on the UK pensions scene“The current annuity market will change massively, but the good things about annuities, including guaranteed income for life and no risk of running out of money, should be retained – which is where unit-linked guarantees can play a major role,” says Dominic Grinstead, managing director of MetLife UK. The company expects sales of the products to near treble to £4bn in the UK by the end of 2015.“Clearly, unit-linked guarantees are not suitable for all, but they enable advisers and clients to guarantee income and capital now and retain flexibility and freedom in the future as their circumstances change.”Axa, another pension provider, has just launched its first unit-linked guarantee product aimed at the newly liberalised UK market.“The product is designed to be very flexible to allow the client to take a higher level of income in the early years, and when they are not so active it will give a guaranteed income for life,” says Simon Smallcombe, managing director at Axa Life Invest.“The minimum capital we accept is £25,000, but we think that drawdown providers will go to a lower threshold as more people could benefit from drawdown protection.”——————————————-The U-shaped annuityIn the new era of freedom and choice, annuities are also set to receive a makeover to increase their appeal. Currently, income from a lifetime annuity may rise annually with inflation, or remain level, but cannot fall. However, annuities of the future may do so.“We’d like the ability to do all shapes of annuities, where income can go up as well as down to match retirement income needs,” explains Andrew Tully, pensions technical director at MGM Advantage, a pension provider.“People talk about their income needs changing throughout retirement. Those needs might be high when they first retire but drop down in their late 70s when they aren’t as active. But income needs will pick up again when they have care costs.“We would like the ability to make the payments go down and up, like a U-shape, in a predetermined way.”——————————————-Deferred annuitiesAs well as more flexibility over their income, pensioners could opt to buy an annuity which does not start paying until they are much older.Experts say deferred annuities, which are a bought with a single premium typically at retirement, but only begin to pay at a predetermined date, make more sense for many than simply buying a lifetime annuity at 65.“I think they are a really good idea,” says Philip Smith, director with PwC’s pensions team.“Regardless of the government’s reform I think they would have fitted very well with people who wanted to go into drawdown but who wanted a little more certainty. There’s a strong case for staying invested until you reach 75 or so, before you consider annuitising.”——————————————-‘Traditional’ annuityEven with product innovation to increase their appeal, there are concerns that annuities will become poorer value in the short term as retirees exercise their newfound freedoms.This is because of the “mortality cross subsidy”, whereby those unfortunate enough to die early effectively subsidise those who live longer than the average. If there are fewer unhealthy people buying annuities, the income rates offered to those who are healthy will fall.Get an idea of how much you should consider contributing and how much you could receive when you retire with our pension calculator“On balance, I think annuities will become poorer value unless firms are prepared to accept lower profit margins,” says Alan Higham, retirement director with Fidelity Worldwide Investment.“That won’t happen until the Financial Conduct Authority steps in to make it harder for them to sell annuities to their captive clients, and addresses the regulatory capital issues.”“In the longer term, I think annuities will become more competitive as the market settles down.”——————————————-Lifetime Pension AccountsWith the requirement to buy a product with pension savings abolished, it’s likely that savers will be encouraged to think of retirement as a journey, rather than an “event”, with accounts they can hold on to for life.“In the new regime, there will actually be no need to move from your pension provider at all if you want to take an income for retirement,” says Ros Altmann, an independent pensions expert.“Pension companies could develop ‘lifetime pension accounts’ which will cater for customers’ needs from beginning to end.“For the initial years, the fund would roll up all income and aim for strong capital growth. However, once the customer reaches later life, they can just contact the pension provider to ask them to start paying out their income.”——————————————-Bricks and mortarThe government’s reforms will mean that pension funds can be used next year to buy property, to deliver a regular income in retirement. But while bricks and mortar may feel a more intuitive investment for many than the stock market, advisers warn that property also attracts fees and charges and could be considered a high risk strategy.In the UK, the system has made it so you never had to think too hard about where your pension income was coming from. However, the world is changing and people will have to engage with their pension planning“Most buy-to-lets yield somewhere around 5 or 6 per cent per year, although there is potential for capital appreciation,” says Lauren Peters, pensions adviser with Tideway Wealth Management. “It’s a personal choice, which should be considered with caution, particularly if you anticipate investing a significant proportion of your pension savings and you have no other assets from which to draw a retirement income.”Whether it be bricks and mortar, a capital guarantee or a combination of products, experts say that it will be more important than ever for savers to engage with their retirement choices.“In the UK, the system has made it so you never had to think too hard about where your pension income was coming from,” says Ms Altmann – savers either received a final-salary pension from their employer, or they rolled accumulated savings into an annuity.“However, the world is changing and people will have to engage with their pension planning.”——————————————-What are the rules now and how are they changing?Currently retirement savings must be used to deliver a secure income, in the form of an annuity, or be kept invested in “capped” drawdown, where limits are imposed on how much cash can be taken each year. Only those with additional secure pension income of £12,000 a year, recently reduced from £20,000, have full freedom to access their savings in one hit. Savers with total pension wealth of £30,000 or less can take these funds as cash under trivial commutation rules.From April 6 2015, these restrictions will be lifted, giving all savers the option to take cash as a lump sum taxable at their marginal rate, with a quarter tax free.——————————————-Beware of ‘marketing wheezes’The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is being urged to be on guard for products rushed on to the retirement market as savers abandon annuities and look for alternatives.“I think we can expect some good innovation but we should also expect some bad practice,” says Debbie Harrison, member of the Financial Services Consumer Panel and a visiting professor of the Pensions Institute at Cass Business School.“The panel would like the FCA to be closely evaluating and watching every new product on the market. There is a danger that people could buy inappropriate and expensive products which are being rushed on to the market.”Financial advisers are already cautioning against a new breed of capital and income guarantees pitched at savers who want stock market exposure but with protection against exhausting their funds.“The cost of the guarantee is usually far greater than the benefits it provides,” says Patrick Connolly, certified financial planner with Chase de Vere, the independent financial adviser.“Depending on the needs of the client, we’d prefer to buy an annuity or go into conventional drawdown rather than plump for a halfway house where some form of compromise usually has to be made between the guarantees and the potential for a rising income.”Justin Modray, founder of Candid Financial Advice, says adding the total cost of the pension wrapper, investment fund, protection and advice might top 3 per cent a year, “which is prohibitive”.Nest’s pension price may not be right, but it’s a start, writes Jonathan Eley“For example, buying protection on a MetLife low risk fund over 10 years costs 1.2 per cent, fund charges add another 0.54 per cent and the pension wrapper costs a pretty hefty 0.7 per cent a year,” says Mr Modray. “You can only buy via financial advisers who might charge a further 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent year, so your total costs will probably be between 2.94 per cent and 3.44 per cent.”“Axa offers the option to protect investment income, albeit at a hefty price – the cost to protect a joint life income is between 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent a year with pension, fund and advice costs on top.”Mr Modray says savers could put together a “sensibly diversified portfolio” for about 0.7 per cent or less a year and with pension wrapper charges on top, end up paying around 1 per cent or less a year.“Your pension will not be protected, but the chances of making a loss over 10 years are relatively slim. In my view, these products will remain more of a marketing wheeze than truly useful until costs fall to a sensible level.”

76;MET;Metlife Inc;2014-04-23T12:10:24Z;Idea management software boosts collaboration;Idea management software is smart way to deal with staff suggestions, and boosts collaboration, says Jane Bird;Employees often have ideas for improvements at work – after all, who knows the business better? But few are put forward, let alone reviewed, refined and acted upon.Ending this huge waste of knowledge and creativity is the aim of idea management software. This helps organisations capture and evaluate ideas to identify the best, by letting people make suggestions, comment on each other’s proposals, collaborate and vote for winners.Simon Hill, chief executive of Wazoku, a UK-based idea management software supplier, explains: “It provides the information sharing that people are familiar with from Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter but with more governance and control.”The software can handle huge volumes of suggestions. This year, Aviva expects to generate 800 entrants – double the number last time – for its Customer Cup challenge, in which employees compete to supply ideas to improve the customer experience. The insurance company is using Wazoku for the first time to run the tournament.Previous Customer Cups have been very labour-intensive, says Jan Gooding, Aviva’s group brand director. “Every employee had to be emailed a request to participate. To spread the word, we relied on old fashioned methods such as posters.”With Wazoku, Aviva can invite its 33,000 staff worldwide, in their native languages, to log on, stimulate their imaginations by looking at examples of previous winners, and submit ideas.Previously, people did not know what ideas their colleagues had submitted. “This time they will be able to inspire each other and join forces with people who have similar ideas, rather than each team working in the dark,” Ms Gooding says. She hopes the collaborative approach will create momentum and keep teams motivated.Lorenz Wyss, head of idea management at Swiss Post, says idea management software is particularly effective when used to address specific topics and problems. “It can also be used as a brainstorming tool, and as an instrument to rate ideas with the audience acting like a review committee.”However, he notes, organisations implementing idea management need to reassure people that their ideas will not be stolen, but rewarded and recognised. At Swiss Post, people are paid up to 20 per cent of the cost saving or additional revenue in the first year.MetLife, the US-based insurance company with operations in 46 countries, has found international collaboration to be one of the big benefits of the Mindjet idea management software it is using.Many companies say they are global, says John Geyer, MetLife’s vice-president of innovation. “But most of their staff rarely collaborate across national boundaries, even though they are often trying to solve the same problems.”MetLife is asking its employees in Russia, Japan, Iberia, the US and the Gulf to suggest ways to remove unnecessary procedures and processes. Managers were “blown away” by the results, says Mr Geyer.“The 460 people in the Gulf who were invited to participate, generated 440 ideas. Each idea had additional collaborators, many people submitted multiple ideas, and many who submitted none contributed to the ideas of others.”Ideas are usually collected for about a month, but some were so powerful and simple that they were adopted two weeks into the campaign, Mr Geyer says.Good idea management software helps decision making because it makes it easy for the “crowd” or experts to evaluate which ideas are best, says Michael Stilger, senior vice-president for global solutions, Qmarkets, another idea management software company.To help with the analysis, Qmarkets includes a simulated stock market tool that lets employees use virtual currency to buy, sell and make investments in each other’s ideas. For the best ideas, the value of a share goes up, like in a real stock market, says Mr Stilger. “It is a reliable forecasting technique.”Idea management software can identify innovative people who otherwise might never have been spotted. “It’s amazing how people who wouldn’t normally contribute to the innovation process because they are quiet and shy, will do so electronically,” Mr Stilger says.The prerequisite is that it has to be simple, says Mr Geyer at MetLife. “Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have become ubiquitous largely because they are easy to use. If you want 70,000 people to collaborate, it can’t be intimidating.”Giving employees the chance to take part in the development of the company is good for morale, says Mr Geyer. “People who’ve been with us 25 years say this is first time they’ve really felt valued, engaged with the direction of the company, and that management has considered their ideas.”Employees like the fact that everyone’s ideas are on view for people to see and vote on, so they can see how they are rated. In the past, they submitted their ideas into a “black box”, says Mr Stilger. “Now the ideas are like a living organism that people can see evolve.”Idea management software can also be used to gather suggestions from customers, but you do not want it to become a complaint box, warns Mr Stilger. “Lots of companies hesitate, because they think it could do more harm than good.”Despite the fact that Swiss Post pays staff for successful suggestions, idea management quickly pays for itself, Mr Wyss says. “The more ideas we get the more we get out of it,” he says. “If we spend one franc we get two francs back.”That sounds like a compelling proposition. And maybe the simplicity of the software will encourage companies to take up the challenge and listen to their staff.
77;MET;Metlife Inc;2014-04-06T08:46:45Z;Chilean pensions lure US investors;MetLife and Principal blaze a trail to the country’s pioneering private market;US asset managers are increasingly buying into a Chilean resource that could turn out to be richer than even its copper mines: its population’s golden years.Only six private sector investment houses are approved to manage assets in the country’s mandatory Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones, or AFP, scheme and two of them were bought by US groups last year – market leader Provida by MetLife and Cuprum, the fourth biggest, by Principal Financial Group.Chile’s upward mobility, combined with a transparent political and regulatory system and its pioneering embrace of defined contribution pension saving have created one of the world’s most promising retirement markets, says Oscar Schmidt, executive vice-president and head of MetLife in Latin America.“This balance in Chile between growth from an emerging middle class and relatively low risk – that is the sweet spot,” Mr Schmidt says.Created in the early 1980s, Chile’s pension system is built on individual savings accounts funded by mandatory 10 per cent salary or wage contributions. The assets are invested by one of six AFPs, which offer up to five government-approved portfolios invested according to differing risk levels.The mandatory savings are supplemented with tax-advantaged voluntary schemes known as Ahorro Previsional Voluntario, or APV accounts, in which assets are invested in private sector mutual funds or insurance products by the AFPs.As of February, the AFPs oversaw $160.4bn in assets, up 11.5 per cent over the past year, according to government data. Assets in the voluntary schemes rose 11.2 per cent in the year to September, to $7.2bn.Fuelling the rising trend is Chile’s robust economic growth, which its central bank projects will climb as much as 4.8 per cent this year. Pension fund assets in the country, meanwhile, are projected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 per cent through to 2017, compared with 7.4 per cent in the US, according to data from Cerulli Associates, the research company.“This is a country that is going to be growing at a higher rate than the developed markets, and because of that growth we will have more new consumers demanding new products,” says Roberto Walker, president of Principal’s Latin American operations. “New growth will take place within the mandatory programme and will be even faster in the case of the voluntary programme.”Indeed, the voluntary scheme has attracted recent US interest as well. In the past month, Nuveen Investments and Federated Investors have announced distribution deals making their funds available.“Any time we see an emerging market that is developing with a stable and growing pension marketplace, we think our product line fits it,” says Gordon Ceresino, executive director for international distribution at Federated and president of Federated International Management.Chile’s system also stands out for provisions allowing investors to allocate up to 80 per cent of their contributions to foreign investments. About 40 per cent of that is invested in the US, Mr Ceresino says.Nuveen sees a glowing prospect in convincing savers about the benefits of active management, says Oscar Isoba, its head of business development for Latin America.“The allocation is done on a regional basis and developed markets like the US are accessed mostly through passive vehicles,” Mr Isoba says. “If US active managers gain ground on the performance front, there could be an opportunity to raise assets.”The next large competitor in the market, however, may be the government.President Michelle Bachelet has vowed to create a government-run retirement fund to compete with private sector providers. Her proposal is expected to be presented to the National Congress this year.MetLife’s Mr Schmidt says he takes comfort in the fact that Ms Bachelet presided over an ambitious, and ultimately positive, pension reform initiative in 2008, during her previous term as president.“Overall, it was a great reform, and we think she is going to continue supporting the system,” Mr Schmidt says.Both Mr Schmidt and Principal’s Mr Walker say the system suffers from insufficient savings rather than a lack of competition. They point to potential solutions including higher contributions and greater support for an employer-sponsored option under the voluntary scheme.“We are not against the idea of the government-run AFP because we believe in competition, and if it is fair, we will compete,” Mr Schmidt says.“But we do not think it solves the current problems.”

Previous transactions have been valued at about 10 per cent of assets under management.The deal is Rothesay’s first since Goldman sold a majority stake to investors including Blackstone and brings its total AUM to about £10bn.Addy Loudiadis, chief executive of Rothesay, said demand for bulk annuities – under which schemes transfer financial responsibilities to insurers for a fee – remained buoyant with transaction levels near record levels.
79;MET;Metlife Inc;2014-02-06T17:43:48Z;Akzo Nobel: beyond the DIY;Büchner is doing a good job but the refurb has far to go;Ton Büchner, boss of paint and chemicals maker Akzo Nobel, is undertaking some DIY. In the best traditions of home decoration, Mr Büchner is giving the place a good clean and a fresh coat of paint. Costs have been cut (ahead of schedule and above target), working capital is being hammered down, unwanted divisions have been sold, net debt has been cut and everything is looking more shipshape. He has even taken risk out of the pension scheme via a $170m deal with MetLife (although a chunky deficit remains). To top it off, Akzo beat fourth quarter estimates, pushing the shares up 7 per cent on Thursday.But although Akzo Nobel is a more efficient and healthy-looking version of its former self, it is still Akzo Nobel. Mature European markets account for 38 per cent of sales, so the health of the European economy has a big influence on how bright or gloomy the room looks. Currency fluctuations dented group revenues in 2013 but even before that they barely budged. Volume increases in paints were offset by tougher times in speciality chemicals, where prices fell in the fourth quarter. Even if a recovery is on the way, it will not be smooth. A shift to emerging markets is the standard response to such difficulties. Akzo Nobel is moving in that direction but developing nations accounted for 44 per cent of revenues in 2013, no more than in 2012.So while awaiting the European recovery and emerging-markets shift, investors will have to make do with watching Mr Büchner’s DIY. There is certainly more to do. He is aiming for a 14 per cent return on invested capital by 2015, so 2013’s 9.6 per cent leaves room for improvement. A rolling cost-cutting plan, which aims to save €150m-€200m per year to offset inflation, will also be important. That is all fine for the time being but at some point the investment case for Akzo Nobel will have to stretch beyond DIY.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

American International Group on Monday agreed to sell International Lease Finance Corp, its aircraft leasing business, to smaller rival AerCap. It is the last major sale of non-core assets as part of AIG’s post-crisis restructuring. In the five years since its $182bn bailout, AIG has shed assets to repay the US government. AIA, the Asian life assurer, was floated, and the non-US life assurance unit Alico was sold to MetLife. A year ago, the US had recovered the rescue funds plus about $23bn, and the Treasury had sold its entire stake in AIG.But the sale of ILFC is not a clean break and this is where the deal leaves something to be desired. AIG will receive $3bn in cash, plus about 98m shares in Dutch-headquartered AerCap for ILFC. Based on Friday’s closing price, the AerCap shares were worth $2.4bn. That leaves AIG with a 46 per cent stake in ILFC’s new owner, which it can only sell down in stages over a period of nine to 15 months after the deal closes. AIG also is providing AerCap with a $1bn five-year revolving credit facility.At $5.4bn, the purchase price represents a discount to ILFC’s book value – about 0.7 times shareholders’ equity. The upshot is that AIG can hope to make up some of that discount through its new stake in AerCap. AerCap’s shares jumped 33 per cent on Monday, adding about $800m to the value of the deal. The tie-up will result in cost and tax savings – the assets will be moved to Ireland – of about $300m a year.The AerCap deal is worth slightly more to AIG than a previous one with Jumbo Acquisition Limited, a Chinese consortium, for up to 90 per cent of ILFC, which valued the aircraft leasing company at $5.3bn. That transaction, agreed a year ago, was never finalised. This one, although it fails to sever all of AIG’s ties to the aircraft leasing business, has a better chance of getting off the ground.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.comThis article has been amended to show that AerCap’s shares jumped 33 per cent on Monday, not 8 per cent as previously stated.

82;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Prudential Financial drops opposition to stricter oversight;;Prudential Financial, the US insurer, has dropped its opposition to being designated a “systemically important financial institution”, in a blow to other non-bank financial groups that are trying to stave off additional regulation.The company on Friday decided not to mount a legal challenge to a ruling last month by the US Financial Stability Oversight Council that could lead to the imposition of extra capital and liquidity requirements.Other large insurers and fund managers had been watching Prudential’s decision, hoping that a legal challenge would circumscribe FSOC’s power and reduce the likelihood of other companies being designated as Sifis.Prudential “will continue to work with . . . regulators to develop regulatory standards that take into account the differences between insurance companies and banks, particularly in the use of capital, and that benefit consumers and preserve competition within the insurance industry,” it said.Prudential’s decision was being watched by fellow life insurer MetLife, which is also being assessed for a possible Sifi designation. That company also believes it does not deserve the Sifi label and plans to challenge the effort, at least through the FSOC process.Behind MetLife, the asset management industry is being examined by FSOC over whether the failure of the largest fund managers, such as BlackRock and Pimco, might pose a threat to the financial system.Analysts have been reluctant to quantify the potential hit to Prudential’s return on equity from having to set aside additional capital, until the Fed’s rules are clearer, and Prudential had been angry that the process of identifying systemic importance came before there was clarity on the regulatory requirements that come with such a designation.Jay Gelb, a Barclays analyst, predicted the Fed may hold off setting new capital rules for non-bank Sifis until apparent contradictions in the Dodd-Frank reform act are ironed out, perhaps requiring action by Congress. The wording of the law both requires the Fed to take into account differences between banks and other Sifis, and to impose the same capital and liquidity rules.The uncertainty remains a problem for shareholders, however, Mr Gelb said, because Prudential and the other Sifi insurers would be unable to extend share buybacks until capital rules became clear. “[They] may not be subject to stress testing until 2015 . . . Although investors should keep their expectations low for share buybacks (particularly for MetLife and Prudential), it would give these insurers an extra year to organically increase capital levels and prepare for increased oversight.”When FSOC made its designation in September, the two insurance experts on the council and the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Edward DeMarco, disagreed with the body’s move on Prudential.John Huff, director of the Missouri insurance department and the state insurance expert on the FSOC, said in his dissent that “there appears to be a lack of recognition given to the nature of the insurance business and the authorities and tools available to insurance regulators.” He added that applying banking standards renders “the rationale for designation flawed, insufficient, and unsupportable.”Roy Woodall, the independent member on the council with insurance expertise, said the FSOC’s assessment was not supported by facts or experience. “The underlying analysis utilises scenarios that are antithetical to a fundamental and seasoned understanding of the business of insurance, the insurance regulatory environment, and the state insurance company resolution and guaranty fund systems,” he said.
83;MET;Metlife Inc;2013-10-09T18:47:18Z;Large insurers reserve judgment over global capital standards;;About 50 of the world’s biggest insurance companies are facing fresh uncertainty after regulators unveiled plans for the first industry-wide capital standards.On Wednesday, three months after global regulators designated nine insurers – including Allianz, Prudential and Metlife – as “systemically important”, they put forward separate proposals that would affect an additional 40 companies.The new capital standards are due to take effect from 2019 and apply to insurers that members of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors deem “internationally active”.Narrower criteria are to be applied than those the regulators used to determine the nine too-big-to-fail insurers.They will look mainly at size per se, irrespective of the type of business the insurers do and their interconnectedness with the wider financial system.The standards will apply to insurance companies that have total assets of at least $50bn or write premiums worth at least $10bn a year, and do at least a 10th of their business outside their domestic market or write premiums in at least three jurisdictions.Regulators will have some discretion in determining the final list.Officials say the shake-up is necessary because insurance sector regulations have failed to keep pace with the changing nature of the industry.“It is undeniable that the business of insurance is global,” said Peter Braumüller, who chairs the IAIS’s executive committee. “Global issues demand global responses.”Officials argue that the financial crisis underscored the importance of common global standards – not only in banking.In addition to capital standards, the 50 or so insurers face “qualitative” requirements, including risk management standards and governance procedures.It is undeniable that the business of insurance is global. Global issues demand global responsesIndustry insiders stressed that details remained sketchy and said they would reserve judgment on the plans.Important questions remained about how the global standards would work alongside Solvency II, the EU’s regulatory shake-up.Several other jurisdictions outside the EU – but notably not the US – are planning to implement regimes that are equivalent to Solvency II.Regulators plan to unveil the global standards by the end of 2016 and implement them in full after two years of “testing and refinement”.The proposals would bring insurance regulations more in line with the set-up in banking. Regulators are phasing in the Basel III rulebook over several years.John Fitzpatrick, secretary-general of the global insurance trade body the Geneva Association, said in a statement that the industry was “committed to working with standard setters” on the plan.However, he added: “It is clear that there will be significant challenges to the creation of a global capital standard for insurers, particularly within the timeframe proposed.”The IAIS, which represents insurance regulators in 140 countries, unveiled the plans ahead of its annual meeting in Taipei next week.
84;MET;Metlife Inc;2013-09-19T22:00:03Z;Insurers fall but US indices steady;Insurers fall but US indices steady;US stock stepped back from record levels following Wednesday’s sharp uptick that was spurred by the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would not begin to scale back its quantitative easing programme.Insurers were among the worst performers as investors anticipate that the Fed’s efforts to maintain low interest rates will cut into profits.MetLife shares declined 3.2 per cent to $47.08 and are now off 6.8 per cent since the Fed’s announcement.The insurer, known for using Peanuts character Snoopy as its mascot, is up 43 per cent in 2013 as strong earnings and rising interest rates have cheered investors.Expectations that the Fed’s announcement would mark the start of the end of quantitative easing and cause an increase in rates fuelled the rally by insurers, and caused a reversal when tapering was delayed and rates fell, said Suneet Kamath, research analyst at UBS.“I think it’s a situation where sentiment lifted these stocks on expectations for higher interest rates and as that expectation is adjusted downwards, the valuation multiples adjust downwards,” he said.“It’s a move in the right direction, but I’m not sure it’s going to dramatically change the earnings outlook for next year.”Although not back near pre-crisis levels that briefly broke the $70 level, shares of MetLife have steadily recovered despite facing tighter regulation.MetLife was not alone as Lincoln National fell 3.7 per cent to $41.21 and Prudential Financial declined 1.9 per cent to $78.69.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,722.33, led by a 0.1 per cent rise by the information technology and industrials sectors. The benchmark index touched a new intraday high of 1,729.86 in early trading.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 15,636.55 and the Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.2 per cent to 3,789.38.Apple helped keep the Nasdaq in positive territory, rising 1.6 per cent to $472.30. Analysts’ predictions for sales of the new iPhones released this weekend have cheered investors initially disappointed by the company’s new offerings.But Apple shares remain 6.7 per cent lower since the new products were announced.Retailer Rite Aid was among the strongest stocks on the day, up 23.5 per cent to $4.58.The company announced an unexpected profit in the second quarter and lifted its outlook for 2014.Earnings news from ConAgra Foods was not as encouraging as the company missed first-quarter earnings per share expectations.The company warned earlier in September that profits would come in below expectations, sending its shares lower.But the early warning was unable to save ConAgra shares from falling 4 per cent on Thursday to $30.80, now down 11.8 per cent on the past month.Online coupon issuer Groupon benefited from a Stifel Nicolaus upgrade to “buy” from “hold”. Shares in the company added 9.1 per cent to $12.60.Home furnishings retailer Pier 1 Imports also fell after earnings missed analysts’ forecasts. The company also scaled back its 2014 forecast. Pier 1 shares fell 13.9 per cent to $20.33.JPMorgan Chase shares were down 1.2 per cent to $52.75 after news broke that the bank would face $920m in fines related to the London “Whale” trading losses.The bank has endured a variety of scandals in 2013, including a $410m settlement for charges of rigging power markets, and faces a $6bn penalty over allegations that it missold securities to government-backed mortgage companies.Despite these difficulties, JPMorgan shares are up 20 per cent on the year to date.Shares of electric carmarker Tesla hit another high, up 7 per cent to $177.92.Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Tesla shares to $200 from $160 while chief executive Elon Musk has stated publicly that the company will pursue the production of automated cars that require little human direction – a technology he believes will be ready within three years.
85;MET;Metlife Inc;2013-09-09T01:41:10Z;Insurers back fund with focus on Asia and Africa;;Six of the world’s leading insurers are to invest in a new $400m private equity fund being set up to back companies that sell financial services to individuals in developing countries.MetLife, Prudential Financial and Swiss Re are among the companies backing the second fund being put together by specialist “microfinance” house, Leapfrog Investments.The group will disclose as early as Monday that it has raised $204m for the venture, with plans to raise up to $200m more in the coming months.Other investors include the financial institutions JPMorgan Chase, TIAA-CREF and the European Investment Bank as well as mainstream insurers such as Partner Re, XL and Achmea.The fund will aim to take stakes in companies that offer general insurance and life assurance, as well as savings, pensions and investment products, to low-income consumers, some of whom earn between $1.25 and $10 a day.It will be looking at prospective investments in south and south east Asian markets such as India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka as well as parts of sub Saharan Africa including Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya.“A lot of people are saying the fundraising environment is quite brutal,” said Andrew Kuper, founder of Leapfrog. “But people [investors] are looking for operators [of businesses], not just clever [financial] structures.“People have become interested in Africa, parts of Asia . . . We see decades of opportunity lying ahead.”Leading insurers based in developed markets have previously focused their expansion efforts in developing countries on the relatively prosperous emerging middle classes. They have tended to avoid the high volume, low margin and difficult business of offering financial services to the world’s poorest people, especially given potential problems in distributing the products.However, Leapfrog said mainstream insurers are increasingly interested in the area.People have become interested in Africa, parts of Asia . . . We see decades of opportunity lying aheadLata Reddy, a corporate social responsibility executive at Prudential Financial, said: “People have been slow in coming to the realisation there’s potential in making money here. It’s a shift in mindset – seeing low-income [individuals] as consumers, not recipients [of charitable aid].”Leapfrog pointed to research from bodies including the World Bank, Global Findex and McKinsey showing there are 1.9bn potential consumers– only three in 10 of whom have access to financial services. Their total consumption is forecast to rise from $2tn to $5tn by 2022.The new fund is set to become almost three times bigger than Leapfrog’s $135m maiden offering, which it invested in seven companies reaching a total of 18m people.Leapfrog declined to disclose the profitability of its first fund, but said revenue rose by about a quarter on average across its portfolio in 2012 compared with a year earlier.
86;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
87;MET;Metlife Inc;2013-08-12T14:42:53Z;Prudential: box of chocolates;UK insurer offers investors exposure to UK, Asia and US in one place;Open up the chocolate box marked Prudential and there is an array of goodies – an Asian business, asset management, US insurance and, lurking at the bottom, UK life (the hazelnut praline that nobody likes). But what if you bought individual chocolates rather than the box?Replicating the Pru’s portfolio with specialist businesses is possible. For exposure to Asia, the obvious choice is AIA. It is larger, with $1.5bn of first-half operating profit against £476m from Prudential in Asia, so has more potential for economies of scale. And it has more exposure to China. But it is smaller in markets such as Indonesia and, overall, is not growing much faster than the Pru.The UK life and asset management businesses, which account for a third of Prudential’s profits, could both be replicated by Legal & General. In UK life L&G has the edge – its UK life profits were up 6 per cent in the first half against a 1 per cent rise at the Pru. With more than two-thirds of profits coming from UK life, L&G has a far greater incentive to find growth there than Prudential does.That leaves the US, where the Pru uses the Jackson brand. There the alternatives would be MetLife and the UK company’s namesake, Prudential Financial. All three are growing as the economy recovers. US profits from the UK’s Prudential rose a third in the first half, although an acquisition was partly to thank.So it is possible to replicate the Pru’s portfolio. But unless you do not want exposure to UK life or dislike the break-up talk surrounding the group, there are few compelling reasons to do so. By sticking with the Pru you leave the insurance asset allocation decisions in the hands of its managers. That does not come cheap. The shares rose another 5 per cent on Monday. On 14 times earnings they are at a discount to AIA but a premium to L&G and the US insurers. Nice boxes of chocolates never were a bargain buy.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
88;MET;Metlife Inc;2013-01-09T19:00:46Z;Banks lead rush to US debt markets;;Banks and financial institutions are leading the pack of global borrowers that have rushed to the US debt markets at the start of the year.Global corporations began 2013 with a wave of issuance that pushed total bond sales in the US over the $40bn mark in less than a week. But no group of borrowers has been more aggressive than banks and financial institutions.Citigroup, Allstate and MetLife, among others, were joined by the UK’s Standard Chartered and Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo, sending dollar-denominated sales of bank debt to $14.3bn so far this year, according to Dealogic. In a single blockbuster sale, Bank of America offered $6bn in three parts on Tuesday. That was the largest bond sale so far in 2013.Banks are rushing to squeeze in as many sales as possible ahead of the so-called quiet period, which precedes the release of their quarterly earnings reports, analysts said. Wells Fargo kicks off the US bank results season on Friday, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs coming next week.“Banks tend to come to markets earlier in the year, but they are certainly being more aggressive,” said Jason Brady, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “It’s a sign they are growing more comfortable with their balance sheets and in a position to take more debt.”A recent rise in Treasury yields may also be contributing to the banks’ rush to lock in new funding sooner rather than later. The yield on the 10-year note moved close to 2 per cent from 1.7 per cent in a matter of days, before paring some of its advance.“Any jump in rates tends to kick borrowers into action,” Mr Brady said.Bank sales have also dominated the issuance calendar in Europe. Northern European issuers such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC France, BNP Paribas and Société Générale have all tapped the euro market in the past few days, but much of the focus has been on higher-yielding assets from the eurozone periphery.BBVA, Spain’s second-largest bank by assets, reopened the region’s bond markets last week with a €1.5bn deal. But there have since been sales from Portuguese, Italian and other Spanish lenders, including Banco Espirito Santo, UniCredit, Caixabank and Banco Popular.“Investors would prefer higher beta issuance just to get some decent yield in this low-rate environment,” said Suki Mann, head of credit strategy at SG.European banks have also taken advantage of huge demand for dollar transactions. The $3.5bn Yankee offering from Italy’s Intesa was almost six times subscribed.For investors, bank debt is appealing as supply is still recovering from a sharp drop in issuance in 2010 and 2011. Barclays analysts expect total sales by investment grade financial institutions to reach $290bn this year, in line with 2012.Average yields on the securities are also higher. Yields on US investment-grade financials stood at 2.55 per cent this week, compared with 0.91 per cent for US Treasuries, according to Barclays indices.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway in New York
89;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-12-27T19:02:27Z;MetLife – try a little patience;An ugly moment, but for patient investors, it could be an opportunity;On the list of companies, institutions and savers that are smarting from years of near-zero interest rates, life insurers are close to the top. Low rates diminish the returns on premiums that they reinvest to cover their long-term liabilities. Take MetLife, the biggest life insurer in the US by market value. A day after the Federal Reserve’s December announcement that it would keep rates at record lows until employment falls below 6.5 per cent, the insurer issued a profit warning.But MetLife is known for its savvy. Consider the brilliantly-timed decision to sell Manhattan’s Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village apartment complex in 2006 – at the top of the US property boom. And the company has not sat by watching the yield on its investment portfolio inch lower. When rates were higher and contracts cheaper, it bought hedges that have insulated it against some of the declines. The company also is shifting away from variable annuities, arrangements that can give holders a lifetime of guaranteed minimum payments regardless of what is going on in the financial markets.MetLife has agreed to sell its banking deposits to General Electric – a move meant to shed its status as a bank holding company. Last year, plans for buybacks and a dividend rise were thwarted when MetLife failed the stress tests under which the Fed determines whether banks can return capital to shareholders. MetLife has argued that, as the only insurer tested, it was at a disadvantage. Further regulatory uncertainty looms, however, as MetLife could be deemed “systemically important” by the Fed and face other requirements.All the same, MetLife is a well-run franchise, with an estimated return on equity of 11-12 per cent this year, trading below its book value. It is an ugly moment, but for the patient investor, it could be an opportunity.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
90;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-12-13T15:13:42Z;Low interest rates force MetLife warning;;The biggest life assurer in the US by market value has warned that profits next year could be much lower than expected because of continued low interest rates.The warning from MetLife comes only a day after the Federal Reserve made the historic announcement that it would keep rates at record lows until employment falls below 6.5 per cent. While the low rates are expected to spur the economy, they are also putting pressure on the profits made by financial companies such as insurers and banks.MetLife said on Thursday that it expected operating earnings, which exclude tax and interest expenses, would be between $5.5bn and $5.9bn next year. That equates to about $4.95 to $5.35 a share – well below the $5.47 a share analysts had been expecting before Thursday’s announcement.Life assurers, with their billions of dollars worth of longer-dated liabilities, are particularly hard hit by the low rates, which eat into the money they make from reinvesting their premium payments to cover insurance payouts.While MetLife had previously said it was able to cope with low rates, thanks to a hedging programme struck in the mid-2000s, the company admitted on Thursday that it would have to speed up a planned strategic overhaul and forego share buybacks next year to deal with continued low rates. The plan includes selling the company’s eponymous bank company and increasing variable annuity sales.“In light of a lower-for-longer interest rate scenario, we have a heightened sense of urgency about our strategic initiatives,” said Steven Kandarian, chief executive. “We are focused on the levers we can pull to meet our financial objectives.”MetLife also said thatit expected profits this year of between $5.5bn and $5.6bn, or $5.15 to $5.25 a share. That’s at the top end of analysts’ forecasts despite MetLife recording a loss of as much as $95m from super storm Sandy. Selling MetLife Bank is also expected to free more capital for use in other areas of its business.Earlier this week, a bank regulator gave conditional approval for MetLife to sell $6.5bn worth of bank deposits to General Electric – another step towards the insurer ridding itself of its capital-costly bank holding company status.Banks have been attempting to cope with the low rates, in some cases by investing in higher-yielding securities. However, Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of investment bank Goldman Sachs, warned at a conference on Wednesday that investments in certain types of debt could lead to portfolio losses when rates eventually increase.
91;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-11-19T11:54:37Z;The importance of understanding culture;;People often say that learning is more than just reading from a book, but I never truly understood what this meant until I was in Turkey this summer with my fellow business school classmates.I was there as part of an immersion programme and for an entire week we visited companies, factories, financial institutions, universities and government agencies. As a class, we discussed Turkey’s economy and the private sector and got some interesting insider knowledge about the companies we visited.For my summer internship at Accenture, I worked on a project that investigated multiple characteristics of successful business approaches. One of the most important factors turned out to be cultural awareness and cultural intelligence. Companies such as InBev, Scotiabank and MetLife have all launched global talent mobility programmes to train students and employees in global awareness and culturally conscious practices.During my trip to Turkey, I experienced at first hand how important cultural competence is in the business world. Turkish business culture is unlike many others. Although there is an increasing trend towards western corporate culture in some of the larger companies, many businesses are still family-owned and run.Most of the companies we visited – Koç Holding, Arçelik A.Ş, Dudullu Industrial Zone Project – are family-owned enterprises where employees are treated with high respect and consideration. In these companies, Turks prefer doing business with those they like, trust, feel comfortable with and with people with whom they feel can provide a productive long-term relationship.Many companies fail because they don’t have a complete perception of what is really going on in the country they are going to do business with. One example is Caesars Entertainment (formerly known as Harrah’s Entertainment). During a class session last spring, the company’s chief executive Gary Loveman confessed that Caesars missed out on a great business opportunity in Macau because the American businessmen couldn’t understand the business culture of China.I think we, as students, learn the most by travelling to countries that are, in a sense, still “working out the kinks,” whether that means trying to establish a stable capitalist structure or trying to gain a greater share in the international market.In studying the business dynamics in places such as Turkey, we can see that the success of companies does not depend on finance and accounting alone, but to a greater degree on their cultural sensitivity and global awareness. These are indicators that cannot be measured and are not found in text books.
92;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-10-22T19:56:06Z;AIG seeks to shed stigma of bubble era;Tainted insurance group tries to remould itself;Four years after AIG posed a threat to the stability of the global financial system, the company is seeking to reintroduce itself to consumers and investors.Robert Benmosche, the company’s chief executive, paraded a new corporate logo and rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to “commemorate the company’s continued progress” away from the dark days of its near collapse and back to its roots as a global insurance company. The company’s nearly 100-year history will always be stained by an ill-judged expansion into mortgage and derivatives markets in the bubble era but it is now trying to remould itself.Mr Benmosche says the US Treasury – which acquired 92 per cent of the group in 2008 – may sell its remaining holdings by the end of the year. “Our hope is they’re gone,” he says, according to Bloomberg.The US has already cut its stake in AIG from 77 per cent to 16 per cent through four share sales this year. The company has shed major assets to help repay the government. That includes floating AIA, the Asian life insurer, and selling its non-US life insurance subsidiary Alico to US rival MetLife. The headcount globally had shrunk to 57,000 last year from 116,000 in 2008. The derivatives book of AIG Financial Products, worth $1.8tn on a net basis four years ago, had shrunk to about $157bn by June this year.Now, AIG is seeking to refocus its Chartis unit as part of a push for increased profitability.The stock has gained more than 50 per cent this year, above the Treasury’s break-even cost of about $28.73. Showing confidence, the company is reverting to the old name so Chartis will become AIG in most places and SunAmerica Financial Group will become AIG Life and Retirement.
93;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-09-21T16:22:23Z;Caution urged over fixed-term annuities;Investors gamble on rates rebounding;Pension savers reluctant to lock into a lifetime annuity at today’s record low rates are being urged to think carefully about buying short-term products which hinge on hopes that rates might rebound in the near future.The caution over fixed-term annuities (FTAs) comes from advisers following the sudden withdrawal of a household-name provider from the sector, which has led some to suggest the market will now become less competitive.MetLife suspended sales of its Freedom Income Plan last week, saying investment returns were not sufficient to keep its products competitive. Just a handful of providers now sell the plans.FTAs are fairly new in the UK, having only been launched five years ago but have grown in popularity as lifetime annuities, where rates are locked in for life, became poorer value.These short-term plans pay a predetermined level of income on lump sums from pension funds, at rates typically less than those offered by the best lifetime annuities.But the key feature is that the income, and the capital investment, is only for a fixed term – which may be five years, giving breathing space for investors.At the end of that term, the plans return a guaranteed capital sum, which can then be used to buy another fixed-term annuity or a conventional annuity, or drawdown. The hope would be that rates had improved, or an income uplift could be achieved if an individual’s health had worsened over the period, qualifying the investor for an impaired life annuity.As annuity rates have plunged, short-term plans have gained in appeal but some advisers say their risks should not be understated.“When I first saw these plans I thought they were a good idea in that they allow you to defer decision on a lifetime annuity but in the meantime get a guaranteed income,” says David Trenner, technical director with Intelligent Pensions, the independent financial advisers.“However you are gambling that either rates will improve or that your health will worsen. If you bought one of these plans five years ago you would be worse off unless you had developed a serious illness.”Providers have responded to concerns about flexibility by introducing features such as break clauses which allow the investor to switch to another pension or enhanced annuity if they fall ill, get married, divorce or their spouse dies.While these innovations have made fixed-term products more attractive, they come at a cost. Advisers say that consumers should consider alternative options.“A better strategy is to opt for a combination of lifetime annuity and drawdown, where the annuity underpins and guarantees sufficient income to meet daily needs and the drawdown provides variable income but hopefully higher than an annuity over time, albeit with greater risk,” suggests Danny Cox, head of advice with Hargreaves Lansdown, the independent financial advisers.“And the drawdown fund can be converted to annuity at a later stage if appropriate.”However, FTA providers, including Just Retirement, LV=, Aviva and Primetime Retirement insist fixed-term plans can be a suitable alternative to a lifetime annuity.“The future of annuity rates is uncertain, especially with gender equalisation still to come, but there are signs that annuity rates could recover and we are certainly a long way from a ‘normal’ market in terms of gilt prices,” says Stuart Wilson of Primetime Retirement.“No-one knows what the future holds, but FTAs provide a ‘keep your options open’ alternative to locking in at what could be the ‘low point’ of annuity rates. We believe the market and demand for FTAs will continue to grow.”

The shares continued to slide in the after-hours trading, falling more than 17 per cent to $2.15.The technological glitch compounded uncertainty over the eurozone that was already confronting Wall Street investors.On Thursday, US equities lost ground for the fourth consecutive day, falling sharply as the European Central Bank failed to reassure investors.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,365.00. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.7 to 12,878.88 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq shed 0.4 per cent to 2,909.77.“Markets are clearly disappointed with the ECB inaction, coming on the heels of the Fed inaction on Wednesday. Draghi really put himself in the corner when he said ‘he would do whatever he could to save the euro’, but today markets readjusted their expectation to what he realistically could do,” said Alec Young, global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ.“What the ECB has done again is bought itself a bit more time. Markets were expecting more forceful action in terms of bond buying and the ESM (European Stability Mechanism) banking license,” he added.In one bright spot on the market the clothing chain Gap enjoyed a midsummer rally as sales figures from a number of companies beat expectations for July.Share in Gap jumped 12.75 per cent to $33.17, their highest point in the past year. The stock is up a hefty 78.8 per cent in the year to date.“The company bucked the trend some other retailers faced in a tough quarter and finished with upward momentum. It shows that the strategy is working and bodes very well for fall and holiday this year,” wrote John Morris, analyst at BMO Capital Markets in a note to clients.“Gap remains one of our favourite names for the back half despite the notable run up in the stock price,” he added.Although mixed, the news from US retailers boosted the consumer discretionary index – the only sector to trade into positive territory – up 0.2 per cent.Macy’s reported an increase in same-store sales of 4.1 per cent in July. Shares in the department store chain rose 3.8 per cent to $36.40.Mid-scale retailer Target reported an increase of 5.1 per cent in its same-store sales in the same period and the shares gained 2.2 per cent to $61.97, while Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, reported a 12 per cent increase in comparable store sales and gained 1.9 per cent to $47.72.But other retailers dragged. The apparel chain Abercrombie & Fitch was among the day’s laggards, falling 14.6 per cent to $29.06.Coach, the leather goods manufacturer and retailer, continued to decline, losing 1 per cent to $50.29. Matt Arnold, an analyst who covers US retailers at Edward Jones & Co, said the weakness in sales occurred at factory outlet stores, a uniquely North American phenomenon.In earnings news, shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roaster perked up, rising 26.5 per cent to $22.66. The makers of Keurig coffee brewers and K-cup portion packs, which has seen shares fall 50 per cent in the year to date, plans to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal year 2013 and will attempt a $500m buyback over the next two years.Insurance companies MetLife and Prudential reported on Wednesday. MetLife rose 4.2 per cent at $31.70 after beating analyst expectations. Prudential, which missed earnings estimates but met revenue estimates, traded 5.2 per cent higher at $50.04.Elsewhere, semiconductor stocks have been rallying during the earnings season. Since hitting a low on July 17, the Philadelphia exchange semiconductor index had risen as much as 9 per cent compared with a 1 per cent increase for the S&P 500.“We believe this has been caused by smaller than expected estimate reductions,” said Christopher Danely, analyst at JPMorgan.However, the sector could not escape the gloomy market sentiment and fell back 0.6 per cent.The US electronics components group SanDisk was down 1.6 per cent to $40.75 having climbed as much as 28 per cent over the past two weeks, while Intel traded flat at $25.91 on Thursday, but has gained 4 per cent in the past two weeks.Chipmaker Marvell increased 0.3 per cent in the morning session to $11.11 and is up 7 per cent since the beginning of the earnings season.Shares in Facebook continued their steady decline falling 4.0 per cent to close at $20.04.In contrast, investors responded positively to Yelp’s plans to expand into new markets, lifting shares in the business reviews website 16.9 per cent to $22.00.

She said she hoped remaining holdouts would “take this opportunity to take a second look” at the “enormously valuable” deal on offer.The settlement between BofA and Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for a group of mortgage bonds, has the support of other key investors including BlackRock and MetLife.BofA has been weighed down by its past mortgage misdeeds over the past few years. Investors who bought mortgage-backed securities have been demanding compensation for those that contained soured loans that breached underwriting guidelines.The issue flared up again during the bank’s second-quarter earnings presentation last week when BofA disclosed that claims had jumped from both private mortgage investors and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage companies.
96;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-07-12T23:18:36Z;Sale considered of ING Japanese unit;;Nomura is working on a potential sale or refinancing for ING’s Japanese business as the final round of bidding for the Dutch group’s Asian insurance operations approaches, according to people familiar with the situation.The Japanese arm and particularly its variable annuity business, which holds billions of dollars worth of difficult to hedge liabilities, has attracted least interest of the three main units up for sale by ING, which also includes its Korean and south-east Asian operations.Final bids for the units, which could fetch a combined $7bn, are due on Monday after parties that made it into the second round spent eight weeks doing due diligence and preparing their offers.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are the main advisers on the sale, Nomura and ING all declined to comment.The units are expected to be sold separately, or at least without significant chunks of the Japanese business, after two of the strategic buyers with most experience in Japan, MetLife and Prudential Financial of the US, dropped out of the race in the first round.Only one Japanese bidder, Dai-Ichi Life, remains, while other large strategic bidders, Manulife of Canada and AIA, the Hong Kong based pan-Asian insurer, are mainly interested in the south-east Asian business and potentially the Korean unit, according to people with knowledge of the process. Sun Life of Canada, which has a much smaller Asian presence, may also still bid.Mark Wilson, a former chief executive of AIA, is reported to have backing from a consortium including private equity group Blackstone and reinsurer Swiss Re to launch a bid for the full set. However, analysts and bankers with knowledge of the process thought it would be much more difficult for a financial buyer to get regulatory approval in all the different countries.Mr Wilson, who declined to comment, worked very closely with Blackstone’s advisory team on a planned initial public offering of AIA in 2009 when its former parent AIG of the US was looking to raise capital by selling the group.That IPO was overtaken by the ultimately abortive bid for the group from Prudential of the UK in 2010. Mr Wilson was ousted from AIA as that process collapsed in acrimony and Mark Tucker, a former chief executive of the Pru, was brought in to pursue a fresh listing of AIA in October 2010.Blackstone had been approached to work with Richard Li, son of Li Ka-shing, in his bid for the south-east Asian operations of ING, according to a person familiar with the talks. However, it did not believe the unit would be competitive as a standalone business, the person said.Richard Li is preparing a final bid for the south-east Asian unit and has plenty of funding since his billionaire tycoon father pledged financial backing for his son’s business ventures.ING’s Korean arm has attracted separate interest from two leading domestic financial companies, Kookmin and Korea Life.
97;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-05-31T16:08:15Z;European insurers rethink US strategy;;"They entered the US to offer savings and investment products to the millions of baby boomers approaching retirement.However, after a decades-long effort to break America, some of Europe’s biggest life assurers are rethinking their strategy in the face of regulatory concerns and highly competitive market conditions.“Many came to the US market because it is ‘big’ – which is not necessarily the best reason,” says Spencer Horgan, insurance analyst at Deutsche Bank.The latest sign of a shifting landscape came on Thursday when Swiss Re disposed of its capital-intensive US closed life assurance business for $600m, to Prudential-owned Jackson National Life Insurance, saying it saw “attractive growth potential in the UK and continental Europe”.At least one European insurer, Aviva, has been considering plans to quit the US. Analysts estimate that Aviva USA would fetch only about half the $2bn the FTSE 100 group paid for the business six years ago.Others have been writing substantially less new business in the country. Axa of France wrote €136m of new business in the US last year, down two-thirds since 2007. That compares with a group-wide fall in new business of about a fifth during the same period.Regulation threatens to make life even tougher.The UK’s Prudential has warned that Brussels’ forthcoming capital requirements for EU-based insurers could make it impossible for its American arm to compete with domestic peers.Any retreat by the Europeans would come after an aggressive, often acquisition-led, advance into the world’s biggest insurance market by premiums.The Pru acted early by purchasing Jackson one of the largest US life assurance groups, for £406m in 1986. Since 1995 there have been 22 acquisitions of US insurers by western European companies with a transaction value of more than $1bn, Bloomberg data show. By contrast, US groups have been far less eager to expand in Europe, with only six such deals in the other direction.European insurers are important in the US retirement market: five of the 20 biggest annuity providers in the US by sales are owned by European groups, according to data from Limra, the trade body.Several European insurers garner chunky proportions of sales from the US. For example, the US business of Aegon accounts for 63 per cent of the Dutch group’s capital expenditure. Aegon paid $10.9bn in
1999 for Transamerica.But to underscore the difficulties in the US market, MetLife, the S&P 500 insurer, said last week it would scale back its variable annuities business.Variable annuities are among the potentially most problematic products. They tend to offer minimum guaranteed returns to consumers even though the portfolios can invest in equities as well as in less volatile fixed income securities.“There are quite a lot of guarantee-type products in US life assurance, which are generally tougher than those offered in Europe,” says Toby Langley, analyst at Barclays.In order to meet such guarantees, the insurers involved usually attempt to hedge their exposure to the potentially volatile assets – but they have had mixed success in doing so. Sales of such annuities fell 7 per cent to $36.8bn in the first quarter.Metlife’s shift away from the area follows the decision this year by Hartford Financial Services, another S&P 500 insurer, to sell its variable annuities business.Yet rivals argue the retrenchment by others gives them an opportunity. “We’ve come through the crisis without any issues,” says Mike Wells, chief executive of the Pru’s Jackson. “The flight to quality pushes advisers to us.”“Going into the financial crisis there was a perception by competitors that it was sort of a land race. We held our pricing while there was a price war on the guarantees, and the fees on those guarantees.”But for all the difficulties faced by some operators in the US, its sheer size remains a powerful lure.“For European insurance groups with global aspirations it’s seen as very important that they have a strong position in the US,” says Simon Harris, managing director at Moody’s, the rating agency.Although competition can be more intense than in Europe, the economic backdrop is much healthier than European insurers’ domestic markets.“It’s nice to have some exposure to the US at the moment,” says Kevin Molloy, senior vice-president at Axa’s US business. “The macro situation seems to be improving a little bit faster” than in Europe, he says.Mr Wells of the Pru hails the benefits of transatlantic diversification: “The [business] cycles are different and that gives you much more robust, more balanced earnings. That’s not an immaterial issue.”He says the macro trend of ageing baby boomers, which attracted European insurers to the US in the first place, still holds true, adding: “You get about 8,000 to 10,000 of them a day turning 65 right now.”"

He also bought Pinebridge, a US-based asset management business, from AIG following the insurance company’s collapse during the global financial crisis.Mr Li, who is being advised by HSBC, spent several weeks trying to find a consortium partners who would be interested in the Japanese or Korean parts of ING’s Asia business, according to people familiar with his dealings.However, the Dutch group and its advisers in the sale, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, did not allow consortium bids in the first round of bidding, which closed on May 18, because it would prefer to sell the businesses as a single unit.Large North American groups MetLife and Manulife are thought to have lodged offers for all the Asian businesses, while Prudential Financial of the US, which had been expected to do so, dropped out days before the deadline without bidding, according to people familiar with the situation.However, most other interested parties, including AIA, the pan-Asian insurer, are expected to avoid the Japanese unit, which has a good life assurance group but an opaque and potentially loss-ridden variable annuity division that writes long-term income guarantees to policy holders.The Korean arm has generated some strong interest from domestic rivals, but the south-east Asian business, which is dominated by a Malaysian unit, is expected to attract the most interest and potentially the highest premium.South-east Asia is seen as promising the highest growth rates as a burgeoning middle class looks to save for the future and protect its improving lifestyles.As a whole, ING’s Asian insurance operations are expected to fetch between $6bn and $7bn. Mr Li, HSBC, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs all declined to comment.Additional reporting by Enid Tsui
99;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-05-18T16:27:14Z;Bidding starts in ING Asia auction;;Three North American groups were expected to bid for all of ING’s $6bn Asian insurance operations in the first round of its auction on Friday in a gamble that certainty of sale would prove most attractive to the Dutch group.MetLife and Prudential of the US and Canada’s Manulife were expected to make indicative offers for the whole business, bankers said.They added that AIA, the Asian insurer, was likely to do the same but only if it was certain to get a partner to take the units in Japan, where it currently has no presence.The businesses on the block are centred on a strong South Korean unit, a rapidly growing Malaysian operation and a problematic Japanese business.The Japanese unit has a good life assurance company but an opaque and potentially loss-ridden variable annuity division, which writes long-term income guarantees to policy holders.Bidders have had limited data so far on the units, and one person involved said it would probably take up to three weeks of serious due diligence once they were given access to the data room before they could be certain about potential exposures in the variable annuity business.According to bankers involved in the process, the variable annuity unit has about $7bn worth of reinsurance and those who have looked at it think losses from expensive guarantees could be anywhere from nothing to $2bn.Jan Hommen, chief executive, said recently he expected the insurance business to fetch more than €8bn but bankers said that was optimistic.ING is being forced to split its banking and insurance operations after it received bailout funds from the government of the Netherlands during the financial crisis.Bankers said a price of not much more than $6bn was more realistic, especially given the turmoil in European markets, which is affecting sentiment around the globe.The Dutch group would almost certainly prefer to sell the businesses in one go rather than risk being left with a slow and costly rundown of its Japanese business.Some Korean groups are interested in taking that business separately, and the higher-growth Malaysian-centred unit could attract strong interest from a number of players.However, it is far from certain that the prices paid for these two if sold separately would outweigh the costs of sorting out Japan.

Such institutions must receive Federal Reserve approval to deploy capital.MetLife has said it would like to use what it deems excess capital to pay dividends and repurchase additional shares, but it did not pass the Fed’s stress tests of systemically important institutions in March. MetLife’s chief executive said then the company was “deeply disappointed”.The reverse mortgage unit will be sold to Nationstar Mortgage, subject to regulatory approvals. Terms were not disclosed. Though MetLife does not break out the unit’s results, the company said that its retail banking businesses, which included the unit, represented less than 2 per cent of operating earnings.“Given MetLife’s strategic focus as a global insurance and employee benefits leader, the company decided in 2011 that a bank holding company structure was no longer appropriate,” the company said.MetLife agreed to sell its retail bank to GE Capital late last year, with the sale expected to close later this year, and its warehouse finance business to EverBank. It also announced it would stop writing traditional mortgages.After market close, the company reported a first-quarter net loss due to $1.3bn in losses on derivatives, which it used to hedge against the risk of falling interest rates and unfavourable foreign currency movements.The company said the losses were “largely due to increases in interest rates and MetLife’s lower credit spreads”.The result was a net loss for the quarter of $120m, versus net income of $884m a year ago. Total revenues grew fractionally, to $15.92bn from $15.91bn.The derivatives loss masked a rise in premiums and other fees by 7 per cent, to $11.6bn, and a 12 per cent jump in net investment income, to $6.2bn. Expenses also rose 12 per cent, to $16.3bn.MetLife’s share price has fallen 18.5 per cent in the past year. The shares were unchanged in after-hours trading, after adding 1.4 per cent to $36.47 on Thursday.MetLife, like other insurers, has been increasing its premiums following an extended period of falling rates after the financial crisis, in part to make up for a surge in losses related to weather catastrophes last year.“These results reflect top-line growth in all of MetLife’s global regions, sound fundamentals and the core earnings power of our diversified businesses,” said Steven Kandarian, chief executive.
101;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Walmart senior executive quits MetLife board;;A senior Walmart executive implicated in the Mexican bribery allegations roiling the retailer has resigned from his position on the board of MetLife to focus on defending his reputation.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart Mexico from 2002 to 2005, said in a letter on Tuesday to Steve Kandarian, MetLife’s chief executive, that due to “recent events” he was stepping down immediately from its board.“I now must focus my energy in spending personal time with my family and in protecting my good name and business reputation,” wrote Mr Castro-Wright, a Walmart vice chairman who led its large US business after Mexico.The allegations and the investigations they have triggered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and lawmakers have cast a pall over the company as its potential liability, if wrongdoing is found, is likely to be high.According to a former Walmart Mexico official quoted by The New York Times, Mr Castro-Wright was “the driving force behind years of bribery”. The New York Times has alleged that Walmart covered up a campaign of bribery to secure permits for new stores in Mexico.In his letter to Mr Kandarian, Mr Castro-Wright wrote: “It is my expectation that these outside distractions will be resolved favourably within the next several months.” He joined the board of MetLife, an insurance group, in 2008.His resignation from MetLife marks the first significant executive move in the US linked to the weekend allegations.Walmart Mexico has said that its general counsel, José Luis Rodriguez Macedo, has been assigned to other duties “in the interests of the investigation” that Walmart has launched into the allegations.On Tuesday Walmart shares closed down 3 per cent at $57.77, taking their fall since the allegations were made to 7.5 per cent, equating to a loss of $15bn in market capitalisation.Rapidly growing sales made Mexico one of Walmart’s best performing overseas markets and helped Mr Castro-Wright to win promotion from his Mexican role to chief operating officer of the US business and then its head in 2005.He was once seen as a potential Walmart chief executive, but his tenure in the US coincided with a fall in sales that the company later acknowledged was due to strategic errors.Mr Castro-Wright was effectively demoted in 2010 to run Walmart’s ecommerce operations as it struggled to staunch its loss of business to Amazon. Late last year Walmart said he would retire from the company this July.Walmart said on Tuesday that it had appointed a global compliance officer responsible for the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the US anti-bribery law, but it was unwilling to name the person.
102;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-04-16T19:31:45Z;European banks: Lloyds and ING;They may share the same Brussels doghouse, but their predicaments could not be more different;This post-crisis bank narrative is familiar: forced seller seeks deep-pocketed buyer for prize assets in bombed out market. No, this is not a desperate Spanish lender. Nor is it a eurozone bank deleveraging story. The protagonists this time are Lloyds Banking Group and ING, both on tight European Union-imposed timetables to sell assets because they received state aid in the crisis. They may share the same Brussels doghouse, but their predicaments could not be more different. UK lender Lloyds, forced to sell 630 branches, has only one credible taker for its slice of mature domestic banking. Dutch group ING, however, has a queue of buyers for its Asian insurance business.Still, Lloyds remains in talks with preferred bidder Co-operative Bank – despite reports that talks are foundering. A sale to the Co-op is sensible: the mutual is a known quantity and versed at integration after buying Britannia. But the UK’s Financial Services Authority has qualms about the Co-op’s capital structure and management capacity. If these prove insurmountable, Lloyds has fall-backs: a £2bn bid from NBNK Investments, an unknown quantity, and a listing. Now is no time to cast branch and customers into the unknown. Nor do investors, already facing a £500m book loss on the sale, deserve such treatment. The Co-op deal at least answers the call by the Independent Commission on Banking for a new bank of scale. It would be off if the deal was blocked because the FSA could not agree on a safe structure.Buyer firepower is not in doubt as ING plans its $6bn sale of insurance assets in Korea, Malaysia and Japan. Instead, the question is whether Hong-Kong-listed AIA, MetLife and Prudential Financial of the US, or Manulife of Canada, buy all or part.ING’s Asian assets give it choices now. Lloyds must rue its long retreat from emerging markets to the UK.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
103;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-04-15T21:54:46Z;ING starts sell off race for Asian assets;;Bankers for ING sent financial details of the Dutch group’s $6bn Asian insurance businesses to a string of bidders late on Friday firing the starting gun on what will be a keenly fought contest for the units.The sale of businesses in Korea, Malaysia and Japan is seen by insurance industry observers as one of the last opportunities for any group that is under-represented in the world’s most promising life assurance markets to gain a significant foothold at one attempt.However, bankers representing a group among those preparing potential bids said it is likely to prove very difficult to beat AIA in the auction if the Hong-Kong listed pan-Asia group decides it wants the businesses because its highly rated stock means it is likely to have more firepower to offer a higher premium.MetLife of the US, which has Credit Suisse as an adviser, and Prudential Financial of the US, advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, are the leading US bidders, while Manulife of Canada has hired Citigroup to lead its efforts. Of those three, Prudential has the most limited presence in Asia, though it has been growing in Japan through acquisitions.Prudential US also has a presence in Korea, but ING’s business there has attracted a lot of interest from local bidders who want only that unit, including Kookmin, which is being advised by Barclays.Life assurance businesses in emerging Asian economies are the fastest growing in the world as an emergent middle class begins to take measures to protect its improving lifestyle in countries that usually have little if any public welfare support. South-east Asian markets such as Malaysia and Indonesia are among the most promising, while China has huge potential but is very difficult to gain a significant presence in because of dominant local companies such as Ping An, and restrictions on foreign operators.Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore are much more mature, but still have the potential to produce good cash flows.Japan is the smallest and least attractive of ING’s businesses, worth only a few hundred million dollars according to bankers, while the South Korean and Malaysian units are worth more than $2.5bn each.It is still unclear whether ING will insist on bids only for the entire block of businesses in the first round in order to improve its chances of offloading all of them, or whether it will run a more open and flexible process that allows those interested only in one or two units to make offers for them, bankers said.ING, which is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, decided to sell the Asian insurance businesses separately from those in Europe because it expects to get a better price more quickly for the Asian units. It was directed to sell all the businesses by European authorities after receiving state support during the financial crisis.It has also decided to sell its Asian asset management business separately and retained Credit Suisse to run that process last month. The information memorandum for that sale is likely to come out later this month.
104;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Consolidation: There are few large deals on the horizon;Most activity has affected smaller, weaker groups, writes Alistair Gray;Big underwriting losses, regulatory pressure and weak investment returns have caused a bout of mergers and acquisitions among smaller insurers – but analysts and bankers are unconvinced that there are many larger deals on the horizon.Mark Winlow, head of general insurance at KPMG, says: “There’s going to be some small- and medium-sized ones but don’t hold your breath for the big ticket transactions.”In addition to the economic uncertainty that has kept M&A subdued in general, analysts say there are insurance-specific factors that make a spate of large transactions – other than forced or distressed sales – unlikely.Insurers in the European Union are bracing themselves for the introduction of the Solvency II regulatory regime, the biggest ever regulatory shake-up in the sector, due to take effect from 2014.It has wide-ranging implications for capital requirements, corporate governance and data management.The regulatory changes may be encouraging smaller companies in the sector to consolidate, but some analysts say uncertainty is putting larger companies off deals.In a recent example of a successful bid for a smaller insurer, CNA Financial of the US last month agreed to pay £143m for Hardy Underwriting, a Lloyd’s of London company that was among the hardest hit by last year’s natural catastrophes.However, government bailouts aside, data from Dealogic show there have only been two transactions in the sector worth more than $10bn since 2007.They were Allianz’s 2007 purchase of the stake in AGF of France it did not already own and AIG’s $15.5bn disposal of American Life Insurance, one of its overseas businesses, to MetLife in 2010.Some large transactions have been aborted, notably Prudential’s $35bn bid for AIA, the Asian life assurance business of AIG.Although huge deals have been almost non-existent, the data show there were 723 M&A transactions in the insurance sector last year, with a total value of about $67.6bn, accounting for more than a quarter of the financial services total of $250.6bn. The deal value total was down 48 per cent from 2007 highs, although activity held up better than in the broader financial services industry, which was down 65 per cent.Some large transactions seem fairly certain, because of restructuring of the financial services industry driven by regulatory changes after the economic crisis.Notable examples include ING, which has put its Asian life insurance business up for sale, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which plans to spin off Direct Line, its UK insurance arm. Both groups were ordered to make the disposals because they received state aid during the crisis.Difficulties arising from the eurozone debt crisis may also spur transactions.Although most big insurers remain generally well capitalised, some with extensive operations and investments in the eurozone have run into financial difficulties and are looking to sell “non-core” assets.They include Groupama, the French mutual, which has put its brokerage operations and UK business up for sale.Bill Cooper, head of insurance at Lloyds Banking Group, says: “We think there will be others to come as other institutions – not just banks – are affected by the eurozone crisis.”On the life insurance side, some consolidation is being driven by “closed fund consolidators” such as Resolution, set up by insurance entrepreneur Clive Cowdery. A closed fund manages sets of existing policies that are no longer open to new business.Resolution, which has acquired Friends Provident, Axa’s UK life operations and Bupa’s life and health business, said last month it believed “value can be created from further consolidation” and was looking at more deals.On the non-life side, the Lloyd’s of London market has long been regarded as ripe for consolidation. The Hardy sale was preceded by that of Chaucer, which last year accepted a cash takeover bid from The Hanover, The year before, Brit Insurance agreed to a private equity takeover by Apollo and CVC.Analysts expect to see more such transactions, as profitability comes under pressure from depressed premium levels.Omega Insurance is among the Lloyd’s companies that is the subject of bid interest. “It looks like the ones that are worst affected by claims have decided they may not have an independent future,” says Mr Cooper.Potential buyers include overseas groups eager to gain a foothold in London.Richard Ward, chief executive of the City’s 300-year-old insurance market, says: “Businesses are looking to expand their international presence and they think Lloyd’s is a great way of doing that.”“People are holding on to excess capital,” says Gordon Aitken at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank. He says many insurers believe it would be “imprudent to do a major deal” ahead of Solvency II.Moreover, he says, investors remain to be convinced about the extent that dealmaking in life insurance can yield substantial efficiencies. These businesses often have legacy IT systems,” he says.“The jury’s out on whether banging them together saves money in the end.”
105;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-04-04T00:32:32Z;Moody’s downgrades GE credit rating;;General Electric suffered a credit rating downgrade from Moody’s on Tuesday, with the agency warning that the industrial group’s large finance unit remained over-reliant on short-term funding.Moody’s cut its rating on the senior unsecured debt of GE Capital Corporation by two notches to A1 and its rating on the parent company from Aa2 to Aa3. The industrial group held a prized triple A rating for 42 years until it was stripped during the financial crisis on fears over the stability of GE Capital.The move by Moody’s on Tuesday came on the same day the Financial Stability Oversight Council moved towards a new system of identifying and regulating large “non-bank” financial groups, which is likely to hit GE Capital with tougher supervision and higher capital requirements.Moody’s had warned last month that it might cut GE and GE Capital’s ratings as part of a broader reassessment of risk associated with finance companies. Banks including Morgan Stanley are bracing for possible ratings cuts, which could raise their cost of funding.The agency acknowledged that GE Capital had improved its liquidity and capital position since the financial crisis but said there “remain material risks associated with the firm’s funding model”. It cut GE Capital’s “standalone” rating to Baa1 but said it believed the company would be bailed out by the parent if necessary, boosting its rating.“We believe that GE’s industrial operations continue to have many Aaa-like credit characteristics,” said Russell Solomon, Moody’s lead analyst for GE. “The downgrade reflects Moody’s view of the heightened risk profile inherent to finance companies like GECC, which has strategic importance to GE, rather than any deemed incremental risk related to GE’s industrial business lines.”GE said its “liquidity and capital position have never been stronger”, adding: “Moody’s actions are based on a change in their own methodology rather than our credit position, which has only improved in the past few years. With over $80bn in cash and a healthy balance sheet, GE is well positioned and GE Capital remains one of the highest rated financial services companies in the world.”In December, GE Capital acquired bank deposits from MetLife, the insurance group. For MetLife, it was a step on the path to shedding bank holding company status in order to escape the top level of supervision from the US Federal Reserve. For GE Capital, it meant more lower-cost sources of funding. The lender is otherwise dependent on issuing debt and commercial paper to fund itself.In Washington, the FSOC group of regulators, chaired by the Treasury secretary Tim Geithner, improved a new list of metrics to identify a “systemically important” company and hit it with stricter regulation. GE Capital and AIG, the insurer, are among the most likely candidates to be designated.Standard & Poor’s rates both GE and GE Capital at double A plus, which was already a notch above Moody’s rating.Matt Toms, head of US public fixed income investments at ING Investment Management, said: “The action taken by Moody’s on GECC illustrates the depths of Moody’s new-found distaste for finance-related businesses more broadly. While the bond market is not likely to be overly concerned about a nuanced ratings notching form GECC, it does not bode well for other financial issuers with ratings much closer to non-investment grade status, such as Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.”
106;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-29T22:44:30Z;BofA settlement clears legal hurdle;;Bank of America took an important step toward cementing a $8.5bn legal settlement that is crucial to its future when a court rejected a challenge to the deal by Baupost, a Boston-based hedge fund.BofA has been trying to emerge from an avalanche of mortgage losses and litigation related to its disastrous 2008 acquisition of Countrywide, the California-based mortgage originator. The bank last year agreed to pay $8.5bn to settle claims that bad loans made by Countrywide, which underpin mortgage-backed securities, breached underwriting guidelines.But that deal, cut with Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee on a set of MBS pools, and backed by investors including BlackRock and MetLife, has been challenged by other investors, including Baupost, and is waiting for a judge’s approval. If it succeeds, it could be the blueprint for other settlements, paving the way for BofA to escape its mortgage difficulties. If it fails, BofA faces a new, unpredictable wave of litigation.On Thursday, Barbara Kapnick, a judge in New York’s Supreme Court, dismissed a complaint from Baupost, which is run by founder Seth Klarman and brought the case under the name Walnut Place. Baupost had objected to the way BNY Mellon had handled its complaints about Countrywide.Ms Kapnick said BNY Mellon “did, in fact, act upon [the] complaints, as demonstrated by the settlement agreement”. A lawyer for Grais & Ellsworth, the hedge fund’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.People involved who want the settlement to succeed argued that Ms Kapnick’s decision boded well for the ruling on whether to uphold the settlement. A hearing on that is expected next month and Ms Kapnick will also decide that case. BofA said: “We’re pleased with the court ruling.”Others said it was only a step in BofA’s direction. The judge’s decision “certainly shows that the [$8.5bn] settlement is effective from Bank of New York and BofA’s perspective in consolidating the actions and forcing the litigation into this one very favourable forum,” said Isaac Gradman, an attorney specialising in mortgage litigation. “But it doesn’t necessarily suggest the judge is going one way or the other in the settlement.”Baupost said in its complaint that it had told BNY Mellon, the trustee for the MBS trusts, in 2010 that it should force Countrywide to compensate the MBS holders because many of the loans underpinning the securities had breached underwriting rules.Other complainants, including the attorney-general of New York, are pursuing BofA over the MBS. While BNY Mellon reached a settlement on behalf of investors, US Bancorp sued the bank on behalf of investors in pools of mortgages for which it was trustee.
107;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-21T22:49:33Z;Aviva chief executive’s pay rises 8.5%;;The chief executive of Aviva received an 8.5 per cent increase in his total pay for 2011, a year in which shares in the FTSE 100 insurer lost about a quarter of their value.Aviva disclosed in its annual report that Andrew Moss received a total package of £2.69m, up from £2.47m in 2010. This includes bonuses and other benefits but excludes a long-term incentive plan, under which he could receive up to £3.39m in shares. Aviva said he was more likely to receive £1.47m given the performance of the company.His base salary is to rise to £1m in April. “These increases reflect his performance, experience and contribution since his appointment,” Aviva said. It noted that Mr Moss along with other executive directors requested not to receive a rise in his basic salary in 2009 and 2010.The UK’s second-biggest insurer by market capitalisation is in the middle of a strategic overhaul under Mr Moss, who became chief executive in 2007. The group is focusing on core products in markets that meet certain scale or profitability requirements.So far, Aviva has exited nine markets, most recently selling to MetLife in central and eastern Europe in January.The shares came under pressure last year as some analysts grew concerned about the impact of the eurozone debt crisis on Aviva’s investments and operations in the continent.The group took a £1.15bn hit from movements in the value of investment assets during the year, pushing pre-tax profits from continuing operations down 47 per cent to £813m. Sales of life and pension products in Europe fell 19 per cent.However, a stronger performance in its domestic market helped the group lift annual operating profits from continuing operations by 6 per cent to £2.16bn.The group has since assured investors about the impact of the eurozone debt crisis on its capital buffer and since the turn of the year the shares have rallied 17 per cent.Mr Moss received £951,000 in a base salary for 2011, plus a £1.16m bonus payment, a £480,000 pension-related payment and £98,000 in other benefits.Igal Mayer, who became the chief executive of Aviva’s European operation in January 2011, was the group’s second-highest paid executive with total remuneration of £1.69m. The pay of Patrick Regan, finance director, rose from £1.2m to £1.42m.Executive pay in the insurance industry have largely escaped the public criticism and extensive scrutiny of that in banking.
108;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-16T16:12:48Z;Relief as banks pass Fed’s stress tests;;The biggest members of the US banking industry breathed a collective sigh of relief this week, after the Federal Reserve released the results of its much-anticipated stress tests two days early.The results, published on Tuesday afternoon, showed 15 of the 19 banks involved in the exercise passing. Four banks – Ally Financial, Citigroup, MetLife and SunTrust – failed, or did not have their plans to return money to shareholders approved by the US central bank.Despite unevenness in the results, the Fed’s announcement sent bank stocks soaring, with the S&P financials index finishing up at $211.03 this week, its highest since May of last year.Banks had to prove they could maintain a core tier one capital ratio above 5 per cent of risk-weighted assets under the Fed’s hypothetical “stress scenario”, which included an economic recession and a financial system shock. Only then would the companies be allowed to pay out dividends or buy back stock – though their “capital plans” still had to be approved by the US central bank.But the 78 per cent pass rate also disguised a wide degree of variation in payout ambitions.Bank of New York Mellon and Goldman Sachs sought only modest returns to shareholders, while JPMorgan Chase said it would buy back up to $15bn of its shares and increase its dividend.Ally, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley did not seek to return money to shareholders.“All investors should care about is did we pass,” James Gorman, Morgan Stanley chief executive and chairman, said in an event hosted by Fortune magazine on Friday. “A couple of years ago very few banks could have passed.”
109;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-14T20:56:29Z;US stocks steady after bank stress tests;;The leading US banks dominated market attention for a second straight day as investors digested the results of the Federal Reserve stress tests.Citigroup and MetLife – two of the four banks that failed the stress tests – were among the main losers on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs finished down 3.4 per cent to $35.21 after being thrust back into the spotlight as a derivatives trader resigned on Wednesday and published an opinion piece in The New York Times that criticised the bank’s culture as “toxic and destructive”.Overall, the financial sector index on the S&P 500 edged up fractionally after leading the benchmark US index to its best day since November 30.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, said: “Typically, after a big run like we had yesterday, it’s natural to see some profit-taking the next day.“You are starting to see investors discriminate between large banks and between regional banks,” she added.Large banks soared in late trading on Tuesday as JPMorgan announced that it would return $15bn to shareholders and increased its dividend after passing the Fed’s tests.JPMorgan, one of 15 institutions that met the Fed’s capital requirements, added 0.5 per cent to $43.58 and is up 7.5 per cent in the past two days of trading.Citigroup, the biggest of the four banks to fail the tests, dropped 3.4 per cent to $35.21 and has lost more than half of its gains from Tuesday’s surge.Vivek Juneja, analyst at JPMorgan, downgraded shares in Citigroup from “buy” to “hold” on news that the bank would be unable to return money to shareholders under the Fed’s restrictions for banks that fail the stress tests.“Increased capital return in 2012 has been one of the key tenets to our ‘buy’ rating on Citigroup …Valuation remains attractive but we see limited upside in the near term until Citigroup can begin to return capital,” he said.MetLife, another of the banks to fall foul of the Fed’s tests, was the leading loser on the financial sector index, down 5.83 per cent to $37.16.Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays, said: “This outcome [of the stress tests] was not expected, particularly after we met with MetLife last week and is challenging for the company.”SunTrust, which also failed the tests, climbed 4.6 per cent to $23.61. The bank said in a statement that it expected earnings for the first quarter of 2012 to beat initial estimates.Zions Bancorporation soared 10.5 per cent to $21.58 as the bank said it planned to issue $600m in senior debt to help repay $1.4bn in US government bailout funds.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,394.28, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 per cent to 13,194.10, led higher by Bank of America.The bank, which passed the tests but said it would not return money to shareholders at present, climbed 4.1 per cent to $8.84 with its shares now up more than 59 per cent in the year to date.American Express was the second-leading gainer on the index, up 3.5 per cent to $56.15. The world’s third-largest payment networks company said it would boost dividends by 11 per cent to 20 cents and buy back up to $5bn of shares.The Walt Disney Company was leading the fallers, down 1.2 per cent to $43.48. Earthmover Caterpillar dropped 0.9 per cent to $112.27.The Dow Jones Transportation Average was down 1.4 per cent to 5,180.39 as gas prices hit a record for 2012. The average price of regular unleaded gas struck $3.81 with its impact taking a toll on airlines and rail companies.Southwest Airlines was the worst off among airlines, down 2.7 per cent to $8.18. United Continental Holdings, the parent company of United Airlines, fell 2.1 per cent to $19.42, and Delta Air Lines shed 0.1 per cent to $9.30.Norfolk Southern Corporation, the Virginia-based railroad company, dropped 3.1 per cent to $64.95. Rail-based transportation supplier CSX Corporation fell 2.9 per cent to $20.20.The Nasdaq Composite index was up fractionally to 3,040.73 as Apple continued to add to its gains.The most heavily weighted stock on the index climbed again into record territory, gaining 3.8 per cent to $589.58. David Evanston, analyst at Canaccord, raised the 12-month price target for Apple to $710.“Since we attended the iPad launch last week, our checks have indicated record pre-orders with wait times for shipping iPad models now reaching 2-3 weeks …Apple remains a top pick,” he said.Netflix, the streaming and home DVD delivery provider, fell 2.3 per cent to $103.90. Its shares were hit by news that Walmart would let customers buy online access to movies they have already purchased.
110;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-14T00:14:04Z;Banks pass but Fed test comes under fire;;The US banking system is safe. That was the overall message from the Federal Reserve, which sparked a rally in bank stocks on anticipation of higher dividends and share buybacks.Banks were forced to submit detailed capital plans to the Fed, setting out how they would survive an unemployment rate of 13 per cent amid a severe global recession. If banks could not demonstrate a 5 per cent ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets they would not be allowed to pay higher dividends.The Fed also included a “global financial market shock” for six of the banks – Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo. Results showed the six banks posting a median $17.01bn worth of trading and counterparty-related losses – slightly higher than in 2009.Controversy still swirls around the Fed’s process. The American Bankers Association said “it unjustifiably prohibits some institutions from paying dividends to shareholders and could potentially impair their ability to raise capital and make loans”.Hawkish critics say the opposite. “The tests have been perverted into a mechanism for the biggest banks to pay out billions in capital, which makes them less likely to survive the next economic crisis,” said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an organisation that campaigns for stricter financial regulation.Aside from the broad theme, on an individual level the results for the banks diverged into good, bad and ugly.Leading the positive results and supercharging the late market rally was JPMorgan’s announcement of a $15bn share buyback programme – significantly larger than analysts had expected.BofA passed the 5 per cent test and beat JPMorgan and Citi after planned dividends and buybacks were taken into account. BofA did not ask for a dividend increase after last year being the only bank to have a dividend request refused.But Citi, which has said it plans to return capital to shareholders this year, was the only bank other than Morgan Stanley whose projected loss rate on its pool of assets rose compared with 2009, when the Fed last released so much data on bank safety. Fed examiners project that a downturn could erase 11.2 per cent from Citi’s portfolio, compared with 10.9 per cent projected last time.Citi’s core capital ratio to risk-weighted assets was 4.9 per cent after its dividend payout plan. It can shave its ambitions for capital distribution and the new plan should be approved. The Fed said it would respond to a revamped capital plan within 75 days.“This is a departure from last year’s stress test which was binary, with a bank receiving a objection or non-objection, without the ability to resubmit if the capital plan was objected to,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday.The only ugly result was Ally Financial. The company, which had no hope of increasing its payout, reached only 2.5 per cent of core capital to risk-weighted assets under the stress scenario. Ally, which is majority-owned by the US government, will have to come up with a convincing plan, which is expected to include the sale of a mortgage subsidiary.The Fed faces questions about its processes, not least over the communication of the results, which was brought forward two days.Some in the industry have more fundamental concerns. In unusually tough language dealing with a regulatory issue, Citi said it did not understand the Fed’s stress loss models. “We strongly encourage the public release of these models and the associated benchmarks and assumptions,” it said in a statement.MetLife, the insurance group that is assessed under the process because it is structured as a bank holding company, went even further. “We do not believe that the bank-centric methodologies used under the [tests] are appropriate for insurance companies, which operate under a different business model than banks,” said Steven Kandarian, chief executive. The insurance company plans to escape the process by getting rid of its bank holding company.Additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour in Washington
111;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
112;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-13T23:43:14Z;Banks shored up by stress test success;;Big US banks are set to return money to shareholders after the Federal Reserve released the results of “stress tests” on 19 financial groups showing that all but four – including Citigroup – had passed the exercise.Results of the test, which were rushed out two days early after the Fed said it was concerned about information leaking, sparked a rally in US bank stocks. The S&P financials index rose 3.9 per cent and is now more than 18 per cent higher for the year, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America leading the way. Citigroup rose 6.3 per cent before the market close, but fell close to 4 per cent after hours as it became clear the bank had failed.Tuesday’s decision by the Fed is a disappointment to Citi, which had pledged to increase its dividend above a notional 1 cent a share for the first time since its near collapse during the financial crisis. “We intend to move forward with some force in 2012,” Dick Parsons, Citi’s chairman, had told the Financial Times on Friday. However, Citi said on Tuesday after narrowly failing the test that it planned to submit a new capital plan to the Fed, which could pave the way for later payouts.Most of the 19 largest US banks were allowed to distribute more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. JPMorgan announced on Tuesday it would buy back up to $15bn of its stock, more than analysts had expected, and increase its dividend. Wells Fargo announced its dividend would almost double.Bank of America, which suffered reputational damage last year when its plan to pay a dividend was vetoed, passed the test but had not asked permission to increase its payout. Other than Citi, MetLife, SunTrust and Ally Financial could not demonstrate that their core tier one capital ratios would remain above the required 5 per cent of risk-weighted assets under a Fed “stress scenario”.The Fed told large banks to assess how their balance sheets would cope with a severe global recession, including a 13 per cent US unemployment rate, precipitous declines in stock markets and house prices, and the sort of “market shock” that might be caused by a collapsing European bank.Only if they showed that their core capital levels would remain above 5 per cent of risk-weighted assets were the banks allowed to increase their payouts to shareholders.With many banks around the world concentrating on raising capital levels, the Fed’s decision to allow a broader distribution from US groups is controversial. Some academics argue that dividends should not be increased until banks have reached the new tougher capital levels prescribed by the Basel III agreement of international regulators.“Independent of these stress test results, the dividends are misguided, period,” said Anat Admati, professor at Stanford University. “The banks want it but that’s not enough justification.”But Fed officials believe that the tests are suitably stringent and that only healthy banks will be allowed to release capital to shareholders.Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two of the more trading-focused banks included in the stress test group, said the Fed had approved their capital plans.For Goldman the plans include repurchasing common stock and a “potential increase” in its quarterly dividend. For Morgan Stanley they include “the potential cash acquisition of an additional 14 per cent of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney”, but no dividend increase or share buybacks.Steven Kandarian, MetLife’s chief executive, criticised the Fed for using “bank-centric methodologies” which he said were not appropriate for insurers. MetLife had requested approval for $2bn in stock repurchases and an increase in its annual dividend from 74 cents per share to $1.10.The company said it “continues on track” to cease being a bank holding company in the second quarter.The surge in financial stocks helped propel the S&P 500 1.8 per cent higher, its best one-day gain since the end of November.With additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie and Telis Demos in New York.
113;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-03-08T19:21:01Z;Aviva insists capital buffer is secure;;Aviva, the insurer, has assuaged investor concerns that the eurozone debt crisis has taken a heavy toll on its capital buffer, disclosing a 50 per cent jump in its surplus within two months.Corporate and sovereign bond prices in Mediterranean markets moved in Aviva’s favour, pushing the insurer’s capital levels above those required by regulators from £2.2bn at the turn of the year to £3.3bn by end of February.Since the height of the financial crisis, the amount of capital held by insurance companies became less of a concern for investors. But some analysts grew concerned by Aviva’s position after its buffer dropped by a third in the third quarter.Reassurance on Thursday about the volatile measure alleviated disappointment over the full-year results, including a weaker-than-expected dividend increase of 2 per cent to 26p.Sales of life and pension products in Europe fell 19 per cent but a stronger performance in its domestic market helped Aviva lift annual operating profits from continuing operations by 6 per cent to £2.16bn.Under a strategic overhaul by Andrew Moss, who became chief executive in 2007, Aviva is focusing on core products in markets that meet certain scale or profitability requirements.Aviva sees 12 countries – in Europe and also the US, China and India – as core, although Mr Moss indicated on Thursday the group might also retain its business in Singapore, not previously on the list. So far, Aviva has exited nine markets, most recently selling to MetLife in central and eastern Europe in January.“There’s a bit more to do and we would hope to get that done this year,” Mr Moss said. The group is still eyeing a sale of some of its remaining operations across the Asia-Pacific region.Aviva, the UK’s second-biggest insurer by market capitalisation, took a £1.15bn hit from movements in the value of investment assets during the year compared with £479m in 2010. This was the biggest factor in a 47 per cent drop in 2011 pre-tax profits from continuing operations to £813m, on gross written premiums that fell 6 per cent to £30bn.Including discontinued operations – such as Delta Lloyd in the Netherlands, in which Aviva has been cutting its stake – pre-tax profits dropped from £2.44bn to £87m. Diluted earnings per share fell from 49.6p to 5.7p. The results in Europe contrasted with UK fortunes, where operating profit in life and general insurance improved by 8 and 11 per cent, respectively.Mr Moss said the UK insurance industry had been “lobbying hard” to ensure a shake-up of European regulations would not leave it at a competitive disadvantage to rivals.Aviva shares rose 1.6 per cent to 356.8p. That keeps them trading at a significant discount to net asset value per share – an important valuation metric in the insurance sector – of 457p.
114;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-02-16T00:31:05Z;MetLife eager to use reserve capital;;Shares in MetLife hit a four-month high as the insurer said it was preparing to return more capital to shareholders or make an acquisition once it was no longer under the oversight of the Federal Reserve.The company has fallen under the Fed’s supervision, designated as a systemically important financial institution as part of the Dodd-Frank Act because it is a bank holding company with more than $50bn in assets. That has limited its flexibility to use its cash because such groups must receive Fed approval for distributions.But MetLife is moving to loosen the Fed’s grip. In December it sold its banking unit to GE Capital, with the deal expected to close later this year. It is also now winding down its mortgage origination business, for which it failed to find a seller.Steven Kandarian, chief executive, said on Wednesday at an insurance industry conference that MetLife could begin to return capital later this year, once the GE Capital deal closed, expected in the second quarter, and its January filings to the Fed have been reviewed, likely in March.“We have excess capital [that] we’ve been trying wildly to return to shareholders. But we have an impediment right now. We have to go through a capital plan process with the Federal Reserve,” Mr Kandarian said.He added: “We also want some dry powder in case of opportunistic acquisitions in markets we are seeking to grow in.” Last year, MetLife bought Alico, a unit of AIG, for $16.3bn, and has said it has $3bn-$4bn to spend on further international expansion.MetLife could still be deemed systemically important by the Fed as the US’s largest life assurer. But that status would not likely begin until 2013, as regulators are still formulating such rules. Even in that case, it would still have a window between the closing of its bank sale and 2013 to return capital.In the meantime, its limbo status has weighed on its share price. MetLife is down 14.8 per cent since the beginning of last year, versus a 6.1 per cent decline in the KBW Insurance index.But with the sale of the bank, MetLife has begun to rebound. It ended the session on Wednesday with its highest close since August, up 1.5 per cent to $37.89. The shares are up 21.5 per cent so far in 2012, versus a 9.5 per cent gain in the KBW index.The company is in the middle of a transition from life assurer to a more diversified insurance business, planning to reduce its sales of some annuity products. It is still seeking a permanent chief financial officer.It reported fourth-quarter operating earnings from non-divested businesses grew 17 per cent from a year ago, at $1.4bn, versus $1.2bn. That excluded a $1.5bn gain from derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk.
115;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-02-07T23:20:53Z;Stockpickers ride again as investors hunt value;;The recent demise of “risk-on, risk-off” style trading across markets is welcome news to the battered ranks of stockpickers.Buying cheaply priced or “value” stocks has been a fruitless endeavour since 2008 as the financial crisis and eurozone debt problems have overpowered any sustained focus upon company fundamentals, the tenet of stock investing.Now doing your homework and buying undervalued or cheap stocks is finally paying off as equity volatility has dropped sharply against the backdrop of better US data and massive liquidity efforts by the European Central Bank.The risk, stockpickers acknowledge, is that the return of “risk-on, risk-off” could be around the corner. Just as the ECB’s offer of long-term loans has been a balm for markets so far this year, a messy Greek default or another macro event could yet trigger a significant sell-off.But for now, the turnround in value is eye catching and comes after some notable value investors such as Bill Miller of Legg Mason, threw in the towel last year.So far this year, the S&P Value index has rallied 8 per cent, ahead of the S&P 500’s rise of 7.1 per cent and the 6.5 per cent gain for the S&P Growth index.For investors in the Fairholme Fund, managed by Bruce Berkowitz, a leading value proponent, 2012 has already delivered a gain of 16.4 per cent, after its performance was crushed 32.4 per cent last year. However, many investors missed the rebound: Fairholme’s assets under management of $7.4bn are less than half what they were a year ago.The game changer has been the 25 per cent drop in equity volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix, which currently trades below a reading of 20, indicative of low stress levels.“Now at least for the moment, we seem to have a capital market that actually cares about fundamentals rather than the monotonous cadence of ‘risk-on, risk-off’,” says Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. “It is a sign that portfolio managers are actually taking the time to assess what sectors and stocks hold the most promise and investing accordingly.”Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says: “Stockpicking is coming back.”Given the significant underperformance of value stocks in recent years, the stage may be set for a strong run should macro risk from China to Europe remain contained.The return of stockpicking and lower volatility has been accompanied by a sharp decline in trading volumes of exchange-traded funds, which fell to a four-year low in January. Declining use of what are essentially indexing products comes as no surprise with stockpicking back in favour.“Less volatility and improving investor confidence results in a more deliberate and discerning approach to buying stocks,” says Mr Paulsen.In turn, actively managed funds are leaving passive index funds behind so far this year. According to Birinyi Associates, the fifty largest actively managed domestic equity funds have beaten the S&P 500 by 1.24 percentage points in the year to date, which equates to an excess return of $12bn.Leading the value charge have been financials, where fears of being exposed to contagion from a meltdown among eurozone banks crushed the sector last year.Now the S&P financials sector has recovered sharply, up 12.6 per cent in 2012 and moreover its price-to-book ratio is back above 1, or equal to the value of the sector’s stated assets. The ratio is up from under 0.9 at the start of the year. Historically, such a low price to book ratio has attracted value investors who patiently bide their time waiting for vindication.Phil Orlando, who manages a portfolio for Federated Investors, added to an existing position in JPMorgan and purchased shares in Wells Fargo at the start of January.Those two stocks have rallied 13.9 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively this year, matching the sector, but lagging Bank of America’s 41 per cent year to date return by a distance.Yet it is still hard to find a value manager who has made the plunge into BofA stock, despite an enticing market capitalisation, which is just 37 per cent of its book value. Concerns about financial regulation remain high for the sector.“Stockpicking is not simply about attractive valuations,” says Mr Orlando. “We’re intentionally sticking to higher quality names – it may give less upside, but it allows us to sleep at night.”Mark Luschini, chief investment officer at Janney Montgomery Scott, has also looked at BofA, but instead opted for life insurers Prudential Financial and MetLife.“With new regulation and reduced leverage, the business model of banks may have changed irrevocably,” Mr Luschini says. “Whereas the big life insurers remain great diversified companies, and this is a historically rare opportunity to pick them up below book value.”Such blue-chip stocks that also pay solid dividends are highly attractive in a world where the US 10-year Treasury yield remains below 2 per cent, evidence that the bond market and the Federal Reserve remain cognisant that macro risk events still loom this year.In this environment, Oliver Pursche, a portfolio manager at Gary Goldberg Financial Services, prefers to focus on balance sheet strength and is enticed by the estimated $2tn in cash sitting on the balance sheet of US non-financials.Mr Pursche initiated a position in Microsoft, a company with $50bn in cash or short-term investments, in early December. Microsoft increased its dividend by 20 per cent and supported its share price with $2bn of share repurchases in the second half of 2011, and its shares have rallied 18.7 per cent to $30.35, since December.Value investors are also starting to spread their wings. Highly cyclical material stocks, which have climbed 12.4 per cent this year but are among the most vulnerable to a global slowdown, are beginning to attract attention, despite weaker balance sheets.Mr Pursche has been building a position in Cliffs Natural Resources, a coal miner heavily exposed to China. Cliffs has rallied 21.1 per cent this year to $75.51 after slumping more than 30 per cent in the second half of 2011 as fears over China slowing sharply have abated lately.“Our strategy is generally to buy globally diversified blue chips that yield high dividends, and our clients are comfortable with that, but some stocks have been beaten down so much, the valuations are compelling,” Mr Pursche says.Valuations meant precious little in 2011, but following January’s impressive run, stockpickers are hoping they continue to be a strong guide to performance in 2012.“If this trend continues, it is unalloyed good news for active managers, provided of course they get their calls correct,” says Mr Colas.
116;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-02-02T18:29:23Z;Allstate shifts to alternative assets;;Low interest rates are prompting Allstate, the US consumer insurance group, to “get creative” in its portfolio to generate returns in its investment products business.The company on Thursday told analysts that it is shifting some of its fixed-income security investments into alternative assets such as resources, infrastructure, real estate and stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds, in order to generate the yield necessary to match its long-term liabilities.“We have to get creative in the way we manage the investment portfolio,” said Matthew Winter, chief executive of Allstate Financial, the company’s annuity and life insurance business, on an earnings call.Allstate has been shrinking the balance sheet of its financial unit by shifting out of annuities, a retirement product that pays out cash over time and generates interest rate risk for the insurer, and more toward life insurance products that do not have interest rate, or “spread”, risk.The move matches a broader shift by US insurers, which have struggled to earn returns on annuity products. MetLife, the US’s largest insurer by market capitalisation, has said it plans to reduce variable annuity sales by 35 per cent this year, and Canada’s Sun Life has said it will discontinue new sales on the products in the US.“[We] feel pretty confident that with the change in the mix of business, growing the mortality and morbidity non-spread related businesses, as well as the alternative kind of pension investment strategy for long-term liabilities on the pay-out side, it leaves us with …some targeted good return investment assets,” said Mr Winter.Allstate’s $95.6bn investment portfolio returned 6.6 per cent in 2011, versus 8.6 per cent in 2010 and 10.8 per cent in 2009, in part reflecting Allstate Financial’s smaller balance sheet.The biggest change in the portfolio in the fourth quarter versus a year ago was a 5 per cent decline in holdings of US Treasury and other government notes, plus a 2 per cent drop in other short-term paper. By contrast, the allocation to corporate bonds rose from 38 per cent to 46 per cent.This tracks with the Federal Reserve’s move hold core rates near-zero until 2014, in order to generate investment activity while the global economy languishes.Allstate’s net income in the fourth quarter doubled to $724m as it raised rates on homeowners and auto owners and released reserves. Insurers are broadly enjoying the relief of better weather, as they recorded massive losses in the first half of the year amid a record number of $1bn disasters.“With a sustained low interest environment, it means that core returns on underwritten products need to offset that headwind,” said Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays Capital.
117;MET;Metlife Inc;2012-01-30T18:46:07Z;Aviva Investors to cut staff in focus shift;;Aviva Investors is to shed more than a 10th of its workforce as the asset management arm of the UK insurer moves away from active equity management to focus instead on “core” areas such as fixed income.About 160 employees, mostly in London, were told on Monday they would lose their jobs when the group closes its UK-based European, emerging markets, global and “sustainable responsible investments” equities desks.Aviva said it had taken the step in response to the economic downturn, which had resulted in a “reduced appetite for riskier assets such as equities, notably in Europe” from clients.Analysts said the retrenchment by Aviva Investors – which has about £270bn of assets under management – underscored the difficulties some insurers have had in competing with established City fund managers in areas outside their core expertise.Marcus Barnard, analyst at Oriel Securities, said: “They never really seemed to get it going properly. It’s hard in investment management to get there and stay up there.”He added that the asset management business was “a bit of an Achilles heel for Aviva in that it doesn’t generate a significant amount of profit, while attempts to invest and grow the business don’t seem to have yielded results. It has struggled to become a convincing third-party asset manager”.The planned staff cuts, which are subject to a period of consultation, come after Aviva Investors’ chief executive Alain Dromer led a review of the business.“The business review concluded that our strategy is broadly right but, faced with a tougher external environment and at the same time wanting to continue to invest for the future success of the business, we propose to reduce our cost base by focusing on our main strengths,” he said in a statement.He added that the move would create a “stronger, leaner and more focused business” focused on fixed income, real estate and “multi-asset investment”.Aviva Investors’ move comes after Liverpool Victoria, one of the UK’s largest mutual insurers, last year agreed to Threadneedle taking over the running of its investment arm, which had about £8bn of funds under management.Eamonn Flanagan, analyst at Shore Capital, said: “I would expect the trend to continue. The word here is focus.”Aviva Investors was launched in 2008, combining the group’s disparate investment operations around the world into one global division.Separately on Monday, Aviva also announced the sale to US insurer MetLife of its life and pensions operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.The disposal of these businesses, which have total net assets of about €57m, are part of Aviva’s strategy of refocusing on core markets and concentrating on its most profitable operations.Aviva shares closed down 3.8 per cent at 342.7p on Monday.
118;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-12-27T21:44:35Z;Sears slump weighs on Wall Street;;The market capitalisation of Sears Holdings fell by more than a quarter yesterday after the company said it would close as many as 120 Kmart and Sears stores after sales of consumer electronics declined in the holiday shopping period.Sears’ shares tumbled 27.2 per cent to $33.38, their lowest level since early 2009.The decision to close stores came after comparable same-store sales for the eight weeks to December 25 fell 5.2 per cent across the group compared with the same period in 2010.The closures will generate $140m to $170m of cash from sales of inventory and the leasing or sales of the locations, the company said in a statement.But that was a drop in the ocean compared to non-cash charges of $1.6bn to $1.8bn that the company said it will book as a result of the poor sales performance.Wall Street opened lowered on the Sears’ announcement and an unexpectedly large fall in the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities. But stocks rallied after a survey of consumer confidence report jumped almost ten points from its November level to 64.5.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day almost back where they started. The S&P was up just 0.01 per cent to 1,265.43 and the Dow edged down 0.02 per cent to 12,291.35Homebuilder stocks are among the best performers in the S&P 500 in the quarter to date, and share prices were little affected by the Case-Schiller data.Lennar was off just 0.4 per cent to $19.30, DR Horton fell 0.8 per cent to $12.35 and PulteGroup close 0.5 per cent lower at $6.05.The Nasdaq Composite index closed up 0.3 per cent to 2,625.2, helped by strong performances by Apple and Google, the two most heavily weighted stocks in the index.Apple was up 0.8 per cent $406.53 and Google climbed 1.1 per cent to $640.25 on reports that 6.8m Apple iPhone and Google Android smartphones were activated on Christmas day, more than double the previous daily record of 2.8m on 25 December 2010.Mead Johnson Nutrition climbed 5.8 per cent to $69.08, recovering some ground from a 10 per cent sell-off in the week before Christmas.The company said it had conducted tests on samples of its Enfamil powdered baby food formula, tied to a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the death of a newborn baby in Missouri, and found no presence of bacteria.Computer Sciences Corp fell 9 per cent to $24.10 after the company withdrew its 2012 financial guidance and said it stood to lose up to $1.5bn after the UK government scrapped the company’s contract to build an electronic patient records database.Stocks with exposure to internet gambling continued to benefit from reports at the end of last week that the Obama administration intended to make it easier for US states to legalise internet poker and certain other online betting.International Game Technology, which sells computerised gaming equipment, climbed 5 per cent to $17.37 and casino chain Wynn Resorts was up 3.2 per cent to $113.53.Shares in dishwasher manufacturer Whirlpool fell 8.9 per cent to $46.62. The share price hit a 52-week low last week, and that appears to have triggered more selling, which had an exaggerated impact amid light trading volumes, traders said.Banks underperformed the wider market with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 0.7 per cent, far more than any other broad S&P 500 sector.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $15.29 and Bank of America was off 2.1 per cent to $5.48.MetLife climbed 0.3 per cent to $31.20 as the life insurer said its retail deposit business would be acquired by General Electric financial services division.The business has $7.5bn in customer funds and an online banking platform. General Electric shares were off 1.2 per cent to $18.01.The deal should mean MetLife avoids some regulations faced by banks under the Dodd-Frank financial reform passed last year.Bank stocks have weighed on the S&P 500 throughout the year, and the financial sector is set to end 2011 17.7 per cent lower than it started – easily the worst performing sector in the benchmark US index.Once dividends are included, only financials and materials have failed to deliver a positive return in 2011, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.The CBOE Vix index of volatility edged up for the first time in a week, climbing 5.3 per cent to 21.83, although Wall Street’s “fear gauge” remained well below the elevated levels of the summer, during which it touched a high of 48.00.
119;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-12-27T18:34:09Z;MetLife sells bank deposits to GE Capital;;MetLife has agreed to sell most of its bank deposit business to GE Capital as the US life assurer tries to avoid heightened oversight by the Federal Reserve.The company will sell about $7.5bn of its roughly $10.7bn in US deposits to GE Capital, the two firms announced on Tuesday. MetLife will transfer the rest of its deposits from its bank to other units of the company over the next six months, it said.“[This] agreement is a significant step towards MetLife’s no longer being a bank holding company,” said Steven Kandarian, MetLife chief executive.GE Capital also acquired MetLife’s online banking platform as the commercial lender’s GE Capital Financial bank attempts to establish an internet retail deposit-gathering presence. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Both sides hope to obtain regulatory approval by the end of the second quarter.“This acquisition fits with our plans to launch a US deposit platform,” said Dan Henson, GE Capital chief executive of the Americas. “It accelerates our timing, helps us build a stronger and more cost efficient funding base, and allows us to better serve our middle market commercial customers.”The sale comes as MetLife clashes with Fed supervision. The life assurer is automatically designated as a systemically significant financial institution by virtue of being a bank holding company with more than $50bn in assets, as a result of last year’s Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law.With $785bn in assets, the insurer is the seventh-largest US bank holding company. It is more than twice as big as large regional lenders US Bancorp and PNC.That has led to increased oversight by Fed examiners, who have subjected MetLife to so-called “stress tests” to gauge its financial health and have final say over MetLife’s plans to buy back shares or distribute dividends to shareholders.In June, C. Robert Henrikson, MetLife chairman, told analysts that if the company’s status as a bank holding company continued to subject it to heightened oversight “of course we would consider selling the bank”. The next month MetLife announced it was exploring a sale of its banking business.In October, the Fed denied the insurer’s request to increase its dividend and resume stock repurchases. At the time, Mr Kandarian said he was “disappointed” with the Fed’s decision, and reiterated the company’s plan to cease being a bank holding company.“This is essential to ensure that MetLife operates on a level playing field with other insurance companies,” Mr Kandarian said in October.GE Capital has been trying to diversify its funding in the aftermath of the financial crisis, when the company required extraordinary support from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.With $571bn in assets, GE Capital would be the eighth-largest US lender if it was a bank.Without a significant amount of deposits, the lender is dependent on issuing debt and commercial paper to fund itself.GE Capital executives said in December they were trying to establish a retail deposit-taking institution in the US to diversify its funding. The MetLife deal was a step in that direction, the company said.
120;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-12-05T15:28:17Z;Medical technology companies lead Wall St rally;Financial sector surges on possible Eurozone deal;Healthcare stocks bounced back from Friday’s big sell-off but analysts remained concerned that government healthcare schemes may limit expensive cardiovascular and orthopedic treatments.Hospital manager Tenet Healthcare jumped 12.4 per cent to $4.70, reversing nearly all of its losses from Friday, when Wells Fargo analysts had said 11 different states will study heart, knee and spine cases before agreeing to pay for hospital stays and treatments.Nuvasive, which manufactures equipment for spinal surgery, popped 13.3 per cent to $14.53, also recovering all of Friday’s losses.St Jude Medical, Medtronic and Boston Scientific rose 3.9 per cent to $37.21, 4 per cent to $35.98 and 1.8 per cent to $5.60, respectively, but were still several percentage points lower than Friday’s opening price.Analysts were struggling to understand the implications of a pilot scheme, announced in November by the Centre for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to conduct checks before authorising some treatments in states with high levels of improper payments.Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo’s hospital analyst, said all 11 states involved in the pilot would follow the example of Florida and begin pre-auditing a wide range of treatments, forcing hospital management companies to cut back on procedures to avoid falling foul off the audit schemes.“This will likely reduce procedure volume because hospitals will begin making sure that every patient meets the coverage criteria,” Mr Biegelsen told clients.But a Credit Suisse note, arguing that the procedures in question accounted for only 1 per cent of hospital revenues helped Tenet recover losses.The CMS also refused to confirm what shape the pilot scheme would take in states other than Florida, leading other analysts to conclude the sell-off in device makers was overdone.Elsewhere, US stocks were broadly positive with the S&P 500 closing up 1 per cent to 1,257.08. The benchmark US index had been us as much as 1.5 per cent before news the Standard and Poor’s is reviewing its sovereign rating on 6 eurozone sovereigns including Germany, knocked stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 per cent to 12,097.83.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.1 per cent to 2,655.76.“Positive news flow from Europe is driving stocks,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi asset strategies at ING.“But the S&P 500 is seeing resistance at the 200-day moving average above 1,260. If you were long from the November lows, it’s a good place to take profit and, if you have money on the sidelines, it seems a bit high to be initiating new long positions,” he added.Bank stocks led the rally with the financial sector of the S&P 500 handily outperforming all other sectors with a 2.1 per cent rise.Morgan Stanley climbed 6.8 per cent to $16.57. New York-based investment bank Jefferies continued to rally, rising 4 per cent to $12.90.As recently as two weeks ago, the bank had hit year lows of $9.50 on concern about its exposures to European sovereign debt and short-term funding needs.Citigroup climbed 5.9 per cent to $29.83.Goldman Sachs financial services analyst Richard Ramsden beat the drum for US banks ahead of a Goldman banking conference this week.“Fundamentals don’t appear nearly as bad as valuations imply,” he told clients, while acknowledging that hedge funds significantly reduced their weightings to financials in the third quarter.Newfield Exploration fell 3.4 per cent to $44.03 as investors reacted guardedly to its agreement to supply Tesoro Corporation’s Salt Lake City refinery with 18,000 barrels of oil per day from 2013 from planned growth in the Uinta Basin.“Management had been flagging this announcement for a week,” said Subash Chandra, an oil analyst at Jefferies, “but when it came it was underwhelming. There’s no revenue till 2013, and we’re still waiting for updates from new fields within the basin.”Time Warner fell 1.7 per cent to $62.71 on mixed reaction to its plans to make films available for consumers to watch on any platform through a cloud verification service.Gannett climbed 10.2 per cent to $13.13 after Lazard analysts recommended clients buy the stock, tipping the media company to raise its dividend soon.“Cloud” software provider Salesforce.com was the main beneficiary of a Standard and Poor’s note forecasting a round of acquisitions in the software industry.

The largest US life insurer said 2012 earnings may reach $5.20 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $5.08 a share.Staples rallied 5.6 per cent to $15.13 after positive coverage over the weekend, which suggested that the stock could rise as high as $22 in the next year if the economy improves and companies spend more on office supplies.
121;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US lenders review military foreclosures;;"Ten leading US lenders may have unlawfully foreclosed on the mortgages of nearly 5,000 active-duty members of the US military in recent years, according to data released by a federal regulator.JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America this year reached legal settlements in which they agreed to pay damages to nearly 200 service members who claimed that their homes had been improperly seized.Data released last week by the Treasury’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, shows that 10 lenders – including BofA, but not JPMorgan, which was not part of the study – are reviewing nearly 5,000 foreclosures of homes belonging to service members and their families to see if they complied with the law.Under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act of 2003, mortgage servicers have to follow special procedures when foreclosing on homes belonging to active-duty members of the armed forces and their families. For instance, there are restrictions on so-called default judgments, in which homes are seized after the borrower fails to appear in court.In April, JPMorgan reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with members of the armed services. The bank admitted to 27 wrongful foreclosures in May. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, apologised for his bank’s errors, calling it a “painful aberration”.BofA struck a deal this year with the Department of Justice to resolve a government lawsuit alleging about 160 unlawful foreclosures. This month, the company agreed to pay each service member whose mortgage was illegally foreclosed at least $116,785, plus compensation for lost equity.US banks are facing mounting pressure from politicians, the courts and regulators over their shoddy mortgage foreclosure proceduresThe data released by the OCC are based on estimates prepared by lenders and their consultants. BofA said it is reviewing 2,400 foreclosures involving active-duty military families to see if they were conducted properly. Wells Fargo is reviewing 870 foreclosures and Citigroup is looking at 700 cases.Also under review are 575 foreclosures at OneWest, formerly known as IndyMac; 87 at HSBC; 80 at US Bancorp; 56 at Aurora, formerly known as Lehman Brothers Bank; 25 at MetLife; six at Sovereign; and three at EverBank.In response to demands by US regulators, the largest home loan companies have been reviewing foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 to ensure that borrowers of all kinds were not improperly evicted. The new data on military foreclosures could lead to a new round of lawsuits, experts said.In May, the US Government Accountability Office said it had identified 50 cases in which military borrowers were illegally foreclosed. In February, John Walsh, the acting head of the OCC, said that only a “small number” of home seizures should not have occurred.Sherrod Brown, a Democratic senator from Ohio, said last week: “I don’t know if big banks are foreclosing on military families out of carelessness or callousness, but neither is acceptable.”Dan Frahm, BofA spokesman, said: “We work hard to ensure our military customers receive high-quality service that caters to their unique needs. When we find mistakes, we address them.” Citigroup and Wells Fargo declined to comment. The OCC declined to comment.Samuel Wright, a retired member of the US Navy and director of the Service Members Law Center, said it was likely that the banks may be undercounting the number of possible evictions of US military members, adding that foreclosures on military families were “pretty prevalent” given the number of complaints he has fielded from active-duty military members.The months-long reviews by the banks’ consultants could determine that the foreclosures were done in full accordance with the law, and that none of the military borrowers were harmed.John Odom Jr, a Louisiana lawyer who represents members of the military in litigation against financial institutions, said he was doubtful banks would admit to unlawful foreclosures.“You’ve got institutions that don’t understand what the law says doing self-investigations and self-policing,” Mr Odom said. “I have very, very, very low levels of confidence that they’re going to do this right.”"
122;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-11-17T10:06:04Z;Hooked on the final salary pension;;There was a time when the final salary pension was as familiar a part of retirement as the carriage clock. Having served most of their adult life working for the same employer, retirees looked forward to enjoying a predictable, and often comfortable, income at the end of their careers.How things have changed. A final salary pension is now rare. A number of factors, including longer life expectancy, low inflation, falling stock markets and increased regulation, mean these schemes place a huge cost and administration burden on the companies that offer them.An annual survey by the National Association of Pension Funds found that in 2010 only 21 per cent of final salary schemes in the private sector remained open to new recruits, compared with 88 per cent 10 years earlier. It also reported that 17 per cent of final salary schemes had closed to both new and existing members.For those employees lucky enough still to belong to a final salary pension scheme, it is no surprise they would be reluctant to give them up. MetLife Assurance, the insurer, recently found in a survey that almost 40 per cent of members of final salary pension schemes would be reluctant to move to a new job for fear of damaging their retirement savings. It also found that more than 60 per cent of all workers would be deterred from moving to an employer offering inferior pension benefits – 26 per cent said they would not move jobs, while 36 per cent would only move if their salary increased by 10 per cent or more.“It’s a very emotive subject,” explains Emma Watkins, director of business development at MetLife Assurance. “Companies must weigh up whether they could potentially lose some of their best talent if other companies offer better pension schemes.”Further research by PwC backs this up, with 41 per cent of organisations reporting reluctance to close final salary schemes in case of potential employee unrest.This was a very real prospect at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch manufacturer of household brands. In September, union members voted to hold a ballot over industrial action after the company announced plans to close its final salary pension scheme.In the public sector, meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of workers took strike action in June to complain about planned changes to their final salary pensions.As alternatives, most organisations are in the process of moving to a defined contribution scheme, to which employees pay in part of their salary each month and the employer makes a contribution on top.This places the greater burden on the employee to save for their retirement, so shifting risk away from the company. Another option is to offer employees a defined benefit pension scheme based on their “career average” salary rather than salary at the time of retirement – an option that has been mooted for the public sector.But with so much emotion surrounding pension provision, does closing a final-salary scheme make it harder to retain good staff? According to Keith Lewis, UK managing director of Matchtech, a technical recruitment specialist, very few of his clients still offer this perk, but it is a great sales tool when they do.One company that decided to scrap its final salary pension scheme found that a lot of senior managers looked to leave and the client became less attractive to future candidates.Employers that are closing schemes need to look for alternative reward strategies if they want to prevent a drain on talent, says Paul Waters, a partner at Hymans Robertson, a pensions adviser. “There’s real nervousness as [employers] embark on a pensions closure exercise, but there are things companies can do to make the process more successful.“First, make the alternative provision attractive in your market. Not many companies will be offering defined benefit schemes to new starters, but look at what they have got. Benchmark it. This is especially important where unions are concerned, as they’ll want evidence that what you’re doing is fair.”One client working with Hymans Robertson has delayed closing its final salary scheme to existing members because it works in a competitive sector and many staff have been there for more than 10 years, so have built up valuable skills and experience.The more senior the staff, the more they have to lose if the scheme closes, suggests John Ralfe, former head of corporate finance at Boots and now an independent pensions consultant. “Some companies close the defined benefit scheme to existing members, but tier the new, defined contribution scheme so more senior staff get a higher company contribution,” he says. “Or they will tap people on the shoulder and say ‘Although we are closing the pension scheme, you are one of our key people and we don’t want you to be unhappy, so we are giving you a pay rise to compensate’.”It is not always about losing valuable senior staff, however. Because final salary schemes tend to benefit those who have served in a company for longer, there may be an element of ”irrational retention”, where a cadre of staff are simply hanging around for their pension, rather than focusing on moving the business forward.In terms of attracting candidates, it is hard to pin down the pension as the sole reason someone would move to another employer. Raj Mody, head of the pensions practice at PwC, says that while the media coverage of industrial action and the economic crisis has raised the profile of pensions in candidates’ minds, it is rarely a deal-winner at a job interview. “Do people choose to go to a job because of the pensions arrangements? The answer is no.”In a situation where there are two equally attractive jobs on the table, however, it could swing the decision. According to Matchtech consultants, some clients feel they must offer good “equivalent” benefits to lure candidates away from jobs where they have a final salary pension.One candidate asked for the amount he would have received in his final salary pension to be divided into his annual salary or given as an annual bonus. The client said no.Younger workers, perhaps in their first or second jobs, frequently have other things on their minds. “For graduates, it’s not on their radar,” says Mr Lewis. “They’re generally more interested in the basic salary and the type of work they’ll be doing, as well as career progression.”Government plans for companies to enrol staff into a pension scheme automatically from October 2012 aim to increase how much workers save for retirement, but will place an added cost and administration burden on employers. This may, in turn, affect existing schemes as companies look to make cost savings elsewhere.In the meantime, industry body NAPF is working with its members to encourage employers to raise the profile of pensions in the recruitment process so that candidates can make an informed choice: “Our research has shown that staff would like more information on pension provision, yet only a fraction of companies mention the pension in their job advertising, so there’s a mismatch,” says Darren Philp, NAPF’s head of policy.Whichever route an organisation chooses for its pension provision, it pays to communicate it clearly to both prospective and existing staff.
123;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T04:00:02+0000;Corporate default concerns rise, survey says;Respondents most negative since June 2009;Credit portfolio managers at banks, insurance companies and investment funds around the world have grown increasingly concerned about a rise in corporate defaults amid uncertainty surrounding the financial health of peripheral countries and banks in Europe, a new survey has shown.Some 66 per cent of the surveyed members of the International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers (IACPM), an organisation of managers at 92 institutions in 17 countries, said that they expected an increase in corporate defaults in Europe over the next year. Respondents were largely split over the direction of default rates in the US, with 47 per cent bracing for an uptick and 41 per cent expecting that default rates would be static.Default expectations were generally the most negative that they have been since June 2009, said Som-lok Leung, executive director of IACPM, whose members include large banks like Bank of America and Commerzbank, MetLife and other insurance companies and funds such as BlueMountain Capital.“The lack of clarity over the European sovereign debt crisis is causing a ripple effect over corporates,” Mr Leung said. “If [Europe] does not get fixed, the effects could be pretty dramatic. When you manage a credit portfolio, you are managing that long tail of downside risk.”Banks and investors manage that risk mostly by hedging with derivatives, selling loans or other securities, holding smaller amounts of risky investments or demanding higher interest rates, Mr Leung said.Spreads, or risk premiums, on corporate debt have risen during the past few months as problems mounted in Europe and the outlook on the US economy soured.Asia, however, is seen as insulated from Europe’s problems. Only 29 per cent of respondents expected corporate defaults to rise in Asia, while 54 per cent expected them to be stable.The trailing 12-month global speculative default rate finished the third quarter at 1.8 per cent, down from 2.3 per cent in the second quarter, according to Moody’s Investors Service. In the US, the default rate was 2 per cent and it was 1.4 per cent in Europe, both below historical averages. Moody’s does not calculate corporate default rates for Asia.In a sign of potential stress, Moody’s speculative-grade distressed index, which measures the percentage of issuers with ratings below investment grade whose debt trades at risk premiums of more than 10 percentage points above the benchmark, surged to nearly 25 per cent in the third quarter from 9.5 per cent in the second quarter.

Mr Spahr lowered 2012 and 2013 earnings estimates for Franklin Resources by 12 per cent “to reflect much lower average AUM than expected”.Franklin Resources fell 2.9 per cent to $96.85. Legg Mason fell 1.3 per cent to $26.80. BlackRock fell 1.4 per cent to $153.06 and Federated Investors fell 2.4 per cent to $17.72. But some analysts said Franklin Resources’ woes might not be mirrored at other firms.“Asset declines at Franklin were mainly down to the performance of the Templeton Global Bond Fund, mainly invested in international bonds, which have been hit by emerging market currency weakness,” said Jeff Hopson, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “There’s really not much read-across to domestic fixed income funds,” he added.The broad S&P 500 eked out a 0.1 per cent rise to close at 1,195.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 11,416.3 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.7 per cent to 2,583.03.But after hours, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, marked the start of the quarterly earnings season by missing forecasts for the first time in four quarters. Alcoa reported earnings per share of 14 cents excluding restructuring costs, compared with analyst expectations of 22 cents. The stock was down in after-hours trading.Insurers were among the biggest beneficiaries of another Europe-fuelled rally. Genworth Financial, which sells a consumer debt insurance product in Europe, was up 3.1 per cent to $5.62. Fears that Europe’s financial crisis could herald a spike in unemployment, and lead to pay-outs on the policy, have weighed on Genworth’s stock price.Lincoln National rose 1.9 per cent to $16.34, and MetLife was up 0.6 per cent to $30.58, as the insurance sector rallied on hopes that European equity assets may recover in value.Derivative exchanges sold off, with CME Group down 3.4 per cent to $257 and IntercontinentalExchange off 2.3 per cent to $123.10, though analysts struggled to explain the moves.The New York Stock Exchange was up 2.3 per cent to $26.46, tracking its potential merger partner, German exchange Deutsche Börse, which rose 1.4 per cent while German markets were open.Fashion group Nordstrom was down 2.8 per cent to $49.26, after a filing showed executives had sold shares last week.Video streaming service Netflix continued its downward momentum, falling 2.7 per cent to $108.66. On Monday the company reversed a previous decision to hive off its DVD delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster, but did not row back on a 60 per cent price rise for the joint DVD and streaming service.Fertiliser maker Mosaic Company rose 4.3 per cent to $55.77 after Credit Suisse increased its estimates for fertiliser prices, citing strong demand for grain.Reits fell, with Equity Residential down 3.1 per cent to $52.91 and AvalonBay Communities falling 2.2 per cent to $118.50.Store chain 99 Cents Only Stores rose 4.4 per cent to $21.39 after agreeing to a $1.6bn cash takeover by alternative asset manager Ares Management and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

125;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-09-19T21:04:56Z;Defence stocks diverge on M&A talk;;Goodrich Corp jumped 15.8 per cent to $107.60 on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation is preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer.Indications last week that Connecticut-based UTC was raising an acquisitions war chest had sent several shares in potential targets in the defence industry soaring.On Monday shares in Rockwell Collins, down 4.2 per cent to $53.87, and Textron, off 5.7 per cent at $17.57, dropped back, as UTC appeared to focus on Goodrich.Some analysts warned that those stocks could continue to see large swings, until UTC confirms an acquisition of Goodrich, but there seemed little prospect of HTC bidding for more than one company at once.“Buying Goodrich would take UTC’s net debt from 20 per cent to almost 50 per cent of market capitalisation. If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.
126;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-08-31T11:00:58Z;Pension falls lead people to work longer;Retirement income has decreased by 2 per cent;More people are planning to ask their employer if they can continue working past retirement, amid fears that they have not saved enough to stop working and live comfortably.One in four people aged over 60 still in employment has asked their employers if they can continue to work after the official retirement age of 65, while a further 26 per cent are intending to do so, according to research from MetLife, the pension provider.A third of those hoping to work beyond 65 said they needed to have more time to build up their retirement savings, with 45 per cent saying they could not afford to retire.From October this year, the default retirement age - a law that allowed employers to force people to retire at age 65 - is being phased out, meaning that people can continue working as long as they like.But fewer people in the MetLife survey wanted to work full-time into their late 60s. Just 28 per cent wanted to stay full-time in their current job, while 40 per cent wanted to stay in their job but work part-time. A further 11 per cent said they wanted to move employers.The survey, which questioned 1,000 non-retired UK adults over the age of 60, also found that women were less likely to be able to afford to retire than men.Women are more likely to have gaps in their retirement savings due to periods out of the workplace while having children. While 42 per cent of men said they could not afford to retire at 65, this rose to 50 per cent of women.A separate study this week warned that retirement prospects for UK workers had declined in the past three months due to a combination of falls in the stock market and lower annuity rates.Aon Hewitt found that expected retirement income had decreased by 2 per cent for those aged 60 and 65, and by 4 per cent for those aged 30 since May.But the consultants said that the figures should not deter people from savings towards their retirement.“While market fluctuations can affect the expected retirement income, they should not be considered as a major distraction, as pensions are a long-term investment vehicle,” said John Foster, benefits consultant.“There is always a degree of risk involved in seeking higher returns, and it is important not to over-react to these short-term fluctuations. This is particularly relevant for members who are 20, 30 or 40 years away from retirement.”
127;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-08-03T23:33:32Z;US insurers release mixed results;;"Prudential Financial, the US insurance group, reported increased core profits of $831m for the second quarter on Wednesday as revenues were boosted by two acquisitions and a sharp increase in the value of annuity accounts.Shares in Prudential, the second-biggest insurer after MetLife, rose $0.72, or 1.7 per cent, in after-hours trading to $57.60. The net profit of $831m increased from $798m a year earlier. On an operating basis, earnings per share were $1.71; analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $1.55 a share.Prudential said its profits for the three months to the end of June were helped by revenue from AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life, both bought in February from AIG, the US insurer, which reports its own earnings on Thursday.“Our organic business growth in US and international markets is bolstered by the expanded distribution opportunities and client base from the Star and Edison businesses we acquired in Japan earlier this year, with business integration on track,” said John Strangfeld, chief executive.The increased core profit excludes Prudential’s “closed block” of legacy business. Including that, profit declined from $1.1bn to $838m.Meanwhile, Hartford Financial, the smaller US insurer, announced a $500m share buy-back programme only a year after repaying government bail-out money. The announcement came after Hartford’s second-quarter results, which were pre-released last month due to charges related to tornadoes that devastated parts of the US earlier this year. Net income at Hartford fell from $76m in the second quarter of 2010 to $24m.Liam McGee, chief executive, said it was “an important action and the next step to ultimately increasing our return on equity and earnings per share”. He said he had consulted regulators before approving the share buy-back and would continue to “prudently” manage capital."
128;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New York attorney-general probes BofA settlement;;New York’s attorney-general sent letters to 20 investment managers, including BlackRock Financial Management and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, seeking information about an $8.5bn settlement Bank of America struck last month with large bond investors, according to copies of the letters obtained by the Financial Times.Eric Schneiderman, the attorney-general, has been investigating Wall Street banks over how they packaged and sold mortgage-backed securities before the collapse of the housing market. The letters, dated July 7, said his office is seeking information about the BofA settlement in connection with its ongoing investigation into the securitisation of residential mortgages.Mr. Schneiderman’s office requested the asset managers provide information by July 14, including the names of investors in the securities covered by the settlement, as well as the par amount and current market value of those investments.BofA last month reached a deal to settle allegations made by 22 large bond investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock, MetLife and Freddie Mac, that loans made by its Countrywide Financial unit failed to meet underwriting guidelines and that the lender, which was bought by BofA in 2008, failed to properly service the loans once they were packaged and sold.A group of bond investors who were not part of the settlement said in court documents last week that they planned to challenge the agreement on the grounds that Bank of New York Mellon, which was party to the deal as the trustee on the bonds in question, had conflicts of interests that raised questions about its fairness.BofA and BNY Mellon declined to comment.BofA has been moving to resolve claims related to how it underwrote, packaged and sold mortgages leading up the housing collapse.The bank reached an agreement on Monday with MBIA under which the large bond insurer will drop a lawsuit that accused BofA’s Merrill Lynch investment bank of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage-backed securities for which the insurer underwrote $5.7bn in protection against default.The agreement to drop the suit is the first significant move by MBIA and BofA to begin sorting through a tangle of cross-litigation that has ensnared the two companies since the housing market collapsed.A filing with the New York State Supreme Court said that in agreeing to dismiss all “claims, counterclaims and cross-claims”, each party would bear the cost of their respective legal fees.MBIA continues to press two separate lawsuits against Bank of American and its Countrywide Financial unit over the quality of loans underwritten by those institutions.BofA has meanwhile joined a group of 15 large banks and financial firms suing MBIA, claiming that the bond insurer reduced its ability to pay policyholders by splitting its business in two when it restructured in 2009.MBIA sued Merrill Lynch in April 2009, about seven months after BofA agreed to buy the investment bank. In its suit, MBIA accused Merrill Lynch of misrepresenting the quality of the securities for which an MBIA unit, LaCrosse Financial, underwrote credit insurance. Although Merrill said the quality of the securities was triple A, the bank knew that the credit quality was far below that level, according to the complaint.As a result, MBIA said it wound up owing several hundred million dollars to cover losses.A state judge threw out all but one claim last year, and in February, a New York appeals court dismissed the entire case on the grounds that MBIA’s level of sophistication would have made it difficult for the insurer to prove that Merrill Lynch had committed fraud.MBIA filed a motion to appeal the ruling, but no decision had been made on it before Monday’s agreement by both parties to dismiss the case.MBIA and BofA declined to comment.The other firms contacted by the New York attorney-general were Aegon USA Investment Management, Bayerische Landesbank, ING Investment Management, ING Bank, ING Capital, Invesco Advisors, Kore Advisors, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, MetLife, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Neuberger Berman Europe, New York Life Investment Management, Pacific Investment Management, Prudential Investment Management, Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, Trust Company of the West and Western Asset Management.The firms declined to comment, were unavailable to comment or said they had not received the letter.
129;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-07-05T21:14:30Z;Bond investors challenge $8.5bn BofA settlement;Walnut group raises questions about deal fairness;A group of bond investors plans to challenge an $8.5bn deal that Bank of America struck last week with other investors to settle mis-selling claims over mortgage-backed securities sold by its Countrywide Financial unit.The group, which calls itself Walnut Place, has accused Bank of New York Mellon, BofA’s trustee on the securitisations, of having conflicts of interest that raise questions about the fairness of the deal, according to a court filing.The Walnut Place investors own more than one-quarter of the voting rights in one Countrywide trust and unspecified shares in two others, the court documents said.Bank of America last week reached a deal to settle allegations made by 22 large bond investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, BlackRock, MetLife and Freddie Mac, that Countrywide loans failed to meet underwriting guidelines and that the lender, which was bought by BofA in 2008, failed to properly service the loans once they were packaged and sold.The Walnut Place investors were not part of that settlement, although they had made similar claims in a lawsuit filed in March.The court filing made on Tuesday accused BNY Mellon of failing as trustee in multiple ways, especially in not forcing Countrywide to buy back faulty home loans but also because it put its own interests ahead of shareholders in the trusts when it took part in negotiations for the deal reached last week with the 22 investors.The Walnut Place investors said that as many as two-thirds of the loans in two Countrywide trusts failed to meet underwriting guidelines, according to their own investigation.Extrapolating that failure rate to the 530 trusts covered by the bank’s settlement, the Walnut Place investors concluded that BofA could be liable to repurchase loans with unpaid principal balances of as much as $242bn.“The $8.5bn that Countrywide and BofA have agreed to pay is therefore only a small fraction of the potential liability that they would have faced in litigation on behalf of the trusts,” the Walnut Place investors argued in the court documents.BNY Mellon declined to comment on Walnut Place’s claims, but said, “As trustee, we acted and continue to act in the best interests of all investors in the trusts.” A BofA spokesman said, “The settlement agreement was designed to give certificate holders, like those behind the Walnut Place entities, an opportunity to have any objections heard.”As part of the settlement, BNY Mellon negotiated a larger indemnity from Countrywide for costs and liabilities related to servicing the trusts than it would have otherwise received as well as a guarantee from BofA that puts BNY Mellon “in a substantially better position than it was in before negotiating the proposed settlement, at the direct expense of the certificate holders whose interests [BNY Mellon] purports to protect,” the court papers said.
130;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-07-03T22:32:34Z;Alico deal opens door to MetLife expansion;;Snoopy is an unlikely character to be joining the Bolshoi, Russia’s world renowned ballet. But with a sponsorship deal nearly done, MetLife’s mascot since the 1980s will soon be on posters alongside humans of greater grace and poise.This doggy ambassador, a familiar sight on the US golf tour through another MetLife sponsorship, should also get a lofty perch at the new home for New York football teams the Giants and Jets, if talks over naming rights for the new Meadowlands stadium are successful.William Toppeta, who runs all of MetLife’s businesses outside the US, will not comment on Meadowlands, but says the company is working hard on building its brand internationally following the $16bn takeover of Alico from AIG, the bailed out US insurer, last year.That deal added businesses in 50 countries and is set to double the earnings of MetLife’s international arm to 40 per cent of the group total. In Japan, which accounts for half of that contribution, the company has already added a fourth Snoopy airship to the three it has that cover golf tournaments in the US.Golf and ballet both attract the senior executives and benefit consultants that MetLife targets for one of its core products, employee benefits, which Mr Toppeta says the company has been describing as its jewel since it demutualised in 2000. The Alico deal has given the group greater heft in this market internationally, but it has also added other retail life products that help to balance out its exposure to the US, where growth has been slower and the costs of running variable annuities were exposed by the financial crisis.These products, a mainstay of the US market, promise an income to retirees based on the performance of stock and bond markets. Insurers must either spend a lot of time and money on hedging programmes, or take a heavy hit when markets turn bad. That MetLife dealt with the crisis better than rivals has been shown by the Alico deal. AIG’s only other viable option was for an initial public offering of the life unit.However, with Alico MetLife has bought itself some new and unfamiliar exposures. The Japanese business came with $550m of bonds from Tepco, the nuclear power company that is in trouble following the earthquake in March. Its European businesses also have about $1bn of sovereign debt from weaker nations. Mr Toppeta says the company is comfortable with these investments and with the fact they are tiny compared to its more than $450bn of assets.The deal also bought them exposure to now volatile parts of the Middle East, such as Egypt, where political upheaval forced it to relocate customer service and other operations. This affected the integration programme, but Mr Toppeta insists not by much. “We fell behind a little, but we are back on track.”Now the big question is how much spare capital the company has and what it plans to do with it. The group said at the end of 2010 it had $5bn of excess capital and reiterated recently that its capital position remains strong. However, some analysts question whether it can still calculate what is spare in the same way it did before the financial crisis.According to Mr Toppeta, MetLife can spend $3bn-$4bn on another acquisition, although he is guarded as to where the next opportunity could come. Japan, though mature, is one of Mr Toppeta’s main focus markets today. “Our task is to outgrow the market,” he says. “We estimate market growth in Japan is about 1 per cent a year, we want to grow by 4-5 per cent.” He adds, though, that he believes MetLife can already achieve that. Markets that are important for the medium term include another mature market, the UK, although that is one where employee benefits are set to become increasingly important.Then there are the longer term markets, which for MetLife include those where it already has a presence to build on such as Turkey and the Bric countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China – as well as those that it would like to get in to, such as Indonesia and Thailand. But he insists the company will keep its careful approach. “Our premise is to stick to our core and do the things we can do well,” he says. “If we go too far from our core we are going to disappoint people and that’s not good for our future growth.”
131;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-07-03T22:15:02Z;MetLife eyes further deals;;MetLife is able to spend $3bn-$4bn on another deal following last year’s more than $16bn acquisition of AIG’s international life business, according William Toppeta, head of the US-based life assurer’s international arm.The sectors it is focused on include both the more mature markets such as Japan and the UK, as well as the longer-term prospects of Brazil, Russia and Turkey and other areas of Asia and Latin America.Mr Toppeta told the Financial Times that “job one” was the integration of Alico, whose purchase from AIG last year saw MetLife leapfrog its bigger but stricken peer to become the US’s largest insurer and among the biggest in the world.He added, however, that the group liked acquisitions, especially internationally, and that MetLife’s deals department was constantly being offered opportunities around the world.“We are perfectly capable of doing a medium size transaction, by that I mean several billion dollars,” Mr Toppeta told the FT. He said “$3bn-$4bn would not be beyond the realm of what’s doable.” A deal of that size would appear significantly more ambitious than the “tuck-ins or bolt-ons” that MetLife’s group chairman, Robert Henrikson, said were the opportunities the group was seeing when he spoke to analysts and investors at the start of June.It would also surprise analysts who are expecting the company to start buying back shares with any spare capital it has by the end of the year.Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, says MetLife is his top pick because of international expansion already bought through the Alico deal.MetLife has already done a deal this year, the €160m ($232m) purchase in June of the Turkish life company of Dexia, the Franco-Belgian financial services group, which Mr Toppeta said rounded out the pensions business in Turkey it got as part of Alico.Mr Toppeta said the company had very strict rules about dealmaking, which it had shown itself determined to follow in the five years between its $11.5bn purchase of Travelers Life and Annuity from Citigroup in 2005 and Alico. He describes these years as the glory days in markets when plenty of other companies were more willing to do risky things.
132;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Pension option could fund long-term care;Government urged to ease rules on capped drawdown;The government is being urged to relax its rules on capped drawdown to enable pension investors to use their funds more freely to help pay for nursing home care.MetLife, a pension provider, is proposing that investors be allowed to use funds held in capped drawdown, currently subject to income withdrawal limits, to help pay for long-term care as part of moves to scrap means-testing.Currently, individuals with assets of more than £22,000-£23,000, including the family home, will have to pay for their own care costs in old age, which can range from £25,000-£36,000 a year.With £489bn currently invested in defined contribution pensions schemes, MetLife proposes that the government eases its rules on income drawdown so investors can use the funds to help with care cots.The proposal would see savers effectively be able to access higher income levels than currently allowed under capped drawdown rules but would only be able to access pension funds when their medical condition means they have to go into residential care.“The issue of funding long-term care requires new solutions and this proposal could provide considerable help to people with reasonable-sized pension savings,” said Peter Carter, product marketing director at MetLife UK.“The OECD estimates the UK will have to find an extra £50bn a year to fund care and that clearly cannot come from the government alone. Accessing pension funds will free considerable amounts which can be used to tackle a major issue while allowing people to keep their homes”.Investors in capped drawdown saw their income withdrawal limits reduce from 120 per cent of the equivalent annuity rate to 100 per cent, under reforms which came into force in April this year.The Dilnot Commission on the state’s role in the funding of care and support is due to presents its recommendations next month.
133;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-05-28T03:31:29Z;Pension Corporation in talks to raise £500m;;Pension Corporation, the specialist insurer set up by Edi Truell, is in exclusive talks to raise up to £500m in fresh capital mainly from a single new investor, Reinet Investments, the Luxembourg-listed investment vehicle.The capital raising would end a frustrating period for Pension Corporation, which since late 2009 has been seeking funds to back large deals in the UK pensions market where it insures or buys out the long-term liabilities of paying pensioners from corporate defined benefit schemes.Pension Corporation is one of a handful of specialist companies in this area, along with Goldman Sach’s Rothesay Life, Cerberus-backed Lucida and traditional insurers such as Aviva, Legal & General, MetLife and Prudential.The company is backed by JC Flowers, the private equity group, JPMorgan, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, but none of them had been keen to increase their investment beyond the £900m ($1.5bn) that Pension Corporation had raised in its early years.The extra capital along with cash flows from its £4.2bn of pensions assets and further reinsurance transactions should allow Pension Corporation to reach the point where its business is self sustaining, Mr Truell said.“This capital should get us to the point where we could have £10bn or more of pensions assets on the balance sheet and so become self funding,” said Mr Truell, who formerly ran Duke Street Capital, the private equity firm. “It’s been a little bit frustrating on a couple of things [not having that capital] where we could have been more robust bidders.”Reinet is controlled by Johann Rupert, chairman of Richemont, the Swiss luxury goods group, from which it was spun out. Reinet also owns 49 per cent of Trilantic Capital Partners, the former Lehman Brothers private equity fund, and it recently agreed to invest alongside Lord Rothschild’s RIT Capital Partners to create an alternative asset management and advisory company that will be run by Bill Winters, the former co-chief executive of JPMorgan Investment Bank.Mr Truell said he got to know the Rupert family in the early 1990s when he was involved in restructuring Cartier, Dunhill and Rothmans into a pure tobacco company.Reinet said it would invest £400m but the deal is complicated by the need to agree a restructuring of the firm’s capital structure to allow Reinet to invest only in the insurance arm of the firm and not take exposure to Pension Corporation’s investments in companies such as Telent, which it bought in part for its pension fund.The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, will also see Mr Truell seek a further £100m in capital from some existing investors and other family offices.The market for corporate pension schemes to offload their defined benefit liabilities is expected to grow by about £20bn over the next 18 months, according to leading pensions consultancy, Hymans Robertson.
134;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world.

The tradition of appointing a European as managing director “undermines the legitimacy” of the International Monetary Fund, the world’s largest developing countries said in an unusual joint statement on Tuesday, the FT reports. The IMF executive directors for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa attacked the “obsolete unwritten convention” that the head of the fund is always a European and calling for a “truly transparent, merit-based and competitive process”. The statement is a rare example of co-ordination by the Brics countries and marks a challenge to Europe, which is uniting behind Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, as its candidate in an effort to keep control of the IMF job.India pledges second $5bn loan to Africa
India has offered Africa a second $5bn loans package as it attempts to catch up on a decade-long head start by Chinese investment into the resource-rich continent, the FT reports. During a six-day trip to east Africa, Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, also promised railway lines, training schemes and cash for peacekeeping on top of the three-year credit line, which follows a $5.4bn five-year loan deal at the first India-Africa summit in New Delhi in 2008.China in talks with Brazil over trade barriers
China is in talks with Brazil on lifting trade barriers that would allow the Latin American country to sell it more processed agricultural goods, Brazilian government officials have told the Financial Times. During the negotiations in Brasília last week with Chen Deming, China’s commerce minister, Brazil’s government gave Beijing a list of 10 processed goods it wants to start exporting in quantity, such as frozen chicken wings and soyabean oil. The move is the first stage in a plan to sell more value-added goods to Asia.S&P raises Brazil credit outlook
Standard & Poor’s has raised its outlook on Brazil’s credit rating to positive from stable, praising the Latin American country for diversifying its economy, increasing exports and fostering the growth of the middle classes, the FT reports. The rating agency’s more bullish view follows Fitch’s upgrade to Brazil’s local and foreign currency debt to BBB in April this year and comes at a time when several European countries are struggling to emerge from the global financial crisis and suffering downgrades.Worst drought in 50 years along Yangtze
The worst drought in 50 years to hit provinces along the Yangtze River may continue to plague Central China, China Daily reports. The China Meteorological Administration warned on Tuesday that little rain is expected in the coming 10 days and highs of 36 C are likely to hit the central and southern parts of China. Data indicated that rainfall in these regions is 30 to 80 percent less compared to normal years, while the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and Shanghai municipality continue to suffer the worst drought since 1954.Yanzhou Coal targets $1.1bn in initial sale
Yanzhou Coal Mining, China’s fourth-largest producer, may raise more than A$1bn ($1.1bn) in an initial share for at least a third of its Australian unit by the end of the year,China Daily reports.

Another company executive, who didn’t want to be identified, said the deal’s value is estimated around $29.8m. NMDC’s buyout of an up to 50 per cent stake in Perth-based Legacy Iron Ore will pave the way for the Indian miner to expand overseas at a time when operations at some of its local mines in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh are threatened by Maoist rebels.Belarus devalues its currency
Belarus on Tuesday lowered its official exchange rate against the dollar by 36 per cent, but analysts questioned whether even such a radical step would be enough to resolve the country’s balance of payments crisis, the FT reports. The central bank lowered the official rate for the dollar from 3,155 roubles to 4,930 roubles but the move appeared to have little impact on the street, as the bank also said over-the-counter currency traders could not deviate by more than 2 per cent from the official rate. The bank also continued to refuse to sell foreign currency to commercial banks.Emerging Markets

137;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-05-22T21:59:39Z;Pensions ‘will offload £20bn liabilities’;;Corporate pension schemes will offload about £20bn worth of defined benefit liabilities to banks and insurers over the next 18 months, according to leading pensions consultancy, Hymans Robertson.James Mullins at Hymans also predicts that this quarter will see a record volume of deals. A number of significant schemes are in advanced talks to complete buy-outs, buy-ins or longevity swaps as they look to dismiss the volatility that swings in pension deficits bring to company balance sheets.Mr Mullins would not comment on specific schemes, but other market sources said that ITV has been exploring a very large longevity swap for its pension scheme, while Bentley, the luxury carmaker, is close to completing a smaller deal. Both companies declined to comment.Mr Mullins said that by the end of 2012, one in four FTSE 100 companies would have completed either a buy-out, where a company offloads its entire pension scheme to an insurer, a buy-in, where a company buys an insurance policy against investment, inflation and longevity risks, or a longevity swap, which insures only the risk that pensioners live longer than expected.“Our analysis illustrates that it won’t be long before £50bn of pension scheme risk has been transferred to insurance companies and banks,” Mr Mullins said, adding that £30bn of deals had been done since 2006-07, when the market began to really take off.He said that 2010 was the third successive year in which £8bn of pension scheme risks were transferred via buy-ins, buy-outs and longevity swaps. Despite the relatively quiet first quarter, 2011 was likely to see a substantial increase above recent annual levels, he added.There has already been one publicly announced deal this quarter that was worth £200m on its own – when the London Stock Exchange bought insurance against liabilities for its current and some future pensioners from Pension Insurance Corporation.Pension Corp is one of a handful of specialist companies in this area, along with Cerberus-backed Lucida and traditional insurers such as Aviva, Legal & General, MetLife and Prudential. But the leader in the field is Goldman Sachs’ Rothesay Life unit, which last year did a £1.3bn deal for British Airways as well as buying out its stricken rival, Paternoster.Mr Mullins said the amount of capital being made available for the sector from the banks and insurers had not changed in the past couple of years, but the level of demand was growing.“Also, corporate transactions are picking up and pension-related risks can often get in the way of these,” Mr Mullins said. “Doing buy-outs, buy-ins or longevity swaps can help to oil the wheels of other corporate activity.”

MetLife wishes to point out that its hedging programme was recognised at the time by analysts as being consistent and robust.
139;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-04-03T22:00:46Z;Financial groups seek to avoid ‘important’ list;;"There is a new parlour game in the geekier circles of Washington’s regulators, academics and lobbyists: who should be on the list of companies deemed so important to the financial system that they must be subject to tighter standards?After financial groups built up risk that threatened to bring down the entire financial system, the Obama administration decided to identify future AIGs and Lehman Brothers and subject them to tougher capital and liquidity standards and closer supervision.As Congress debated the law that became Dodd-Frank, lawmakers wrangled over this systemic risk designation. Some warned it would crystallise the “too big to fail” funding advantage enjoyed by the largest groups by underlining the fact the government considered them crucial. Others said it would instead be a “scarlet letter”, a sign that profits would be hit by the new standards.Nine months after the designation became law, it looks like the scarlet letter brigade has won. Disclosures show a long list of companies and industry trade groups engaging in lobbying efforts – people involved with the talks say they are desperate to prove they do not deserve to be branded.Viral Acharya, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, has developed a daily league table of systemically risky companies, which measures the correlation between a stock market fall and that of an individual company and also takes into account how much debt it has. It is an elegant way of measuring how tightly bound to the broader system a group is and how vulnerable it is to failing.As Mr Acharya points out: “In the end, it wasn’t a regulator who woke up one day and said ‘Listen, we are having a subprime crisis’, it was the market.”Bank of America is top of the list. Like all bank holding companies with more than $50bn in assets, it is automatically designated, but the top 10 also includes four insurance companies: MetLife, which is structured as a bank holding company and is therefore expected to be designated; AIG, which is also expected to be designated even though its supporters say it has shed its risky businesses; Prudential; and Hartford Financial Services.How to treat the latter two businesses shows the difficulties of the designation: they are both large and the NYU-Stern calculations show them to be systemically risky. On the other hand, the insurance industry is arguing that its companies enjoy stable funding and are therefore not susceptible to bank-type “runs” and that unlike AIG, they are not dangerously intertwined with other financial companies.“It’s absolutely the number one outstanding issue that we have,” David Sampson, chief executive of the Property Casualty Insurers Association, told a Chamber of Commerce conference last week. “Clearly it’s fundamentally a size-based threshold … [and] a bank-centric view of how they [regulators] approach their work. You’re not going to have a run on [insurers] … unless everyone in the country crashes their car at the same time.”Mr Acharya notes though that it is very difficult to argue convincingly that there is no systemic risk in insurance. As big buyers of corporate bonds, if they stopped buying in a crisis then corporate America would be forced to turn to credit lines with banks, having knock-on effects for banks’ funds. Mr Acharya’s league table only includes public companies – asset managers, private equity firms and hedge funds that are not on the stock market are therefore exempt.That might not be the case in the real designations. But in 2009, both Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, separately expressed the view that no individual hedge fund was risky enough for inclusion.That might not suit the purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The agency has been given powers to wind down a failing systemically important financial group to complement its existing powers to wind down banks. Officials there, in contrast to their counterparts at the Fed and the Treasury, want a longer list because they think the designation, particularly the requirement to draw up a living will, is important to the FDIC’s ability to wind down a future AIG or Lehman Brothers. But the FDIC is only one vote on the council of regulators.Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor, said last week that the initial list should be short and “treating financial firms of all sorts as banks could be both ineffective and inefficient”.Although some lobbyists worry that the council will ultimately opt for broader inclusion for fear of missing a company that later roils markets, the indications so far are that a decisive majority of its members will opt for a smaller list."

Elsewhere, Bank of America was down 0.9 per cent to $13.33 while SunTrust Banks fell 1.2 per cent to $28.86.The S&P financial index was down 0.4 per cent, the worst performing of all the S&P sub-indices.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 1,325.83, following a string of lacklustre economic numbers.Figures from the Labor Department announced that 12,000 more people had claimed benefits than had initially been reported last week, weighing on sentiment. The four-week moving average of claims went up 3,000 to 394,000.However, the news was not all bad as it also reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000 last week. This helped to limit losses in the session ahead of the all important official non-farm payroll number due to be released today.“The revised data show a slightly less steep drop in claims over the past few months, but the key point here is that the trend is still clearly downwards,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Other figures showed that US factory orders had fallen 0.1 per cent in February, which was more than expected, and that business activity had expanded at a slower rate in March than in the previous month.Overall, that disappointing data left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2 per cent at 12,320.79 while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,781.07.The Dow was up 6.7 per cent in the quarter, which was the best first quarter for the index since 1998.The retail sector lost ground in the session led by CarMax, which fell 7.2 per cent to $32.10 after the biggest US used-car dealer reported lower gross margins for the fourth quarter. However, the group also reported earnings up 19 per cent and double-digit gains in sales of vehicles.Elsewhere in the sector home improvement retailers lost ground, with Home Depot falling 1.4 per cent to $37.06 while Lowe’s lost 2 per cent to $26.43. Earlier in the week, Home Depot had seen gains after announcing plans to issue $2bn of debt and buy back $1bn of stock.The S&P retail sector was down 0.7 per cent, one of the worst performing in the session along with financials. Looking at the first quarter on Wall Street, equities have seen strong 5.6 per cent gains. It was the best first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1998. On average since 1998, the S&P 500 index has lost 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year, with the index losing ground in six out of the previous 13 first quarters.The markets began the year in a euphoric state, continuing the rally from early September 2010 when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The S&P 500 saw a sharp 6.8 per cent rise throughout January and the first half of February, reaching the point where many commentators started to argue equities were overbought and due a correction.Then in the middle of February, the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East and the subsequent spike in oil prices provided a catalyst for a sell off.That was compounded in March by a further retreat following the natural disaster in Japan. These worries saw markets marked down 6.4 per cent in four weeks. Since the middle of March, the index has rallied back 5.6 per cent as traders have turned their attentions towards the domestic economic recovery.“Ultimately, the markets have been predisposed to positive news and have had a tendency to shrug off negative news,” said Matthew Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.Energy stocks dominated the quarter, with the S&P energy index up 16.8 per cent as oil prices soared. Chevron rose 17.8 per cent in the quarter to $107.49.Industrial stocks have been the next biggest winner rising 8.1 per cent. Caterpillar has put on 18.9 per cent to $111.40 over the quarter.
141;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-03-10T19:57:47Z;Appetite for convertible bonds grows;Investors seek protection against rate rises;Big investors looking for protection against rises in interest rates have stoked demand for convertible bonds, with global issuance rising sharply and putting the market on course for its best year since 2008.Companies last week sold $9.4bn of convertible bonds, debt which can be exchanged for equity at a pre-agreed price trigger, according to data from Dealogic.These figures marked the strongest week of issuance since May 2008 and included the year’s two largest single issues, from MetLife, the US insurer, and Sinopec, the Chinese oil company.This week, Cemex, Mexico’s cement group, said it would sell $1.2bn in convertible notes, which would be the third largest sale of the year. So far this year, companies have sold $18.7bn of convertible bonds, the best pace since 2008.Convertible bond issuance shrank over the past three years, as companies were able to sell more conventional debt, which does not carry a risk of equity dilution, at historically low rates.Yields on global corporate debt are at an average premium over benchmark US Treasuries of 1.51 per cent, versus a premium of 6.2 per cent for convertibles, according to Barclays Capital indices.But as yields on US and other government bonds have risen since late 2010, in part because of economic recovery hopes, convertibles have become more attractive.“As rates increase, convertibles will become even more compelling to issuers. The companies looking at this market now are skating to where the puck is going,” said Paul Donahue, co-head of US equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley.Traditional fixed income investors, including Pimco, have also been eager to buy convertibles recently. Loomis Sayles, a fixed income-focused fund manager with $151bn in assets, has also been a buyer of convertibles.“We are seeing crossover interest from credit and fixed income accounts looking for the equity participation component of convertibles,” said David Puritz, head of US convertibles sales and trading at Nomura in New York.Mr Puritz said the investor base of convertibles had shifted from about 80 per cent hedge funds to a nearly even split with mainstream investing institutions.“Trading volumes have been aggressive in January and February as new funds come into the market seeking convertibles,” he said.So far in 2011, convertibles’ returns have lagged behind those of equities slightly, with prices up 4.4 per cent, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch US convertibles index, versus a 5.1 per cent rise in the S&P 500 index.“In a short time frame, convertibles lag on the upside due to the conversion premium [the cost of exchanging debt for equity],” said Tracy Maitland, president of Advent Capital Management, which manages $6bn in assets.“But over a longer period, they outperform because of the yield. They also tend to lose less on the downside.”Last year, convertibles saw stronger returns than all asset classes except small-cap stocks, rising 15.5 per cent, according to the BofAML index.
142;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-03-03T01:04:08Z;AIG sale of MetLife shares raises $6.3bn;;AIG raised $6.3bn through the sale of shares in its US rival MetLife, in a move that will help the insurer to accelerate the repayment of the US government’s aid during the financial crisis.The Treasury department announced on Wednesday that 146.8m shares of Metlife common stock were sold for $43.25 per share.The sale of the shares – which AIG received as part payment for the $16.2bn sale of Alico, its foreign life insurance business, in November – will put an end to AIG’s unusual position as a large shareholder in one of its fiercest competitors.MetLife said on Tuesday it would raise about $3bn by selling shares to buy back preferred shares held by AIG.The rest of AIG’s stake in MetLife, which comprises of common stock and equity units that convert into common stock, will be sold into the market.Under the terms of the Alico sale, AIG was banned from selling the MetLife shares until next August but the two companies hammered out a deal to speed up the divestment.People close to the situation said AIG wanted to move faster than originally planned to raise funds to repay the authorities, while MetLife was eager to lift investor uncertainty over the timing of such a large sale of its stock.AIG plans to use about $7bn of the proceedings to pay back some of the $18.2bn it owes the US Treasury as a result of multiple bail-outs. The US authorities are also planning to sell down their 92 per cent share in the insurer, which is valued at about $79bn at current market prices.Overall, the authorities have committed more than $180bn to rescue the troubled insurer. The remaining $3bn to be raised by AIG will be set aside to indemnify MetLife if legal issues related to Alico emerge in future years.AIG is set to make a profit on its MetLife investment, given that the shares have risen more than 14 per cent since the Alico deal closed.The sale of the MetLife shares underlines how the recent stock market rally has helped AIG emerge from the dark days of the crisis.
143;MET;Metlife Inc;2011-02-25T19:01:44Z;Investors offered three levels of downside protection;Bond price will never fall to less than 70, 80 or 90 per cent of its highest level;Investors looking to capture further rises in equity markets, but without the risk of volatility wiping out short-term gains, can now make use of the first investment product to offer a choice of three levels of downside protection.MetLife, the insurance group, has launched a new unit-linked bond that will lock in investment growth on a daily basis, to ensure that its unit price never falls to less than 70, 80 or 90 per cent of its highest ever value. Investors pay in a single premium of £15,000 or more, and choose the level of protection they require. Their money is then split between cash and UK equities, according to the protection level selected, and the direction of equity markets.For those investors choosing 90 per cent unit price protection, the maximum allocation to equities will be 40 per cent. For those comfortable with 80 per cent protection, the equity allocation can rise to 70 per cent. Or for those happy with 70 per cent protection, the equity allocation can rise to 90 per cent.Exactly how much equity exposure is taken, up to these limits, will be decided daily using a formula devised by Barclays. If the value of the equity investment increases, more money will be moved from cash to equities and the protected unit price will be increased.But if the equity holdings fall in value, money will be moved back into cash to “lock-in” most of the gains.Even if share prices fall sharply, any “gap” between the bond’s value and the protected price will be made up by Barclays – and Met-Life offers its own secondary guarantee. Charges for the protection are levied at 0.7 per cent, on top of an annual management charge of 0.35 per cent for an onshore bond (0.6 per cent for an offshore bond), plus fund charges of 0.2 per cent.Other managers offer similar investments, but with a single level of protection and without guarantees.Fidelity’s Equity Growth Defender fund also moves investors’ money from equities to cash on a daily basis with the aim of locking in 80 per cent of gains – but does not guarantee this level, on the grounds that the FTSE All-Share has never fallen by 20 per cent in a single day.Zurich’s Sterling Protected Profits funds aim to ensure that unit prices will not fall to less than 80 per cent of their highs even if underlying equity, bond and commodity indices fall. Aegon International’s Protected Funds set the same 80 per cent protection target.However, independent advisers warn that funds like these are likely to underperform equity indices – and can quickly become stuck in cash after several days of a falling market.Commenting on the MetLife bond, Laith Khalaf of advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown points out: “The plan increases your equity exposure as markets are rising and pulls it back when they are falling – this sounds like a buy high, sell low approach to me. If markets do fall significantly, you can be left with an entirely cash portfolio so your capacity to make good those falls is close to nil.” Ian Lowes, of Lowes Financial Management, says this is a problem common to all protected funds: “A lot of them run the risk, if the market falls, of ending up in a cash-locked position.”MetLife’s head of product marketing, Peter Carter, says that if its bond ended up wholly in cash for four weeks, it would switch investors into a pure cash fund so they don’t pay the protection charge, and write to them offering a transfer to any other available fund.Even so, Lowes says the onshore bond structure may not be tax-efficient for investors not using their capital gains tax allowance.

Funders continue to retreat from more secondary parts of the real estate market outside the capital, however, with an increasingly wide two-tier market emerging for real estate finance.The deal is one of the largest of a recent wave of debt restructurings that have arisen as facilities agreed during the boom years for five-year terms approach expiry in 2011 and 2012. There is £161bn of debt due to expire in the next five years in the UK.As part of the process, Westbrook is expected to pay down an amount of the debt and bring in a small amount of junior debt to add to the package. In total, it is expected to have agreed to new debt of about £375m. Westbrook declined to comment.Several other banks put forward terms on the refinancing package, suggesting that the market for such prime asset refinancings has come deeper in recent months. The Shell-Mex debt needed to be refinanced by July 2012.Westbrook had been in talks to sell the property although it is believed to have shelved plans following funder interest and in order to benefit from further asset value growth. It has restructured the leases in the building, including an extension of a lease with Shell until 2020 while Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, has a lease that runs until 2040.On Monday, Vico Capital, the company of Brian and Mary O’Donnell, the Irish investors, agreed a £107m refinancing of the Credit Suisse-occupied 17 Columbus Courtyard in Canary Wharf with MetLife and with junior debt provided by Duet Private Equity.Vico needed to refinance debt after a loan provided by Morgan Stanley expired in October. MetLife also refinanced a property portfolio owned by London & Stamford last week.

The investment bank Greenhill is advising the Treasury on the sale of its stake.As part of that deal, AIG would be allowed to raise as much as $3bn of equity in the market and another $4bn with Treasury approval.In December, AIG sold $2bn in debt, including $500m in three-year notes and $1.5bn in 10-year notes, on the private market. The company has also established a $500m contingent liquidity facility.The credit facilities announced on Monday will help reassure credit rating agencies that AIG will be able to borrow at sustainable levels in future.
146;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-12-16T09:56:09Z;S Korean private equity group targets Woori;;Vogo Fund, a South Korean private equity group, wants to take a controlling stake in Woori Financial Group, amid growing uncertainty over the government’s $6bn-plus privatisation of the country’s largest lender.Lee Jae-woo, a managing partner at Vogo, said the fund was contacting potential investors to raise money to target a controlling stake in Woori.“The investors we contacted want us to either control the lender or have a substantial influence over it,” said Mr Lee. “We are at the initial stage of fundraising but the situation is fluid due to growing uncertainty over the government’s sale process.”Seoul is reviewing the planned sale of Woori after two prime consortia pulled out of the bidding this week, citing the high premium sought by the government. The lack of a rival bidder may force a delay to the sale because the government wants to uphold its “valid competition” principle, which requires at least two bidders for Woori.Vogo is one of South Korea’s biggest private equity funds with about Won1,000bn ($866m) in assets. Last month, it agreed to buy a 47 per cent stake in Tong Yang Life Insurance, and last year became the largest shareholder in BC Card, a local credit card issuer.While Vogo has expressed interest in bidding for the bank, the protracted sale process has been thrown into doubt since Hana Financial Group last month opted to buy Korea Exchange Bank and drop its bid for Woori. The government officially launched the sale in October but the privatisation plan has been talked about for years.The government wants to privatise Woori to recoup as much public funds as possible after it spent Won12,800bn bailing out troubled banks in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis.Woori was created in 2001 as a holding company for the banks that the government rescued. The government has so far recovered Won5,300bn of public funds through block sales of Woori shares.The government received letters of intent from 11 bidders for Woori in November, but most of the companies only have an interest in taking a minority stake. Private equity groups including Carlyle and MBK Partners, and foreign investors such as Macquarie and MetLife, are reportedly among the 11 bidders.The public fund oversight committee, a government agency in charge of Woori’s sale, on Thursday said it would soon announce whether the sale would be delayed.“There are not many bidders with substantial financing capability, who can meet our criteria,” said one committee official.The government wants preliminary bids by Monday to allow it to select a shortlist of bidders before the end of the year. It plans to select a preferred bidder by March, and sign a contract by the end of June.Vogo would have to buy more than 28.5 per cent of Woori to become its largest shareholder and replace the government, which owns 57 per cent.

Lincoln National Corp jumped 7.5 per cent to $27.24, Hartford Financial Services added 3.5 per cent to $25 and MetLife gained 3.9 per cent to $42.79. AIG sunk 3.9 per cent to $42.23 before trading was halted just before the closing bell.Investors feared dilution when the US Treasury said it plans to sell about one-fifth of the insurer. It was reported that the sale, which would take place in the first half of 2011, could total more than $10bn.The company also struck a deal to repay its Federal Reserve credit line as it seeks independence from the government.The wider market’s gains were limited by the rising dollar and climbing bond yields after Tuesday’s agreement to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.Investors tried to gauge what was the primary cause of the rising rates – expectations of stronger economic growth or the resurfacing worries about inflation and the government deficit.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,228.28, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,372.52 and the Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.4 per cent at 2,609.16.The materials sector lost 0.9 per cent with Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold down 1.8 per cent to $108.60 and Cliffs Natural Resourcesdropping 2 per cent to $71.18.Elsewhere, Fortune Brands – which owns brands ranging from golf balls to Jim Bean whisky – gained 1 per cent to $61.76 after it said it planned to split itself into three separate businesses.The conglomerate will be divided into companies specialising in golf, home products and alcoholic drinks.Details of the plan, which is the result of a four-year strategic review, are expected to be finalised in the next several months.3M edged up 0.6 per cent to $84.05 as analysts weighed up the outlook given by the company on its investor day. On Tuesday shares in the industrial conglomerate declined after it forecast sales volumes at existing businesses would rise more slowly in 2011 than this year.Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation from “buy” to “neutral” and JPMorgan reiterated its “underweight” rating for 3M.“This is not about management as the durable 3M franchise is intact and has been enhanced through investment since chief executive [George] Buckley came aboard,” analysts at JP Morgan said. “This is more about an ongoing high level of expectations from a bullish sell side that has maintained stubbornly high estimates. We need to see some capitulation here.”In technology, Texas Instruments added 1 per cent to $33.75 after the US chipmaker narrowed its fourth-quarter profit and sales forecasts. But the reductions brought the company’s forecasts in line with analyst estimates and it said a recent correction in demand for its chips would be short-lived.Netflix’s chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, resigned and will be replaced by David Wells, an internal appointment. Shares in the mail order online film rental service, which have soared 234 per cent so far this year, sank 0.8 per cent to $188.23.In retail, Home Depot edged higher by 1.4 per cent to $34.03 even though the home improvement retailer increased its full-year profit forecasts.
148;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-12-01T09:02:27Z;Mergers and acquisitions: the new dealmakers;;Most US merger agreements look the same – at least to the untrained eye. The same dour language outlines similar issues in broadly the same way. One mergers and acquisitions specialist says that even after the near-collapse of the financial system, dealmaking seems to have gone back to marking up the same documents that were used at the height of the credit boom.Legal innovation in this area, then, can be hard to pinpoint. Moreover, for a profession that concerns itself with how to get a deal done within the limits of the rules, reinventing those boundaries seems counterintuitive. “Innovation is really about doing things structurally that either haven’t been done before or have been used in other contexts to ensure a deal is going to close,” says Frank Aquila, a partner and M&A specialist at Sullivan & Cromwell. “Those situations don’t come along all that often.”Moments such as the first use of a reverse break-fee – paid to a target if a buyer backs out of a deal – or the invention of the poison pill may be rare, but dealmakers agree that the financial crisis has helped trigger greater creative thinking among M&A lawyers.“Thinking about innovation in the legal profession is slightly antithetical to the way the law has traditionally evolved through case law and precedent,” says Brian Duwe, M&A partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. “But especially with the challenges we have faced in the past few years, precedents do not always work when the circumstances change dramatically, and you have to be willing to think outside the box.”The fallout from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 created a challenging backdrop for all deals. According to Dealogic, the investment banking analyst, M&A volumes slumped 27 per cent in 2009 from the year before as funding for deals dried up, so M&A lawyers also had to find innovative ways to raise funds for beleaguered institutions.“What was scary about the financial crisis was that you had to invent things on the fly,” says George Bason, global head of Davis Polk & Wardwell’s M&A practice. “There were situations that just hadn’t been seen before.”In the $16bn sale by AIG of Alico, its foreign life insurance unit, to financial services provider MetLife, a team of Dewey & LeBoeuf lawyers had to unpick Alico’s business – spread across more than 50 countries – from its parent as the US insurer battled to raise funds.The crisis also complicated the work of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison for Citigroup, the financial conglomerate, in Japan – first buying and then selling Nikko Cordial, the Japanese brokerage. The purchase – which was the first to employ a newly adopted statute allowing the use of foreign company shares to buy a Japanese company – had to be renegotiated as Citigroup’s share price tumbled. Only months later, the bank was battling massive writedowns in its loan portfolio and had to raise capital. When a share offering of the business proved impossible, the law firm instead co-ordinated three separate sale processes and structured “drag along” rights that would ensure Citigroup’s sale could go through without restrictions from its co-investors.The need to deal with multiple legal systems, regulators and jurisdictions add complexity to a transaction. Managing and negotiating several processes simultaneously can also give rise to innovation simply by virtue of making a deal incredibly complex.“A multi-jurisdictional, multidisciplined deal requires innovative thinking simply to get the transaction done,” says Matthew Herman, head of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer’s US corporate practice. “The acquisition by K+S [the German salt and fertiliser producer] of Morton Salt required creating and implementing a complex structure, coordinating the sale of a business before closing for antitrust reasons and securing financing in the immediate wake of the 2008 crisis.”Mr Bason agrees, pointing to his firm’s role in helping PepsiCo acquire two bottling companies – thought to be the first time a company has bought two public companies in two deals on the same day. “It is unquestionably true that a lawyer’s job in a going-private transaction is very complex, and there is a lot of choreography that is important to get right,” he says.The international flavour of the most innovative lawyering – such as Simpson Thacher & Bartlett’s work to bring a wealthy Russian investor to help fund a new arena and development for the New Jersey Nets, the US basketball team – looks set to continue. Cross-border M&A is already up by more than 50 per cent this year on 2009, with emerging markets playing an ever-increasing role. And with year-to-date activity sluggish amid continued economic fears and a cautious approach to dramatic transactions, lawyers are finding new ways to protect their clients’ interests and get deals over the finish line – whether by speeding up private equity buy-outs or by developing structures to bridge the valuation gulf between sellers and buyers.“The distinction between good lawyering and just lawyering is that each deal has its own set of personalities and issues,” says Morton Pierce, co-chairman of M&A practice at Dewey & LeBoeuf. “You need innovative thinking that asks, ‘How can I get this done, notwithstanding these issues?’”“Innovative lawyers are the ones who can recognise and adapt to new ways of doing business,” says Mr Bason. “When working with them, you can be arguing vociferously, but you are arguing about the right things.”Alas, some innovation may be destined never to see the light of day. “It is ironic that some of the biggest successes are those that remain behind closed doors,” says one prominent dealmaker, pointing to furious wrangling over closing conditions or tax-saving wheezes.Merger agreements may seem formulaic, but dealmaking can be a messy business.

Neither, apparently, is the business of providing care and income to the elderly, particularly as they live longer and as the money socked away for the purpose earns less and less.Insurer MetLife announced on Thursday that it will stop writing long-term care (LTC) policies, a segment thought less than a decade ago to be one of the brightest growth areas for the industry as baby boomers prepared for retirement. Medical cost inflation, rising life expectancies and poor investment returns have instead made it a disaster. Several small insurers have stopped issuing new policies in the past decade and, of those in the business, the average LTC financial strength rating by AM Best has dropped four notches to C++.What policies are still on offer are becoming less attractive due to high premiums. Consider that Medicare will only pay for a full 20 and partial 80 days of nursing home care while the median cost has been rising nearly 5 per cent a year to $75,190 annually according to Genworth Financial. Policies could keep paying far longer than expected as more otherwise healthy seniors suffer from maladies like dementia.Low interest rates are affecting the much larger business of fixed annuities and even traditional life assurance. Though new policies can be repriced, spreads are lower and policies less attractive to customers while old policies are becoming a drag. Combined with more stringent regulation, this is probably what induced insurer Transamerica to cease sales of fixed annuities through brokers.

AIG said it would use the proceeds to repay a credit facility held with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Still to come in the restructuring is the conversion of the US Treasury’s preferred shares in AIG into common stock, which will see it take 92.1 per cent of the group’s equity before selling that over time.At Monday’s share price of $41.98, the stake would be valued at $69.7bn, giving the government a paper profit on its investment.AIG’s rescue led to some of the most dramatic and heated moments of the aftermath of the financial crisis.Bonuses paid to AIG executives after the $180bn bail-out heightened public anger and contributed to a distrust of government.This is expected to hurt Democrats in the midterm elections.The Treasury’s exit from AIG will take more time.It announced on Monday that it would be extending a further $22bn to AIG to allow it to buy assets held by the New York Fed but added that the assets exceeded the value of the new cash infusion.AIG said it had concluded its sale of Alico, a life insurance division, to MetLife, its US peer, for $7.2bn in cash and about $9bn in MetLife securities. Floating AIA raised $20.5bn.The Alico announcement and the totting up of cash to be paid to the New York Fed come shortly after a report by Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).It accused the Treasury of inconsistent accounting in its new estimate of the final cost of support to AIG, reduced from $45.2bn to $5bn.The White House defended the calculation.Jen Psaki, a White House spokeswoman, accused Mr Barofsky of seeking to “generate a false controversy over AIG to try and grab a few, cheap headlines”.Mr Benmosche said: “We promised the American taxpayers we would repay them and the initial public offering of AIA last week and the completion of the Alico transaction move us closer to delivering on our promise.”

The US Treasury has agreed to convert its preferred shares into a 92 per cent stake that will be sold over time – the last step to free AIG from government control.In his message to staff, Mr Benmosche said: “Learning that I have cancer makes me even more committed to working with all of you to turn AIG into the success story we all envision. It’s a turnround I want to complete.”Mr Benmosche, a former MetLife chief who joined AIG in August last year, said the board of directors had intensified its search for a successor. He had previously indicated he would step down in 2012.“While I have every intention of staying on that timetable, it’s important that we prepare for any alternate plan that fate may have in mind,” he said in his letter.AIG declined to comment on potential successors or on the type of cancer afflicting Mr Benmosche. People close to the situation said Peter Hancock, a former JPMorgan executive who joined in February and is in charge of finance, risk and investments, was a potential candidate.However, AIG insiders said news of Mr Benmosche’s cancer had come as a surprise and the board was still in the early stages of succession planning.Mr Benmosche’s tenure has been marked by a number of successes as AIG has sold assets to repay the authorities, and by clashes with government officials and the former chairman, Harvey Golub.
154;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-10-22T22:10:50Z;US set for AIA Hong Kong windfall;;An eclectic group of Middle Eastern and Asian sovereign funds and Hong Kong tycoons and retail investors will help the US government to earn a higher-than-expected pay-out of up to $20.5bn from the listing of AIG’s Asian life insurance unit.Proceeds from the initial public offering of AIA, the largest in Hong Kong, could enable AIG to repay the whole $20bn loan it received from the New York Federal Reserve at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.The successful IPO, which priced late on Thursday, highlights the unique mixture of small and large investors who have turned Hong Kong into one of the world’s hottest markets for offerings. Big state-owned funds from Kuwait, China and Malaysia took their place on AIA’s shareholder register next to Hong Kong property tycoons, the territory’s famously aggressive retail investors and international fund managers, bankers said.AIA raised $17.85bn after pricing its shares at the top of an indicated range of HK$18.38 to HK$19.68. The total amount could rise to $20.5bn if, as expected, AIG increases the deal’s size when the shares start trading on October 29. With AIG due to receive $6.8bn in cash from the $15.5bn sale of Alico, another Asian business, to MetLife, the insurer could begin repaying some of the $20bn-plus it owes the US Treasury.The US authorities have agreed to convert $49.1bn in AIG preferred shares into common stock and to sell the resulting 92 per cent stake over the next few years – the final step to free AIG from government control.Raising the maximum $20.5bn from selling a 58 per cent stake in AIA would help AIG’s management get over the embarrassment caused by the collapse of a previous deal to sell the unit to Prudential of the UK in May. That deal would have seen the American company receive a total of about $30bn, with more than $20bn in cash. The IPO values AIA at $30.5bn.AIG, which can start selling the rest of its AIA shares in 12 months, declined to comment.Investors for AIA include the Kuwait Investment Authority, a Malaysia state pension fund, New World – a property group controlled by the tycoon Cheng Yu-Tung – and Wharf Holdings, another developer. As reported by the FT, China Investment Corp, the sovereign wealth fund, and Chinese insurance companies also bought shares.The 11 banks that underwrote the deal – led by Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley – will share about $400m in feesAdditional reporting by Robert Cookson and Paul J Davies
155;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-10-19T23:57:55Z;Investors join forces in BofA bond fight;;Some of the world’s largest institutional investors have joined forces with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to recover losses on more than $47bn in mortgage-backed securities issued by Countrywide Financial, the consumer lender acquired by Bank of America.The eight boldholders, which include BlackRock, Pimco and MetLife, own more than 25 per cent of the voting rights on the securities. The New York Fed inherited its stake in the bonds during the financial crisis.The bondholders argue that BofA violated elements of its servicing agreements. They aim to put back loans that fell short of the underwriting standards stated in the 115 deals.News that such powerful investors would take on BofA re-ignited fears the bank had underestimated the cost of buying back troubled loans. BofA shares fell 4.4 per cent.“We’re not responsible for the poor performance of loans as a result of a bad economy,” a BofA spokesman said. “We don’t believe we’ve breached our obligations as servicer. We will examine every avenue to vigorously defend ourselves.”Kathy Patrick, an attorney representing the investors, wrote to BofA and the trustee of the securities, Bank of New York Mellon, on Monday to express objections. She said her clients first raised their concerns to BoNY in June.When BoNY refused to investigate, the bondholders chose to enforce the put-back policies, she said. “They have 60 days to fix this,” she said. “If they don’t, we can declare an event of default under the servicing agreement.” BofA executives said it had the means to fight individual claims and had set aside $4.4bn in put-back reserves. “If you think about people who come back and say, ‘I bought a Vega, a Chevy Vega, but I want it to be a Mercedes with a 12-cylinder,’ we’re not putting up with that,” said Brian Moynihan, BofA’s chief executive.A BoNY executive said the bank had received the letter, which it said “does not ask Bank of New York Mellon to take any action.” The New York Fed, BlackRock and MetLife declined to comment. A call to Pimco was not returned.
156;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
157;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-10-17T21:15:55Z;US mortgage expenses under scrutiny;;US banks are coming under increasing pressure to set aside extra money for mortgage-related expenses as questions surrounding their foreclosure practices spark broader concerns over how these loans are sold.As banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, report earnings this week, mortgage-related expenses are expected to be a hot topic on investor conference calls. JPMorgan Chase last week increased its reserves for mortgage repurchases by $1bn to $3bn. The bank also set aside an additional $1.3bn to cover mortgage-related litigation.Shaun Donovan, US housing secretary, said on Sunday it was “shameful” that financial institutions might have made the housing crisis worse by improperly processing foreclosures, reported Reuters.Mr Donovan wrote in a column on the Huffington Post website that a comprehensive review of the foreclosure crisis was under way and that the Obama administration would respond with “the full force of law where problems are found”.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have demanded that banks repurchase loans that failed to meet certain underwriting guidelines. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden, such demands could total as much as $44bn. In a note published Friday, Mr Ramsden said banks have so far set aside about half that amount.Separately, investors in private label securities have sued the large banks in an effort to recoup losses on mortgages they say were not underwritten properly. Among the investors that have filed suit are the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh, Seattle and San Francisco, which are demanding a combined $25.6bn, according to a report published in August by Compass Point, a US research firm.These concerns took on a fresh urgency last week after the attorneys-general of all 50 US states launched a joint investigation into the foreclosure practices of major lenders. At issue is whether bank employees rubber-stamped thousands of foreclosure documents without checking their accuracy as required by law. In some cases, judges have ruled against banks when they try to foreclose without the relevant paperwork, including the note and the mortgage that prove they own the loan.BofA, JPMorgan and GMAC have temporarily suspended foreclosures while they examine their procedures.On Friday, Moody’s Investor Service warned that foreclosure irregularities at a MetLife unit could force the company to hold property longer. The MetLife unit, MetLife Home Loans, said it verified mortgage information in the foreclosure filings it processed.The banks also contend the problems are procedural and have not resulted in any improper foreclosures.
158;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;AIG exit plan set to deliver a profit;;The US government took a major step towards ending two years of taxpayers’ assistance to AIG, clinching a deal that could allow the US Treasury to sell its huge stake in the insurer at a profit.Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, celebrated a restructuring plan that “dramatically accelerates” AIG’s repayment of government support.Days before the two-year anniversary of the passage of the main $700bn government bail-out fund, Mr Geithner told the Washington Ideas Forum that losses on the rescue effort should fall below $50bn and that “overwhelming financial force” had saved the financial system.He gave some credit to those Republicans who backed the rescue and signalled that the Obama administration could work with the party if it won a majority at November’s congressional elections.The AIG deal will see the US Treasury exchange its $49.1bn in preferred shares into a 92.1 per cent stake in AIG to be sold in the coming months. AIG shareholders will receive warrants to buy more shares to cushion the blow of the dilution caused by the Treasury’s conversion.Shares in the company rose on Thursday amid investors’ hopes that the company would re-emerge as a standalone entity after 24 months as a ward of the state. It boosted the government’s chances of recovering for taxpayers the unprecedented amount of aid doled out to the corporate sector during the crisis, including $182bn to AIG in debt, equity and credit lines.The New York Federal Reserve, which has lent AIG $20bn and is entitled to $26bn from the sale of the insurer’s assets, will be repaid by the end of March 2011, leaving the Treasury as the company’s sole government paymaster.Robert Benmosche, AIG’s chief executive, called the deal “a pivotal milestone” and, in an interview, said the company was ready to raise funds after a long absence from the markets.A “limited” debt issue could come next month, followed by a share offering of about $2.5bn towards the end of the first quarter of 2011 if credit rating agencies upgrade AIG’s rating to at least single A.Under the plan, AIG will issue common shares to Treasury in the first quarter of 2011. Discounting accrued interest, the Treasury would break even at $28.70. On Thursday the shares rose by more than 4 per cent to $39.10, giving the taxpayer a paper profit. AIG is expected to repay the $20bn it owes the New York Fed by using internal resources as well as the proceeds from the pending sale of Alico, its international life insurance operation, to MetLife and the Hong Kong listing of AIA, its Asian life assurer.

160;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-09-21T23:02:34Z;AIG resurrects plan to sell insurance groups;;AIG has resurrected a plan to sell two Japanese life insurance companies to Prudential Financial of the US and is close to agreeing a deal that would help repay taxpayer funds used to save the the beleaguered US insurer.People familiar with the matter said that Prudential Financial could pay more than $4bn for AIG Star Life Insurance and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co, after more than a year of talks.In what could be a complex deal, the net consideration to AIG could be less than that figure, they added.Negotiations between the two have in the past focused on the regulatory capital required for the businesses as well as the quality of some of the Star-Edison assets, such as their investment portfolios.While a deal could be announced within the next few days, last-minute disagreements could yet derail an announcement, those people warned.AIG and Prudential Financial declined to comment on the deal, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.A deal would leave AIG with little presence in Japan, with the US insurer having sold Alico, its Japan-centred life insurance business, earlier this year to MetLife for $15.5bn.The company is pressing ahead with plans for a listing of AIA, the Asian business whose $35bn sale to the UK’s Prudential collapsed earlier this year.A successful sale of Star-Edison would be another small step for AIG in repaying about $80bn debts to the US Treasury and Federal Reserve. The insurer last month sold most of its consumer finance unit, known as American General Finance, to Fortress Investment Group for a small fraction of its book value.

Insurance companies have the capacity and are keen to transact business,” he added.Most of the business is currently shared between five insurers: Rothesay Life, Aviva, Legal & General, MetLife and the Pension Insurance Corporation. Other players, such as Lucida and the Prudential, are waiting until larger deals come to the market.Mercer research showed the majority of deals were small, with 65 per cent of all the transactions so far in 2010 involving a premium of less than £10m.
162;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;History littered with bail-outs;;"The recent financial crisis was traumatic for the global money market fund industry, with 62 funds being bailed out by the sponsors and one, the Reserve Primary, “breaking the buck” after suffering losses on its $785m (£508m, €610m) of Lehman Brothers debt.However, by some measures, 1994 was a worse year still, with 79 US funds needing the support of their parent, according to Moody’s. It was also the year of the only other default in the near four-decade history of the sector; the $64.8bn Community Bankers Money fund, which reportedly lost money on derivatives. Investors ultimately received $0.961 for every dollar invested. According to Moody’s, 42 of the bailed-out funds were caught out by a sharp rise in US interest rates, with the federal funds rate climbing from 3 to 5.5 per cent during the calendar year.A further 37 funds suffered losses when Orange County, California defaulted on its debts in the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history.In 1999 25 funds had to be propped up after General American Life Insurance defaulted on about $5bn of debt, although the funds were reimbursed when Metropolitan Life Insurance later bought GALI. In 1990, 13 funds were hit at MNC Financial, Mortgage & Realty Trust and Drexel Burnham Lambert, according to Moody’s."
163;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-08-17T10:45:17Z;Private equity and hedge fund money flows into financial services;;Harbinger Capital’s $350m (£225m, €270m) deal to buy the troubled US life-insurance business of Old Mutual, the Anglo-South African financial services group, came as a surprise to many in the City – not least because gossip had long suggested Old Mutual was struggling to generate any serious interest in the asset at all.At the same time, however, many were left asking exactly what Harbinger, a US private equity and hedge fund business, would want with such a heavily regulated business as life insurance. The official answer was that the new owners would be able to juice the returns from the life insurer’s multibillion-dollar assets that back its life-insurance liabilities.Philip Falcone, chief executive of Harbinger Capital Partners, said: “The purchase of Old Mutual’s US business is an attractive proposition. We expect to realise substantial returns from continuing business improvements and Harbinger’s ability to enhance the value of the asset portfolio.”Harbinger has hired outside expertise in the form of Leland C. Launer Jr, former chief investment officer of MetLife, to run the business. Similarly, Transamerica Re, the US life-reinsurance business being sold by Dutch insurer Aegon, is said to have attracted at least initial interest among some financial investors.You would be forgiven for thinking this kind of play had been killed off by the financial crisis. While “the great moderation” lasted and markets – particularly credit markets – seemed set to go only ever in one direction, the idea of betting that you could earn more from a pool of assets than you had promised to pay out was fairly straightforward. This is known as a spread business – and it drove all manner of activity before the crisis. Mortgage bonds and collateralised debt obligations in all their variety were the true froth of this kind of thinking, but it applies as much to traditional annuity businesses – which pay retirement income – and life insurance, though perhaps historically in a less aggressive form.In the UK, specialist monoline annuity businesses were set up to exploit the apparent ease of access to such spread profits and bring competition to the traditional insurance players in the sector. Paternoster – one of the first, and initially most successful, of these – has now been put up for sale as the private equity and hedge fund groups among its backers have given up on hopes that their investment is likely to come good.In spite of this, others are still operating in the sector. Investment banks are increasingly moving into the market for corporate pension risk, too. Many of these banks want only to be traditional intermediaries and are developing capabilities to sell on the various forms of risk that come with long-term annuity business – market, inflation and longevity risks.Goldman Sachs, through its brand Rothesay Life, is the only one so far that is also backing a significant proportion of such deals with its own capital – or taking on the risks itself. But this is based on its view of its own great skill with derivatives trading and risk management, which allows it to earn high returns on an asset portfolio that, for the most part, is likely to consist of gilts. This may give some clue to Harbinger’s strategy – although undoubtedly one of Rothesay’s big contributors to its returns is the large upfront fees it charges to take on pension liabilities.However, it seems extremely unlikely that a wholesale rush into regulated life and pensions business by private equity and hedge fund money is back on. For the most part, where such investors are pursuing deals in the financial services sector it will be particularly the lower-risk infrastructure or administrative-type services where they will hunt for deals, according to investment bankers. But even there they may not find much joy.A consortium of US private equity groups has been successful in its £2bn (€2.4bn, $3.1bn) purchase of WorldPay, the payments processing business of RBS of the UK. Balboa, the mortgage-related home insurance arm of Bank of America, which originally came with its purchase of Countrywide Financial, has apparently attracted the interest of at least 10 private equity groups. But bankers still think this deal and others in the field are far more likely to end up with strategic investors winning out over financial ones.

The investigation concerns sales of the “Premier Access Bond Enhanced Variable Rate Fund” to clients between 2001 and 2008, RBS said.The product was marketed by the AIG-owned company Alico. Alico was sold by AIG to US insurer MetLife in March this year.About 250 Coutts clients are believed to have put money into the bond. Investors in the bond saw their funds frozen in 2008 after AIG was bailed out by the US government. Some claimed they had been missold the products after the value of investments fell.Sir Keith Mills, the entrepreneur who devised the Nectar loyalty card scheme, has accused Coutts of mis-selling the Alico bond to investors after putting £73m (£116m) of his money in the fund.A Coutts spokesperson said the bonds had been advertised as “low-risk” not “no-risk”. He said the private bank would co-operate with the FSA investigation.RBS and the FSA declined to comment because the investigation is ongoing.
165;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-08-06T19:58:21Z;AIG;The bailed-out US insurer is not out of the woods yet;What on earth is one to make of AIG these days? With the US Treasury owning 78 per cent of the insurer, few investors or analysts look at the stock any more. Such was the scale and awfulness of AIG’s demise and subsequent bail-out that most, it seems, would rather put the whole episode behind them.But it is still right that US taxpayers should try to get all their money back. What chance do they have? On Friday, Robert Benmosche, AIG’s president and chief executive, said that in recent weeks the company has sat down with the Federal Reserve to discuss how the insurer will repay the $27bn it still owes in loans and interest, as well as with the Treasury on how the government might eventually exit its equity positions.To recap: AIG’s plan is to shrink right down to international general insurance (property and casualty) plus domestic life assurance. It may also keep insuring mortgages. Everything else has been sold, closed or is probably up for sale. AIG has agreed to flog Alico to MetLife for $15bn, and, post the Prudential deal falling apart, is planning to list its jewel of an Asian operation, AIA, in Hong Kong. Management will be very lucky to get the $30bn the Pru offered, but who knows?All in all, repaying the Fed’s credit line is easily achievable and the Fed’s equity investments in AIA and Alico are attractive ones. Less certain is whether the value of what is left of AIG – CreditSights reckons a mid-case number of $55bn – exceeds the $49bn the government has committed in equity capital. A double-dip recession would also raise concerns about $30bn of taxpayer loans used to buy toxic mortgage securities and derivatives, now held in two special purpose vehicles. For those still interested, AIG is not out of the woods yet.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
166;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-08-06T17:37:11Z;AIG set to clinch sale of finance division;;AIG, the US insurer bailed out by Washington, expects to clinch a sale of its consumer finance unit in the next few weeks and is looking to raise some $4bn in debt to reduce its reliance on federal aid.Robert Benmosche, AIG’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that the company was evaluating bids for American General Finance, its consumer finance unit, and expected to pick a buyer in the next few weeks.AIG, which reported second-quarter results on Friday, put the unit up for sale this year and several private equity groups are believed to have expressed interest. However, a deal in the next few weeks would be quicker than most analysts had expected.The unit, which offers loans to lower income consumers, lost $11m in the quarter, compared with a $202m loss a year earlier. AIG said on Friday that it “may incur a loss” on the sale.Mr Benmosche said AIG was preparing to raise about $4bn in debt to repay a federal loan to International Lease Finance Corp, its aircraft leasing unit.AIG ran into trouble when billions of dollars of credit insurance it sold went bad during the financial crisis. The company owes $101.2bn to the government, including $49bn to the Treasury, which issued preferred shares to AIG under the troubled asset relief programme, and $52.1bn in debt to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The company has been selling non-core assets to help repay that money. This includes a planned divestiture of Alico, a foreign life insurance business, to MetLife, and the spin-off of AIA, its Asian life assurance business, following the collapse in June of a plan to sell the unit to Prudential.In an internal memo to employees on Friday, Mr Benmosche said that, once those deals were completed, “we will be well with-in striking distance of completely repaying the Fed”.He also told the FT that the company was in talks to unwind the Treasury’s investment in the company. One potential solution would be for the Treasury to convert its preferred equity into common stock and sell the shares on the market, similar to what the government is doing with Citigroup, Mr. Benmosche said.AIG lost $2.7bn, or $3.96 per share, in the second quarter, compared with net profit of $1.8bn, or $2.30 a share, a year ago, mainly as a result of a $3.3bn write down of Alico.
167;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-08-02T21:40:18Z;MetLife targets $1bn more for Alico deal;;MetLife said on Monday that it planned to sell an additional $1bn worth of its shares to help finance its acquisition of American International Group’s foreign life assurance division.MetLife said it planned to raise about $3bn from the sale of 75m shares of common stock, up from the $2bn it planned to raise when the acquisition of the unit, called Alico, was announced in March.Although MetLife had not previously disclosed how many shares it planned to sell in the $2bn offering, the number would have been considerably less.Selling more shares will reduce the future earnings per share contribution from the deal by about 5 cents, or 11 per cent, MetLife said in a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.MetLife now expects an increase of 40 cents to 45 cents a share, down from a previous estimate of 45 cents to 50 cents a share.It said the change in financing did not require shareholder approval.Analysts said the step was taken mainly to head off a potential ratings downgrade.A larger stock offering will allow MetLife to reduce the amount of cash-on-hand used to finance the deal. “These financing terms will appease the rating agencies and give them a stronger balance sheet,” said Bret Howlett, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s.Mr Howlett said he expected MetLife would still recognise “significant synergies from the deal” and that the addition of Alico would boost MetLife’s return on equity by a significant amount next year.MetLife’s shares have climbed nearly 10 per cent since it announced the deal in March, and traded up slightly in New York on Monday morning to $42.31, a rise of 0.6 per cent.The $15.5bn purchase of Alico will expand MetLife’s overseas presence, while giving AIG money to repay some of the government assistance it received through the troubled asset relief programme.MetLife has said it will finance the deal with $6.8bn in cash, including the share sale outlined on Monday.The remainder will come from equity securities issued to AIG.MetLife did not say when it would sell the common stock but noted that the offering was based on $42.06 a share, the closing price of its shares on Friday.The company also said that the forecast earnings from the deal did not include transition and other one-time expenses of about 12 cents a share.MetLife has recently seen a big improvement in its business, driven by investment gains, including gains on derivatives.Second-quarter earnings totalled $1.5m, compared with an $817m loss a year earlier.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was slightly lower, closing at 10,465.94, but up 0.4 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,254.70, but lower by 0.4 per cent for the five days. The S&P gained 6.9 per cent in July, its best monthly gain in a year.The market dropped 2.3 per cent at the open after GDP data was released but later trimmed losses.US economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent, coming in just below consensus forecasts of about 2.5 per cent. A larger trade deficit and slower growth in consumer spending meant that the economy expanded less than in the first quarter. The first-quarter figure was revised up to 3.7 per cent from 2.7 per cent.“The picture is of an economy that continues to shuffle along rather than sprint, which is probably not surprising after the leading economic indicators that we’ve seen out since May,” said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer for JPMorgan’s private wealth management business.But both the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index and the Chicago PMI gauge of business activity were slightly better than expected, going some way to soothing investors’ worries.The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary sector led the late day rally, up 0.7 per cent, on news that consumers were feeling less negative than predicted.In earnings news, Chevron reported a threefold rise in quarterly profit as increased output, higher energy prices and wider margins at its refineries helped it top analysts’ profit forecasts. Shares rose 0.3 per cent to $74.89.Insurers Metlife and Aon both rose after reporting better-than-expected second quarter results.Metlife was up 4.6 per cent to $42.06 after it moved back into the black, making second-quarter net income of $1.84 per share after a loss of $1.74 for the same period last year.Recent acquisitions helped offset a fall in commissions at Aon Corporation, the world’s largest insurance brokerage. Earnings per share were 63 cents compared with 50 cents for the same period last year. The shares rose 2.8 per cent to $37.67.But Genworth Financial, the mortgage guarantor and life insurer, slumped 14 per cent to $13.58 after posting a weak second-quarter profit and issuing a cautious outlook.There was positive news from several pharmaceuticals. Merck & Co reported better-than-expected earnings on the back of strong sales of its treatments for diabetes, arthritis and HIV. But the shares fell 1.7 per cent to $34.46 because revenue missed estimates.Drugmaker Warner Chilcott rose 5 per cent to $25.60 after the company raised its full-year outlook.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, rose 2.2 per cent to $54.53 after reporting a better-than-expected second quarter profit. It said that the launch of its new drug for osteoporosis was on track.Biotechnology company Geron jumped 17.3 per cent to $5.63 after it said that the Food and Drug Administration had lifted its hold on an early-stage trial of its embryonic stem cell-based therapy.Charles River Laboratories International fell 2.7 per cent to $31.08 after it agreed to end its merger agreement with Wuxi PharmaTech, paying $30m to break the contract. The company also announced a $500m share buy-back.In deal news, Walt Disneyhas sold film studio Miramax to Filmyard Holdings for more than $660m, ending months of talks between the media group and bidders. Disney shares fell 0.1 per cent to $33.69.

170;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-07-15T22:09:21Z;AIG’s executive revolving door spins again;;They say that breaking up is hard to do. Not at AIG, the bailed-out insurer which has been shedding top managers at an alarming rate since it was rescued by the US government in September 2008.The latest to go is Harvey Golub, chairman for less than a year, who abruptly stepped down on Wednesday after a spectacular falling-out with AIG’s chief executive Bob Benmosche.In a resignation letter that did not even attempt to cloak the rift in the usual diplomatic niceties, Mr Golub said Mr Benmosche had told the board that their working relationship was “ineffective and unsustainable”. Not wanting to ask the board to choose between the two, he continued, he decided to leave “for the simple reason that it is easier to replace a chairman than a CEO”.As the FT reported last month, the recent row between Mr Golub and Mr Benmosche over the failed sale of AIG’s giant Asian arm AIA to Prudential of the UK had exacerbated a simmering power struggle between the pair.Insiders had dubbed the two executives, who were appointed by the US government last August to bring some stability to AIG’s upper echelons, “the odd couple of US insurance” for their strained relationship and bruising manners.Those who know them say that, if anything, Mr Golub, a former chief executive of American Express, and Mr Benmosche, who used to head the insurer MetLife, clashed because their personalities were too similar.Both are used to getting their own way with an aggressive style that can offend underlings and counterparts. Both men thought their job was to lead AIG into repaying $180bn in federal aid and free it from the shackles of government ownership.Mr Benmosche’s supporters say he often felt Mr Golub was acting more like the boss rather than a non-executive chairman.Mr Golub’s camp retorts that Mr Benmosche did little to consult with the board and had a testy, counterproductive relationship with the company’s government paymasters.AIG shares, 80 per cent of which are owned by the government, were down on Thursday more than 2.5 per cent amid a broad sell-off of financial stocks.Yet some AIG watchers believe the latest turmoil could usher in a period of calm, especially if Mr Benmosche can consolidate his power and finds a way of co-operating with the new chairman, Steve Miller, a director of the company.Although Mr Benmosche had argued strongly to accept a price cut in order to complete the sale of AIA to the Pru, and was overruled by the board and Mr Golub, his victory in the power struggle is unlikely to revive a sale of the business.At this week’s board meeting, AIG directors gave the green light to a Hong Kong listing of AIA, a plan that could be scuppered only by the unlikely appearance before the end of the year of a bidder with a spare $30bn-plus.Mr Golub’s name is added to the list of four chief executives and countless senior employees who have left AIG in recent years.Meanwhile, employees have been left to contemplate the irony of a situation in which the company had one chief, Hank Greenberg, for nearly 40 years until 2005, then got through so many chiefs since, in a hotbed of palace intrigue and back-stabbing.
171;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-06-24T21:50:30Z;AIG chiefs at odds over failed sale of AIA;;The failed sale of one of AIG’s crown jewels has strained relationships at the top of the US insurer, increasing tensions between Robert Benmosche, the chief executive, and Harvey Golub, the chairman, according to people close to the situation.The rift between AIG’s two senior executives has triggered concerns within the board and among officials in the US government, the controlling shareholder, who fear one of the two men might leave less than a year after their appointment.The authorities, which own 80 per cent of AIG, have overhauled senior management since rescuing the insurer in late 2008 and further upheaval could complicate plans for the repayment of billions of dollars in bail-out funds.AIG and the US Treasury declined to comment. People close to the situation said the relationship between Mr Benmosche, the outspoken former head of MetLife, and Mr Golub, who used to run American Express, was not yet at breaking point.However, they said that the board’s behaviour in the run-up to this month’s collapse of the proposed sale of AIA, AIG’s large Asian arm, to the UK’s Prudential angered Mr Benmosche and soured his relations with the chairman.Mr Benmosche supported the Pru deal and argued for accepting a reduction of about $5bn in the $35.5bn price to help the UK company win support from its shareholders. But the board, led by Mr Golub, rejected the idea by an overwhelming margin, forcing AIG to go back to its original plan for a listing of AIA.“Benmosche did not take kindly to being outvoted by his own board, especially on such an important matter,” said a person familiar with the matter.Mr Benmosche’s supporters said Mr Golub was acting more as co-chief executive than part-time non-executive chairman and his assertive style was ­stoking tensions. Mr Golub’s camp maintains that the board had a duty to do what was best for investors.Both men enjoy the backing of the board and Barack Obama’s administration. The two were appointed in August when Edward Liddy, the former chairman and chief executive, left amid a political backlash over AIG’s pay policy, and the authorities decided to split the roles. Mr Golub was expected to take the lead in managing AIG’s relationship with the government, with Mr Benmosche focusing on the company’s ­operations.
172;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;MetLife chief slams US financial reforms;;The head of MetLife, the largest life assurer in the US, has criticised the financial reforms being finalised by Congress, saying some measures betray a “total misunderstanding” of the insurance industry and could hit the sector hard.In a video interview with the Financial Times, Robert Henrikson warned of “negative unintended consequences” from a financial overhaul that was too “bank-centric” and failed to take into account insurance companies’ needs.The MetLife chief, who steered the company through the financial crisis without the help of government bail-out funds, said the insurance industry had been “vilified” by Washington, in spite of faring better than the banking sector during the turmoil.Mr Henrikson argued that insurers, which are regulated by states, suffered from not having an interlocutor in Washington, adding that the authorities were missing an opportunity to create a federal insurance agency.“The language that has been worked on has been focused on bank language by bankers or people that have banking knowledge,” said Mr Henrikson. “That language then, without reinterpretation or re­classification . . . could have extremely negative unintended consequences to the insurance industry.”He said insurance groups might have to comply with planned changes to increase the capital banks set aside for derivatives trading, or spin off those businesses altogether, even though their use of those instruments was fundamentally different.Mr Henrikson argued that insurance companies were users rather than providers of derivatives and should be exempted from the new provisions affecting derivatives just like other non-bank entities that buy derivatives to hedge risks.He said the argument that exempting insurers could prompt banks to characterise their derivatives units as insurance “shows a total misunderstanding . . . of how an insurance company operates”.Politicians have taken a tough line against insurers, mainly because AIG was one of the biggest casualties of the turmoil.“The insurance companies want it both ways,” said one congressional aide working on the reforms. “They want to argue that they are not systemically risky . . . they don’t want to be ‘in’ [the new oversight structure] but you’ve got AIG as exhibit A as how insurance companies can be. They’ve got so many assets and frankly those state systems [of regulation and dissolution] are just untested for the big companies.”Mr Henrikson, who succeeded Robert Benmosche, the current AIG chief, at MetLife’s helm in 2006, also warned that insurance companies could be caught by the “Volcker Rule” banning financial groups from taking trading bets with their funds.He said the insurer’s general accounts - which contain premiums paid by customers and are invested by the company - could be included in the activities prohibited by the provision.Mr Henrikson said MetLife’s recent $15.5bn acquisition from AIG of Alico, a large Asian insurer, would significantly boost the company’s international presence and give it a platform for future expansion overseas. Once the deal is completed, the proportion of MetLife’s earnings from outside the US will grow from 15 per cent to 40 per cent.“The fit between the two companies is superb. You couldn’t have designed a company that has a better fit,” he said. “It gives us a very strong global footprint, gives us opportunities in mature markets where we have already shown that we can grow faster than the market, and it gives us an opportunity in developing markets for the future.”
173;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-06-01T22:46:33Z;Fifty words that sunk the deal;;In the end, all it took to sink the $30bn-plus deal to sell AIA, AIG’s Asian crown jewel, to Prudential of the UK was a terse 50-word statement from the US insurer.The last line of the press release – “the company will not consider revisions” to the original terms – killed off the Pru’s offer of a cut-price deal for AIA, opening a period of uncertainty for all three companies.For AIG, the question now is whether the internal debate that preceded the rejection of the Pru’s gambit will leave lasting scars among its management and board and strain the relationship with the US government, its largest shareholder.People close to the situation said Monday’s two consecutive board meetings were contentious, particularly because Robert Benmosche, AIG’s outspoken chief executive, was in favour of the deal.With some in the US government, which stood to receive $25bn (£17bn) under the original deal as part-payment for its bail-out of AIG, also believed to be keen for AIA to be sold, the debate pitted two of the most powerful voices behind AIG against its directors.Mr Benmosche, a former MetLife executive who has a short temper and a robust management style, is believed to have told directors a lower-price deal would have still delivered more than $20bn in cash and sped up the repayment of the $80bn or so AIG owes the government.He thought a partial listing of AIA – AIG’s preferred option before the Pru came along – would have raised less capital, been more time-consuming and would remain hostage to the vagaries of equity markets. The US Treasury supported his view, according to a person familiar with the deliberations, while the New York Federal Reserve, the other AIG paymaster, was non-committal.Yet, AIG’s board was swayed neither by Mr Benmosche’s arguments nor by the wishes of the company’s 80 per cent owners. The second board meeting of the day, from about 9pm to past midnight, ended with an overwhelming vote against the Pru deal.Directors were concerned about criticism from politicians and shareholders had they decided to lower the bid price by some $5bn as well as the Pru’s seeming inability to reassure them its shareholders would approve a revised deal.After Harvey Golub, picked by the government as AIG’s chairman, had asked each director to state their views, the tally left no doubt as to where the board stood. Ten directors expressed their opposition to the revised deal, with only two, including Mr Benmosche, voicing support, said people close to the situation.AIG insiders, however, scoffed at the idea that events called into question Mr Benmosche’s position.Additional reporting by Tom Braithwaite in Washington
174;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-05-31T19:28:36Z;Pru talks stall over reduced AIA valuation;;Prudential was on Monday night still hoping to strike a new deal with US insurer AIG for its Asian arm AIA after several days of talks failed to find common ground between the two sides over a reduced valuation.AIG and the US Treasury, which owns 80 per cent of the US insurer, appear determined to play hard ball over the businesses that the Pru agreed to buy for $35.5bn (£24.4bn) in late February, in spite of the turmoil experienced by markets since then.Advisers to the two sides are attempting to reach a compromise that would be acceptable to the ultimate owners of both businesses – the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve on one side and Prudential’s investors on the other.The Pru was forced to try to persuade AIG back to the negotiating table after some of its biggest investors made clear to the company last week that it would not get the 75 per cent of shareholder backing it needed to approve its takeover and $21bn rights issue.AIG is considering other options in case a sale of the unit falls through, according to people familiar with the situation. One option could be to resurrect the initial public offering of the division, which was planned before the Pru trumped the process with its takeover offer. But AIG could also hang on to AIA, and a person familiar with the situation cautioned AIG would only be willing to do a deal at an appropriate price and was not willing to sacrifice value.In spite of AIG’s difficulties and need for cash, its hand could be strengthened by the relatively smooth sale of Alico, another life insurance business, to MetLife and the news last week that it is also looking to offload its consumer finance unit American General Finance.Meanwhile, the Pru itself could be much better off if the deal fails, according to analysts at CLSA in Hong Kong. The analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday that the extra capital demanded by the Financial Services Authority to approve the Pru’s takeover would restrict its ability to pay dividends.“We believe Prudential will be better off on its own than going through the ordeal of combining operations with AIA,” CLSA said. “Prudential is more pro­active than rivals in banc­assurance and the protection business. It’s got a nice growth profile in Asia on its own.”Markets were closed in the UK and US on Monday, but in Hong Kong the Pru’s shares closed unchanged at HK$61.50.
175;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Sector tries to recover after toxic shock;;A new chapter has opened up in the sorry tale of the alphabet soup of structured products that have already caused hundreds of billions of dollars of losses to banks, insurance companies and other investors around the world.The Securities and Exchange Commission’s charges of fraud against Goldman Sachs, which the bank denies, has put the troubled aspects of structured finance back in the spotlight. It is the biggest action taken against Wall Street in this financial crisis.At the centre of the SEC’s case is a collateralised debt obligation (CDO). Investors bought slices of this CDO backed by mortgage-backed securities (MBS). These MBS were, in turn, backed by extremely risky US subprime mortgages.The housing loans backing such CDOs were offered at the height of the US housing boom in many cases to people with little or no income. As house prices fell, mortgage defaults on these types of home loans soared. The result: close to 100 per cent default rates on some of these CDOs, particularly those dating from 2007.The structured finance fiasco continues to be felt throughout the world, as central banks wonder how much longer they need to buoy liquidity and keep pumping cheap money into wobbly economies. The lack of securitisation and structured finance is a factor that may curb future recoveries.“As of the end of 2009, existing transactions in the securitisation market had provided over $11,000bn in financing to the US economy,” said Charles Scully, head of structured finance at MetLife, in a recent letter to regulators. “However, this number is rapidly declining. The current state of affairs in the securitisation market is preventing it from contributing to US economic recovery at a very critical time.” MetLife’s insurance companies held $72.8bn (£47.7bn, €55.2bn) of structured finance securities at the end of last year. “As a significant investor in the securitisation market, MetLife supports fundamental changes to certain practices in order to ensure the securitisation market’s long-term sustainability as a major financing source for the economy and as a viable investment alternative for MetLife’s general accounts to support many of the insurance products that we sell to our customers,” Mr Scully said. The details of the crisis remain shocking because many of the securities that proved virtually worthless were deemed to be very low-risk at the time. Many had triple A credit ratings – rating agencies like Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s believed they represented the safest possible debt investments. Default was not a risk that was associated with a triple A security.There were numerous factors that fuelled this particular debt crisis. The lax underwriting standards behind many of the subprime loans meant defaults would be higher than had historically been observed. Models that measured and tried to forecast default and correlation risks, associated with different types of debt and derivatives, permeated the investment world. Investors – including the biggest banks and insurance companies – developed a blind faith in these models.When the models proved to be wrong, the losses cascaded around the globe. The subprime mortgage defaults echoed around the financial system because hundreds of billions of dollars worth of securities had been sold that were either backed by those mortgages, or were based on derivatives whose values depended on subprime home loans.Now, investors such as insurance companies that need to invest in debt investments, are asking whether they will again be able to buy structured finance. When it works well, it is a way to pick up some extra yield and gain exposures to risks that are otherwise not available.But the shadow of CDOs and other toxic inventions still looms large. The SEC charges against Goldman Sachs come as efforts continue by regulators and lawmakers around the globe to set new rules that will create confidence in structured finance. There are detailed proposals doing the rounds in the US, with detailed suggestions offered up by senators, and regulators ranging from the SEC to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. In the UK and eurozone there are also many suggestions about how to prevent securitisation from being misused.The changes include proposals for improving underwriting standards, such as requiring banks or other lenders to hang onto 5 per cent of the loans originated so they have “skin in the game”.But what is really proving to be key for investors is getting information they can use.In that way, investors can work out for themselves whether they want to buy securities – without needing to rely on rating agencies.“[What is needed is] performance data on a daily basis on the individual loans that support the securitisation and the implication of this performance for each part of the structure of the securitisation,” says Richard Field, managing director of TYI, a consulting and technology firm.“If all market participants receive equal and full information on a daily basis, they can evaluate the risk and return of the securitisation in both the primary and secondary markets.”At the centre of the crisis – and as is illustrated in the SEC’s case against Goldman Sachs – there was a shocking lack of information about what was actually being bought. Investors outsourced their analysis to rating agencies, or to other managers.Many had no clue what was actually in the deals, and continue to struggle to place a value on them.There are numerous proposals for more disclosure. Questions include how often reports should be updated – daily, weekly or monthly. Should the reports include detailed information at the asset level? At the pool level? At the tranche level? So far, there are no clear answers.There are some concerns that regulators may impose different rules that clash with each other, and investors are urging them to work together.It is also not clear whether different rules will apply to mortgage-backed deals, or to all securitisations, including sectors that have not performed as badly, such as auto loan or credit card backed deals.There are also concerns that it is not just information, but the models underpinning structured finance that need to be reassessed.“As investors we are always in favour of better transparency and more disclosure,” says Ann Simpson, senior portfolio manager at Calpers, the Calfornian pension scheme for public employees, in a comment to the FDIC about new rules for securitisations.“More disclosure should always lead to better informed investment decisions. However many of the problems of the recent financial crisis were a result of poor application and forecasting of the data available,” says Ms Simpson.“Better disclosure will fail to provide for a stronger market if the additional information is simply implemented in the poor models and forecasts which led to the mispricing of risk in the first place.”There are likely to be several more chapters in the story about how, or whether, structured finance recovers from the toxic shocks it has suffered.
176;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-05-07T22:44:40Z;AIG on track to restore performance;;AIG on Friday reported a $1.45bn first-quarter profit, as core property and life assurance operations stabilised and it continued to sell ancillary businesses.The insurance company, which received billions of taxpayer dollars to keep it afloat during the financial crisis, announced plans to sell $51bn of assets in the period. This comprised a $15.5bn deal to divest its American Life Insurance to MetLife and another that would see UK insurer Prudential buy AIG’s Asian operations for $35.5bn. AIG said the money would help repay $94.8bn in government aid.The Prudential deal suffered a setback this week when the company delayed a $21bn share sale to finance the transaction over regulatory concerns about the combined company’s capital levels.Robert Benmosche, chief executive, said on Friday that AIG continued “to work closely with Prudential on the sale of AIA”. He added that AIG in the quarter continued “to make great progress in not only stabilising our business, but also in restoring the strength of AIG’s operating performance”.Catherine Seifert, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s, said the troubled AIA deal highlighted the “enormous amount of execution risk facing the company”.In spite of better-than-expected results that Ms Seifert called “encouraging”, she also pointed out that much of the earnings improvement came from a gain on certain investments.“This is a company on the mend,” Ms Seifert said. “Progress has been made, but they are still at a critical juncture.”AIG’s first-quarter profit of $1.45bn compares with a loss of $4.35bn a year ago.Earnings at the company’s property and casualty insurance business, called Chartis, rose 24 per cent to $879m, mostly on improved investment income. Results include catastrophe losses of $481m, partly related to the Chilean earthquake, compared with a year ago, when there were no catastrophic events.The domestic life assurance and retirement division, now called SunAmerica Financial Group, swung to a $1.1bn profit, against a $160m loss a year ago. The financial services unit at the heart of AIG’s problems narrowed its loss to $474m, compared with $1.1bn a year earlier, as it continued to unwind a derivatives position.
177;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-05-07T18:45:21Z;Prudential hopes remain for an AIA deal;;Prudential might be struggling to reach a deal with regulators this weekend over its $35.5bn takeover of AIG’s Asian businesses but it has strong vested interests, particularly in the US, willing the UK life assurer to get its deal over the line.These include not only the banks underwriting the financing, for whom a staggering $1bn of fees are up for grabs, but also for senior US executives at the leading banks behind the deal and at AIG itself.A failure to get the Pru deal done would be an embarrassment for AIG and the US authorities, who swapped their bird-in-the-hand of the AIA initial public offering, which was on track to go ahead last month, for the greater immediate cash prize of a sale to the Pru.Between AIG and the US authorities, it is the stricken US insurance group that is least sanguine about the delay to the Pru’s $21bn rights issue, which came this week after the UK company failed to get clearance from the Financial Services Authority over whether it would have enough capital following a deal.The last-minute cancellation of the launch of the rights issue has caused huge embarrassment for the Pru’s chairman and chief executive, Harvey McGrath and Tidjane Thiam, and thrown the whole timetable for a shareholder vote, the listing of Pru shares in Asia and the fundraising into deep uncertainty.This has deeply unnerved some investors, particularly as it comes as markets react badly to fears over the financial strength of some European countries, the exposure of many banks and insurers to sovereign debt and political uncertainty in the UK after the failure of the general election to deliver a clear result.The Pru on Friday was holding to its earlier statement that it still expected to complete the deal in the third quarter – as was AIG, which said when it issued first-quarter results that it still expected to sell AIA this year.Within the results, AIG disclosed better results for AIA, Alico, which it is selling to MetLife for $15bn, and Nan Shan, a Taiwanese business it is also selling. The three units combined saw a small increase in premiums to $6.5bn from $6bn in the first quarter last year, but a big improvement in GAAP profits to $1.14bn from $152m.AIG, driven by its hard-charging chief executive Bob Benmosche, is keen to divest businesses, raise cash and pay back the government as soon as possible to try to reinvent itself as a smaller, less risky company.A failure to sell AIA or Alico could hurt its business and financial results. “Alternative plans to dispose of AIA or Alico may be difficult to structure and may take extended periods of time to implement,” AIG said yesterday. “AIG may not be able to realise equivalent value for AIA or Alico under an alternative asset disposition plan.”If the Pru is forced to abandon its AIA takeover, it will also be a blow to Brady Dougan and Jamie Dimon, the chief executives of Credit Suisse and JPMorgan respectively. The two men stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr Thiam when he made his final pitch to the AIG board and representatives of the US authorities at a meeting in the US group’s historic Pine Street headquarters on Friday February 26. Each bank chief spoke in support of the Pru’s and their own institutions’ ability to execute the deal, which helped clinch the agreement for a takeover that was announced the following Monday.The US authorities, by contrast, have less riding on a failure of the takeover, even though the deal is due to bring them $25bn. They can afford now to play a longer game as the political pressure on AIG has abated and better financing and capital markets have helped the troubled insurer to improve its financial health.However, for the Pru, sorting out its problems with the UK regulator is only half the story – it must still then get approval from investors, some of whom are increasingly likely to vote against the deal when they get their chance. Some large investors are beginning to buy shares with the specific intent of voting “no”, according to bankers.“What’s really odd here is that there are two sets of investors who have the same view of the deal – that it looks bad – but are pursuing totally different strategies,” says one London-based banker.“One side is shorting the stock with the idea that it will go through but prove incredibly costly, while the other is buying shares because they think the deal will fall apart.”…………………………………….AIG on track to restore operating performance after strong quarterAIG on Friday reported a $1.45bn first-quarter profit, as core property and life assurance operations stabilised and it continued to sell ancillary businesses, writes Suzanne Kapner in New York.The insurance company, which received billions of taxpayer dollars to keep it afloat during the financial crisis, announced plans to sell $51bn of assets in the period. This comprised a $15.5bn deal to divest its American Life Insurance to MetLife and another that would see UK insurer Prudential buy AIG’s Asian operations for $35.5bn. AIG said the money would help repay $94.8bn in government aid.The Prudential deal suffered a setback this week when the company delayed a $21bn share sale to finance the transaction over regulatory concerns about the combined company’s capital levels.Robert Benmosche, chief executive, Friday said AIG continues “to work closely with Prudential on the sale of AIA.” He added that AIG in the quarter continued “to make great progress in not only stabilising our business, but also in restoring the strength of AIG’s operating performance”.Catherine Seifert, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s, said the troubled AIA deal highlighted the “enormous amount of execution risk facing the company”.In spite of better-than-expected results that Ms Seifert called “encouraging,” she also pointed out that much of the earnings improvement came from a gain on certain investments.“This is a company on the mend,” Ms Seifert said. “Progress has been made, but they are still at a critical juncture.”AIG’s first-quarter profit of $1.45bn compares with a loss of $4.35bn a year ago.Earnings at the company’s property and casualty insurance business, called Chartis, rose 24 per cent to $879m, mostly on improved investment income. Results include catastrophe losses of $481m, partly related to the Chilean earthquake, compared with a year ago, when there were no catastrophic events.The domestic life assurance and retirement division, now called SunAmerica Financial Group, swung to a $1.1bn profit, against a $160m loss a year ago. The Financial Services unit at the heart of AIG’s problems narrowed its loss to $474m, compared with $1.1bn a year earlier as it continued to unwind a derivatives position.
178;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;More schemes eye bulk annuities;;Almost half of UK pension trustees will consider using bulk annuities to remove as much risk as possible from their pension schemes within the next two years, according to a survey from MetLife Assurance.“Economic events appear to have accelerated trustees’ focus on pension de-risking,” said Dan DeKeizer, chief executive of MetLife.The timing of any transaction is key, however, as the cost of buy-outs varies with interest rates, while a pension scheme’s ability to pay will vary also with the level of its assets.While the recent doubling of the real yield on UK government bonds may have helped make buy-outs more affordable, a complete buy-out is still beyond the reach of most schemes’ pockets.“I don’t think we’d expect to see large schemes moving straight to full buy-out in one go,” said Jay Shah, a partner at Pension Corporation, which is active in the market.Pension Corp has just launched a “pension risk transfer affordability index” showing how pension assets have moved as a proportion of buy-out cost. Despite recent improvements, a complete risk transfer is still 20 per cent more expensive than it would have been at the end of 2007.“The whole mindset is about establishing a plan for moving toward full buy-out,” said Mr Shah, who predicted trustees would make those moves piecemeal, using buy-ins, where the insurance company would take on the liabilities only for part of the scheme, usually the pensioners already claiming benefits, or longevity swaps, where the pension scheme pays to get rid of the risk that pensioners will live longer than budgeted for.Although transferring pension risk seems attractive, trustees are very aware there is an additional risk inherent in bringing a new party into the equation. Nearly three-quarters of the MetLife’s survey respondents said financial strength was the most important attribute in a bulk annuities provider, trumping affordability, which was a priority for just 23 per cent.
179;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

181;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;AIG’s Taiwan sale hit by regulator scrutiny;;The attempted $2.2bn purchase of AIG’s Taiwan insurance unit by a Hong Kong consortium is facing intense scrutiny amid lingering concerns among regulators that the buyers are backed by Chinese funds.Last October, AIG agreed to sell Nan Shan, one of the island’s top insurers, to a consortium led by Primus Financial, a financial services fund, but approval for the deal has been bogged down by a tough regulatory probe.The largest member of the consortium is China Strategic, a Hong Kong-listed battery maker whose new business focus is financial services.China Strategic’s unexpected involvement in the bid has fuelled concerns in Taiwan that the company could be backed by Chinese funds. Taiwan has strict limits on permitted levels of investment from the mainland.Both Primus and China Strategic have denied having mainland backing and remain confident that they will secure approval.While AIG will be keen to secure a sale, the pressure to raise funds to repay its debts to the US government have receded in recent days.AIG last week announced the sale of its Asian life insurance assets to Prudential of the UK for $35.5bn and this week sealed a deal to divest American Life Insurance Company to MetLife for $15.5bn.China Strategic appeared to have passed one hurdle as Huang Chung-chiu, Taiwan’s deputy economics minister, told legislators on Thursday that a review of documents showed that its backers were not mainland Chinese nationals, but carried British and Hong Kong passports.However, Wu Chung-chuan, deputy director-general of the insurance bureau at the Financial Supervisory Commission, said his department still had “more than 40 unanswered questions” after reviewing China Strategic’s initial application.Mr Wu said some of the regulator’s concerns include whether China Strategic and Primus have the professional skills to run Nan Shan, and whether they have the capacity to raise further funds to support the company in the future.“Our hope [is] that they can provide sufficient information to convince the regulators and the general public,” said Mr Wu.Mr Wu said there was no deadline on how long regulators could take to review the case, although some government officials believe it could be decided within two months.The sensitivity of the Nan Shan deal is highlighted by the fact that representatives from eight different government departments sit on a special review committee, and each has to give its approval to China Strategic’s application material before the ministry of economic affairs can conduct final due diligence.China Strategic plans to sell on just over one third of its 80 per cent stake in Nan Shan to Chinatrust, a local banking group, should regulators allow the takeover.Nan Shan is Taiwan’s second-largest life insurer with more than 4m customers and 35,000 sales agents. A sale would be the largest takeover of a local financial group by foreign buyers.
182;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-03-09T01:34:43Z;AIG sells Alico to MetLife for $15.5bn;;AIG on Monday took another step away from its troubled past, selling Alico, its non-US life assurance business, to domestic rival MetLife for $15.5bn in cash and securities in a deal that will enable it to settle part of its debts to US taxpayers.The acquisition of Alico – a cornerstone of AIG’s overseas success over more than 70 years – will transform MetLife from a company largely focused on the US into a group with 90m customers in 64 countries.The long-awaited sale of Alico, first reported by the FT in July, will give the US government an indirect stake of up to 20 per cent in MetLife alongside its 80 per cent ownership of AIG.Although the US authorities will not be allowed to vote against decisions taken by other MetLife shareholders, the federal government will find itself in the unusual position of owning large stakes in two of the country’s largest insurers.Bill Toppeta, president of MetLife’s international business, told the FT the government’s stake was “not an issue”. “Having the interests of the US government and US taxpayers aligned with those of MetLife is a positive,” he said.Under the deal, a special purpose vehicle controlled by the New York Federal Reserve will receive $6.8bn in cash and $8.7bn in MetLife shares and other securities. The cash will go towards repaying some of the $9bn in preferred equity the Fed injected into the vehicle after one of its many bail-outs of AIG.The SPV will be allowed to begin selling some MetLife shares nine months after the Alico sale is completed. MetLife said it expected the deal to close at the end of the year.The divestments of Alico and AIA would leave AIG with a debt of about $8bn to the New York Fed as well as $47bn worth of bail-out funds.Shares in MetLife were 5.1 per cent higher at $40.90 in New York, while AIG’s shares were up 3.6 per cent at $29.10.

185;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-03-06T01:47:42Z;AIG near deal on divesting Alico to MetLife;;AIG is close to agreeing to sell Alico, its international life assurance business, to MetLife for about $15bn in cash and shares in a deal that would further reduce its indebtedness to US taxpayers.People close to the situation said AIG’s board was due to discuss the deal for Alico, one of the company’s biggest units, this weekend and an announcement could come as early as Monday.AIG and MetLife declined to comment.The terms of the sale were being finalised and could change, but insiders said MetLife was likely to pay about $7bn in cash and the rest in common stock and preferred shares.A person close to the situation said the shares were likely to have no voting rights and AIG, which is 80 per cent owned by the US government, would be required to hold them for an undisclosed period before being allowed to sell.The New York Federal Reserve, which has repeatedly bailed out AIG, stands to receive up to $9bn from the sale.The Fed is due to receive a further $25bn once the $35.5bn sale of AIA, AIG’s huge Asian arm, to Prudential of the UK is completed.If the Fed receives $9bn from the Alico deal and the sale of AIA goes through, AIG would still have to repay $14.4bn under a credit line and $47bn it received from the US Treasury.The sale of Alico and AIA would mark the end of AIG’s history as an international group spanning life and general insurance.The proposed divestment of Alico to MetLife, which was first reported by the Financial Times in July, had been expected for some weeks but was held up by a last-minute question over tax liabilities.In order to avoid a future charge, MetLife asked the Internal Revenue Service to confirm that, since Alico sold most of its policies outside the US, it did not have to withhold US taxes on distributions to foreign policyholders.People close to the situation said that the IRS had sent the companies a letter this week stating that tax would not be an issue.Alico is headquartered in Delaware but operates in more than 50 countries.The company, which was founded in China in 1921 and was one of the AIG’s first businesses, has more than 19m customers.The purchase of Alico would boost MetLife’s presence outside the US, giving it a stronghold in Asia, one of AIG’s strengths.
186;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-03-01T11:17:30Z;AIG and Pru close to $35bn Asian deal;;AIG and Prudential are close to agreeing the sale of AIA, the US life group’s Asian business, to the UK’s biggest insurer for about $35bn in cash, shares and other securities, in a deal expected to be announced this week.After a weekend of tense talks, the board of the government-controlled US insurer decided to press ahead with the sale of AIA, one of the jewels in AIG’s crown, and scrap a planned $10bn-$20bn partial listing of the unit, people close to the situation said. No deal has yet been sealed and the talks could still collapse but under the terms being discussed, Prudential would pay about $25bn in cash and the remaining $10bn in shares and other securities such as preferred stocks and options.Buying AIA would represent a stunning coup for Prudential. It would transform the group – which already books a third of its global sales in Asia – into the dominant foreign group in the region and the insurance equivalent of a Standard Chartered or HSBC. A deal would more than double the size of Prudential and mean that its business would be dominated by Asian sales and profits.In order to raise the funds needed to buy AIA, Prudential will have to complete one of the biggest secondary share sales ever, equal to or larger than, its market value of about $23bn – a prospect that might worry its shareholders.News of the talks between AIG and Prudential could prompt competing bidders to emerge, although people familiar with the situation thought that was unlikely.Both Prudential and AIG declined to comment.The US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve, which together have an 80 per cent stake in AIG following repeated bail-outs of the insurer, have been consulted, insiders said. The US authorities will receive the first $16bn from any sale of AIA as part payment for the $80bn-plus that AIG owes them.AIG is already in advanced talks with its US rival MetLife over the $15bn-$20bn sale of Alico, its international insurance arm.An outright sale to the Pru would allow AIG to realise a larger portion of the value of the Asian business immediately, even though the final price is likely to fall below the $40bn-$45bn valuation that AIA could have commanded in a Hong Kong listing.JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse are advising the Pru and HSBC has been lined up to help with the financing. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs advised AIG while Blackstone advised AIG’s board.
187;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-03-01T09:20:59Z;The mandarin from the Pru;AIA suggests yet again bigger is seen as better;Has really so little changed? UK insurance company Prudential is today expected to announce the purchase of AIA, the Asian assets of state-owned AIG, forestalling a planned Hong Kong initial public offering. With the ringing of crisis alarm bells barely fading from earshot, financial institutions are once again lusting after transformation and grabbing ever greater size.Buying AIA would be no ABN Amro, however – the 2007 investment banking deal that fatally wounded Royal Bank of Scotland and Fortis. Prudential and AIA are the two largest pan-Asian insurers and, combined, would dominate a region where populations are young, have relatively few debts and hold savings largely in low interest-bearing bank accounts. Three quarters of assets for the new group would be in Asia, from the 35 per cent held there by Prudential now.AIA is also a well established (and cash generative) business. Still, Pru will have to find $30bn to $35bn (£20bn to £23bn) to seal the deal, more than its current £15bn market capitalisation. It will also be paying about 1.5-1.7 times embedded value, when European insurers typically hover about one times. But valuations are racier in Asia – French insurer Axa, for instance, is to pay 2.8 times embedded value to buy out the half of its Asia-Pacific business it doesn’t own – and this may be an opportunity for the Pru to bring Asian investors into the fold.Meanwhile, the US government (which owns four-fifths of AIG) would probably prefer cash up front to waiting up to three years to sell down its stake on the markets. If a deal is embraced by the Pru’s shareholders, expect more insurance consolidation to follow. MetLife is already in talks to buy Alico from AIG for $15bn. Bigger will be seen as better, once again.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
188;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-02-22T22:13:10Z;US housing market hit by ‘walkaways’;Mortgage holders in negative equity hand back the keys in despair;Wayne B, a 62-year-old executive who works at an airport, and his wife Orapin, a dental assistant, are about to do something odd. The couple, with a pristine credit history, have decided to default on their $500,000 (£325,000, €370,000) mortgage on a townhouse in Livermore, a respectable city in California’s San Francisco Bay area.It is not that they are unable to afford the $4,600 monthly mortgage outgoings: they have never missed a payment. But the house they bought for $582,000 in May 2006 – at the peak of the US housing boom – is now not likely to be worth more than $315,000.“The process towards a default has started,” says Wayne, whose lender does not yet know it will soon be left nursing losses on yet another foreclosed house – and one whose owner, among the top-rated in terms of creditworthiness, is an implausible-sounding default risk. “We plan to retire in four years and will not be able to afford the mortgage payments then,” he explains. “The loss if we sell will be so large that, after doing a lot of research, we have made a business decision to walk away.”The high level of foreclosures in the US – the handing over of homes to banks that lent people money to buy them – has been a huge burden on the economy, has kept house prices on a downward spiral and has resulted in misery and anxiety for millions of people. In some areas so many homes have been abandoned that the entire community has fallen apart as schools close, public services are cut and homes are ransacked for fittings or taken over by criminals. That has also sent property values plunging for those people still in their homes and paying mortgages.Stemming foreclosures is a key policy objective of President Barack Obama’s administration. Various programmes are being worked on to modify people’s mortgages in an attempt to reduce payments so that the mortgages are not defaulted on, but so far with only limited success.The US housing crisis and the foreclosure wave have also been the fuel behind hundreds of billions of dollars in losses for banks and investors around the world – owners either of the defaulted mortgages themselves or of securities linked to their value. Famously, the biggest source of losses came from subprime mortgages– loans given in cavalier fashion to people with poor credit histories. When those borrowers began to default, it triggered the most widespread collapse of housing prices across the US seen since the 1930s.Prices are still falling. So the extent of losses banks and investors will have to take on mortgages that are still being paid every month, but may not be for longer, hangs large over the US economy. Without a recovery in house prices, consumer spending and confidence in the US is expected to remain muted, reducing the potential for economic growth.Further losses on mortgages could result in more pain for banks, too, reducing the amount of new credit that they can make available to consumers and businesses. This, in turn, would have knock-on effects for the global economic outlook, as the US remains one of the biggest drivers of international trade and commerce.The behaviour of people like Wayne could therefore be crucial. With a growing number of Americans facing negative equity – where the mortgage exceeds a property’s current market value – and becoming ever more pessimistic about the prospects of house prices recovering to make up that difference, they are surrendering to foreclosure even though they can still meet the repayments.The trend is clear in recent rates of non-payment, or delinquency, on mortgages. In January, delinquencies on outstanding “jumbo” mortgages – big loans granted to people with good credit histories – rose to 9.6 per cent, according to Fitch Ratings. Many of these problem loans, which have gone unserviced for 60 days or more, were taken out after 2005. And non-payment is increasing not just in hard-hit states such as California: in New York, Florida, Virginia and New Jersey they are all on the rise too.“These are all states where many of the mortgage holders are educated people and it is easy to connect the dots and conclude that these people are deciding it is no longer worth paying a mortgage if they are under water,” says Ivy Zelman, a housing market analyst.She expects US house prices could fall another 10 per cent under the combined weight of the build-up of unsold foreclosed houses, cash-strapped people unable to keep paying mortgages and people facing negative equity deciding simply to hand over their home to their banks.Aclose look at mortgage payment trouble spots shows that the higher the negative equity, the higher the rate of non-payments. Fitch has found that for all the mortgages provided in the private market, householders with no equity have a delinquency rate of nearly 40 per cent, double that of homeowners who have a stake in their property.For those with mortgages worth 50 per cent more than their homes, the delinquency figures are over 50 per cent, and these fall as the ratios fall.Particular concern surrounds defaults by people who merely face negative equity rather than monthly funding problems. These “strategic defaults” may be accelerating as more people shrug aside societal pressure to meet debts if they can.In previous housing downturns, the vast majority made every effort to pay their mortgage, which tended to be the last debt that was defaulted on. Now, as mortgages have become a more impersonal transaction (long-term relationships are rarely built up with mortgage brokers, and many homeowners knew their loans would have been repackaged into bonds and sold to investors around the globe), patterns have changed. As more people move around to find work or better living circumstances, they have less of a “home for life” approach to their houses – and mortgages no longer have so special a status.Nevertheless, giving up on such a debt is still something that often causes emotional turmoil. Shasta Gaughen, a 39-year-old PhD graduate in anthropology who works with a Native American tribe in California, a few weeks ago stopped paying her mortgage. The one-bedroom condominium she bought for $196,000 in October 2005 is now worth just $60,000 and she has decided to default, “after two years of agonising”.“The biggest problem is trying to convince myself it is not morally wrong to walk away,” she says. “I’m approaching my home as an investment that went bad. I’m not stealing anything, the bank will get the property. But my parents raised me to be responsible.” She has decided the “responsible” thing for her to do is get out of the flat and rent somewhere else for less than the $1,200 monthly mortgage payments.A mortgage default could make renting a little more expensive but landlords already have signs out saying “bad credit accepted”.The problems with negative equity are known, but so far there is no government strategy for tackling it. One concern is that giving some homeowners a reduction on their loans (a loss the banks would have to take on the chin) could evoke resentment among others who did not qualify and might themselves stop payments. Ideas to limit this “moral hazard” include requiring homeowners to give the mortgage lender a stake in the house if a loan is refinanced, meaning that any future price gains would be shared between homeowner and lender.“Negative equity is a big challenge. It contributes to higher delinquency and redefault rates,” Seth Wheeler, senior adviser at the US Treasury, told a conference this month. “We will continue to study the reduction of principal where appropriate,” he adds, though the form it would take has not yet been determined.Many mortgage investors and housing experts believe it has to be dealt with. “The housing problems run very deep, but so far policies have just kicked the can down the road,” says Laurie Goodman, analyst at Amherst Securities, a broker that specialises in mortgage investments. “To get an economic recovery you need to fix the housing problem. And to fix the housing problem, you need to fix the negative equity problem.”As well as banks, investors owning the mortgages that were repackaged in the last decade are also concerned that there will be further losses on many of these bonds that have already fallen in value. With foreclosure patterns difficult to predict as even people with excellent credit histories and high incomes choose to default, it becomes harder to determine which securities will keep paying and which will not. Foreclosures eventually feed through to reduced interest payments on the securities.This matters, not least because the private financing of mortgages in the US is at a virtual standstill. The market is all but entirely financed by the US government through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the country’s twin federally backed mortgage agencies.Nancy Mueller Handal, managing director at Metlife, a large insurance company, says nearly one-quarter of the group’s assets are invested in mortgage-backed securities. However, she says Metlife will not buy new securities until it knows what will happen to the current ones – and whether investors will have to absorb the resulting losses. The lack of clarity on foreclosures and house prices means she is still not sure whether the value of the securities will fall further.In the meantime, Ms Gaughen is waiting to hear from her bank, Bank of America. She has hired You Walk Away, a company that offers legal advice, tracks the documentation process and lets people know how close they are to eviction.You Walk Away estimates that she can live in the apartment without paying the mortgage for 12-16 months, leaving her with a nest-egg of cash at the end. Jon Maddux, chief executive, says the time people can stay has been steadily growing. His company, which charges a flat fee of around $1,000 for its services, started just over two years ago. At that time, most of his clients were extremely agitated and phone calls were often peppered with tears, Mr Maddux says.Now, most customers are much less emotional about the information they are seeking. He estimates that 80 per cent of people signing up for advice are – like Wayne B in Livermore – paying their mortgages but opting to default anyway. “It is now a business decision that more and more people are choosing to make.”
189;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-02-16T18:30:18Z;Cleaning up toxic mortgage assets a slow task;Owners of different tranches of debt fight for control;With $45bn of investments in securities backed by US mortgages – or nearly a quarter of the insurance group’s total assets – it is no overstatement to say that MetLife is a heavyweight in the mortgage market.As efforts continue on restoring the damaged market, the actions by investors such as MetLife will prove key in any revival.So far, private financing for mortgages has failed to recover from the crisis, unlike many other parts of the capital markets. In the US, government-backed mortgage agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide funds for nearly all new mortgages. The market was a big source of toxic assets where many hundreds of billions of triple A rated securities proved anything but bulletproof as house prices across the US fell and mortgage defaults soared.For now, however, MetLife is not planning to buy any more debt backed by private-sector mortgages. Nancy Mueller Handal, managing director at MetLife, says much of this is down to the issue of which lenders take losses first when a homeowner is in trouble.Many of the securities MetLife owns are backed by so-called “first-lien” mortgages, usually the main mortgage taken out on people’s homes. Many people also took out additional loans on their homes in recent years. Providers of these so-called “second-lien” mortgages should, in theory, take losses before the first-lien does. But a fight for rights is brewing as, so far, there has been resistance to this by banks and other holders of these second-lien mortgages.“Without a clear solution to the inversion of bondholder rights and some clarification around the position of second-lien holders it’s going to be difficult to invest,” Ms Handal said recently at an American Securitization Forum conference.Such a tussle for position as investors seek to get as large a share as possible of assets from a debtor in distress is a well-worn part of investing in the debt markets. But the huge surge in different types of capital in the past decade, such as the growth in second-lien mortgages, means that many of the rules in cases of distress are untested.It became common not just for securities backed by mortgages to be sliced and diced into different tranches representing different levels of risk, but also for the underlying loans to have different risk characteristics.This applies not just to residential real estate, but also to loans made on commercial properties such as office blocks and shopping malls. As real estate values have plunged, there are increasing fights between holders of different parts of the debt. Some want properties to pull the plug, so that they get repaid. Others who stand to lose from such an event due to the current low property values want to buy time in the hopes that values will rise in future.“When many of these transactions were closed, debt investors, even those holding subordinated classes of securities, thought the likelihood of significant losses was quite low,” says Kenneth Lore, co-chairman of the real estate department at Bingham McCutchen. “Now, with property values having fallen so dramatically, the losses are suddenly very real.”“To make matters worse, values of the underlying assets are quite uncertain,” he adds. “The result is that major issues have arisen between investors who occupy different positions in the credit stack – resulting in so-called tranche warfare as owners of different tranches of debt fight for control. Holders of senior positions want to liquidate, while holders of more junior tranches want to have time for values to stabilise.”The fight among different types of debtholders means the cleaning up of problem assets – even those no longer priced at toxic levels – will be a slower task.There are also often many different perspectives on the clean-up strategies. In the case of US residential mortgages, there are some investors who have recently softened their stance on bondholder rights somewhat, relative to that of MetLife, for example.Micah Green of Patton Boggs, which works for a group of mortgage investors dubbed the Mortgage Investors Coalition, says that investors are trying to ensure they are coming up with practical solutions to the mortgage problem. Even though many investors are prepared to shoulder losses by reducing in the size of mortgages to reflect negative equity in homes, such private sector principal reduction plans may require support from the government which has backed mortgage refinancing programmes.“Philosophically, there are no investors who do not still believe that first-lien holders should not take losses until second-lien holders have,” Mr Green says. “From a practical standpoint, however, some investors are now proposing that first-lien and second-lien mortgage holders take proportional reductions in principal.”As the tussles continue, the stakes are high. Whether or not private financing of US mortgages resumes could play a role in whether the US housing market recovers, which in turn could affect the US economic picture. “If we don’t see a recovery in securitisation we will see another [housing downturn],” says Ms Handal. “We would like to see a lot of these conflicts of interest resolved in order to move forward.”The bursting of the US property bubble has left the thousands of small community banks round the US holding real estate assets such as housing developments and shopping malls that have lost value, writes Michael Mackenzie.Compounding the exposure to ailing real estate is the fact these banks also purchased collateralised debt obligations and other structured securities linked to property values and mortgage loans.According to SecondMarket, a trading platform that specialises in illiquid securities, community banks each have anywhere from $20m to more than $100m in toxic assets. “Not a large number, but when you multiply it by 8,000 it becomes a much bigger figure,” says Elton Wells, head of structured products at SecondMarket. He estimates US community banks hold about $600bn of impaired structured assets.When the financial crisis intensified in 2008, many of these securities effectively became frozen, with Wall Street banks that had sold the securities often shying from helping investors looking to value and sell them.This has created an opportunity for new trading platforms, such as SecondMarket. The company’s online securities auction platform has more than 5,000 participants, including banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, mutual funds, corporations and other institutional investors, and offers an alternative to trades dominated by big Wall Street firms.In reality, many structured products linked to mortgages are worth only a fraction of their previous face value. Recently, a bank sold CDOs for 1 per cent of their $30m face value via SecondMarket, netting $300,000. Another bank sold a $92m holding in a housing project for $30m.One community banker in Texas found the best bid for $14m Trust Preferred CDO through SecondMarket was just $11,000, and marked it down to that figure in the hope the market recovers over time.Mr Wells says quotes for such CDOs range as low as 1 cent, to 10 cents in the dollar, with most in the 2 to 3 cent area.“SecondMarket helps us understand where to go and [find] opportunities,” says the banker. He heard of the platform through a lawyer in LittleRock, illustrating how news of platforms such SecondMarket has spread beyond the more usual Wall Street groups that long dominated these markets.
190;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-02-11T22:37:57Z;Goldman wins bookrunner role in AIA listing;;"Goldman Sachs has been chosen as one of the banks that will manage the $10bn-plus
listing of AIG’s Asian unit– in spite of the political controversy over Goldman’s actions during the insurer’s near-collapse in 2008.People close to the situation said Goldman was one of seven banks that had been selected as bookrunners for the initial public offering of AIA, AIG’s flagship life insurance division.AIA’s listing on the Hong Kong stockmarket, which is expected later this year, is
crucial to AIG’s plans to start repaying the $80bn-plus it owes the US authorities.Goldman’s selection underlines its strength as an equity underwriter in Asia and the fact that the political storm in the US over its role during AIG’s crisis has not soured its relations with the insurer and its government paymasters.The US government owns 80 per cent of AIG after bailing it out in September 2008.Goldman’s role, alongside Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS, as well as two Chinese lenders, will ensure that the Wall Street firm shares in
the estimated $300m in fees the giant IPO is expected to generate.Bookrunners will receive a lower proportion of the fees than Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank, the two global co-ordinators for the AIA share sale.However, competition for bookrunner roles had been particularly fierce because of the IPO’s size. It is expected to be the world’s largest this year.Members of Congress have attacked the government’s decision to rescue AIG and pay its counterparties, including Goldman, billions of dollars owed under derivatives contracts without demanding a discount, as a back-door rescue of the banks. Goldman’s critics have also questioned its aggressive stance in demanding
collateral on derivatives from AIG before the insurer ran into deep trouble in 2008.Goldman has rebuffed the attacks, saying it would not have lost money had AIG gone under and arguing that it had not been particularly aggressive in asking for collateral.Both Goldman and AIG declined to comment on Thursday.The selection of the seven bookrunners, representing almost every global bank with capability to assist with the IPO, will come as a huge relief to those involved as it will also allow them to claim “league table” credit for the large deal. The overseas arms of China Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will also be acting as bookrunners on the IPO.Separately, AIG is close to announcing the expected sale of Alico, its international
insurance arm, to MetLife for about $15bn."
191;MET;Metlife Inc;2010-01-25T19:30:49Z;Tishman walks away from Stuyvesant venture;;Tishman Speyer said on Monday that it would give up control of its Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties, putting an end to a venture that came to symbolise the boom and bust of New York’s commercial real estate market.This month, the Tishman and BlackRock-led venture missed a $16m loan payment, triggering a default on its mortgage and bringing the properties to the brink of foreclosure.The properties were bought in 2006 for $5.4bn but are now estimated to be worth less than $2bn.“We make this decision as we feel a battle over the property or a contested bankruptcy proceeding is not in the long-term interest of the property, its residents, our partnership or the city,” Tishman and BlackRock said in a statement.CWCapital, a special servicer for Tishman’s debt, was in negotiations with the group about restructuring its loans but ultimately no agreement could be reached. A spokesman for Tishman and BlackRock said they had spent the past few weeks in talks and had hoped that they could remain part of the long-term ownership of the properties.“Tishman Speyer would not consider a long-term management contract to continue operating the property that does not involve ownership,” according to Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Tishman. “Without a restructuring that would keep our ownership group as part of the equity, we felt it best that the new owners install a new management team.”Tishman and BlackRock used $3bn in loans which were packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities when they purchased the properties from MetLife four years ago.The venture had planned to convert the 1940s-era complex, which is made up of 110 buildings across 80 acres and seven blocks along Manhattan’s East River, into luxury apartments but that strategy collapsed last October when a New York judge ruled that it was illegally raising rents on thousands of residents.That decision stated that Tishman was wrong to raise rents because the developers benefited from special tax provisions to make renovations and these required rents to be kept stable.Richard Parkus, a commercial real estate analyst at Deutsche Bank, said Tishman had invested only about $56m of its own money into the venture and that without a significant loan modification it would make sense to walk away from the properties.“They never should have been able to borrow on those cash flows and expected future values,” Mr Parkus said.Tenants of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town have been in limbo in recent months. Alex Schmidt, a lawyer who represented the tenants against Tishman, said that any new owner would be obliged to honour the tenants’ rent overcharge claims.
192;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-12-01T18:50:04Z;AIG edges closer to $25bn restructuring;;AIG on Tuesday moved a step closer to selling or listing two of its biggest businesses – its Asian insurance unit AIA and the international life insurer Alico – after spinning them off into separate vehicles partly owned by the New York Federal Reserve.The deal with the authorities, which control 80 per cent of AIG, would more than halve the stricken insurer’s debt to the Fed to $17bn from $42bn excluding interest and fees. The insurer has also drawn about $44bn from a $70bn facility under the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Programme.After Tuesday’s deal with the Fed, AIG will have to take a $5.7bn charge in the fourth quarter to reflect the fall in the value of the credit facility provided by the government when it bailed out the insurer last year.The debt-for-equity swap with the Fed was first announced in March and its completion could pave the way for the sale of Alico, which has drawn the interest of MetLife, the US insurer, and the listing of AIA. AIG and MetLife have been in talks over Alico since July, when the Financial Times revealed the discussions.People close to the situation said the sale process was still ongoing and could be given new impetus by the transfer of Alico, which operates in more than 50 countries, to the new vehicle partly controlled by the Fed.Both AIG and the Fed are keen to sell Alico, which could fetch $10bn-$15bn, to accelerate the repayment of the funds it owes US taxpayers. A speedy repayment is crucial to AIG’s hopes of surviving as a stand-alone business and defusing the political outcry over its bonus payments.Robert Benmosche, a former chief executive of MetLife, took the helm at AIG in August – another factor that could facilitate a sale of Alico.AIG declined to comment on the talks and MetLife could not be reached.AIG has said it will list AIA in Hong Kong.Under the debt-for-equity swap with the Fed, AIA and Alico will be placed in two special purpose vehicles. The Fed will receive preferred shares worth $16bn in AIA’s vehicle and $9bn in Alico’s vehicle, giving it a large stake in the two entities and enabling it to be paid first if they are sold or listed. AIG will retain the common equity in the two vehicles.Separately, AIG declined to comment on an analyst report by Todd Bault of Bernstein Research claiming it had a shortfall of about $11bn in the reserves of its US property and casualty business – a cornerstone of its future as an independent company. In the note, distributed to clients on Monday, Mr Bault said the result was “very unexpected” and “could have major ramifications in coming years”.

More recently, investors have moved into fixed income, which is generally regarded as one of the less volatile asset classes.Support for guarantees has edged higher over the past year. When the same survey was conducted in May, 41 per cent of savers favoured protection of their original investment.“Fear of losing money when investing has always been one of the major motivations for savers and recent events have emphasized the risks,” said Dominic Grinstead, managing director of MetLife, UK branch.“However stock market investing remains the best way to secure long-term returns despite volatility and the risks of short-term downturns. Investment guarantees remove the fear of losing your original investment while also offering the chance to lock-in gains.”
194;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-11-11T23:29:59Z;Microfinance group in CDO scheme;;Deutsche Bank and a major microfinance company are trying to rehabilitate the much-maligned collateralised debt obligation as a means of funnelling money from global capital markets into the pockets of the world’s poorest people.Finca International, a US-based microfinance organisation, is set to announce on Thursday that it has sewn up a $21.2m CDO with the help of Deutsche Bank. Its affiliates in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Azerbaijan plan to leverage that money up another five times before lending it out in $500 chunks to tiny start-ups and would-be entrepreneurs.Its move comes as microfinance institutions search for new ways to access international capital markets amid growing demand and investor interest.CDOs were at the heart of the US subprime mortgage meltdown, spreading risk far and wide via their supposedly safe senior tranches of debt. But Asad Mahmood, managing director of Global Social Investment Funds at Deutsche Bank, said they remained useful structures.“It’s not the CDO that is to blame, it is an instrument. We’re using the CDO to do well, to do good.”By offering some tranches of debt that are protected from the first swathe of losses, Deutsche Bank – which structured, placed and managed the deal – said it was able to tap a new set of conservative investors, such as pension funds, that have fiduciary duties to their clients.Those investors, which include the insurer MetLife, the bank State Street and Hewlett-Packard, will receive a 7.5 per cent fixed rate. Investors in the riskiest slices will get a rate of about 16 per cent.Initially, it was a tough sell. “The atmosphere was pretty bad,” Mr Mahmood said. “You’ve been through the worst economic crisis where things are failing left and right, and you go back to investors as say ‘I’ve got a deal for you: you can invest in Congo!’ ”But the fund ended up being oversubscribed as investors looking to fulfil their social responsibilities were brought on board.“We found a wonderful reception for this product among the subscribers who loved the social aspect, the idea they would be sitting in the comfort of their home in Hamburg or Dallas, Texas or Paris, and their money …would be going to work to help solve the problem of some of the poorest people on earth,” said Rupert Scofield, Finca president and chief executive.It is an interesting time for microfinance. The rapid growth of some institutions is driving them to engage with capital markets in ways some critics have called a betrayal of the original philanthropic nature of the enterprise. The founders of Compartamos, a Mexican microfinance bank that listed on the stock exchange in 2007, attracted such a hail of criticism they issued an open letter to justify their rapid growth and commercialisation.For Finca, raising equity was not an option. Its affiliates were knocking up against their debt-to-equity ratio covenants, but could not raise equity amid the global financial meltdown.
195;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-10-30T20:54:10Z;Wall St falls sharply on mixed data;;US stocks dropped sharply on Friday as the markets fell for a second successive week on mixed economic numbers that dented optimism.The Nasdaq Composite index of mostly technology stocks saw its first fall on the month since February after Weak consumer spending numbers suggested the recovery may be slow and protracted.Analysts insisted, however, that the rally can continue into the new year, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing an eighth consecutive month of gains.The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.5 per cent to 2,045.11 and was down 5 per cent on the week.The S&P 500 index dropped 2.81 per cent to 1,036.19 and was down 4.14 per cent on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue-chip stocks fell 2.51 per cent to 9,712.73 and was 2.6 per cent lower on the week.Some of the biggest falls were among the financials, such as Bank of America and Citigroup. Bank of America fell 7.18 per cent to $14.6 and Citigroup dropped 5.34 per cent to $4.08.Chevron, the second-largest US energy group, was another casualty as its shares fell 2.03 per cent to $76.37, in spite of third-quarter profits beat expectations, .Financials and energy stocks have seen some of the largest gains since the rally began in March. Analysts suggested investors may be taking profits in these stocks amid some concern over the strength of the recovery.Other big losers included McAfee, which saw its shares fall 4.66 per cent to $41.71. The stock has been hit by earnings on Thursday that showed the security software maker had missed revenue estimates as sales grew at their slowest rate in nearly two years.Novatel Wireless also tumbled, 4.4 per cent to $8.92, after it warned sales of its mobile wi-fi product would be flat to lower.Stocks of American Express, Home Depot, DuPont and MetLife showed declines. American Express fell 4.5 per cent to $34.80, Home Depot fell 3.2 per cent to $25.08, DuPont dropped 3.55 per cent to $31.81 and MetLife was 8.44 per cent lower to $33.73.Bucking the trend, shares of Genworth Financial were up 3.93 per cent to $10.58. The insurer reported a net operating profit on Thursday that beat expectations.Among the sectors, materials was hit hard as well as financials and energy. Financial stocks fell 4.76 per cent, energy shares were down 3.82 per cent, while materials were 3.82 per cent lower.It was the US consumer spending numbers, which fell for the first time in five months that took the steam out of many stocks.Data suggested that job losses may keep household spending muted even as the economy resumes growth.Even though business activity in the US unexpectedly expanded in October, investors focused on the gloomier data.Chicago’s Institute for Supply Management said its business barometer had increased to 54.2, higher than expected. A reading lower than 50 signals a contraction.The weakness was in spite of strong economic growth numbers on Thursday, which showed that the economy grew at an annualised 3.5 per cent in the third quarter, taking the US out of recession.Some analysts said on Friday’s losses were partly due to a correction from Thursday, which saw the biggest one-day rally since July 23.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “We have seen eight months of gains and I think that can continue. The market was up on Thursday, so this is a bit of a correction.”Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, added: “It has been another week of good corporate numbers but the market had priced in good company results at the start of the month and has struggled to push higher.”
196;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-10-22T23:58:49Z;NY court rules Tishman wrongfully raised rents;;New York’s highest court ruled on Thursday that the owners of Manhattan’s biggest apartment complex wrongfully raised rents on thousands of tenants, in a decision that analysts say will bring the property closer to default and could further rattle the commercial mortgage-backed securities market.The court said Tishman Speyer and BlackRock, which led a group of investors that bought the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties in 2006 for $5.4bn, and MetLife, the former owner, should not have been able to raise rents for on nearly 3,000 tenants in rent-stabilised apartments while taking tax benefits for renovations. The owners could have to pay $215m in damages and rebates. According to analysts at Fitch, the ratings agency, the $3bn in loans taken by Tishman and BlackRock, which were repackaged as CMBS, is likely to default without an equity infusion or recapitalisation.“Stuyvesant Town’s performance will not improve sufficiently enough to service its securitised debt before reserves run dry,” Mary MacNeill, managing director of Fitch, said.The Tishman purchase came at the height of the commercial real estate boom in New York and analysts estimate that the properties have since lost more than half of their value, saddling owners with debt that is now worth more than the properties. Peter Cooper and Stuyvesant Town, which is made up of 110 buildings across 80 acres and 7 blocks along Manhattan’s East River, was built in the 1940s and was meant to be an oasis of affordability in a city where many people have been pushed out by soaring rents.“While we respect the Court’s decision, we view this as an unfortunate outcome for New York,” Tishman said in a statement. “The ruling, which reverses 15 years of government practice, raises a number of difficult issues that will need to be resolved by the courts and various government agencies in the coming months and years.”The court noted Tishman’s argument that the ruling could have “dire financial consequences” for the owners and New York’s real estate industry, but said that such predictions depend on other factors that do not bear on their decision. The ruling affirms an earlier appellate decision made in March that said the rents should not have been elevated to market rates.Sam Chandan, chief economist at Real Estate Econometrics, said that the acquisition was predicated on the idea that Tishman would be able to raise the rents to market prices and a default, which would be the largest ever for a CMBS loan, could have a chilling effect on the market that would undermine efforts to boost securitisation.“It’s going to colour the impression and nature of investing in CMBS,” Mr Chandan said. “Confidence has been eroded.”
197;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-09-21T08:34:29Z;Life assurance policies;;"If a cure for cancer was developed tomorrow, funeral directors might not be the only ones feeling sorry for themselves. So would investors in so-called life settlements, who buy life assurance policies at a discount, taking over payment of premiums in the hope of making a profit when the original policyholders die; the sooner they pass away, the more profitable the deal. Life settlements are great for older people who want ready cash, but less so for insurers.Part of insurers’ profitability is the 6 or so per cent of policyholders who abandon their policies each year, by lapsing or accepting low surrender values from the insurers themselves, reducing their liability.The $12bn US life settlements market remains minuscule compared with the $19,500bn of life assurance policies in force. But estimates that it could grow substantially should worry insurers. Consider the potential impact on MetLife. In the three months to June, it paid out $534m in cash to life policyholders. But it also reduced its total liabilities by virtually the same amount because of lapses and surrenders.So even insurers that have done a good job of forecasting investment returns and mortality might find their profits trimmed by lower lapse rates if life settlements grow as quickly as some expect. Estimates of the market’s ultimate size range from $100bn to $500bn as investment banks seek to securitise and resell policies. Coming on top of insurers’ recent investment losses and the largest drop in premium sales in 67 years, life settlements pose yet another threat.Premiums on policies written in the future could rise to reflect settlements, but it is too late for the millions already held by baby boomers. If they choose jam today versus jam for their heirs tomorrow, insurers may be in a sticky situation indeed.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"

Citigroup and Bank of America were bailed out and are likely to survive.But a year on from September 16, when the Fed had to bend the rules to provide $85bn to prevent the world’s largest insurer from being crushed under lossmaking derivatives contracts, AIG’s destiny is unclear.During a torrid 12 months, the behemoth has had to labour under the government control that came with the federal aid and to respond to political attacks on its pay practices, all the while trying to stay open for business.The uncertainty over AIG’s future has been reflected in its share price.The stock, which trades at a fraction of the levels touched during AIG’s golden era under former chief Hank Greenberg, has see-sawed wildly as investors switch between hope and despair about the company’s prospects.Yet the anniversary of the Fed’s rescue – the first in a series of bail-outs that require AIG to repay some $80bn in capital and loans to the government – could prove a milestone in the company’s troubled history.Fresh from appointing a new chief executive and chairman, AIG has the chance to draw up a strategy that would satisfy both the government, which owns an 80 per cent stake and wants its money back, and other equity and debt investors.So far, Robert Benmosche, the former head of MetLife who became chief executive in August and then took off on holiday, has been running thecompany from its Croatian Zinfandel winery.Some of Mr Benmosche’s utterances have caused a stir inside and outside the company.According to Bloomberg, he told employees that Andrew Cuomo, New York’s attorney-general, had been “unbelievably wrong” in attacking AIG’s bonuses.But Mr Benmosche is shaping AIG’s strategy. His most important decision so far has been to place a go-slow order on AIG’s plan for asset disposals.Under Edward Liddy, Mr Benmosche’s predecessor, AIG’s priority had been to sell or spin off businesses in the quickest possible time in an effort to repay the government.But tough financing markets, a dearth of cash-rich buyers and the tendency of many bidders to push prices lower to exploit AIG’s need for a quick sale meant the insurer risked selling the jewels in its crown at bargain basement prices.Mr Benmosche has told associates he wants to wait for an improvement in M&A markets to wring the best possible price for AIG’s assets.If the board endorses his policy it will delay deals such as the Hong Kong listing of American International Assurance, AIG’s Asian unit.The board met on Tuesday and was chaired for the first time by Harvey Golub, former head of American Express.Talks between AIG and MetLife over the $15bn sale of American Life Insurance Company, an insurer with operations in more than 50 countries, could also cool, at least for some time.The government appears to have raised no objections to Mr Benmosche’s decision, though any long delays in asset sales would be likely to upset the authorities.Mr Benmosche’s tactic could also reduce the millions of dollars in fees AIG pays bankers, accountants and consultants that have been helping with “the fire sale of the century”, saving money for shareholders.On a parallel track, the chief has sought to thaw the group’s relationship with Mr Greenberg, who had been criticising AIG since leaving the helm in 2005.Whatever the speed of the disposal programme or the rapport with Mr Greenberg, AIG has to prove that it can survive as a standalone, much smaller entity, largely focused on the US, once it repays the bail-out funds.Recent results offer encouragement.After reporting more than $100bn in losses over six quarters, last month AIG swung back into the black with a $1.8bn profit for the second quarter.While much of that was due to accounting gains, its life assurance business reported a $1.8bn profit compared with a $2.4bn loss the year before, as rising capital markets boosted investment income.The general insurance unit, AIG’s other main business, fell 20 per cent over a year ago as premiums decreased. But that was in line with its rivals.There was little evidence that AIG’s struggles had prompted large numbers of customers or staff to flee.“We consider AIG’s operating insurance earnings, albeit pressured, to be strong and diversified,” Standard & Poor’s, the credit rating agency, wrote in a recent note.“However, we continue to monitor AIG’s ability to retain key staff and underwrite profitable new business in commercial and life insurance segments.”
199;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-08-17T21:40:17Z;New AIG chief to receive $7m pay;;Robert Benmosche, AIG’s new chief executive, will receive annual pay of $7m in cash and shares and be in line for a bonus of $3.5m a year, the government-controlled insurer announced on Monday.Mr Benmosche’s package has been approved “in principle” by the Obama administration’s “pay czar” Kenneth Feinberg in a move aimed at avoiding a repeat of the political row that broke out earlier this year over bonuses for AIG’s staff.Edward Liddy, Mr Benmosche’s predecessor who stepped down this month, agreed to receive $1 in pay after lawmakers attacked the insurer for paying out bonuses to some traders despite having received some $80bn in taxpayers’ funds.However, people close to the situation said Mr Benmosche, a former chief executive of rival insurer MetLife, had made it clear it would only take the job if he were paid a salary and a bonus.Under his pay deal, Mr Benmosche, 65, will receive a cash salary of $3m a year plus $4m worth of shares in AIG, which he will be barred from selling for five years. His annual bonus - to be awarded by the board depending on his performance - could total up to $3.5m in shares.The terms of Mr Benmosche’s package underline a trend toward increasing base salaries and reducing bonuses at US financial services companies following the crisis.Companies like Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have taken a similar approach to the compensation of bankers and traders in an attempt to reduce their incentive to take huge risks with the company’s balance sheet.In the insurance industry, this strategy has been less visible.For example, Robert Henrikson, the current chairman and chief executive of MetLife, received a 2008 salary of $1m – less than Mr Benmosche’s – but then had stock and options awards worth more than $9m, according to regulatory filings.Unlike other executives who left the insurer as the financial crisis pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy, Mr Benmosche will not be entitled to any severance payments should he leave the company.
200;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
201;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-08-07T01:00:55Z;Former Amex chief tipped for AIG chair;;Harvey Golub, a respected former head of American Express, has emerged as the frontrunner to become chairman of AIG, in a move that would provide the stricken insurer with a robust defender against congressional critics.Mr Golub, who joined AIG’s board in June, has the edge over other candidates, including ­Dennis Dammerman, the former General Electric executive who is also a director of the government-controlled insurer, people close to the situation said.They added that no decision had yet been made and the situation remained fluid.AIG’s board is expected to decide on the new chairman in the next few days, following this week’s decision to appoint ­Robert Benmosche, former head of the insurer MetLife, as chief executive.AIG, which reports second-quarter results on Friday, declined to comment. Mr Golub could not be reached.The management reshuffle has been driven by the decision by Edward Liddy, chairman and chief executive, to step down next week after a torrid 11 months marked by several government bail-outs and a political furore over employee bonuses.Mr Liddy agreed to receive just $1 for his services, but the new chairman and chief executive are expected to be paid in line with industry standards, with Mr Benmosche believed to have agreed a package of $7m-$10m a year.Officials at the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve, which have propped up AIG with $80bn in loans and capital, have been monitoring the selection process for the chairman and chief executive.Mr Golub, 70, and Mr Dammerman, 63, were among several new directors picked by government officials over the past few months as the authorities revamped a board that had been criticised for failing to spot AIG’s huge problems.The insurer’s new chairman will have to manage the company’s strained relationship with lawmakers and ensure its government paymasters are happy with the pace of disposals of most of its global operations.Mr Golub, who is also non-executive chairman of the private equity group Ripplewood, the food group Campbell Soup and The Readers’ Digest Association, has been an outspoken critic of government involvement in financial matters.In an editorial in the Wall Street Journal after Barack Obama’s presidential victory in November, Mr Golub said he was “pessimistic about whether our next president and the savants in Congress can deal with the massive economic issues we face”.“Members of Congress…will continue to meddle in matters beyond their knowledge. In doing so they will exacerbate our current economic downturn,” wrote Mr Golub, who used to be on the board of Dow Jones, the owner of the WSJ.As chairman and chief executive of Amex between 1993 and 2001, Mr Golub was credited with turning round the fading US corporate star. During his tenure, Amex’s shares rose more than sixfold.
202;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-08-03T23:02:49Z;AIG names former MetLife head as chief executive;;American International Group has filled one of the hottest seats in corporate America, naming Robert Benmosche, a former head of rival insurer MetLife, as chief executive.The appointment of Mr Benmosche, who left MetLife in 2006, fills one half of the void left when Ed Liddy, AIG’s current chairman and chief executive, decided to leave the government-controlled insurer after less than a year in charge.AIG is still looking for a chairman, whose primary job will be to manage the troubled company’s fractious relationship with the Obama administration, lawmakers and regulators.Mr Liddy, a former head of Allstate, the insurer, and director of Goldman Sachs, is leaving partly because of the constant barrage of criticism from lawmakers and regulators over AIG’s use of billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money.Mr Benmosche will have to steer AIG through a complex series of disposals aimed at returning the $80bn in funds the insurer owes the US government while trying to salvage at least part of the once-sprawling company.“We will focus on this mission: maximising the value of the company’s assets and meeting all of our stakeholder obligations,” Mr Benmosche said on Monday.One of Mr Benmosche’s first tasks will be to lead negotiations with his former employer over the sale of American Life Insurance Company, one of AIG’s crown jewels. As first reported by the Financial Times last month, MetLife is in talks to buy Alico in a deal that could raise around $15bn for AIG.AIG has not said how much Mr Benmosche would be paid but Mr Liddy said his successor would earn more than the $1 a year he himself accepted to defuse a political furore over executive pay at bailed-out financial groups.The pay package awarded to Mr Benmosche will be closely scrutinised by Congress and regulators.The appointment, which is believed to have been approved by the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve, will lead to the departure of Paula Rosput Reynolds, AIG’s chief restructuring officer. Ms Reynolds – a close ally of Mr Liddy’s – was the leading internal candidate for the top job.Mr Benmosche joined MetLife in 1995 from PaineWebber, the investment bank, and became CEO three years later. He was credited with changing the company’s sleepy corporate culture and overseeing its transformation from a mutual company into a listed entity.Since leaving MetLife, he had remained on the board of Credit Suisse, which he joined in 2002.
203;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-07-17T01:12:30Z;Legal & General bond issue raises £300m;;Legal & General has raised £300m ($492m) in fresh capital through a junior bond issue, highlighting both improved investor appetite for riskier financial debt and the alternatives to equity issuance that life insurers are using to bolster financial strength.The L&G bond sale follows two junior debt issues from Prudential raising £400m and $750m in recent months, while RSA raised £500m in May although that was to replace a different bond the general insurer was due to repay. Also this month, MetLife became the first US insurer to issue such debt with a $500m deal.Junior bonds in both the so-called tier one and tier two categories are attractive for insurers because the money raised counts towards the Insurance Groups Directive capital surplus figure that investors and regulators use to gauge groups’ financial strength.This is in contrast to banks, where the focus is increasingly on equity and cash – known as core tier one – alone, which is pushing many banks to find ways to cut their tier two debt in favour of more equity-like instruments, such as preference shares.UK insurers have used a variety of methods to boost capital strength this year as they try to allay investor fears that they might have to raise equity through rights issues.L&G cut its dividend when it reported full-year earnings at the start of the year, Aviva used reinsurance and sold its Australian business and Prudential sold a book of life insurance business in Taiwan.The life companies report their half-year results in the first two weeks of August and there are likely to be further announcements on capital boosting measures then. Aviva, for example, is widely expected to announce a dividend cut of about 50 per cent.The L&G bond, which was sold by Barclays, BNP and HSBC, was priced to yield about 10.125 per cent, which is marginally better than the Pru’s earlier deal, which yielded 10.5 per cent. Bankers said this showed the improvement in debt markets generally as investors were willing to take more risk.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 8,183.17 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,752.55.“People are looking for a reason not to sell stocks right now, rather than to buy them,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, wrote: “The overall rebound appears to be somewhat muted, suggesting this bounce may be more of a pause in selling for now rather than the start of a new upswing,”Merck exerted significant pressure on the Dow amid speculation its cholesterol medicine fared poorly in a clinical trial comparing it with a rival drug from Abbott. Its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $27.01.But there was support from financial stocks after the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week was shown to be much lower than expected.Banks were particularly strong gainers, supported by the economic data and by signs of progress with the government’s latest plan to clear balance sheets of toxic assets.The Treasury announced on Wednesday evening the nine fund managers with which it will work to purchase those securities under the Public-Private Investment Plan, and committed up to $30bn to it.Citigroup rose 2.7 per cent to $2.69, while Bank of Americaclimbed 1.1 per cent to $11.97.Goldman Sachs climbed after BofA recommended buying the shares, saying second-quarter earnings would be better than previous estimates as trading and investment banking delivered strong revenues. Shares in Goldman gained 3.4 per cent to $143.21.The economic optimism was tempered however by renewed talk of a second stimulus plan, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett added his voice to those calling for the government to consider such a move.But George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers, said this should be a bullish sign for stocks. “The first stimulus hasn’t begun to work yet, so the impact will be impressive if lawmakers vote in a second,” he said.Retailers were mixed as they reported their same-store sales for June.Target, the discount retailer, reported a steeper drop than predicted but the shares jumped 3 per cent to $38.39 after the company said its second-quarter profits would meet or exceed analysts’ estimates.But there was worse news for other retailers, including Limited Brands, whose shares fell 4 per cent to $10.89 after sales at its flagship Victoria’s Secret chain fell 14 per cent.Elsewhere, investors were betting that the possible sale of American Life Insurance Company by AIGto Metlife, its rival insurer, reported in the Financial Times, could be a better deal for Metlife than its competitor. The unit is regarded as one of the jewels in AIG’s crown, and the news sent Metlife’s shares up 2.7 per cent to $27.63 while AIG tumbled 27.6 per cent to $9.48.In the technology sector, NetApprose 3.4 per cent to $19.01 after it pulled out of the bidding for Data Domain, its rival data storage company, saying it could not match an increased bid made by competitor EMCthis week.Analysts said NetApp could now become an acquisition target itself. EMC’s shares gained 1.9 per cent to $12.76 but Data Domain fell 1.4 per cent to $33.44.
205;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-07-08T22:00:49Z;AIG in talks with MetLife over Alico;;"AIG has rekindled talks with MetLife, its US rival, over the sale of American Life Insurance Company, one of the jewels in its crown, in a move that could help the stricken insurer raise more than $15bn to repay the $80bn it currently owes US taxpayers.The talks over Alico, which has operations in more than 50 countries outside the US, are preliminary and could founder as they did earlier this year when the two sides disagreed on price, people close to the situation said.After AIG received its fourth bail-out from the government in March, it halted talks for all or parts of Alico with potential bidders, including France’s Axa, Prudential of the UK and China Investment Corp, the state investment fund, and MetLife.AIG is in the process of spinning off the unit into a separate entity partly owned by the Federal Reserve, in preparation for a listing. AIG has said it is open to offers for Alico, whose largest operations are in Japan.Prudential, Axa and CIC are currently not interested, according to people close to the situation. In recent weeks MetLife and AIG have been talking again amid hopes that an improvement in credit markets might help the two sides bridge the price gap, bankers said.Before talks broke off in March, MetLife was believed to have tabled an offer of about $11bn for Alico, with AIG expecting roughly $20bn.People close to the situation said that although AIG would still like to get more than $15bn for Alico it was interested in exploring a sale, partly because it was coming under increasing pressure from the government to speed up disposals.A divestment would enable the authorities, which own 80 per cent of AIG, to recoup
their funds more quickly than through an initial public offering in 2010.MetLife might be interested in buying only some of Alico’s sprawling operations, although AIG is believed to prefer a sale of the whole business. It is unclear whether MetLife would use shares as part-payment in any bid for Alico.AIG – whose shares have fallen sharply this week amid analysts’ downgrades and a legal setback – and MetLife declined to comment on the talks.Alico’s attractions are its vast geographical scope and exposure to the huge growth potential of emerging economies.Additional reporting by Henny Sender in New York and Paul Davies in London"
206;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-06-17T17:15:10Z;Relief on Wall St at proposed regulation plan;;“We should be able to do business with the Federal Reserve as long as all these new powers do not go to its head.”The response of a senior banker summed up Wall Street’s reaction to the Obama administration’s proposals for an overhaul of financial regulation: relief mixed with apprehension at the planned new powers to be assumed by the central bank.The Fed’s proposed new role as a “systemic regulator” did not appear to surprise traditional commercial banks and investment banks, most of which are already being overseen by the monetary authorities.“If the industry had a choice of an overall regulator, it would have chosen the Fed,” said another Wall Street executive. “They are not perfect but they have a better idea of what is going on than most regulators. They are better staffed and more respected by companies.”But the planned extension of the Fed jurisdiction over all institutions that could harm the financial system will change the playing field for companies ranging from General Electric to the insurer MetLife, and perhaps even a retailer like Wal-Mart.If Congress approves the Obama plan, the Fed will be the glue that binds together the porous and diffuse system of US regulation, with the power to look into any large company with a sizeable financial arm.GE, whose giant finance arm GE Capital is bigger than many traditional banks, is a case in point. Up until now, GE Capital had been regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, an agency that will be disbanded after being criticised for its inability to spot problems at the collapsed insurer AIG and the lender Washington Mutual.But under the Obama plan, GE Capital will have to submit itself to the much more detailed scrutiny – and higher capital requirements – of the Fed, a change that could significantly affect its business model and profitability.Companies that had looked into buying a bank – such as Wal-Mart – could be deterred from pursuing a foray into financial services by the prospect of falling under the Fed’s control.“In the US we had a long-standing debate over the separation of commerce and banking and concluded that commerce and banking will not be mixed,” said Don Ogilvie, the former head the American Bankers Association who now chairs the Deloitte Center for Banking Solutions, a think-tank.Large insurers such as MetLife, which was the only insurance company included in the government’s stress tests, could also see the centre of regulatory gravity move away from state authorities towards federal watchdogs.Wall Street bankers said the plan addressed one of the glaring regulatory deficiencies highlighted by the crisis: the fact that the Fed, which has control over funds and liquidity, had little or no influence over many of important parts of the financial system.As last year’s bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and collapse of AIG showed, the fragmented system of US regulation had left large companies whose failure had the potential to harm global markets without effective supervision.The plan unveiled on Wednesday aims to close this gap but its critics said it did not go far enough by failing to substantially reduce the number of financial regulators, partly because of fears Congress would not approve such a move.With only the OTS destined for the scrapheap, banking supervision will still be shared among at least four agencies. As one Wall Street executive put it: “Congressional antibodies gained strength and stopped the long-overdue consolidation of our financial regulatory structure.”
207;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-06-05T16:39:52Z;Matthew Vincent: Is it a fair cop?;;Was Bertie Wooster deterred from stealing policemen’s helmets by Totleigh-in-the- Wold’s law enforcer, Constable Eustace Oates? Did Sir Charles Lytton (aka “The Phantom”) abandon his attempt to steal the Pink Panther diamond when he discovered Inspector Clouseau was on the case? Were Top Cat’s gang of feline finaglers operating in constant fear of Officer Dibble? No.So why are the nation’s independent financial advisers (IFAs) now worried that their asset allocation choices will result in their collars being felt by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)?This week, new research from MetLife, the insurance group, claimed that nearly six out of 10 IFAs are “concerned” that they “could face regulatory issues” in justifying their asset allocation decisions. Apparently, only 41 per cent of them have plans in place to deal with any regulatory problems if their asset allocation advice to clients is challenged. And nearly two in 10 admit they are totally unprepared to deal with potential complaints over investment losses, following last year’s market falls.But other news this week suggests they have little to fear. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act have shown that staff at the FSA were awarded £19.7m-worth of “target”- related bonuses last month – a 40 per cent increase on the previous year. All this for overseeing the near total collapse of the very banking system they were appointed to police – a risk that was identified as long ago as 2004, in a “war game” simulation that the FT revealed was conducted jointly by the Treasury, the Bank of England and, you guessed it, the FSA.If these financial plods were too busy counting their money and playing toy soldiers to investigate Northern Rock or HBOS, it seems unlikely that they’ll soon be asking “’Ello, ‘ello, ‘ello – what’s going on ‘ere, then?’ at a high street financial adviser near you.So IFAs can keep sleeping a little easier over their asset allocation advice – and carry on selling the equity funds, bond funds, cash funds and funds of hedge funds that charge up to 1.5 per cent a year – or the multi-asset funds that charge up to 2 per cent.Or can they? Rather more diligent inspectors of financial markets have been calling complacent allocators into question – if not “in for questioning”.Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management recently interrogated 15 years’ worth of market data to find out how effectively different asset classes have protected clients from risk. Its investment detectives studied the correlations between US equities and the assets held by different funds – ie how closely these assets’ prices have fallen, or risen, in line with each other. A correlation of +1 shows that that their prices moved in the same direction by the same amount, and a correlation of -1 means they moved in the opposite direction to each other, by the same amount.They found that international equities have gone from a correlation of -0.02 in the period 1991-95 to a correlation of +0.98 in 2005-08. High-grade corporate bonds have gone from -0.46 in 2001-05 to +0.72 in 2005-08. Hedge funds have gone from -0.02 in 1991-95 to +0.95 in 2005-08. In other words, these separate asset classes – as well as commodities and property – have all been moving in the same direction for some time. So if the FSA’s gumshoes were ever to investigate asset allocation advice, this is the smoking gun.Under questioning, IFAs would doubtless rely on the fact that these correlations are unprecedented. But they are paid to keep an eye on them over time – out of the 1.5 or 2 per cent annual charges on the funds they recommend.It’s not as if there hasn’t been evidence of the vital role played by asset allocation in determining returns. An ongoing study by US academics Brinson, Singer and Beebower has proved that asset allocation decisions account for 94 per cent of the variability in a portfolio’s total return. Stockpicking, or individual fund selection, accounts for only 4 per cent. Market timing accounts for the remaining 2 per cent.So the arrival on the scene of a service that has a better chance of getting a client’s asset allocation right is timely. Barclays Wealth’s Global Beta Portfolios are set up to correspond to five different risk profiles, with asset allocation decisions taken not by a single adviser but by an 11-strong committee, headed by Tim Bond. Clients are matched to the most appropriate portfolio allocation, using a proprietary personality assessment. Most significantly, though, only the asset allocation is actively managed. All of the funds used are passively-managed exchange traded funds – most of which charge only 0.5-0.75 per cent. That’s more than half the cost of the funds used by IFAs.

208;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-05-24T15:33:54Z;Time to rethink the long equity bet;;"The long-held belief that taking the risk of equity investment will be rewarding in the long term, and can be relied on to pay pensions, has been challenged by the experience of the credit crisis.Governments have built their pension policy on the expectation that pension savers could collect the equity risk premium, according to a report published last week by Ros Altmann, an independent expert on pension policy. In the UK, employers’ defined benefit schemes and personal pensions alike relied on the equity gamble paying off, and “the expected strong equity returns enabled successive governments to cut UK state pensions over time”, she says.Financial theory supports the view that equities will outperform government bonds in the long term on average. But averages mask a range of outcomes, so some people will do well from equities and others will not. Moreover, it is not clear how long the long term is. Therefore individuals cannot rely on equities to outperform bonds.Ms Altmann points to the example of Japan, where the stock market is still one fifth of its level 20 years ago; and notes that in the UK, bonds have done better than equities over the past 10 years.She suggests a rethink is required, with insurance being a potential solution. People insure their houses so why not their pension savings? The report is sponsored by MetLife, a company looking to kick-start the variable annuity market in the UK. Such products, referred to unhelpfully as unit-linked guaranteed in the report, may become a useful addition to the range if they can be provided at a reasonable cost, but many have yet to be convinced of their value.The point remains, though, that stock market investment cannot reliably furnish pensions for all. This is a nettle that has to be grasped by the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority, which is consulting on the investment approach to be adopted for the UK’s new national pension scheme to be rolled out from 2012.Pada has indicated it is in favour of keeping the default fund low risk, although it has not said how that translates into an asset allocation. John Ralfe, an independent pension consultant, maintains the personal account default fund would have to be 60 per cent in equities to satisfy the assumptions built into the projections for the 20 per cent replacement earnings the scheme is supposed to provide. The whole thing relies on equities delivering inflation plus 3.5 per cent over a 40-year career, he says.The equity bet has become the default setting around the world as individuals everywhere are increasingly expected to shoulder all the risks – investment, inflation, interest rate and longevity – of financing their retirement.Whether there is an investment philosophy informing this approach is not clear. This is an important question, according to an article in the International Journal of Pension Management, published by the Rotman International Centre for Pension Management. The article Do institutional investors have sensible investment beliefs? by Kees Koediijk of Tilburg University and Alfred Slager, chief investment officer of Stork Pension funds – both in the Netherlands – reports the results of a worldwide survey of investment beliefs among pension funds and asset managers.They find striking differences between the two. Asset managers seem to use their beliefs “to demonstrate their competitive advantage to current and potential clients”. Pension funds use them as a decision-making tool and focus on getting risk exposure right. Few of either type state their beliefs, though.Crucially, however, the research finds that “pension funds with clear beliefs about asset pricing and risk diversification have better return/risk performance measures and lower costs”.The question of what investment beliefs inform the approach of an asset manager or pension fund seems an obvious one, say the authors, but it has rarely been addressed in investment literature.Perhaps most do not feel the need to formulate and write down their investment philosophy because it is really quite simple: equities will outperform in the long term and a degree of diversification reduces risk without compromising return.Recent experience suggests a need for something a bit more thoughtful. It also suggests governments might have to give up encouraging people to think there is some product or fund manager out there offering the equivalent of the philosopher’s stone that can transform their meagre pension contributions into a pension pot big enough to support a nice retirement.Mr Ralfe says it is a savings issue rather than an investment issue. “There are lots of clever things you can do with investments but if you don’t put enough in you won’t get enough out.”pauline.skypala@ft.com"
209;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-05-22T17:50:15Z;Enter retirement one step at a time;;"Falling pension values are now forcing more people to defer, or ‘phase’, their retirement by staying on in work for a few extra years – sometimes on a part-time basis.Research published this week by MetLife revealed that 54 per cent of people now think their pensions will fall short of expectations, and are worried about their retirement income.As a result, Rachel Vahey, head of pensions development at Aegon, has forecast an increase in phased retirements, as people work longer to make up for stock market falls that have wiped up to a third off the value of many pension funds.“Phased retirement has always been traditionally seen as a way of bringing in early retirement. But what we will see is that people will carry on working until 65 and it will be a way of extending their working life, not cutting it short,” she warns.Planning for phased retirement has been made easier by changes to the pension rules in 2006. “In the past, it was a bit fiddly but now it is straightforward,” says Ian Naismith, head of pensions market development.Investors are now are able to cash in their pension one part at a time, and each time they cash in a segment, they can take 25 per cent of that part as a tax-free lump sum.Naismith says many people encash some of their pension in their 50s and use the tax- free cash to pay off their mortgages.But more and more people are using the cash as a supplement for income when they go part-time, he says.Using the tax-free cash as income can also save on tax, as it could prevent people in the basic rate tax band from becoming higher rate taxpayers. Pension investors with families are using the tax-free cash to help cover additional costs in the short term, such as paying for children’s university fees, according to Lee Smythe at Killik.Encashing part of a pension is also useful for people who think their income may fluctuate – for example, people who are self-employed. In income drawdown, the income from the remaining 75 per cent of the pension can be varied from nothing at all in one year to 20 per cent above the equivalent annuity rate in another.Vahey suggests that people could also encash the different pensions they have at different times. Many people who have changed jobs have pension pots scattered among various employers. One option is to consolidate these pots into one pension, purely for ease of administration. But investors could instead opt to encash one at a time, she says.One thing to bear in mind, she warns, is that some older pensions may come with guaranteed annuity rates that are only offered at a certain retirement age. So anyone retiring after that age may lose out on the guarantee and receive a lower income than they would have done.Vahey also warns that it will probably be impossible for anyone in a final salary scheme to phase their retirement – though they could check with their employer.Those who are able to delay their retirement should have reasonable expectations, advisers warn.Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown says that people cannot bet on the value
of their pension recover-
ing quickly, but the odds
of it recovering over five years are much better. “There’s no guarantee that your fund will be much higher than it is now and
it could be lower over the next year or two,” he warns.People delaying retirement are also taking a gamble on the direction of annuity rates, which could be about to fall. Khalaf says a better bet for the short term could be to defer taking the state pension, which removes any annuity risk and comes with a guaranteed increase of 10.4 per cent a year in income."
210;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T06:00:28+0000;Pension warning over bet on shares;;The traditional model of relying on the stock market to deliver a good income in retirement has failed, according to a leading independent pensions adviser.Defying conventional wisdom, Ros Altmann warns in a report published on Wednesday that the credit crisis has “hugely damaged” the UK’s pensions system and destroyed the widespread belief that long-term stock market investment would produce generous pensions.“Essentially the entire UK pensions system has been based on a bet that equities would always do well enough over the long term to deliver reliably good pensions,” she says in her report, Planning for Retirement: You’re On Your Own.“The old idea that stock markets can always be relied on to deliver strong returns has left millions facing an impoverished old age.”Research commissioned for the report by MetLife, the pensions provider, showed that a third of people who were five years from retirement were unhappy with their pension or felt they had wasted their money by investing. More than half said their pensions would fall short of expectations.A poll of the wider population found that just 9 per cent believed the stock market was a sound long-term investment.Altmann says betting on equities allowed the government to reduce the state pension and shift responsibility for saving to employers.She warns that policymakers have never seriously considered that stock markets might not deliver strong returns. Yet over the past 10 years, equity returns have averaged just 1.2 per cent, compared with 16.1 per cent in the previous 10 years.

212;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-05-08T17:14:02Z;Variable annuities in doubt as big provider quits UK;;Fears have been raised over the future of variable annuities after one of the main providers pulled out of the UK market last week.US-owned life company Hartford Life said it would no longer do new business in the UK and it is moving its operations for existing customers to Dublin – a move affecting more than 18,000 policyholders.Anyone with a Hartford policy can transfer their pension to a new provider or stay with the company, which has promised to meet existing guarantees on its products.Variable annuities, also called “third-way” annuities, are viewed as a halfway house between an annuity – which provides a steady income in retirement in return for giving up a pension fund – and income drawdown – where investors keep control of their fund but could lose it all in the stock market.The products are offered in the form of a pension or an investment bond and come with a promise to pay a certain income in retirement – or guarantee a certain fund value – if the stock market falls below a given level.Nigel Callaghan, pensions analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, the adviser, said that anyone whose pension value was under the level guaranteed by Hartford should probably keep the policy.But Hartford’s withdrawal from the UK comes at a bad time for providers of variable annuities. They have struggled in recent months with the increased costs of providing guarantees on their policies.After the losses of last autumn, when the value of investors’ policies slumped below the levels guaranteed, insurers have been forced to pay out more than they had anticipated.This had already led MetLife and Aegon to raise the charges on their products in order to meet the increased costs they face – though the increases apply only to new rather than existing customers.Other major providers including Prudential and Standard Life have delayed launching variable annuities, citing the costs of providing the guarantee given the current market volatility.However, the three remaining providers – Aegon, Lincoln and MetLife – all said they had no plans to withdraw from the UK. MetLife said it had seen sales of its product “grow substantially” this year, with sales to the end of April about six times higher than the same time last year.Lincoln also said sales were up this year compared with a year ago. It added that there were no penalties at any stage for exiting its products.Investors with a MetLife product can turn off their guarantee, when no penalty applies, or encash it completely, when penalties may apply.Aegon’s investment bond can be cashed in at any time free of penalties. It also offers a third- way pension, though if this were transferred to other providers, the policyholder would lose the guarantee on the income.Third-way products were launched only three years ago in the UK with much fanfare, after successful sales in the US and Japan, but the concept has failed to take off with pensioners in this country.Variable annuities have been criticised for being too expensive and too difficult to understand.Independent financial advisers, through whom the products are exclusively sold, have also been wary of recommending them to clients.“One of the downsides of what’s happened in the economy is that people are really shying away from anything they don’t understand,” said Callaghan of Hargreaves Lansdown.“We think in theory they’re a good idea, but with the current crop, the numbers don’t stack up.”Experts said the future of third-way annuities would depend on whether providers could keep costs down.“The third-way product concept is still completely viable – it’s just whether people are happy to pay the costs,” said Andy Sanders, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt.He said that while the market was still very new, the growth was “significant”. Total premiums from third-way annuities in 2008 amounted to more than £1bn, according to a Watson Wyatt study, though this equated to only 14,000 people actually taking out policies.Helen Turner, sales and marketing director at Lincoln, argued that the market volatility had helped to highlight the benefits that variable annuities could offer.“In the current climate, clients are demanding options at retirement that can potentially help them recover some of the investment losses suffered in recent months,” she said.

Its shares picked up 2 per cent to $68.01.Meanwhile, Conoco Phillips, which last week beat analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings, rose 3.7 per cent to $42.50.During the week, the market managed to shrug off fears over swine flu, a worse contraction in the US economy than expected and a delay in the results of the government’s stress tests on banks to finish higher.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent. This was the Nasdaq’s eighth straight week of gains.But banking stocks finished on a low note after reports said the results of the government’s stress tests would be delayed from Monday until Thursday May 7 as banks debated the results and the government considered the best way to release the information.But Bill Webb, deputy chief investment officer of Gluskin Sheff, said: “I think investors are taking some comfort from the fact that the government has come up with a pragmatic process for the stress tests.”The general uncertainty weighed on confidence, which was also hit
by JPMorgan lowering its earnings forecasts for several institutions. Analysts warned: “We expect credit deterioration to persist, led by rising unemployment and continued sharp declines in home prices.”Bank of America closed down 2.6 per cent at $8.70 while Wells Fargo fell 2 per cent to $19.61.Morgan Stanley jumped, however, after John Mack, the chief executive, denied reports the company was looking to buy a regional bank. Its shares rose 9.2 per cent to $25.82.The markets took extra confidence from figures showing that the decline in manufacturing had slowed during April.The S&P 500 and the Dow both rose 0.5 per cent to 877.52 and 8,212.41, respectively. The Nasdaq gained 0.1 per cent to 1,719.20.Equities were also feeling the fall-out from several disappointing earnings announcements, especially in the financial sector.Mastercard became the second leading credit card company in two days to beat analysts’ estimates with its results. It saw some gains on Thursday after better-than- expected results at Visa lifted the sector as a whole but fell back on Friday as investors worried about falling revenues. Its shares lost 5.8 per cent to $172.90.MetLife, the biggest US life insurer, felt the effect of the recent market falls as performance in its investments dragged it to its first quarterly loss since 2001.Even excluding the investment performance, the company made a smaller profit than Wall Street had expected and its shares fell 7.7 per cent to $27.45.Hartford the insurer and financial services company, also suffered from the stock market crash as it was forced to pay out more on policies protecting customers from losses on investment accounts. This took the company to its third straight quarterly loss and its shares fell 7.9 per cent to $10.56.Aon, the insurance broker, was the third company in the sector to report falling revenues from investments. The company increased profits but fell short of analysts’ predictions and the shares lost 13.8 per cent to $36.38.Mr Webb said: “We have seen a lot of volatility this week but stocks have not moved outside of their recent range. It wouldn’t surprise me if the next few years are like this.”"

With the company having recently been added to Goldman Sachs’ “conviction buy” list, the shares jumped 11.4 per cent to $5.Equities initially dived after the government released the parameters of its stress tests on banks’ capital positions, with some analysts saying they wanted to see more detail on how much capital banks would be required to hold.But many investors were reassured by the fact the parameters seemed to match those set by Citigroup in what the bank said was an “internal stress test” and shares quickly rallied.“Citi said it would pass those parameters weeks ago, and they are considered to be one of the worst of the worst,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 1.7 per cent higher at 866.23 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.5 per cent up at 8,076.29. The Nasdaq Composite index rose 2.6 per cent to 1,694.29.The S&P finished 0.4 per cent lower for the week, while the Dow lost 0.7 per cent. The Nasdaq made a weekly gain of 1.3 per cent, however – the first time it has completed seven straight weeks of gains since 2005.The week started on a negative note as earnings from Bank of America triggered fears over increasing loan losses at financial companies on Monday and the market saw its biggest one-day fall since the rally began.A series of better earnings announcements after that helped restore confidence, but equities remained within a range without moving decisively either way.American Expresswas the latest major financial company to report its results. Its earnings beat expectations, which helped the shares leap 20.7 per cent to $25.30 yesterday morning.Elsewhere in the sector, Prudential rose after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company from a “sell” to a “buy”. Goldman said the sector could find cheap capital from the government. Prudential’s shares gained 10.8 per cent to $28.33.Goldman also increased its price target on MetLife, which rose 3.7 per cent to $29.25.Microsoft also rose after reporting results that were marginally ahead of consensus expectations. Its shares advanced 10.5 per cent to $20.91 having been given a further boost by Goldman Sachs, which upgraded the company to “overweight”, saying it was “ahead of plan on cost controls”.Amazon, the online re-tailer, rose after sales of its Kindle electronic book reader helped revenues rise 18 per cent, defying the consumer downturn. Its shares gained 4.8 per cent to $84.46.The sector was hampered, however, by Netflix. The online DVD rental company reported strong profits as customers continued to use the service as an inexpensive form of entertainment.But the shares lost 5.7 per cent to $42.73 as it warned about increasing competition from DVD rental kiosks.Figures showing orders for durable goods fell less than expected during March and helped the materials sector perform better than any other on the S&P. This also helped industrial stocks in spite of poor results.3M, the industrial company, reported disappointing earnings and revised its full-year profit forecasts downwards. But its shares still gained 5.2 per cent to
$57 as positive sentiment dominated the sector.But some analysts warned the market may be reacting too positively to the economic data.“Leading indicators like initial jobless claims continue to get worse,” said Doug Roberts. “Investors are reacting to what they want to see, not what is actually out there.”"
216;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-04-16T00:13:34Z;AIG near to key $2bn disposal;;AIG is in advanced talks to sell its US personal lines insurance business to Zurich Financial Services for about $2bn, a move that would mark the largest disposal by the US insurer since being rescued last year.Selling the unit, which includes car, motorcycle, and commercial vehicle insurance, to the Swiss group would help AIG repay $100bn in federal aid and maintain a chance of a future outside government control.People close to the matter warned that negotiations between AIG and Zurich Financial could still fall apart but said the two sides had been in talks for months and a deal could be announced in the next few days. MetLife, a US insurer, was also believed to have shown an interest in the unit.Executives have said the group wanted to sell the entire US personal lines business except for AIG private clients, a small unit catering to wealthy individuals.AIG and Zurich Financial declined to comment.AIG has been propped up by four US rescues since September and is 80 per cent owned by federal authorities.To secure its latest federal lifeline of $40bn in capital and $60bn in loans in March, the group agreed to break itself up and cede control of two of its biggest divisions to the government.The group is working to sell, list or wind down businesses that include a foreign general insurance business and International Lease Finance Corporation, its aircraft leasing group. It sold Hartford Steam Boiler to Munich Re in April for $739m.AIG’s ability to preserve the value of the operations it aims to sell, rather than having it seep out as customers and counter­parties switch allegiances, will directly affect its ability to repay the government.Acquisition of the AIG business would boost Zurich Financial’s scale in the US, where it says it is the third largest property and casualty insurer. Zurich Financial owns Farmers Insurance, a home and car insurance provider.Additional reporting by Paul J. Davies in London
217;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-04-14T20:59:38Z;US stocks fall despite Goldman results;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as much better than expected results from Goldman Sachs were offset by negative economic data.Financials were the biggest fallers even though Goldman helped return some confidence to the sector by far outstripping analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter earnings.Goldman announced it had made $3.39 a share against expectations of just $1.49 a share on the back of strong trading figures.But the bank’s shares fell as it also announced it was to raise $5bn of capital by issuing new shares in order to repay money from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp).This would dilute existing shareholdings, and its shares dropped 11.6 per cent to $115.11. Rival Morgan Stanley, which is forecast to make a loss when it reports, fell 12 per cent to $23.67.“It’s no surprise that Goldman was profitable, when they can borrow at zero per cent from the Federal Reserve. The real question is whether it has to make
writedowns later in the year,” said Andrew Mulligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments.However, the positive underlying results did help boost Citigroup, the most beaten-up of all the major banking stocks. Citi leapt 25 per cent during Monday’s session and added 5.5 per cent on Tuesday to $4.01.Financial shares in general were badly hit by figures which showed retail sales unexpectedly fell during March, losing 0.9 per cent, excluding sales of automobiles.Meanwhile, the falling oil price helped drive down ­producer prices in March, contrary to analysts’ ­expectations, following two successive months of gains.Discover dropped after it said that it would cut more than 4 per cent of its workforce as it strives to cut costs. The credit card lender also suffered from a downgrade to “hold” by Stifel Nicolaus, and its shares had lost 10.4 per cent to $7.57.MetLife, the life insurer, also fell, despite saying it would not take federal bail-out funds, even though it is entitled to by the fact that it purchased a bank in 2001.Robert Henrikson, its chief executive, said MetLife was “well positioned, with approximately $5bn in excess capital”. But its shares became caught in the broad sell-off, falling 8.2 per cent to $26.44.Retailers also suffered. after the data. Home Depot lost 2.4 per cent to $25.34, while Macy’s dropped 7.3 per cent to $11.99 and Best Buy fell 6.9 per cent to $38.10.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2 per cent down at 841.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 7,920.18 points and the Nasdaq Composite index had dropped 1.7 per cent to 1,625.72 points.“Analysts are being too optimistic with their predictions on what really matters, such as how much people are spending in stores,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers. “This is a really big disappointment, and one that is going to challenge the rally going forward.”The falls came despite positive comments on the economy from President Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Obama said he saw “signs of economic progress”. But stocks extended their slide after he finished speaking, with investors apparently having hoped for more from what was billed as a “major speech on the economy”.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, followed Goldman Sachs in topping analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings. The company said revenues were down, but it managed to keep costs low and reported earnings of $1.26 per share, against consensus estimates of $1.22. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $51.37.Lennar, the homebuilder, dropped after Moody’s downgraded its debt, citing concerns about the company’s liquidity position. Its shares lost 5.4 per cent to $7.78.MGM Mirage saw some rare positive news after it won a waiver from lenders to pay about $70m of obligations owed by both itself and its building partner Dubai World, which would allow it to continue to build its CityCenter development in Las Vegas. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $6.60.General Motors was another riser after reports that the ­government was considering swapping $13.4bn debt for equity in a new, stripped-down version of the ­carmaker. Its shares gained 4.1 per cent to $1.78."

Aflac said in February that downgrades of such securities could force it to take more writedowns this year. Its shares lost 3.2 per cent to $18.75“The jobs data spooked the market, but there are now some indications that we are starting to see a levelling off of the economic slump,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.7 per cent to 811.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 2 per cent to 7,761.60 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.5 per cent to 1,551.60.Telecoms were the biggest risers on the S&P, led higher by QWest which is considering selling its long haul network, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. With Verizon and AT&T said to be possible buyers, QWest’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $3.75.General Motors fell for a third consecutive session, however, weighed by further talk of bankruptcy, as the New York Times reported that the Obama administration was looking to lead the company into a “controlled” bankruptcy. GM’s shares lost 0.5 per cent to $1.93.But Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said that while the possible bankruptcy was not good news for GM shareholders, the increased certainty about the status of the company had helped calm the wider market.“There has been more clarity from Washington over automotives, and that is lending some stability to stocks,” he said.Healthcare stocks proved the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500 index, after Celgene the drug maker, warned about revenues coming in at the lower end of forecasts, saying it expected 2009 profits of about $2.05 per share. It lost 13.4 per cent to $38.47.Many investors were waiting for further news from the G20 meeting in London.Taro Aso, the Japanese prime minister, warned in an interview with the FT of the serious consequences of not agreeing another globally co-ordinated stimulus plan. But Mr Cardillo of Avalon said he believed that Wall Street would only move if there was a total breakdown of relations at the meeting.“The market is not going to hang its hat on the G20. Unless there’s an indication that protectionism might come into play the market will ignore it.”Apollo Group, the University of Phoenix’s parent company, fell in spite of better-than-expectesd quarterly earnings. Investors were spooked by warnings of slowing margin growth and of the university facing increased regulatory oversight. Its shares lost 15.2 per cent to $66.46.
219;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-03-18T19:52:04Z;US stocks spike on Fed plan;;US stocks surged on Wednesday afternoon, taking the S&P briefly back over 800, as the Federal Reserve announced unprecedented measures to clear financial companies’ balance sheets and stimulate the economy.The unexpected move by the Federal Reserve to buy $300bn in long-term Treasury bonds and an additional $750bn in mortgage-backed securities delighted investors, with financial stocks feeling the most benefit.The benchmark S&P 500 index spiked after the announcement, and was 1.6 per cent up at 790.8 shortly before the close, having hit a high of 803.04. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7,642.6 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.6 per cent to 1,486.16.Banks were the biggest risers, having also been boosted by reports from Bloomberg that the Treasury was ready to expand the term asset-backed relief program (Talf) also to help clear balance sheets. The troubled Citigroup lifted 22.7 per cent to $3.08.Bank of America, whose chief executive, Ken Lewis, earlier said would be able to repay $45bn in government money from the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), picked up 17.2 per cent to $7.35.Fifth Third gained after it declared a dividend of $0.01 a share, helping to push its stock up 13.9 per cent to $2.22.Insurers also felt the benefit of the Fed’s boldness, with Metlife rising 25.8 per cent to 25.17 and Prudential gaining 19 per cent to $24.02.Morgan Stanley fell, however, after JPMorgan, as part of its new coverage of the company, said that it would need more capital. It dropped 0.6 per cent to $23.68.“The Fed needed to act with buying these assets and injecting money into the banks by printing money to capitalise the banks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.But others were more sceptical about the effectiveness of the Fed’s plan. Joe Clark, managing partner at Financial Enhancement Group, said it could actually be bad news for stocks. “I don’t think that many people would view that as a good thing, especially when China has said it is already concerned about US debt. There could be some serious consequences if we were to anger China.”The technology sector continued its recent good performance after it emerged IBM was in advanced talks to buy its smaller rival Sun Microsystems for $10 per share, more than double Tuesday’s closing price. The news sent shares in Sun soaring 77.5 per cent to $8.82 while IBM slipped 2 per cent to $91.01.“The recent buying of tech stocks shows we have hit the bottom. You wouldn’t buy growth stocks if you didn’t think the economy was going to recover,” said Mr Pado.The Fed’s move came despite data released on Wednesday morning showing consumer prices in the US rose more than expected in February, with the consumer price index gaining 0.4 per cent, easing worries over deflation.Corporate earnings from General Mills, the food producer which makes Cheerios, came in below estimates as high costs took their toll, sending its shares down 11.4 per cent to $47.55.But there was better news from Darden Restaurants, the owner of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains which beat analysts’ forecasts for its third quarter earnings. Its shares rose 18.6 per cent to $35.47.Gains in industrial stocks were limited after the World Bank cut its forecast for economic growth in China, fuelling worries over global demand for materials.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 1.7 per cent to $37.57, while Caterpillar, which produces machinery for both US and Chinese miners, gained 1.9 per cent to $27.33.Nucor, the steel manufacturer, rose 5 per cent to $35.22. The shares had suffered earlier after JPMorgan cut its 2009 earnings forecast for the company by 75 per share.Energy stocks put a moderate drag on the market’s gains, rising only slightly after oil prices came off their recent lows. Chevron picked up 1.6 per cent to $66.36 and Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $69.16. The shares were hit in part by profit taking, with the sector having gained more than10 per cent between the beginning of last week and the end of Tuesday.

It also dragged down the financial sector, which had enjoyed an early banking-led rally.Shares in Citigroup surged back above $2, gaining 30.9 per cent to $2.33 as confidence in the banking sector continued to rise after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s leading banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.The sector was also given a boost when Barclays of the UK added its name to the big banks that have said they started the year well.Last week Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009.Bank of America rose 7.3 per cent to $6.18 but JPMorgan fell after American Express’ announcement, losing 2.8 per cent to $23.09.Financial companies were also helped by messages from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed changes to the mark-to-market accounting rule, which has been blamed for exacerbating worries over financial companies’ capital positions.The board proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is “distressed” when measuring the value of an asset.Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 8.1 per cent to $19.17 and Prudential lifting 1.8 per cent to $19.10.Capital One provided some relief from American Express’ news after it announced reduced the numbers of auto loans it believes will never be repaid. Its shares gained 0.1 per cent to $12.57.But many investors still feel the recent rally by financial stocks is flimsy. Terry Morris, senior vice president at National Penn Investors Trust Company, said: “Citi’s rise is based on speculative buying that leads to short-covering. The company is not 40 per cent better than it was on Friday.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 753.89, having earlier been over 2 per cent higher, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to 7,216.97.Weakness from the technology sector weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index, which lost 1.9 per cent to 1,404.02.Cisco announced on Monday it was to sell servers for data systems in partnership with smaller technology companies. Its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $15.45.Analysts said the deal might herald other large companies in the sector snapping up smaller rivals, but shares in many of those companies still fell as investors moved their money back into riskier sectors.Oracle, which was named specifically by Barron’s, the publication for investors, as a potential purchaser, was one of the biggest drags on the sector, losing 4.2 per cent to $14.90. Intel meanwhile fell 3.1 per cent to $14.25 and Dell dropped 5 per cent to $8.90.Investors had looked to the cash-rich technology sector as a defensive trade but as financials strengthened, it became the day’s biggest faller. Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “People are coming back to the financial sector and seeing some recovery in healthcare stocks.”Industrial stocks were led higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected.Investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company and the company’s shares rose 0.4 per cent to $9.66.Consol Energy rallied in spite of the falling price of oil, rising 5.5 per cent to $27.48 after Barron’s said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making it a bargain.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 5 per cent to $19.64 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company. Gilead lost 2.7 per cent to $44.19.
221;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-03-16T14:27:15Z;Wall Street on course for fifth day of rises;;Financials led the way once more on Monday morning as US stocks headed towards their fifth day of rises for the first time since November.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave the equities markets an early boost after he appeared on national television on Sunday night and reassured the public that economic recovery would begin in 2009 if government action worked.He said the country’s major banks were solvent, adding that he already saw some “green shoots” of recovery.His words helped further bolster confidence in the banking sector, which was given a jolt when the British bank Barclays added its name to the major banks which have recently said they had a good start to the year. Last week Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan all said they were profitable for the first two months of 2009. They rose further in early trade on Monday. Citi was 19.7 per cent up at $2.13, Bank of America rose 10.7 per cent to $6.39 and JPMorgan gained 2.4 per cent to $24.50.Financial companies were also helped by messages from The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which proposed allowing companies to exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is active and if a transaction is ”distressed.” “There is likely to be a change which allows illiquid assets not to be marked and requires liquid assets to be marked,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global. Insurers were buoyed by the news, with MetLife picking up 12 per cent to $19.87 and Prudential lifting 9.4 per cent to $20.53.Industrial stocks were dragged higher by General Electric, in spite of figures released on Monday morning showing that industrial production had fallen by more than expected. GE continued its gains of last week as investors took confidence from UBS, which removed its short-term “sell” recommendation on the company. This comes after S&P downgraded the company by only one notch last week, a less aggressive move than many had anticipated.Energy stocks managed to stay stable even after OPEC triggered a fall in the price of oil by saying it would not cut output. The price for a barrel of US crude fell $1.98 to $44.27, but investors seemed to take solace in the news that the cartel would crack down on member countries exceeding their quotas. Chevron gained 0.2 per cent to $63.04, while ExxonMobil also lifted 0.2 per cent to $67.32 after Citigroup put a “buy” rating on its stock in new coverage. Consol Energy outperformed the sector, rising 2.3 per cent to $26.86 after Barron’s the publication for investors, said the company had a strong balance sheet and low operating costs, making its stock a bargain.All three major market measures were up, with the benchmark S&P 500 index 1.2 ahead on 765.57, the Dow Jones industrial Average picking up 1 per cent to 7,293.83 The Nasdaq Composite index was steady at 1,431.42.Shares in CV Therapeutics fell 4.6 per cent to $19.71 after Astellas, the Japanese pharmaceuticals company, confirmed it would not enter into a bidding war with Gilead Sciences for the company. Gilead picked lost 1.2 per cent to $44.87.DirecTV gained after Barron’s said the satellite television company’s earnings were in line for a sharp rise this year. The company’s shares picked up 1 per cent to $21.21 before the bell.European stocks were up early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index 1.7 per cent ahead at 714.36. Asian equity markets closed at their highest levels in a month, led by a 3.6 per cent rise in the Hang Seng to 12,976.71.Bond yields were up, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 3 basis points to 0.988 per cent and on the 10-year Treasury note by 6bp to 2.949 per cent.The dollar was down against major currencies early in New York, falling to $1.41 against the pound.Gold was trading $0.88 lower at $921.65 per troy ounce.
222;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
223;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-03-04T22:04:32Z;Wall Street lifted by Chinese stimulus plans;;General Electric, once the biggest company in the world by capitalisation, on Wednesday saw its share price dip to a low not seen since 1991 during an otherwise positive day on Wall Street.GE was forced to issue a statement tackling rumours it would have to raise fresh capital as the cost of insuring against the company’s finance arm defaulting on its debt spiked.After falling steeply in early trade it the company’s shares bounced slightly when the company said it had “acted aggressively” to adapt to the current recession and had ”no plans to raise additional equity”. They ended the day down 4.6 per cent at $6.69.That went against the general trend of the day, which saw all three major indices rising on hopes that China could shore up global demand, with a fresh stimulus package from Beijing widely expected.Metal producers were amongst the biggest gainers, with Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, picking up 13.4 per cent to $32.21. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, and Alcoa, the aluminium maker, also saw gains, rising 8.1 per cent to $34.73 and 12.8 per cent to $6.24 respectively.The news from Beijing also helped had an effect on oil prices, and US crude rose $3.51 to $45.16 per barrel. This was followed by energy companies, including Chevron, which rose 2.7 per cent to $59.28 and Exxon Mobil, which gained 2.1 per cent to $65.68.Caterpillar, which supplies machinery to domestic mining markets and to China directly, was a big gainer, rising 13.2 per cent to $25.44.A potential uptick in demand from Asia also helped technology stocks, which have been heavily sold during the first couple of months of 2009. Applepicked up 3.2 to $91.17 while Cisco rose 6 per cent to $15.25.“The sector got badly beaten up at the start of the year, but the news out of China has encouraged some buyers,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 712.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.2 per cent to 6,875.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.5 per cent to 1,353.74.Financial stocks were the worst performing sector on the S&P, however, despite further details from Washington on the Obama administration’s $275bn plan to help homeowners avoid defaulting on their mortgages. Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary, said that mortgage providers could start reducing borrowers’ payments immediately.“The mortgage plan is a great idea,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “It will allow some homeowners to refinance and so should relieve pressure on financial stocks.”But others have warned that the administration is not being sufficiently friendly towards equity markets, in spite of President Obama’s reassurance on Tuesday that “buying stocks is a potentially good deal”.“The market will find selling pressure until Washington decides to address the market’s decline via policies which are friendly toward capital formation and investment,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Banks were down, with Citigroup falling 7.4 per cent to $1.13, and Bank of America dropping 1.4 per cent to $3.59. US Bancorp added significant pressure to the sector after becoming the latest large company to cut its dividend, reducing it from 42.5 cents to just 5 cents per share. Its shares fell 12.5 per cent to $11.01.This leaves Wells Fargo as the largest traditional commercial bank not to cut its dividend, and fears that it would soon do so sent the company’s stock down 9.5 per cent to $9.66.Insurers rallied after Tuesday’s falls on news that 12 life insurers have applied for capital injections from the Treasury in order to buy local lenders.MetLife rose 7.3 per cent to $14.72, while Lincoln National and Prudential gained 9.2 per cent to $7.16 and 7.1 per cent to $13.82 respectively.But the overall fall in the financial sector reflected fears in the credit markets about the security of those companies’ debts.The CDR Counterparty Risk Index, a measure of the counterparty risk in the sector, was at its highest level this morning since September last year, went Lehman Brothers went bust.
224;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-03-03T21:53:13Z;Insurers and financials foil Wall Street;;"The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day below the 700 points level for the first time since October 1996 in a choppy trading session dominated by news coming from Washington.Share prices fluctuated as President Barack Obama, Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the federal reserve, all spoke in what appeared to be a concerted effort to calm the markets after heavy sell-offs during the last week.But the effort appeared to have failed in the short term, with all three major indices closing down on Tuesday. The S&P lost 0.6 per cent to 696.33 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 6,726.02 points and the Nasdaq dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,321.01 points.Insurers led the afternoon’s retreat during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to a senate committee. Mr Bernanke said that the stricken insurer AIG had been a “hedge fund basically that was attached to a large and stable insurance company”. His words triggered fears about how exposed other insurers were to AIG.Metlife fell 16.9 per cent to $13.72. Lincoln National, which was hit by a ratings downgrade from Fitch, closed 14.9 per cent down at $6.56. Prudential lost 12.6 per cent to $12.90.After an early rally as bargain hunters looked to take advantage of low prices after Monday’s heavy falls, there was a mixed picture for the banks by the closing bell.Citigroup finished 1.7 per cent higher at $1.22 while Bank of America rose, in spite of being downgraded by S&P, the rating agency. It finished 0.6 per cent up at $3.65. Wells Fargo lost 1.6 per cent to $10.67.The early gains were eroded during Mr Bernanke’s testimony.Dave Rovell, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams, said: “It was the aggressive questioning from senators that weighed especially heavily. One spent a long time calling for nationalisation, putting pressure on financial stocks.”In the afternoon, Tim Geithner launched the term asset-backed securities loan facility, but the markets were left hungry for further details, and his words failed to spark a recovery.Mr Obama was even moved to give his own bullish assessment of stocks during the afternoon, saying, “Profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal.”Industrial stocks rose on speculation that China, the world’s biggest metal purchaser, could soon start to buy in large quantities.Metal companies performed particularly well. Freeport McMoRan, the copper producer, gained 7.3 per cent to $28.41, while Nucorp, which makes steel, rose by
4.5 per cent to $32.12.Energy stocks followed the price of oil higher. Consol Energy, which suffered in the previous session after announcing the temporary closure of its Buchanan coal mine in Virginia, gained 4.4 per cent to $32.57. Chevronalso picked up, rising 0.2 per cent to $57.73.GE, which dropped sharply on Monday after the announcement last week of the company’s first dividend cut since 1938, continued to lose ground, falling 7.8 per cent to $7.01.“GE looks relatively cheap but the company has
really very little in tangible assets,” said Steve Lehman from Federated Investors. There were also concerns that the company would soon have to raise capital.In the technology sector, Apple announced it would release a new Macbook laptop computer. Its shares rose 0.5 per cent to $88.37.Dell gained, in spite of a report on Monday from technology researcher Gartner that forecast an 11.9 per cent drop in personal computer sales this year. It gained 8.5 per cent to $9.15.There was more bad economic news as the number of pending US home sales, those for which contracts have been signed but the purchaser has not yet moved, fell by 7.7 per cent in January, more than twice as much as expected.The home building sector fell 7.5 per cent on the pending sales figure, and real estate stocks followed. Developers Diversified was the biggest loser, down 17.1 per cent to $1.94.There was no major spike in volatility, which analysts said would have to come before equity markets bottomed out. The Vix index, which measures volatility, fell 0.4 per cent."
225;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-02-27T21:34:52Z;Citi deal hits US financials;;US stocks plummeted again on Friday to levels not seen since 1996.Details of a government plan to take a 36 per cent stake in Citigroup and more negative economic data caused the heavy falls, which took shares below Monday’s level, when they tested 1997 lows.Investors balked at the dilution of Citi’s shares by the government holding as well as the news that the company would suspend all dividend payments.But an annualised 6.2 per cent fall for the fourth quarter in US gross domestic product, the sharpest since 1982, meant that the whole market was hit.The benchmark S&P 500 index dropped 2.4 per cent for the day, finishing at 735.09.Citigroup saw 39 per cent of its share price wiped out, finishing at $1.50. It was joined by Bank of America, which shed 25.8 per cent to $3.95 and Wells Fargo, which lost 16 per cent to $12.10. Banks fell 8.7 per cent, and the financial sector overall lost 7.4 per cent.Insurers, meanwhile, fared even worse, hit not only by general fears over the financial sector but also by the fact that Standard & Poor’s cut its rating for 10 companies in the sector.Principal Financial lost 24.6 per cent to $7.99, Metlife dropped 23.1 per cent to $18.46 and Lincoln National fell 20.1 per cent to $8.59.“The insurers have been big backers of commercial securities and that area is getting weak as well,” said Pran Tiku, chief investment officer at Peak Financial. “The whole financial sector is going to continue to show weakness,” he added.General Electric slumped in afternoon trade after the group cut its quarterly dividend from 31 cents to 10 cents per share. Even though the news had been widely expected, its shares fell 6.5 per cent to $8.53.It was a mixed day for healthcare stocks, which fell in afternoon trading after early gains as the market continued to digest the government’s healthcare plan.Humana recovered to gain 0.1 per cent to $23.67, but other companies lost out, such as Johnson & Johnson, which fell 4.7 per cent to $50. Overall, the sector lost 4.2 per cent, contributing to a total fall of 11.4 per cent for the week.“When people started looking at the details of the Obama plan, it got even more frightening for healthcare companies,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Dell did well after its earnings beat analysts’ predictions and it announced it would seek to save an extra $1bn as part of ongoing cost-cutting efforts. Its shares were up 3.9 per cent to $8.53.Heavy selling was also seen on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index. The Dow fell 1.7 per cent at 7,062.93, while the Nasdaq fell 0.98 per cent to 1,377.84 The Dow has now seen six straight months of falls.The sell-off capped a turbulent week, which saw the equities market breaking through November’s lows after heavy selling on Monday which some analysts called “capitulation” and “a technical breakdown”.Despite a mid-week rally, all three indices finished around 4 per cent down for the week, with different sectors having pulled in opposite directions throughout on announcements from Washington.On Tuesday and Wednesday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped trigger a surge in banking stocks when he reassured the market that the government had no plans to nationalise banks.His message was boosted when Mr Obama announced that, as part of his budget, he wanted to put aside $250bn into a reserve fund in case the financial sector needed further bail-outs.These announcements meant that financial stocks remained one of the week’s big winners, even after Friday’s selling, finishing the week 2 per cent up.“The government is starting to realise it needs to either nationalise the banks or be very clear that it will not,” said Mr Paulsen. “But it could still have been more explicit this week.”
226;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BofA stages turnround amid the gloom;;Banking stocks swung violently between spectacular losses and gains on Wednesday as traders scrambled to assess where the Obama administration’s rescue plans leave shareholders.The KBW bank index lurched from losses of as much as 7.6 per cent to gains of 7.1 per cent. The index finished 2.4 per cent higher on hopes that existing equity would at least not be wiped out altogether under further intervention from Washington.The wider market had a downbeat start to the wild session after National Association of Realtors data showed an unexpectedly steep fall in sales of previously owned homes as low prices failed to attract buyers.Yet stocks later rallied after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, again sought to calm nerves that a leading bank would be nationalised. “He has reinforced the message,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The government wants to take preference shares rather than common shares because it wants to give banks an easy way out if the worst doesn’t happen.”However, a strong afternoon rally gave way to a significant sell-off in the last half hour of trading and the wider market finished in the red.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “The bottom line is that we are still lacking any confidence and there is a fear factor the markets can’t seem to get rid of. On top of that, the market just isn’t buying the message coming out of President Obama’s White House at the moment.”At the end of the wild session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index all closed 1.1 per cent lower at 764.90 points, 7,270.89 points and 1,425.43 points, respectively.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “People are buying on a rumour and selling on the subsequent news.”Among the volatile performers, Bank of Americaat one point was down 11.2 per cent after Merrill Lynch disclosed that ineffective internal controls had caused the bank to understate losses last year by $500m.The shares closed up 9.1 per cent at $5.16, as investors focused on the pledge from its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, that the lender would pass the government’s so-called stress test.Citigroup lost 16.9 per cent in the morning session, but rallied to stand 3.1 per cent lower at $2.52.The energy sector – down as much as 2.7 per cent in the morning session – later rallied to close 0.7 per cent lower.Although banking stocks finished higher, the financial sector overall lost ground, weighed down by insurers.Lincoln National reported its first loss in six years and slashed its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 1 cent. The shares sank 14 per cent to $11.21.The news had a knock-on effect on the rest of the life assurance sector.Prudential fell 2.7 per cent to $19.86, while MetLife lost 5.4 per cent to $22.05.Allstate shed 5.7 per cent to $17.57 after the home and car insurer also slashed its dividend by more than half, after two consecutive quarterly losses.But even though the market fell, the Vix – an index of anxiety – also eased 1.9 per cent to 44.6.Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Would lower equity index prices be synonymous with a higher degree of investor fear? The answer turned out to be a resounding ‘no’.”Earlier in the session, the market had sold off heavily after investors overlooked the speech by President Obama the previous evening and focused on data that showed home purchases fell by 5.3 per cent to an annual rate of 4.49m, the fewest since 1997. The S&P fell 1.2 per cent in the 10 minutes after the figures were issued.Homebuilders shed 0.8 per cent overall in choppy trade.Industrials was the worst performing sector of the day, off 2.9 per cent overall. Boeing lost 4.3 per cent at $33.91 and Lockheed Martin 5.4 per cent at $70.46.Telecommunications was the only sector to find positive territory after JPMorgan analysts upgraded their view of AT&T to “overweight”.“Wireline guidance assumptions are conservative,” they wrote. The shares bucked the downward trend, up 2 per cent to $23.71.
227;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Axa;;"Time was when Axa could not put a foot wrong. The French insurer’s chief executive, Henri de Castries, became the poster boy of France’s global presence in financial services. Under his rule, Axa’s share price outperformed the Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance index by almost 40 per cent – until two years ago.Since then, worries about insurers’ capital adequacy have stripped away much of the glamour and value. Axa’s share price has plunged by no less than 78 per cent in the almost nine years since Mr de Castries took his post. Axa has lost more than half of its value this year alone. The fear is that the deterioration in the insurer’s equity portfolios will force it to raise capital. Investors worry that Axa is about to throw merger risk into the mix: it is rumoured to be one of the bidders for stricken US insurer AIG’s life assurance business.Axa managed only partly to address concerns about the adequacy of its capital base in its annual results presentation last week, saying, disarmingly, that it might raise €2bn of preference shares as an “insurance policy”. It also cut its dividend by two-thirds for 2008, signalling that cash was tight. That was only prudent after €2.8bn of mostly equity-related writedowns triggered an 83 per cent plunge in full year net profit.Yet investors remain spooked by Axa’s solvency ratio (actual capital to required capital) which, at 127 per cent, looks low. UBS says the possible funding would boost it by about 9 percentage points – but that a 20 per cent drop in equity markets this year (European markets are already down 22 per cent) would shave off six points. Axa’s share price, trading at about four times forecast earnings, suggests a rights issue looms. Though parachuting in to buy AIG’s life business – which MetLife is said to value at $11.2bn – may be consistent with Mr de Castries’s growth strategy, it may be a bridge too far.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

228;MET;Metlife Inc;2009-01-28T21:42:31Z;Wall Street buoyed by bank rescue hopes;;"US banking stocks enjoyed spectacular gains on Wednesday, helping the wider market extend its winning streak to four straight sessions – the longest since the government rescued Citigroup last November.Citigroup and Bank of America were among the key winners, up 18.6 per cent to $4.21 and 13.7 per cent to $7.39, respectively, as the sector rallied on that Washington could set up a so-called bad bank to take on the toxic assets that lie at the heart of the
financial crisis.Wells Fargo leapt 30.9 per cent to $21.19 as investors overlooked its first quarterly loss since 2001 and focused instead on the disclosure that it would not seek additional capital from the government’s troubled asset relief programme and that it would maintain its quarterly dividend.Regional lenders also did well, up 14.3 per cent overall. Among custodian banks, State Street leapt 31.4 per cent to $25.77.“We’ve had all that public chatter about possibly nationalising banks . . . that would totally destroy the equity,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital. “What the market wants is less uncertainty every day [and] it seems like we’re solidifying on a good bank / bad bank approach.”Insurers were key winners after a group of state insurance regulators endorsed industry proposals to ease capital requirements.MetLife and Lincoln National jumped 20.2 per cent to $33.27 and 21.8 per cent to $20.64, respectively.Financials dominated the leaderboard as the benchmark S&P 500 index finished up 3.4 per cent at 874.09, leaving it more than 16 per cent away from an 11-year low it hit in November.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.5 per cent higher at 8,375.45 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 3.6 per cent stronger at 1,558.34.The market hit session highs after the Federal Reserve indicated it was ready to push ahead with the unconventional move to buy long-term Treasuries.During the morning, the S&P rose above its 50-day moving average – a key technical level – for the first time in nearly three weeks.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 6 per cent to hit its lowest level since the first full week of the year.The S&P had already enjoyed a three-day winning streak, only the third such run of gains since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, according to Bespoke Investment Group.Financials have been the key winners. The sector overall has climbed 28.1 per cent since hitting its lowest level since 1995 last week.Outside the financial sector on Wednesday, most stocks enjoyed more modest, but nevertheless strong, gains.Technology rallied 3.7 per cent overall, given a boost from better-than-expected figures from Yahoo and Sun Microsystems. Shares in the search group and server manufacturer jumped 7.9 per cent to $12.24 and 21.8 per cent to $4.86, respectively.Most earnings continued to be downbeat. Boeing, among the most high-profile, edged 0.1 per cent higher to $43.24 despite worse-than-expected figures. Bulls have argued that the market has stopped reacting adversely to bad news.Negative earnings surprises – when companies miss forecasts – are now at a 10-year high, according to Merrill Lynch.Still, Richard Bernstein, strategist, wrote: “Investors do not seem to realise that credit problems so far have largely manifested themselves in traditional ‘early cycle’ sectors…and seem unaware of the risks to mid- and late-cycle sectors [such as energy, industrials, materials and technology].”Telecoms was the worst performing sector and spent much of the session in the red in the wake of a fall in profit at AT&T, which dipped 0.1 per cent to $25.91 Still, by the wider sector found positive territory, up 1.3 per cent overall.Verizon, which fell 3.3 per cent in the previous session as the group’s fourth-quarter profit trailed some expectations, recovered 3.2 per cent to $30.92 after Citigroup reiterated its “buy” recommendation on the stock, highlighting opportunities in its wireless division.Energy stocks, up 2.3 per cent, tracked the oil price higher. Defensive sectors underperformed as investor risk appetite returned. Healthcare, consumer
staples and utilities rose 1.3 per cent, 1.1 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively."
229;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-12-10T23:15:51Z;AIG plans $15bn disposals before year end;;AIG is planning to announce more than $15bn worth of disposals before the end of the year – a move that would enable the stricken US insurer to pay back part of a $60bn government loan and ease the burden of its $150bn federal bail-out.People familiar with the situation said AIG was in the final stages of the sale of its US personal lines business, which has been valued by analysts at $5bn-$6bn.The US insurer MetLife and its Swiss rival Zurich were interested in the unit, whose offerings include car and home insurance, they added.Asia-based bankers said AIG was also closing on the disposal of American Life Insurance Co (Alico) – a business with an estimated value of more than $10bn that has large operations in Japan. France’s Axa is believed to be one of the front-runners.Other companies, including MetLife and the Chinese sovereign wealth fund CIC, were also interested in buying parts of the business if AIG failed to clinch a sale of the whole unit or a buyer wanted to break it up, they added.Several companies have also expressed an interest in Hartford Steam Boiler, an AIG division that insures energy projects.People close to the situation said that Munich, the German insurer, and the West Virginia-based group Allegheny Insurance were among the front-runners for the company, which is believed to be worth about $1bn-$2bn.AIG and the other companies declined to comment on the deals or could not be reached.Munich has said it could be interested in parts of AIG’s businesses, including specialist insurance and reinsurance businesses in the US and primary insurers in Asia and eastern Europe.People close to the situation warned that no disposal had yet been clinched and that talks could still collapse or be delayed until after the end of the year.But after being rescued by the US authorities twice this year, AIG’s only hope of surviving as an independent company and persuading customers to stay is to sell assets and repay the government’s five-year loan as soon as possible.Separately, AIG on Wednesday denied a Wall Street Journal report that it owed banks $10bn on derivative trades and could be forced to find new capital to pay for the new exposure.The company said it had a $9.8bn nominal exposure to the trades, which are part of its $71.6bn portfolio of credit default swaps.However, it said its actual exposure was much lower because the positions had already been written down. It added that the exposure would be “addressed” by using funds already provided by the Federal Reserve.AIG officials said the main issue with the $9.8bn worth of trades was that they were “synthetic swaps” that did not have an underlying security.As a result, they had to be resolved in a different want from other credit default swaps, which are being bought by a vehicle funded by the Fed.Additional reporting by James Wilson in Frankfurt
230;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-12-08T22:14:54Z;Wall St rallies on Obama infrastructure plans;;"Hard-hit industrial and commodity stocks were among the most prized in a bullish session on Wall Street that lifted the market to its highest level in nearly a month.Plans for the biggest infrastructure investment in the US for half a century helped Caterpillar and Alcoa, which rose 10.9 per cent at $42.42 and 17.6 per cent at $9.58, respectively.In addition to the spending proposals of US president-elect Barack Obama, which would see new government projects such as roads, bridges and school buildings, sentiment was also helped as Washington edged closer to a deal to bail out the ailing American car industry.General Motors and Ford leapt 20.8 per cent to $4.93 and 24.3 per cent to $3.38, respectively, on hopes of imminent aid.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 3.8 per cent at 909.70 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just shy of the psychologically significant 9,000 level, up 3.5 per cent at 8,934.18 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.1 per cent to 1,571.74 points.“The sketchy plans were broad enough in scope to help send equity values skyrocketing,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers, of the market’s reaction to the stimulus proposals.The materials sector led the advance, up 7.7 per cent overall. Dow Chemical jumped 7.2 per cent to $20.37 after the group disclosed plans to cut 5,000 full-time jobs in a move expected to save $700m in annual operating costs by 2010.There was mixed news in the media sector. The Tribune Company, publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But Gannett, publisher of USA Today among other titles, gained 2.7 per cent to $9.16.Energy stocks were other big winners as US crude prices rebounded from their sharpest weekly retreat since 1991.Leading the gains, Chesapeake Energy soared 24.4 per cent to $14.08 after Aubrey McClendon, chief executive, sought to quash rumours that it could have liquidity difficulties. Joseph Allman, JPMorgan analyst, welcomed the update and upgraded his recommendation on the stock from “neutral” to “overweight”.Devon Energy was helped by a note from Jefferies, which upgraded its recommendation from “hold” to “buy” and set a $100 price target. “Devon is well positioned to pursue opportunistic acquisitions in a tight credit and depressed commodity price environment,” the analysts said. The shares rose 6.6 per cent to $65.32.However, profit warnings from 3M and Illinois Tool Works limited gains among industrials.The former was one of the day’s key losers, down 4.1 per cent at $57.38 in spite of a move to shed 1,800 jobs. However, Illinois finished the session up 1.4 per cent at $32.84. Homebuilders extended some of last week’s spectacular gains, up 3.2 per cent overall.McDonald’s, off 2.9 per cent to $60.92, was among the main losers in the consumer sector, in spite of a reasonable like-for-like November sales performance. Oppenheimer cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast due to the earnings risks presented by the strengthening dollar.In financials, MetLife lost 2.4 per cent to $30.03 after the insurer forecast profit for the fourth-quarter and next year below analyst predictions.The decline came even after the company became the latest in the sector – after Prudential Financial and Hartford Financial last week – to state that it was well capitalised.NYSE Euronext was among the strong gains in exchanges, up 22.5 per cent to $26.21, after reports over the weekend that it had been in talks with Deutsche Börse about a potential tie-up.The talks ended without an agreement.The US economic stimulus package is likely to include additional spending on internet broadband infrastructure and the technology sector stood 5.2 per cent higher
overall.Yahoo gained 4.6 per cent to $12.20 on renewed hopes that the company could reach a long-awaited deal with Microsoft, which was up 5.7 per cent at $21.01.Apple gained 6.1 per cent to $99.72 on reports that Wal-Mart would sell its iPhone for as little as $99. Shares in the retailer, among several defensive stocks to come under pressure, lost 1.1 per cent to $57.56."
231;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-11-30T22:19:42Z;Be wary of the next big idea – variable annuities;;Annuities often get a bad press, seen as insurance company profiteering at the expense of people’s hard-earned savings. In the UK, where the rules demand that people buy an annuity with their pension savings by age 75, there are increasing calls for change. Wealthy people in particular do not like handing over their pension pots to insurance companies and being unable to pass anything on to heirs except at penal tax rates.In the US, where there is more flexibility, some are suggesting a move in the opposite direction, to compulsory annuitisation as part of a new government-guaranteed national pension scheme.The debate has been spurred by the damage done to pension savings by falling markets and the imminent retirement of the baby boom generation. Rising life expectancy is an aggravating factor, and the well-established trend away from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions, for private sector workers at least, makes the subject increasingly relevant.Annuities essentially offer a means of insuring against the risk of running out of money. Like other types of insurance, cover depends on the insurer staying in business – a heightened concern currently. In the UK, the issue is insurers’ use of corporate bonds rather than government gilts to back their annuity books. High yields on corporate bonds mean annuity rates look unusually tempting, but the possibility of losses on those bonds makes judging the financial health of an insurer a priority.In the US, concerns have been centred on the health of insurers, such as the Hartford, MetLife and ING, offering variable annuities – investment-linked products that typically provide minimum income guarantees.However, no insurer has gone bust yet from problems with annuities, and those that come through the variable annuity testing ground unscathed will have learned valuable lessons, according to insurance analyst Ned Cazalet.Variable annuities have been a big hit in the US. Sales took off post 2000 and total assets in the products were $1,406bn (£915bn, €1,102bn) at the end of June, according to figures from Nava, the Association for Insured Retirement Solutions. Sales have fallen in response to market volatility and insurers have had to increase charges or cut guaranteed income levels. But success in the US persuaded some insurers to bring their product to Europe – so far with little success.Initial excitement about the potential for variable annuities in the UK market has dissipated, and UK-based insurers have put back plans to launch their own products. Aside from the obvious problems caused by stock market disruption, the complexity of the products has also proved a barrier to sales.Independent financial advisers like the idea of variable annuities, as a halfway house between conventional annuities and drawing an income direct from a pension investment portfolio. But they have yet to sell them in any quantity. Nigel Callaghan, pensions analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, does not recommend them. They are too expensive, he says, and often put a limit on the exposure to equities or cap the upside.Mr Cazalet says IFAs are right to be wary, because the complexity of the products makes them difficult to analyse or compare with alternatives.Investment-linked annuities have not gained much ground in the UK. The risks of income falling with poor performance rather than rising on good performance were underlined by the Equitable Life blow-up.But variable annuities may prove the innovation the market needs to take off. Investment banks reportedly expect the products to be huge eventually, and are offering to construct them for insurers and asset managers.I must confess to sharing IFAs’ wariness of variable annuities. Paying 2 per cent a year, even 4 per cent at the extremes, for guarantees could wipe out any benefit from being exposed to risky investments, especially if the upside is capped. The products appear to extend hopes of a higher income than could be achieved without taking any risk, but with little real possibility of achieving that. Smoke and mirrors – like many structured products.However, the problems may lie, as with conventional annuities, with the information asymmetry typical of the financial services arena, and the lack of real competition. There is a need for innovation in the post-retirement income market, and for products that offer the potential for growth but with protection.The question is how to construct and deliver such products, assuming the expertise exists to design them, in a way that works for investors, as well as for product providers.pauline.skypala@ft.com
232;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-11-19T21:53:50Z;Deflation fears send Dow below 8,000;;The chilling prospect of a deflationary US economy and collapsed car industry sent Wall Street stocks on Thursday to their lowest levels since the financial crisis began.Investors took fright at labour department data that showed the cost of living plunged the most since records began in 1947, and the first decline in so-called core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, in more than 25 years.Sheryl King, senior US economist at Merrill Lynch, said the data suggested there was a “genuine risk that the US economy could fall into a corrosive deflationary phase”.That prospect helped push the benchmark S&P 500 index down 6.1 per cent at 806.58, less than 4 per cent away from an 11-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 5.1 per cent at 7997.28 while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.5 per cent to 1,386.42.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 10.1 per cent to 74.45, which indicated mounting signs of distress.General Motors and Ford shed 9.7 per cent to $2.79, and 25 per cent to $1.26, after Republican senators argued that the Detroit-based companies should consider bankruptcy protection.Concerns over the fate of the pair, along with privately held Chrysler, have dogged the market for weeks and the bankruptcy of either would be the biggest business failure in US history.Investors, nervous at such a prospect, kept a close eye on developments on Capitol Hill as executives faced another grilling over their case for a $25bn aid package.Financials led the market declines, down 11.5 per cent overall to a 13-year low. Insurers suffered more losses in part over fears that they may face delays in securing funding under the government’s troubled assets relief programme.Metlife dropped 8.3 per cent to $19 even after Credit Suisse said the brutal sell-off – due in part to concerns over its high asset leverage – was “way overdone”.Elsewhere, Yahoo dropped below $10 for the first time in more than five years, down 20.9 per cent to $9.14, after Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, scotched speculation that the software group could make a bid.In healthcare, St Jude Medical shed 9 per cent to $27.80 after Jefferies initiated coverage on the medical device group with a “hold” rating and said it faced “numerous risks” in delivering “ambitious expectations”.Homebuilders came under pressure from Commerce Department data showing construction starts on new homes and applications for building permits fell in October to record lows.Target shed another 10.3 per cent to $26.96 as investors questioned whether plans by William Ackman, the activist hedge fund manager, to spin off its land into a listed real estate investment trust would be successful or be accepted by management.Best Buy, the electronics retailer which last week sent a chill through the market when warning of a “seismic” slowdown in consumer spending, dropped 11.4 per cent to $18.58 after Standard & Poor’s cut its debt rating on the company to the lowest investment grade.In materials, down 7.4 per cent overall, Alcoa lost 13.9 per cent to $8.16 after JPMorgan cut its earnings estimate for next year and turned bearish on the sector.“Our strategists see commodity markets remaining lacklustre in 2009. The significant pull-back in prices has led to reduced capacity expansions and mothballing of some existing operations.”Oil refiners came under particular pressure in the energy sector – down 5.2 per cent overall as crude prices slid below $54 a barrel – after Deutsche Bank issued a downbeat outlook.“The most underappreciated issue is the combination of poor demand with major new refining capacity additions and the extent to which that will undermine light sweet crude prices,” the bank’s analysts said. Sunoco shed 12.7 per cent to $33.20 after Deutsche cut its recommendation on the refiner from “hold” to “sell” due in part to its exposure to the Atlantic basin markets “that are already showing signs of stress”.The market had briefly entered positive territory yet declined steadily throughout the afternoon and sold off heavily into the close.
233;MET;Metlife Inc;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Assurers hope for future US Tarp funding;;Some insurance companies could be eligible for capital injections in future stages of the US government’s recapitalisation programme, after establishment of a federal regulation test as the prime criterion by US officials.But the Bush administration is trying to hold the line against pressure to expand the programme further to include auto finance companies, other non-bank financial firms and insurance companies that are not subject to federal supervision.The logic is that federal regulation allows the government to understand the capital needs of each business, and ensures that entities receiving public funds are properly supervised and do not misuse that money.“One thing that’s very important to us in our banking programme is we rely heavily on the federal regulators to give us an indication of how strong the institutions are and how much capital they need,” David Nason, assistant secretary for domestic finance, told CNBC on Monday.Automakers, and their auto finance subsidiaries, are not being considered for capital injections under the recapitalisation arm of the $700bn Troubled Asset Relief Programme, since they are not federally regulated. The Bush administration is looking at other ways to make support available to them.But drawing the line at federal regulation does not necessarily mean only banks and similar entities – such as thrifts and credit unions – will qualify for capital injections in future.When Congress passed the economic bail-out programme last month, the legislation referred to financial institutions generally, rather than banks. Industry representatives say some members of Congress assured representatives of the life assurance industry that the package would include them.But when Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, injected about $125bn (€100bn, £80bn) into nine banks this month, assurers were left out.Since then the Treasury has continued to examine eligibility. Frank Keating, chief executive of the American Council of Life Insurers, issued a statement last week praising the Treasury Department for “considering the inclusion of the life in­surance industry in its capital purchase programme”.A handful of assurance companies, including Met­life, are chartered as bank holding companies and are subject to some federal supervision, making them potentially eligible for equity infusions.A larger number of insurers own federally regulated thrifts. These groups could apply for government capital at the level of the thrift.If big operators such as MetLife did receive a capital infusion, says a person in the industry, they would be able to bid for some of AIG’s assets, which are for sale, increase lending activities, or acquire weaker operators in the market, a step seen as crucial to maintaining the health of the industry.A spokesman for MetLife said the assurer had no comment on the topic of accessing federal funds.Policymakers say they were expecting the “boundary problem” – where to draw the line – to be one of the most contentious issues surrounding the capital injection programme.US officials are sympathetic to claims by non-bank financial firms that capital injections and other bank rescue efforts threaten the health of the non-bank financial sector, which competes with banks for business.But they do not want to expand the capital injection programme in ways that make it unmanageable and reduce the effectiveness of taxpayer financial support.
234;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher. Bucking that trend, Yahoo edged down 0.3 per cent to $12.86 after reports emerged that the internet search group may cut more jobs than already disclosed.Cisco added 5.9 per cent to $18.96 after Morgan Keegan raised its recommendation to “outperform”.Texas Instruments and SanDisk added 1.9 per cent to $17.98 and lost 7 per cent to $14.42 ahead of results due later in the day.Elsewhere, Eaton added 1.8 per cent to $45.22 after the manufacturer warned of a “significant slowdown” in demand.Among utilities NRG Energy rose 29.3 per cent to $25 after Exelon, the nuclear power operator, made an unsolicited $6.2bn offer to acquire the group. Exelon added 0.2 per cent to $54.59.
235;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-17T20:44:04Z;Wall Street ends in red in volatile session;;A wild week for Wall Street stocks that saw their biggest gain since the Depression and worst sell-off since 1987 drew to a close with another highly volatile session that ended in the red.Relatively upbeat earnings and a further easing of strain in money markets failed in the end to outweigh a fresh batch of gloomy economic data and renewed concerns over the health of some financial institutions.The market swung between gains of as much as 4 per cent and losses that hit 2.9 per cent as last month’s options and futures expired.Big name financials including Metlife and State Street endured heavy losses towards Friday’s close and finished down 9.2 per cent at $31.14 and 9.6 per cent at $40.76 respectively.Housebuilders, home furnishers and real estate services were among the key losers on Friday from grim construction and building permit data. DR Horton, CB Richard Ellis and Leggett & Platt were among the biggest drags on the market, down 8.3 per cent at $6.77, 4.8 per cent at $6.32 and 12.3 per cent at $16.29, respectively.The S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent at 940.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,711.29 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent at 8,852.22 points.Yet the benchmark S&P still finished the week up 4.6 per cent – its biggest gain since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – with the Nasdaq up 3.7 per cent and the Dow 4.7 per cent higher.In each session, an overwhelming number of trades took place in the final few minutes of trading, which traders put down in part to a wave of fund redemptions.Defensive names were among the favourites as investors dipped their toes back into the market after stocks’ worst weekly sell-off since the Depression. Wal-Mart gained 5.5 per cent over the week to $53.77. Healthcare topped the sectoral leaderboard, up 8.8 per cent. St Jude Medical, which gained 13.9 per cent to $37.03, helped sentiment with well received results.Financials climbed 5.8 per cent over the week, lifted by the fresh $250bn plan to shore up US banks. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup – among the biggest institutions in which the government is set to buy equity stakes – advanced 11.4 per cent to $23.24, 28.7 per cent to $114.30 and 5.5 per cent to $14.88 respectively.Amid plenty of third-quarter earnings, PepsiCo was one of the relatively small number of companies to undershoot analyst forecasts. The shares fell 6.8 per cent over the week to $53.88.Figures from Coca-Cola, up 6.5 per cent to $44.20 over the week, were better received. So too were those from Intel and Peabody Energy, which gained 2 per cent to $15.50 and 11.8 per cent to $32.03 over the week.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history. However, it finished the week down 1.2 per cent at 69.45.Technology stocks were down after three companies in the sector reported better than expected results after the bell on Thursday.Google rose 5.5 per cent to $372.54 after the internet search group’s profits surpassed Wall Street forecasts. Eric Schmidt, chief executive, warned of “uncharted territory” due to the financial crisis. Advanced Micro Devices and IBM added 2.2 per cent to $4.21 and lost 0.8 per cent at $90.78 after both surprised Wall Street with third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations.Aerospace and defence stocks fell after Honeywell trimmed its guidance for the rest of the year. The diversified manufacturer, off 5 per cent to $29.37, did so even after it became the latest company to overshoot quarterly earnings forecasts.Caterpillar fell 7.2 per cent to $39.32 after Credit Suisse cut its price target from $66 to $46 while Potash eased 0.4 per cent to $74.43 after Citigroup cut its price target.
236;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-10T20:46:59Z;US stocks fall in volatile trading session;;"US stocks ended their second worst week ever with more heavy selling that took the market’s drop since its peak to a level that rivalled the crash of 1929.Few stocks were spared in the sharp weekly decline, as retail investors joined hedge funds and sought to cut their losses amid panic selling.Consumer staples and healthcare – normally defensive havens – lost 15.9 per cent and 18.4 per cent, respectively, over the week. On Friday, Kraft and Procter & Gamble lost as much as 7.7 per cent and 9.8 per cent.Yet after violent swings, the market avoided the capitulation some observers said would encourage a subsequent bounce.Shortly after the open the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed another milestone, diving 8.1 per cent, and falling beneath 8,000 points.Stocks swung between eye-popping losses and, on occasion, positive territory as some investors dipped their toes into financial and technology stocks that had fallen to their lowest level in decades.Having traded within a range of more than 1,000 points, the Dow – which in the previous session suffered its biggest percentage decline since 1987 – closed down 1.5 per cent to 8,451.19 points. The S&P 500 finished 1.2 per cent lower at 899.25, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,649.51.That took the S&P’s losses over the week to 18.2 per cent, the Dow’s also to 18.2 per cent and the Nasdaq’s to 15.3 per cent. The S&P 500 has lost 42.6 per cent since its peak a year ago. In 1929, the market fell by 44.6 per cent from its highest level.Traders said that shorting was not in the most part responsible for the heavy losses, in spite of the SEC’s lifting of the ban on Wednesday evening. Rather, a wave of mutual fund redemptions had driven stocks lower over the week.Lori Calvasina, analyst at Citi, said retail investors had “joined the fray following the release of quarterly 401k statements”.On Friday there was not the wave of sharp selling in the last hour of trading, a sign of redemptions, that there had been in other sessions.Financials and energy, each down 22 per cent, led the weekly rout as fears worsened over the health of the banking system and the subsequent damage the turmoil would do the global economy.On Friday, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs sank 22.3 per cent at $9.68 and 12.4 per cent at $88.80, respectively, after Moody’s warned it might cut the long-term debt ratings on the erstwhile investment banks. That took their losses for the week to 59.5 per cent and 30.6 per cent respectively.Insurers were hard hit. Metlife, XL Capital and Hartford Financial fell 28.2 per cent to $30.25, 63.8 per cent to $5.43 and 29.8 per cent to $19.23 over the week. On Friday, credit default swaps on the companies had indicated increased worries of potential default.Wachovia was one of the few gainers on Friday, up 43.1 per cent to $5.15. Citigroup withdrew from talks with Wells Fargo to buy parts of the embattled bank.Citigroup and Wells Fargo edged up 9.1 per cent to $14.11 and 3.9 per cent to $28.31, respectively. The energy sector led the market declines, down 8.1 per cent on mounting fears of global recession. “It’s no longer a global credit crisis,” said Richard Bernstein, strategist at Merrill Lynch. “It’s a global economic crisis.”Chevron and Exxon Mobil shed 9.6 per cent to $57.83; and 8.3 per cent to $62.83 as oil slid below $80 a barrel.In industrials, General Electric bounced 13.1 per cent to $21.50 after reporting third-quarter results in line with previously lowered guidance. Ford followed GM lower and lost 4.3 per cent for the week, to $1.99.Macy’s was the latest retailer to issue grim updates, highlighting the damage the credit crisis had already done to the so-called real economy. It fell 13.4 per cent to $9.92."
237;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-10T18:24:18Z;Concerns over taking the ‘third way’ to retirement;;Holders of pensions that guarantee income or capital, known as “third way” annuities, may now be wondering if their guarantees are worth the paper they are written on.There are two reasons for concern. First, providers of third way annuities in the UK have tended so far to be US life insurers: The Hartford, Lincoln, MetLife and Living Time, which is backed by Alico, a subsidiary of AIG.This raises questions about the safety of assets, given the share price falls of US insurers and the government bailout of AIG.Second, the companies try to meet the guarantees on third way products by buying options and futures, exposing themselves to counterparty risk, which has hit the value and guarantees of structured products in past weeks.On the first point, investors should take reassurance from the fact that even if the US parent company were to fail, all the products are authorised by the UK’s Financial Services Authority. This means that they fall under the compensation scheme for insurance products, which pays the first £2,000 in full and 90 per cent of the remainder of the claim.The second point is more worrying.Insurance companies match their guarantees by buying options or futures, usually on a daily basis, to ensure that their liabilities match their assets.There are two ways they can do this. The company can do it itself by trading instruments in the market, which removes its exposure to counterparty risk but can, says Harish Gohil, senior director in the insurance team at Fitch Ratings, expose it to movements in the markets if it can’t hedge quickly enough.Another route to limit risk is to hedge through exchange traded instruments. “Through an exchange, they remove counterparty risk as their counterparty is the exchange not the investment bank,” notes Gohil.The more common route is to buy off the counter instruments from investment banks, which does expose the insurers to counterparty risk. This exposure is disturbing, and may seem to put the guarantee at risk.But third way annuities differ from structured products in one important way. The guarantee is made on a contractual basis between the insurer and the customer. Thus the insurance company is only exposing itself, and not its customers, to counterparty risk – it would still be obliged to pay them if its hedging techniques were to fail.It would do this out of its own capital reserves which, for many insurance companies, remain substantial.“As long as the insurance company is well capitalised and well run, even if they have a problem and don’t get paid they still have an obligation to the customer as they have their own capital requirements,” says Gohil.Whether an institution is well capitalised may not seem to have much bearing on its safety in the current climate – HBOS and Icelandic bank Kaupthing both insisted they were well capitalised shortly before failing as independent institutions.But insurance companies are not as troubled by short- term liquidity requirements – instead, their liabilities are long term.That said, Gohil says Fitch is looking closely at how to rate insurance companies and whether being well capitalised now counts for as much as it used to.The concern over guarantees is more of an issue if the insurance company providing the product goes bust. In this scenario, the compensation scheme does not cover any guarantees made on products – only the underlying value of the pension fund.So with the high fees paid for guarantees, are they worth it in the current climate? Third way annuities have come under much criticism for charging high fees for their guarantees – in the region of 2 to 3 per cent a year.John Richardson, head of technical planning at Towry Law, says: “The guarantees offered by these types of contracts are only as good as the financial strength of that provider. But financial strength ratings currently offer little security as these institutions face the same counterparty risk as everyone else.”However, Billy Burrows, annuity specialist at WBA, says this should not mean there is not a role for third way products. “At times like this, people will come to realise the benefit of having a guarantee – it’s fairly horrific out there,” he notes.He echoes the advice now being given to banking customers and recommends not putting all of your pension with any one provider.
238;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-10T18:18:57Z;Find your way;;Variable annuities – also called “third way” annuities – offer guarantees on either capital or income or both, while also paying out a regular annuity.The first variable annuities to launch in the UK were from, or backed by, US firms: The Hartford, MetLife, Living Time and Lincoln. But the main UK insurers. including Prudential and Standard Life, are looking at launching their own versions.Most of the products guarantee that a fixed income will be paid as an annuity, regardless of the underlying investment performance, and with the opportunity for some further capital growth.The Living Time product works slightly differently, guaranteeing a return of capital in five years plus fixed-income payouts each year. The risk is that annuity rates would be lower in five years when a client comes to renew the policy.Third way annuities have been criticised for being difficult to understand, but some are more transparent than others, says Harish Gohil at Fitch Ratings. Aegon, for example, recently launched its 5 for Life product in the UK, which promises to pay 5 per cent in income of the initial investment for life regardless of what happens to the value of the initial investment.Gohil says the UK market for third way annuities is still “nascent”. “There’s been a lot of talk in the industry about whether this is the next big thing, especially with the collapse of the with-profits market. The challenge is to educate people about the product. I think it will be a slow burn.”
239;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-09T20:45:02Z;Wall Street stocks sink in late trade;;Wall Street stocks extended their eye-popping run of heavy losses to a seventh session as another another drastic afternoon sell-off pushed some stocks to their lowest level in decades.Traders said a wave of mutual fund redemptions had driven the market to fresh five-year lows as retailer investors took scant comfort from unprecedented intervention in financial markets from the authorities around the globe and sought to cut their losses.General Motors sank to its lowest point since 1950, down 31.1 per cent to $4.76, after the Standard & Poor’s placed the company on credit watch. Ford, whose rating S&P may also cut, dived 21.8 per cent to $2.08. The duo have already reported declining sales and JD Power and Associates warned on Thursday world-wide automotive demand could “collapse”.The market had earlier swung from losses to gains but major indicies dived beneath yet more psychologically significant barriers in heavy selling towards the close.The S&P 500 closed down 7.6 per cent at 990.92. Its longest losing streak in 12 years has taken the index’s decline since the collapse of Lehman Brothers to more than a quarter.“It’s just relentless, day in day out, regardless of the news,” said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rydex.The Dow Jones Industrial Averages sank 7.3 per cent – its biggest percentage decline since 1987 – at 8,579.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 5.5 per cent lower at 1,645.12.Traders said that shorting was not in large part responsible for the heavy losses, in spite of the SEC’s lifting of the ban before the session began.Energy and financials led the declines, each down by more than 11 per cent.Insurance company XL sank 53.8 per cent to $4.01 while Allstate fell 8.2 per cent to $27.50 after losses of more than a fifth in the previous session.Hartford Financial lost 19.1 per cent at $20.11 after UBS slashed its price target from $70 to $26 and on speculation that talks between it and Metlife had fallen through. Metlife, which priced new shares at a discount during the previous session, found positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $28 after heavy losses on Wednesday.Investors were also examining reports that the US government could take stakes in banks. Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, on Wednesday stressed that rescue legislation allowed the authorities to recapitalise financial institutions.Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley fell 25.9 per cent to $13.32 and 25.9 per cent to $12.45 respectively. Bank of America stood 11.2 per cent lower at $19.63 while JPMorgan rose 2.1 per cent to $40.14.Federal litigation on the dispute between Citigroup and Wells Fargo over the fate of Wachovia was extended by two days. Citigroup lost 10.2 per cent to $12.93 while Wells Fargo sank 14.6 per cent to $27.25. Wachovia dropped 28.9 per cent to $3.60.National City had earlier bucked the downward trend but closed down 3.6 per cent to $2.15 on reports it might sell itself. Energy producers were sold off sharply as oil fell below $85 a barrel on heightened fears of global recession. ExxonMobil lost 11.7 to $68Materials earlier found positive territory but later closed down 6.9 per cent. Steel stocks were hit after Goldman Sachs cut its steel price forecast by 29 per cent, due in part to the slowdown in emerging markets and cut its recommendation on a slew of stocks.Technology had clung onto gains for much of the session, rising as much as 3.3 per cent, but later also succumbed and was down 3.4 per cent by the close.Earlier, relatively positive results from technology bellwether IBM provided a glimmer of hope that corporate earnings may not be as dire as the worst five-day sell-off for stocks since 1987 had implied.IBM, which also reaffirmed its profit forecast, fell 1.7 per cent to $89 after earlier gains.Quest Software jumped 5.1 percent to $11.12 after the group unveiled plans plans for a $400m share buy-back.Elsewhere, Abercrombie & Fitch continued a string of poor performances in the retail sector with a sharp drop in like-for-like sales last month. The shares tumbled 14.8 per cent to $27.69.
240;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-09T19:45:42Z;MetLife sells stock at a discount to raise $2bn;;It emerged on Thursday that MetLife, the largest US life assurer, had to sell stock at a discount on Wednesday in an effort to reassure the markets over its capital base, helping to drive down the shares of its competitors on fears they would have to follow suit.MetLife, which has seen its market capitalisation almost halve so far this month, sold the 75m shares at $26.50 a share on Wednesday, 28 per cent less than its closing price on Tuesday, raising nearly $2bn.Insurers’ stocks have been severely hit in recent weeks and the cost of insuring their debt has risen to record levels on concerns that their exposure to credit markets and the extent of their leverage could rapidly eat into their capital bases.Last month, AIG, which was once the world’s biggest insurer, was bailed out after huge loses in its financial products unit forced it close to collapse.MetLife’s sale of stock helped to drive down other insurers as investors bet that they would also need to dilute shareholders.Prudential Financial fell as much as 38 per cent in morning trading, while Principal Financial Group fell by as much as 14.5 per cent.“Investors [hedge funds] think they are the next to raise capital …and now, for the first time in a month, the shorts can actually short financials again, so Pru is the focus,” said Alan Devlin, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.Hartford Financial sold $2.5bn in stock and debt to Allianz SE earlier this week. UBS on Thursday cut its price guidance on the company to $26 a share from $70 a share.Analysts expect insurers to return for repeated capital raisings in order to maintain their credit ratings – which are critical to attracting new business.Some also expect smaller insurers that have difficulty raising capital to be acquired by larger competitors.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see MetLife or ManuLife, now it has raised capital, to consume a smaller competitor who can’t raise capital – a Lincoln or Principal for example,” said Mr Devlin.
241;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-08T20:53:25Z;US stocks slide despite rate cuts;;Wall Street stocks on Wednesday extended their worst five-day run of losses since 1987 after the co-ordinated global interest rate cut failed to calm nerves during a highly volatile session.Initial euphoria over the move dissolved and the market subsequently swung between gains and losses throughout the day. Further developments underlined concerns that the financial crisis was already hurting US companies by damping global demand and denting their ability to raise funds.Insurance stocks were particularly hard hit after Metlife became the latest big American company to announce plans to raise capital in the midst of the credit freeze. Metlife shed 26.8 per cent at $27, while peers Allstate and XL Capital sank 21.2 per cent at $29.96 and 27.7 per cent at $8.68 respectively.Similarly, Bank of America shed another 7.7 per cent to $21.95 after the group priced 455m shares at $22 each.Meanwhile, Alcoa kicked off the earnings season in downbeat fashion by announcing, after the close of the previous session, a lower-than-expected profit that sent the shares down 12.7 per cent on Wednesday to $14.59. The aluminium group has suspended its share buy-back programme.In volatile trading, the S&P 500 was by up as much as 2.5 per cent and down by the same margin.Stock futures jumped immediately after global central banks announced the cuts. “At last, a co-ordinated show of force,” said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. “The move is to be applauded but there is more to come . ”Yet the S&P closed 1.1 per cent lower at 984.86, further below the psychologically significant level of 1,000 that was breached in the previous session for the first time in five years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent at 9,256.11, having slid by 3.7 per cent in the last half hour of trading. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,740.33.The decline came even after a slew of stocks hit new lows for the year. The overall material sector overcame Alcoa’s difficulties, up 2.6 per cent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and US Steel gained 10.1 per cent at $42.60 and 4.1 per cent at $53.37, respectively.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped another 7.3 per cent to 57.58, the highest level since the credit crisis began.The SEC confirmed that its short ban imposed last month would be lifted last night, as planned. The index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the list fell 2.4 per cent, taking the loss since the ban was introduced to more than a quarter.Some in the market have blamed the ban for exacerbating volatility. “A lot of these liquidity providers [such as hedge funds] have just walked away from these stocks,” said Peter Bottini of optionsXpress.Legg Mason fell 13 per cent on Wednesday to $25.25, after Moody’s cut the debt rating on the money manager. American Express was among the biggest winners earlier in the session after Sanford C. Bernstein initiated coverage on the stock with a “market perform’’ rating and said the credit card group stands to increase market share. It later reversed the gains to stand 4 per cent lower at $27.12.Morgan Stanley – which sank as much as 39.9 per cent in the previous session on speculation that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s planned $9bn investment might not materialise – rose 4.8 per cent to $16.80. Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi reiterated that the deal would go ahead.Bank of New York Mellon climbed 7.9 per cent to $24.45 after agreeing to buy JPMorgan Trust Bank in Japan.Elsewhere, a host of retailers disclosed poor September sales. Escaping the declines, defensive stock Wal-Mart eased 0.5 per cent to $54.55 after the discount retailer was one of the few to report a positive like-for-like performance.Office Depot was one of biggest drags on the S&P, sinking 18.8 per cent to $3.67 after Credit Suisse cut its “neutral” recommendation to “underperform”.In automotives, Ford and General Motors shed 8.9 per cent at $2.66 and 8.6 per cent at $6.91 respectively – even as oil slid – after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the duo from “hold” to “sell”.
242;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-10-08T13:06:23Z;MetLife profits fall prompts stock sale;;MetLife said it would would raise capital and cut jobs after its earnings fell by up to 48 per cent in the third quarter amid losses from exposure to Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and AIG.The the biggest US life insurer said that it would sell 75m shares in an effort to raise capital to assure investors, and position itself to take advantage of future opportunities. At Tuesday’s closing share prices that would raise $2.8bn. Last week, an analyst at Atlantic Equities predicted MetLife might raise capital to bid for AIG’s assets.The company said it would also cut jobs in an SEC filing.Shares in Metlife dropped 5.1 per cent to $35 in pre-market trading, after falling 16.8 per cent on Tuesday.“MetLife is a well capitalized company with a strong balance sheet and financial strength ratings that are among the highest in the industry…[with the capital raising] we are taking an additional, proactive step to further assure all of our stakeholders that MetLife is financially sound and well positioned to meet our future obligations,” said Robert Henrikson, chairman and chief executive.“At the same time, it will enable us to take advantage of potential opportunities in the market and to continue building shareholder value.”Hartford Financial, the Connecticut- based life and property-casualty insurer, said earlier this week it had raised $2.5bn in capital and would cut its dividend after warning of a big loss.The share prices of many life insurers have been falling sharply on fears over the risks they face from exposure to the troubled debt and stock markets, and would need to raise capital.Metlife said operating earnings were expected to be between $600 and $675m, or 83 cents and 93 cents per share.That compares with operating earnings of $1.16bn or $1.52 per share in the third quarter last year.Income from continuing operations is expected to be between $1.01bn and $1.15bn, or $1.38 to $1.58 per share.MetLife reported falling earnings in its prior two quarters. It said that given the volatile markets, it was withdrawing its earnings guidance for full-year 2008.Revenues of $8.6bn were up 16 per cent compared with the third quarter of 2007.MetLife said it expects realized investment gains, net of income tax, to be between $400 and $475m. That includes $490m in credit related losses, $375m of which stemmed from exposure to Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and AIG. Offsetting those losses was a gain from derivatives of $735m due to the rise in the dollar, and an increase in credit default swap spreads.Metlife said that it expected a decline in investment income, driven by negative hedge fund and private equity returns. Meanwhile the almost 9 per cent decline in the S&P 500 in the quarter is expected to drive results on MetLife’s variable annuity business, a popular long term investment that offers periodic payments to investors.The company sought to calm investors by saying that it had $4bn in excess capital. It said it had $21bn in access to liquidity, up from $14bn in June. Its liquid assets totalled $1.75bn, and none of its long term debt is due until 2011.
243;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-06-19T19:42:57Z;Justices rule on benefit plan claims;;Administrators of employee benefit plans have a potential conflict of interest if they are responsible for deciding both the eligibility for benefits and whether to payout on claims, the US Supreme Court ruled on Thursday.The justices decided that courts reviewing cases where a claimant was denied disability benefits are entitled to take into account the potential conflict engendered by this kind of dual rule.The decision – one of four workers’ rights opinions handed down yesterday – strengthened the position of the more than 28m Americans covered by long-term disability plans.In 2006 insurers paid over $7.2bn (£3.6bn) in disability claims to more than 500,000 people, according to a brief filed with the court by the US Chamber of Commerce, which opposed the decision.One case concerned Wanda Glenn, a Sears employee from Ohio, who was diagnosed with a heart disorder and in 2000 began receiving disability benefits. After two years Metropolitan Life Insurance, who administered her plan, decided that she was not entitled to long-term benefits because it believed her capable of doing sedentary work.The justices’ 7-2 decision affirmed a lower court ruling that MetLife was conflicted.Justice Stephen Breyer said that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 demanded higher standards of insurers, requiring them to process claims “solely in the interests of the [plan’s] participants and beneficiaries”.However, he said the significance of any conflict of interest would vary from case to case and warned the court should not adopt “a rule that could bring about near universal de novo review of most ERISA plan claims denials”.MetLife argued that existing federal benefits law expressly permitted a company responsible for evaluating benefit claims to also fund benefit payments. Upholding the lower court’s decision would encourage dubious claims, MetLife said, and the resulting higher litigation costs would drive up premiums.In a separate 7-1 ruling, the court also found in a favour of employees who complain they are victims of age discrimination at work. The justices said the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 made it incumbent on employers, not employees, to prove that employment decisions were governed by factors other than age.The case concerned Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, a nuclear warship contractor, which laid off 31 employees in 1996 of whom 30 were at least 40 years old.Justice David Souter acknowledged the ruling would make it “harder and costlier” for companies to defend age discrimination lawsuits but said the justices were forced to read the law in the way that Congress had written it.In two other employment rulings the court struck down a California law that prevented companies in receipt of state grants from trying to deter the organisation of a union.The court also concluded that the consideration of age as a factor in the administration of a state retirement plan did not contravene federal age-discrimination law.
244;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-06-06T17:38:47Z;‘Third way’ annuities give more guarantees;;The first “third-way” annuity to protect both capital and income launches this week – and, unlike most other annuity products, it’s being targeted at the younger retirement market.MetLife’s New Retirement Portfolio offers the option of paying a fee to guarantee your capital, or income payouts, after investing – or both.Pension products like this are known as variable, or ‘third-way’, annuities as they offer an alternative to the traditional level or escalating payouts. They are marketed widely in the US and Japan, where The Hartford is the main provider, but have only been offered in the UK in the past two years. However, with a number of big UK names expected to launch this year, including Standard Life and Prudential, the market is expected to grow.The fees for the guarantees on the MetLife product will vary according to the risk profile of the fund selected for the pension. Lower-risk funds such as trackers will have guarantee fees of around 0.6 per cent a year, while higher-risk funds will have fees closer to 2 per cent.The guarantees are more likely to make sense on the lower-risk funds, said Ed Gardner, chief executive officer of UK retirement and savings at MetLife. Those investing smaller parts of their portfolio in higher-risk funds might want to waive the guarantees in pursuit of higher performance.Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown said the product looked like a “positive step forward” compared with the first wave of products, some of which have costs approaching 4 per cent a year.He pointed out that the passive portfolio option offered by the MetLife product had costs around 1 per cent lower than the actively-managed options, making them, at 2-2.5 per cent a year, “much more likely to be acceptable to investors”.Offering a guarantee on capital is viewed as an attempt to appeal to younger pension savers, who are more likely to be concerned with protecting the value of their funds than protecting a pension income they have not yet started to draw.The MetLife product is available from age 23 – although, with a £50,000 minimum investment required, it is likely to be of more interest to those looking to consolidate an existing pension.Michael Rudge, managing director at The Hartford, which currently guarantees income only on its three third-way annuities, said: “A guarantee on capital is more attractive when you’re accumulating money. We’re more focused on the retirement space.”He said that when the time was right, The Hartford might also look at offering capital guarantees. Unlike MetLife, its fees are charged at a fixed rate and do not depend on the funds selected.

I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
246;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-05-30T18:08:41Z;Third-way products come up slightly pricey;;A new annuity option on the market is the variable, or “third-way”, annuity.This type of annuity will usually be invested in equities to produce a potentially higher income and guarantee that original capital will not be eroded.Some variable annuities are treated as income drawdown products so, on death, remaining funds can be passed down to heirs. Others offer a guarantee that, at the end of a fixed term, the capital will be sufficient to buy a new annuity that will generate the same income.Variable annuities have only existed in the UK for the past two years and only a handful of firms offer them: The Hartford, MetLife, Living Time, Lincoln and Aegon. But many other life insurance companies are planning to join in, meaning that the size of the market is set to soar.However, their costs are controversial. Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown warns that charges can be as high as 4 per cent per year, a “hefty whack” on a product only returning 7 or 8 per cent. Part of the charge comes from the cost of the guarantee: this may apply to capital and income or income only, and may be capped at a certain level, so it is advisable to compare plans before buying.
247;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-05-14T03:43:30Z;Variable annuities carry assurers’ hopes;;British life assurers, under attack from nimbler rivals, are fighting back. Their weapon: a more flexible retirement savings product that has already taken the US and Japan by storm.Life assurers hope that selling these products, known as variable annuities, will take off in the UK too and stem the tide of customers saving for retirement through rival operators, from banks to fund managers.“This is the natural space of insurance companies,” says Mark Laidlaw, finance director of Aegon UK. “It is a reminder of what insurers can do.”After taking off in the US about five years ago, VAs now have about $1,500bn (£769bn) in net assets.Over the past couple of years, US insurers MetLife, Hartford and Lincoln National have begun selling VAs in the UK, while the UK arm of Aegon, the Netherlands-based insurer, introduced a non-pension VA in 2006. But the product has had a low profile until now.With some of Britain’s biggest names, including Aegon, Standard Life and Prudential, preparing to launch VAs, the product is set to hit the mainstream.The UK versions of VAs provide customers with exposure to riskier but higher returning assets, such as equities, but with explicitly priced guarantees, either to protect their capital or provide a minimum level of income.VAs are expected to appeal to those in or approaching retirement. Facing perhaps 20-30 years as pensioners, they need their pension pots to continue to expand, but are also worried about outliving their savings or having them eroded by market movements.But the guaranteed income provided by a VA comes at a cost.Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, the independent financial adviser and broker, says the cost of the guarantees, fund management, administration and the services of an IFA, can be up to 4 per cent.“If you are getting investment growth of 7 per cent, that is a pretty big chunk being taken out,” he says.All the same, some analysts are excited about the scope for VAs. Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Oriel Securities, recently likened the development of the market to the introduction of unit-linked policies in the 1960s, which he described as “the greatest transformation of UK life assurance over recent decades”.He said in a note: “We believe we are about to see a major development in the UK that may not be of the same scale as unit linking, but is likely to introduce a fresh approach in the savings market.”If insurers can provide the guarantees for less than they charge the customer for them, and also hold on to clients’ money for longer, then the products could prove lucrative.Most important of all, the development of VAs gives insurers a chance to reassert their role in the long-term savings market.Life offices tout their ability to provide guarantees, which require complex financial management as well as their core actuarial skills to determine how long people will live.“This is what insurance companies should do, and do well, which is take risk on behalf of the individual,” says Gary Shaughnessy, managing director, retail life and pensions, at Prudential UK. “[We] have been doing this for the last 150 years.”According to Ned Cazalet, the independent life assurance analyst: “Definitely [life assurers] are saying, ‘if we do anything at all we should be there to take the sharp edges off of life for people’.“But it is also the sheer numbers of people entering the retirement zone. This is a big new market.”According to Watson Wyatt, the consultants, the market for converting invested assets, such as pension savings, into income, was worth almost £14bn ($27.2bn) in 2007. This market is expected to more than double to above £30bn a year within five years.Mark Joannes, a senior consultant at Watson Wyatt, estimates that VAs could account for 10-15 per cent of the market, or close to £5bn, within this period.The big challenge will be to sell the products effectively. VAs, with their array of guarantee options and associated charges, could prove baffling to customers and life assurers have been maligned in the past for marketing opaque and expensive products.New entrants to the market will have to overturn the current insipid level of VA sales, says John Lawson, head of pensions policy at Standard Life. “They are not exactly flying off the shelves yet.”
248;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-04-08T20:42:02Z;Wall St falls as results season starts;;US stocks ended a three session winning streak on Tuesday, falling after Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season with a downbeat set of results and Washington Mutual said it had secured a $7bn capital infusion to shore up its capital base.The largest savings and loan company in the US sold shares, at a sizeable discount, to a group of investors including TPG, the private equity firm, and said it would use the proceeds to keep its capital ratios well above required levels.The company also said it expected to report far bigger first-quarter losses than had been expected, would dramatically increase its provisions for bad loans and slash its dividend and 3,000 jobs for good measure.Washington Mutual shares, which jumped almost 30 per cent on Monday on speculation about the deal, fell back sharply on the news. The shares dropped 10.2 per cent to $11.81.That, and a striking report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that financial losses from the US mortgage crisis could hit about $1,000bn, dragged financials lower.The S&P 500 Financials index fell 1.7 per cent, led by Citigroup, which fell 3.4 per cent to $23.76, and Federated Investors, which slid 6.9 per cent to $34.80, hit by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs analysts.The IMF report undercut nascent optimism about the downtrodden sector. Earlier in the day, analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded brokers and asset managers from “neutral” to “attractive”, arguing that mortgage writedowns might “significantly exceed” actual losses.Goldman reiterated its recommendation to “buy” Lehman Brothers shares and upgraded Franklin Resources, Bank of New York Mellon, MetLife, American Express, and Janus Capital.Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $43.67 while Bank of New York dropped 0.9 per cent to $42.98 and American Express slipped 0.2 per cent to $46.47.Still, investors found enough resilience to absorb the gloomy minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee which showed some officials were concerned about “a prolonged and severe economic downturn,” as they cut interest rates last month.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “The quite negative view of the economic outlook…seems likely, in our view, to trump inflation as a concern and bolsters our view of a 50 basis point rate cut at the end of the month.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,365.54 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,348.76.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3 per cent to 12,576.44.After the close on Monday, Alcoa reported declines in both sales and profits for the first quarter as the company was hit by slowing demand in its home market and rising energy and raw materials costs.The stock slipped a further 0.7 per cent to $37.18, adding to Monday’s 4 per cent decline.Industrial conglomerates also came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their profit estimates and target prices for the sector, arguing that orderswould fall as the economy weakened.Morgan Stanley analysts cut their 2009 profit forecasts for 16 companies, including General Electric, Emerson Electric and Honeywell, reduced their industry rating to “cautious” and encouraged investors to take profits ahead of potentially disappointing earnings towards the end of 2008.GE fell 0.8 per cent to $36.95 while Emerson dropped 2.4 per cent to $52.10 and Honeywell lost 1.6 per cent to $57.19.A sales warning overnight from AMD, the second largest microprocessor maker, also weighed on the market.The company said it would cut about 10 per cent of its workforce in response but AMD shares fell 4.9 per cent to $6.03.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel dropped 3.1 per cent to $21.08 while Novellus lost 8. per cent to $21.88.Homebuilders fell back after the latest data showed pending home sales fell more than expected in February.Lennar dropped 8.3 per cent to $20 and Pulte Homes lost 5.8 per cent to $14.94.Energy stocks helped cushion falls. Coal companies, Consol Energy and Peabody Energy climbed 4.9 per cent to $78.21 and 5.1 per cent to $59.92 respectively.
249;MET;Metlife Inc;2008-04-02T21:13:54Z;ING in Latin American pensions growth plan;;ING, the Dutch financial services company, is targeting Latin America’s booming pensions and life insurance markets, where it wants to become the number one operator in the next three to five years through acquisitions and organic growth.“I think you will probably see us being very active over the next 12 to 24 months,” Carlos Muriel, ING’s head for Latin America, told the Financial Times.ING is targeting pension companies, asset managers, life insurance and distribution networks in the region, but has ruled out attempting to buy a retail bank – as Spain’s Santander did in acquiring Brazil’s Banco Real as part of last year’s ABN Amro takeover – because the sector is already consolidated.“This is the first time I see most of the stars aligned,” Mr Muriel said, noting that most of the Latin American countries had young populations, rapidly developing middle classes and macroeconomic stability thanks to structural reforms.“What we foresee is a development similar to what the US had in the 1950s with the baby boomers,” he said.The move in Latin America fits in with ING’s global strategy of focusing on high-growth emerging markets and using its banking and insurance background to become a “wealth manager” that sells everything from savings accounts to mutual funds and pensions.It is now second by assets under management in pensions in Latin America, behind BBVA, and third in the life insurance sector, where MetLife is number one thanks to its purchase in 2002 of the state life assurer for civil servants in Mexico.ING’s Latin American operations contributed €237m ($371m) pre-tax profit to the group in 2007, about 12 per cent of ING’s Americas Insurance business.Mr Muriel said he wanted to double that contribution to 25 per cent over the next three to five years.On acquisitions, he said no funds had been earmarked as a Latin American war chest but ING’s excess capital of €9.5bn gave it flexibility at a time when other European and US banks might be seeking to divest assets.Mr Muriel also noted that ING could serve the US Hispanic community in ways other banks had not.
250;MET;Metlife Inc;2007-10-31T06:03:53Z;Debating point: A blend of debt and equity;;Hybrid is a term that has traditionally been used to refer to securities that have features of both debt and equity.Beginning in 1993, US companies began issuing a type of hybrid called “trust preferreds”. Similar to debt, these securities called for periodic interest payments that were deductible when calculating corporate income tax.But unlike conventional debt, the issuers of trust preferreds retained the option to defer interest payments when facing financial difficulty. This ability to defer interest, when combined with maturities of 30 years or more and a subordinated position in the capital structure, allowed the securities to gain partial “equity credit” from the rating agency Standard & Poor’s.More importantly, for bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve in 1996 began to allow such securities to qualify as Tier 1 capital when determining a bank’s capital ratios.Despite S&P’s and the Fed’s acknowledgement of the equity-like function of trust preferreds, Moody’s for many years viewed trust preferreds as an expensive form of debt. This view helped limit their issuance mainly to financial institutions.In February 2005, Moody’s changed its guidelines for assessing the equity credit of securities generally, specifically preferred stock. When the new guidelines were released, several issuers took advantage of the opportunity by issuing non-tax deductible preferred stock which received 50 to 75 per cent equity credit from Moody’s. However, the market remained limited until tax-deductible, 50 to 75 per cent equity credit structures from Moody’s were possible.Beginning with deals from Lehman Brothers, Stanley Works, and the Reinsurance Group of America in late 2005, a wave of structural innovation resulted in a $76bn market for hybrid securities in the US.Since 2005, large commercial banks such as Citigroup and JP Morgan have each issued more than $5bn of the new hybrids to meet their Tier 1 regulatory capital requirements. At the same time, holding companies of US insurance companies such as American International Group and MetLife have issued hybrids to reduce debt, buy back stock, and, in a handful of cases, fund acquisitions. Issuance by corporates remains light.The main challenge in structuring hybrids is satisfying the rating agencies that the securities are sufficiently equity-like to merit at least partial equity credit, while at the same time preserving sufficiently debt-like features to maintain tax-deductibility.The equity characteristics that Moody’s and S&P look for in hybrids are long maturities and permanence in the capital structure, flexibility in payment of coupons, and subordination in the capital structure. At the same time, tax looks for shorter maturities, certainty about regular interest payments, and a strong assurance of repayment of interest and principal.Qualities that make a security more equity-like often make it less debt-like for tax purposes.For this reason, the most likely candidates to issue hybrids are companies that are either seeking more capital, but have already exhausted their debt capacity (at least for conventional straight debt) in their targeted ratings range and are reluctant to issue new equity, or they wish to repurchase equity while maintaining their current rating.In such cases, the equity credit accorded hybrids by the rating agencies has the effect of expanding corporate debt capacity (and the interest tax shield that comes with it), while avoiding the possible dilution of value from issuing underpriced equity.For a significant majority of investment grade borrowers, even in today’s more volatile credit market, the after-tax cost of hybrid capital will be much less than an equivalent market of senior debt and common equity.Therefore, even companies that feel they already have an optimal mix of debt and common equity may issue hybrids so as to reduce their overall cost of capital.Accordingly, besides refinancing debt and buying back stock, the proceeds from hybrids have been used for a variety of purposes, including funding acquisitions. In short, tax-deductible hybrids are likely to prove effective capital planning instruments for many companies.During the spring of 2006, the US institutional market for hybrid capital shut down for two months, as US state insurance commissioners required insurance company holders of hybrids to hold additional capital against their hybrid portfolio.The commissioners’ position was resolved through a compromise and the market began its tightening trend in September 2006. Entering 2007, the hybrid market was strong, having significantly outperformed the broader credit market in late 2006Between June and September, as credit volatility increased, hybrid markets weakened and there were no institutional deals. However, the retail market was busy, as financial institutions sought to shore up capital, and retail became the viable alternative for capital raising during this dislocation in the institutional markets.Despite this, in late August, GE Capital entered the European market and priced the single largest high equity content tax-deductible hybrid ever executed by a US issuer. Then, on September 10th, Florida Power and Light reopened the US institutional market and triggered a re-marking of the entire product with secondary hybrids market moving wider.The market picked up significantly after the Fed cut the interest rate by 50 basis points in September. Hybrid issuance so far for 2007 is 38 per cent higher than for the total of 2006, and we expect this trend to continue into 2008, particularly with financial institution issuers that need to shore up their balance sheets.Kevin Ryan is managing director, global capital markets, at Morgan Stanley
251;MET;Metlife Inc;2007-08-14T01:07:21Z;Aegon buys Merrill insurance units;;Merrill Lynch has taken another step away from the products it provides through its brokerage arm by agreeing to sell its life assurance businesses for $1.3bn to Aegon, the Dutch insurance group.Bob McCann, head of Merrill Lynch’s private client arm, said the move would enable it to focus on insurance product distribution “and address the insurance, investment and retirement needs of our clients more broadly”.Aegon’s Transamerica unit would continue to offer the flagship Merrill Lynch Investors Choice Annuity through the broker’s financial adviser network but Merrill would also look to increase distribution of products from other insurers, he said.“Not only will our clients benefit from Transamerica’s scale and risk management expertise, but this strategic relationship will also allow us to jointly develop innovative insurance and investment products as well as pursue new business and distribution opportunities.”The disposal continues the trend among some large US brokers to focus purely on distribution.Citigroup sold its Travelers life and annuity arm to MetLife for $11.5bn in 2005 and then swapped its asset management business with Legg Mason.Last year, Merrill sold its asset management arm to BlackRock in return for a 49.8 per cent stake in the enlarged group.The move partly reflected the pressure Wall Street banks have been feeling to distance their investment management arms from broker networks.Following the regulatory scrutiny on Wall Street conflicts of interest after the 2000 stock market downturn, the companies found their financial advisers were increasingly reluctant to offer in-house products to their clients.Merrill advisers receive the same commission on insurance products whether they come from its in-house insurance company or an external supplier.The Merrill business had about $800m of variable annuity sales last year and $10bn of variable annuity assets.The purchase price includes excess surplus of about $425m.
252;MET;Metlife Inc;2007-06-15T11:56:15Z;US annuity import comes with a caution;;"Variable-rate annuities are the latest investment vehicles to cross the Atlantic with a handful of prominent US insurers now marketing them to pensioners here.AIG, the world’s biggest insurer by market capitalisation, Hartford Life, MetLife, and Lincoln are among the US insurers starting to pitch variable annuities as a product to help Britons stash money away for retirement.But be sure to treat these exports with some suspicion as US securities regulators have criticised them in the past and some advisers claim their high charges mean they may not be as good a deal as they first appear.“I think investors should approach variable annuities with caution,” says Justin Modray, an adviser with Bestinvest.“The combination of high charges and poor investment choice makes it hard to recommend them. If you buy through an adviser who refunds the initial commission the proposition becomes a little more attractive, but I think most investors would be better off in a well-diversified conventional investment portfolio.”In their simplest form, variable annuities are unit-linked savings products, the value of which depends on investments in underlying assets. Like conventional annuities, which pay a pre-set income for life in return for a lump sum, their selling point is that they offer a guaranteed income stream. If you are 60 and hand a provider £100,000, for example, you might get a guaranteed income of 5 per cent or £5,000 a year. If you are older, this income level is likely to be higher. In addition, if the value of your investment increases after all charges, this income level will ratchet up. Even if the value of your pot falls, your level of income is assured, at least until age 75 and in some cases for the rest of your life.At the end of the term, usually when the investor reaches 75, the investor can choose to use the remaining fund to buy an annuity on the open market or stick with the income they are getting, which is guaranteed for the rest of their life. At 75, they can also opt to put their money into an Alternatively Secured Pension (ASP) whereby they draw an income directly from the fund. With a variable annuity, if an investor were to die before age 75, the lump sum would be payable to their heirs less tax of 35 per cent, while taxes on death on ASP funds are far higher.The benefit of variable annuities for investors is the guarantee, which protects income against a possible collapse in markets.“These products allow investors to benefit from a guaranteed income for life without actually buying an annuity,” says Billy Burrows, director at William Burrows Annuities.While variable annuities do not enjoy a strong reputation in the US, the ones available in the UK are slightly different from their Yankee counterparts.In the UK, the goal of variable annuities is to overcome two objections to conventional annuities: the fact that on a single day you lock into rates for the remainder of your life; and you lose access to your capital.A typical example of a variable annuity is Aegon’s ‘5 for Life’ which launched last year. It offers a guaranteed income of at least 5 per cent of the original investment from the age of 60 until age 75. This starting income will vary according to factors such as life expectancy. The 5 per cent is a flat withdrawal from an underlying investment fund and there is a guarantee to continue paying this until death even if the fund runs out.Such an investment can look appealing as it provides a guaranteed annuity-style income, which can rise if fund performance is good while retaining access to capital. The catch is that the hurdles to increasing your income are relatively high. Income will only increase if the fund rises after all costs. Total annual costs on these plans, which include the cost of providing the income guarantee, vary from just under 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent, depending on how the fund is invested and the commission your adviser takes.Without decent underlying fund performance your income will likely fall in real terms because of inflation, say advisers.Some advisers argue that paying additional money for a guaranteed income is not to the investor’s advantage. They also argue that if the investor bought a conventional annuity at outset they would get a much higher starting income. However supporters of variable annuities say that investors still get an income guarantee and that if they get half-decent fund performance their income will rise.Investors do need to keep an eye on costs. Aegon charges about 1 per cent a year to cover the cost of the guarantee, but investors must also pay additional establishment charges to fund initial commissions. With Aegon, initial commissions can be as high as 6.75 per cent.The size of these commissions poses a concern as just three years ago lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington DC brought charges against financial brokers in the US – who were rewarded with similarly hefty sales commissions – for advising elderly Americans to buy variable annuities even when they were not appropriate."
253;MET;Metlife Inc;2007-05-28T21:02:51Z;Spitzer moves to update Wall St regulation;;Eliot Spitzer, New York governor, is to form a top-level panel of Wall Street chief executives, lawyers, consumer groups and regulators to modernise financial services regulation in the state.Chaired by Eric Dinallo, the New York insurance superintendent, the group will seek to keep New York competitive with London by streamlining and modernising regulation without sacrificing the state’s tradition of strong investor protection.The focus will be to rationalise state regulation of insurance companies, state-chartered banks and securities dealers and perhaps serve as a model for other states and the federal government.The project follows Mr Spitzer and Mr Dinallo’s success in rewriting New York’s workers compensation programme and efforts to settle the long dispute over insurance claims after the attack on the World Trade Center.Mr Dinallo said: “I’m viewing this as the cleaning of the Augean stables. It’s always healthy for a regulatory regime to stop and re-examine itself in response to the needs and concerns of the regulated, while still protecting consumers and investors.”The group will be established this week and will include the chief executives of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, AIG and MetLife, and the heads of several New York-chartered banks and representatives of consumer and New York business groups. It will also include the four state agencies overseeing the industry.One consideration will be whether to implement principles-based regulation along the lines of the UK’s Financial Services Authority.Also on the panel are several of those who, with Mr Dinallo and Mr Spitzer, forged the $1.4bn (£706m) global settlement that rewrote the rules for stock analysts at 12 big investment banks.Steve Cutler, then head of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission and now general counsel of JPMorgan, will be a member, as will Ted Levine, who was chief negotiator for the investment firms. Andrew Cuomo, who succeeded Mr Spitzer as attorney-general, will be represented by Eric Corngold, a deputy attorney-general.Participants said they hoped Mr Spitzer’s investor-protection work as attorney-general would give the group credibility among consumer advocates, which some of the business groups calling for regulatory reform lack.
254;MET;Metlife Inc;2006-12-14T19:53:52Z;New issues: European high-yield bond issuance to hit record;;"The record-breaking European high-yield bond market will come close to raising €40bn in 2006 after price guidance was set yesterday for the last major deal
of the year.The private equity owners of TIM Hellas, a Greek mobile phone operator, plan to issue €1.4bn in junk-rated bonds, nudging the market to €39.5bn for the year, a 120 per cent increase on the €18bn in 2005 and topping the previous record of €25bn in 2004, according to Credit Suisse.Although estimates of high-yield issuance vary among the leading institutions, Credit Suisse’s figures are considered a reliable indicator of market size as it includes even the small deals that are not covered in other calculations.Apax Partners and Texas Pacific Group, which own TIM Hellas, are seeking to recapitalise the business and pay themselves a dividend as they attempt to take advantage of low interest rates.The issuance comprises €1.1bn of senior subordinated debt due January 2015 in a mix of dollar and euro-denominated floating rate tranches, €200m of payment in kind notes (PIKs) – which pay out in the form of more bonds or loans at the coupon date – due July 2015 and an add-on of €100m to an existing floating rate note due in 2012.Price guidance for the euro floating rate note has been set at Euribor plus
600-625bp, the dollar FRN has been priced at Libor plus 575-600bp, the PIK has been set at Euribor plus 800-825bp and the €100m add-on has been priced at 102.375 per cent of face value.Of the €1.4bn raised, €900m will go to shareholders in the form of dividends, while €500m will refinance the existing PIK security, which was issued earlier this year at 825bp over Euribor.Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley are the lead managers of the deal.It was also not too late in the year for hybrid capital deals, with US insurer MetLife in the market with a $1bn 60-year hybrid. The interest rate is fixed until the scheduled maturity at 30 years, and floating thereafter. The bond cannot be called for 25 years.The issue is indicative of a strong finish to the year for the hybrid market, which this week also saw the first emerging market deal sold to US institutional buyers. The $1.25bn deal came from Cemex, the Mexican cement group. The MetLife deal, due to price late yesterday, was led by Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan."

257;MET;Metlife Inc;2006-10-17T22:02:00Z;MetLife in huge residential property deal;;MetLife, the US insurer, on Tuesday agreed to sell 110 apartment buildings on 80 acres along Manhattan’s East River to two real estate investment groups for $5.4bn, in one of the largest ever residential property deals.The sale of the units - named Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village - came at the end of an auction that set off an intense debate over the gentrification of one of New York’s most culturally diverse neighbourhoods.A vast majority of the apartments changing ownership are rent-controlled, making them a haven for middle-class families only a short commute from Wall Street and midtown Manhattan. But questions have been raised about the affordability of the 11,000 apartments once market prices kick in under the ownership of Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty, the winners of the auction.MetLife, which built the apartment complexes in 1948 to house veterans returning from World War II, will reap $3bn from the sale, after tax. The company’s shares rose 0.5 per cent to $57.42 on the back of the announcement.Tishman and BlackRock’s bid, which values the units at about $485,000 per apartment, was competing with rival offers from Apollo Real Estate, Lehman Brothers, Vornado Realty Trust, and a bid including a group of tenants. Seth Weinstein of Hannah Real Estate Investors said the price paid was ‘high” and represented “a real economic vote of confidence in Manhattan and the real estate market in general.”Meanwhile, the buyers sought to reassure tenants of the properties that they would not see their rents soar anytime soon.Jerry Speyer, chief executive of Tishman, said in a statement: “The thousands of tenants in rent-stabilised apartments are completely protected by the existing system. No one should be concerned about a sudden or dramatic shirt in this neighbourhood’s make-up, character, or charm.”But Daniel Garodnick, the New York city council member who supported the tenants’ offer, told the Financial Times: “Over time a landlord will take advantage of the opportunity to bring apartments out of the rent regulation system and make them market rate, and over time the whole community will be market-rate luxury tenants. Anyone who appreciates the history of Stuyvesant Town and the purpose for which it was built would be disappointed in that outcome.”
258;MET;Metlife Inc;2005-12-27T19:04:23Z;December proves to be bumper month for deals;;The most robust year for mergers and acquisitions since 2000 continued in spite of the break for the Christmas holiday.Four companies on Tuesday announced deals together worth more than $1bn (£577m, €843m) in the insurance, biotechnology and telecommunications sectors.Fidelity National Financial, which owns the largest US title insurance group, agreed to acquire Sedgwick CMS Holdings, the insurance claims company, for $635m in a cash and credit deal.Applied Biosystems, maker of gene-analysis equipment, agreed to pay $273m in cash for the research unit of Ambion, which specialises in DNA research products.Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, has bought a 12 per cent stake in gene-research company Perlegen Sciences for $50m.Pfizer has agreed to buy up to an additional $25m of Perlegen stock if the company goes public next year.And telecommunications company Nortel has agreed to acquire router maker Tasman Networks for $99.5m in cash.Merger volume of announced deals for December last week reached $134.2bn, making it the third-biggest month so far this year in terms of dollar value - and there are still business days left in the yearThe insurance and telecoms sectors have seen rapid consolidation this year with major deals.MetLife paid $11bn to purchase Travelers Life & Annuity and SBC made its $24bn acquisition of AT&T.Fidelity National’s purchase of Sedgwick CMS allows it to cross-sell products and enter the market for third-party administration services, which it values at more than $2.5bn.Sedgwick CMS is expected to generate nearly $400m in revenue this year.Nortel plans for Tasman’s internet protocol routers to help customers converge network services onto one platform.Buying Ambion will allow Applied Biosytems to expand growth by making products used in gene research, which the company estimates is a $500m market that is growing more than 10 per cent each year.Pfizer’s investment in Perlegen aims to study genes associated with diseases and identify genetic markers that may predict patient response to medicines.Brad Margus, chief executive of Perlegen, said: “Drugs developed based on genetic information will be directed more specifically towards the patients who are most likely to benefit from them.”In addition to Pfizer, Affymetrix, Maverick Capital, CSK Ventures, Eli Lilly and other investors have taken major stakes in Perlegen.
259;MET;Metlife Inc;2005-08-14T17:12:08Z;MetLife to offer mortgages through bank network;;In a rare move for an insurer, MetLife is set to begin originating mortgages through its bank this autumn to woo new customers.Until now, MetLife's bank, which opened three years ago and contributes less than 5 per cent to the life assurer's profits each year, mainly collected deposits. MetLife is looking to mortgage originations as a way to improve its opportunities to cross-sell. Only a handful of its rivals of which State Farm is the biggest originate mortgages.Donna Demaio, president of MetLife Bank, said: “Mortgages are a great product to attract a new type of customer to MetLife …someone just starting out in the financial world.”Some analysts are sceptical of MetLife's move. Doug Duncan, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, the industry trade group, said: “If it was profitable for insurance companies to do that, you'd see a lot more of them doing it.“So far, the business model hasn't proved to be that effective.”More than six months have passed since Bob Benmosche, MetLife's chief executive, reached an agreement with Chuck Prince, Citigroup's chief executive, to buy Travelers Life & Annuity from the bank. MetLife's chief executive is confident the $11.5bn acquisition has paid off despite some criticism from analysts who are concerned about the insurer's debt level.The acquisition has allowed MetLife to expand distribution. It now sells through Citigroup, Primerica and Smith Barney branches. It has reduced expenses and dipped its toes into the Australian and Japanese markets, Mr Benmosche said.The biggest US life assurer, MetLife is already at the top of the market in Mexico and gaining share in Chile and South Korea, two of the biggest retirement markets outside the US.“Strategically, we need to be global,” Mr Benmosche said. “In our business more and more profits are coming from outside of the US.” Mr Benmosche is set to retire from MetLife next year. Robert Henrikson, the insurer's president, will replace him.Last week, American International Group, the world's biggest insurer by market capitalisation, reported that its profits rose 51 per cent in the second quarter to $3.99bn helped by booming sales of life assurance outside the US.On Friday, MetLife shares were flat at $48.76.
260;MET;Metlife Inc;2005-05-04T20:21:41Z;Wall St higher as Kerkorian lifts GM stake;;Surging shares in General Motors put a spark into trading on Wall Street on Wednesday, after a company controlled by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire financier, said it would buy a sizeable stake in the struggling carmaker.Insurers also posted strong gains, as MetLife and Aon weighed in with strong earnings reports.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 10,384.64. The S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 1,175.65, and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.5 per cent to 1,962.23.Ken Tower, chief market analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned against reading too much into the day’s gains, however. Mr Tower said the ratio between put and call options on the US indices remained elevated, “suggesting a strong lingering scepticism for the market’s ability to rally”.Investors were digesting an Institute for Supply Management survey, which showed that business growth among financial, construction and other services firms moderated last month, in line with expectations.Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow financial, said the large number of positive surprises this earnings season was a sign that companies were countering the effects of high oil prices by increasing productivity and cutting costs.General Motors was the centre of attention on Wednesday after Tracinda, the investment vehicle of Mr Kerkorian, said it would buy as many as 28m shares in the struggling automaker at $31 a share. The move would double Mr Kerkorian’s holdings in the company to 8.8 per cent. GM shares leapt 18.1 per cent to $32.80 on the news. Shares in the biggest US carmaker fell sharply from a January high of $40.30 after it warned on profits this year. Ford, GM’s chief US rival, rose 7.3 per cent to $10.16 on the coat-tails of the GM news.Strong results from a pair of big insurers lifted shares across the sector. Aon, the world’s second-biggest insurance broker, shot up 15 per cent to $24.45 after it beat expectations with profits up 18 per cent. MetLife, a New York-based rival, jumped 12.1 per cent to $43.55 after its earnings beat estimates. American International Group, the biggest US insurer, rose 2 per cent to $54.37.Elsewhere on the earnings front, Electronic Arts, the world’s biggest video game maker, fell 6.5 per cent to $49.45 after it reported sharply lower profits for the first quarter and forecast a second quarter loss.Time Warner, the media group, rose 3.6 per cent to $17.28 after profits beat estimates.Utilities companies and energy groups put in the worst performances of the day. Dominion Resources, owner of Virginia’s biggest utility company, fell 3.3 per cent to $72.70 after its first quarter profits fell. Devon Energy, the oil and gas explorer, slipped 0.4 per cent, its second successive day of declines.Microsoft, the world’s biggest software company, slipped 0.6 per cent to $25.21.
261;MET;Metlife Inc;2005-02-27T18:41:36Z;Why Goliaths need to be careful;;"Procter & Gamble has announced it will acquire Gillette; Metlife is buying Travelers Life & Annuity and most of Citigroup's international insurance businesses; Novartis, the pharmaceuticals group, has agreed to buy Hexal of Germany; in telecommunications, SBC is swallowing AT&T and Qwest has just enhanced its bid in an effort to foil Verizon's offer for MCI. Big consolidations are also under way in other industries including steel and software.It is a good bet that the wave of mergers is just starting to build. Each new combination puts pressure not only on rival companies to follow suit but also on big service providers - the lawyers, the public relations and advertising companies - to bulk up to serve their clients around the world, as WPP, the advertising group, has done. In the US, corporate balance sheets are flush with more than $4,000bn of cash and short-term investments waiting to be put to work. In Europe, a strong euro could help with acquisitions outside the eurozone. Corporate boards seem to be re-evaluating their post-Enron aversion to risk, too.While many past big mergers have not panned out - AOL's deal with Time Warner comes to mind - many have, such as BP's acquisition of Amoco, the rival oil group. Most of the deals announced recently look well-focused and seem to be taking place for strategic reasons. For example, the merger of P&G and Gillette will enhance the combined companies' bargaining power with corporate Goliaths such as Wal-Mart, the US retailer, and it will also put the company in a better position to penetrate emerging markets.Classic antitrust concerns are unlikely to apply. Even after the new mega-companies are created, there will be plenty of competition, given that the entire world is now the relevant marketplace. In fact, the purpose of many of these deals is to cut costs, enabling the enlarged groups to compete better on price.The fact that companies are growing so large has other implications, however, which should be of greater concern. It is not clear whether chief executives, no matter how skilful, can effectively manage companies with such a global reach. Consider how Citigroup - by any standards one of the world's most impressive and important financial institutions - has become mired in deep political problems in Japan and Europe due to lack of effective oversight from New York, and look how Chuck Prince, its chief executive, is being forced to refurbish the financial behemoth's culture from top to bottom. These days, chief executives are being held responsible for hands-on management of their enterprises; their duties include personally signing off on the accounts. But, as these businesses encompass more assets, engage in more complicated financial dealings, and employ more people in more parts of the world, can their attestations remain credible?Another problem for outsized companies is the public perception that they possess too much political power. Mega-groups are, like all companies, under severe pressure to generate profits. But, as the most visible targets at a time of notable lack of trust in public companies, they could be held to ever higher standards of non-financial performance.To avoid their sheer size prompting a political backlash, multinationals should try to use their ""soft power"" to pre-empt popular resentment. They should begin by reviewing the effectiveness of the many corporate associations that profess to enhance civil society and redouble efforts to turn rhetoric into concrete actions and results. They could, for instance, enhance the prominence of organisations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Global Reporting Initiative, a group that is developing verifiable ways to measure the economic, social and environmental dimensions of business activities, from safety standards to air quality.The mega-companies should become exemplars of corporate governance. General Electric and IBM have set worthy precedents. Their boards are overwhelmingly made up of independent directors, and their executive pay packages clearly tied to performance.Mega-companies also need to be careful not to neglect their local roots. Charitable work in the community is sometimes uprooted by big mergers - as happened in 1999, when Honeywell, the Minnesota-based industrial company, moved its headquarters to New Jersey after merging with AlliedSignal and severely reduced its philanthropic activities in Minneapolis and St Paul.At a national and global level, large enterprises also have the opportunity to advance public policy. In the US, this could mean helping to reshape the dysfunctional healthcare system. Worldwide, mega-companies can do much more to push for trade negotiations that have a meaningful impact on economic development.In the gilded age of JP Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, big companies were seen as having unchecked power. This led to a dramatic increase in government regulation. Unless the new corporate Goliaths are smart about redefining their own role in global society, that could easily happen again.The writer is dean of the Yale School of Management and author of The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda for Business Leaders (Harvard Business School Press)"

A pick-up in domestic merger and acquisition activity after the announcement of several deals also suggested increased confidence.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent higher at 10,489.94, while the S&P 500 index was 0.9 per cent higher at 1,181.26. The Nasdaq Composite index was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,062.41.Wall Street notched its first winning week of the year last week, tacking on modest advances for the five-session stretch amid warnings that a losing month could bode ill for the year.January has been a dour debut to the year, with the Dow ending the month 2.7 per cent while the S&P 500 index lost 2.5 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 5.2 percent.This week's meeting of US Federal Reserve policymakers is expected to yield a quarter-point rise in interest rates and a keenly studied statement. With a widely watched labour market data report on Friday, it is expected to shed light on the world's largest economy and the outlook for equities.News of multiple acquisitions on Monday suggested increased confidence in US boardrooms. In the telecoms sector, SBC Communications announced the takeover of AT&T for $16bn. The deal, which sees a current Dow component buy a former constituent, pushed AT&T shares down 2.6 per cent to $19.11. SBC Communications shares added 0.6 per cent to $23.76.Lee Enterprises announced it was buying Pulitzer for about $1.4bn in cash. Its shares inched up 1.5 per cent to $44.55, while Pulitzer gained 0.9 per cent to $63.46.Eastman Kodak announced the purchase of Creo, a supplier of printing systems, for $980m in cash. Kodak shares rose 1.2 per cent to $33.09.In the insurance sector, MetLife said it would buy Citigroup's Traveler's Life & Annuity unit. MetLife shares edged off 0.5 per cent to $39.75 while Citi rose 1.4 per cent to $49.05.Monday's deals came after a landmark merger in the consumer goods sector last week, when Procter & Gamble said it would buy Gillette. The stocks were 1.7 per cent lower at $53.23 and $50.72, respectively.The takeover news came after national elections in Iraq were declared a success by authorities in Baghdad, Washington and London. Traders and investors said there had been skittishness in the market about attacks during the polls.About half of the components of the S&P 500 index have reported earnings. A few prominent US corporations were still to report earnings this week.ExxonMobil, the largest publicly traded oil group, saw its shares add 0.6 per cent to $51.60 after it said record crude prices helped it achieve $8.4bn in net profits last quarter.Shares in Marsh&McLennan rose 4.5 per cent to $32.50 after the insurance broker agreed to pay $850m to settle charges that it rigged auctions with insurers.
263;MET;Metlife Inc;2004-12-06T21:38:31Z;Wall Street sputters amid fresh oil fears;;"Wall Street sputtered on Monday amid fresh threats to crude oil output and a lack of positive economic news after last week's disappointing jobs report, frustrating investors looking for a sustained Christmas bounce.By the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4 per cent to 10,547.28. The S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent at 1,190. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent higher, however, at 2,151.24.Stocks were held in check by disappointing economic data late last week that raised doubts about the recovery of the US labour market. This thwarted a more solid follow-through to a mid-week rally that helped push the Dow to a nine-month high while the S&P 500 reached its best level in three years.While bullish investors are hoping for a so-called Santa Claus rally to conclude the year, a retreat typically precedes such a move. This week is likely to determine whether such a pre-Christmas retreat is a blip on the charts or the demise of the market's recent run-up.Amid a thin calendar of economic news, all eyes will be on Friday's meeting of ministers from members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. On the corporate front, investors are awaiting reports about the strength - or lack thereof - in sales at the leading US retailers as the Christmas shopping season gets under way.The price of oil shot back above $43 per barrel for most of the day before closing at $42.98. That followed last week's 14 per cent fall, which led some Opec members to call for a cut in output. Concerns over oil supplies were compounded by unrest in Nigeria, where militants seized three pumping stations, and by an attack on a US consulate in Saudi Arabia.Mike O'Hare, head of listed trading at Lehman Brothers, said that while unrest in the world's oil producing regions had grabbed headlines, Monday's fall was due mainly to profit-taking. ""The market is at a short-term all-time high,"" he said. ""People are going to take a breather. It's healthy for the market to pull back a bit.""Circuit City shares fell 6.6 per cent to $15.14 as the electronics retailer reported a 4.3 per cent drop in same-store sales. Shares in its rival Best Buy were down 0.7 per cent at $56.44. Best Buy last week reported same-store sales up 3.2 per cent.MetLife, the life insurance company, fell 0.9 per cent to $40.10 after it raised its 2004 earnings forecast. The company said it now expected earnings per share in the range of $3.31 to $3.35 this year, against previous expectations of $3.22 to $3.30.International Business Machines rose 0.6 per cent to $97.65 as the computer giant revealed it had won a seven-year, $969m contract to supply internet and data services to Lloyds TSB, the British bank. The New York Times last week reported that IBM was looking for a buyer for its personal computer business to focus on opportunities in the information services business.3Com, the telecommunications equipment maker, fell 7.8 per cent to $4.21 as the company cut its second-quarter earnings guidance and said margins would be lower than expected. The company said it now expected earnings of between $149m and $153m in the quarter, against its previous forecast of $170m to $180m.Pfizer shares fell 2.4 per cent to $27.21 following a downgrade by Merrill Lynch. The investment bank lowered Pfizer's rating from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" citing concerns about the threat of generic competition to its cholesterol drug.Wyeth, arival drugs group, was also hit by a Merrill downgrade. Shares in Wyeth, which faces continuing litigation over the health effects of its Fen-phen diet drug combination, fell 3.2 per cent to $40.24.The US-listed shares of Goldcorp, the Canadian mining company, fell 0.6 per cent to $14.25, after it agreed to a $2.1bn all-share merger with Wheaton River Minerals, a rival Canadian silver and gold producer. Wheaton River's NYSE-listed shares shot up 7.8 per cent to $3.44.Shares in Boeing were down 0.9 per cent at $54.76 ahead of a meeting between US and European Union trade representatives, which is expected to include talks about controversial subsidies for the aircraft maker and its rival Airbus.Apple Computer jumped 5 per cent to $65.781, as Bear Stearns raised its share price target.

264;MET;Metlife Inc;2004-11-12T21:44:39Z;Favoured insurers ‘belonged to ULR club’;;"Mr Spitzer’s complaint, which runs to 24 pages, names as defendants ULR, Douglas Cox, its founder and chief executive, and two subsidiaries United Life Resources and Benefits Commerce.The allegations focus on “side arrangements” between ULR and a group of big insurers.The following are extracts from the main allegations quoted in the civil complaint:Main Allegations and (below) Belonging to the ULR Club; ULR ‘Betrays its Clients’:Clause 10: “According to its agreements with its client employers, ULR’s compensation for its employee benefits consulting and brokerage services generally derives from (i) a flat fee or (ii) commissions representing a percentage of the premiums paid by its client employers and their employees”Clause 11: “What the agreements have generally not disclosed, at least up until the middle of 2003, is that ULR and Cox had separate side arrangements with a group of insurers, including, among others, UnumProvident Corporation; MetLife Inc; and Prudential Financial, under which ULR and Cox have received additional payments. These arrangements - variously known as ‘special producer agreements,’ ‘quality business incentive awards,’ ‘preferred broker compensation plans,’ ‘competitive bonus programs,’ and ‘extra compensation agreements’ - are known generally as ‘overrides’. According to ULR’s financial records, in 2003, overrides accounted for $11.5m of ULR’s $25.3m in revenues.”Clause 12: “These arrangements have the potential and do, in fact, result in ULR steering business to insurers that pay overrides and withholding it from those that do not.”Clause 13: “ULR receives another form of undisclosed compensation through insurers: ‘communication fees.’ These payments, which are sometimes mandated in side agreements between ULR and the insurer, are generally for…enrollment materials…In 2003, communication fees amounted to $5.6m of ULR’s $25.3m in revenues. Together with overrides, in 2003, these undisclosed fees constituted over $17m.”Clause 14: “ULR is not the only party that profits from these side arrangements. In 2003 ULR clients and their employees paid premiums for life, accident and disability coverage in the following amounts to the following insurers: Unum $101.6m; Prudential $214.3m; and MetLife $565.6m. Insurers have found the revenues derived from the collection of premium on accounts brokered by ULR more than compensates for the payments to ULR, especially when their rates and other substantive terms are less competitive. As one udnerwriter at Unum recommended in discussing its override agreement with ULR, it was worthwhile ‘to pay a slightly higher % [of premium to ULR] for retaining profitable life cases - [since] this may be a less expensive way to maintain some of these accounts (vs going head-to-head with Met & Pru on price right now).”Clause 15: “Because insurers have benefited from their dealings with ULR, they have worked in concert with ULR to conceal these side arrangements. They have ommitted information regarding payments made to ULR from mandatory public filings; evaded client inquiries regarding ULR’s compensation; and falsified pricing for communication services to give the impression that ULR’s charges for such services are competitive. One insurer went so far as to enter into a fictitious bid to block and insurer that did not have a side arrangement with ULR from competing for business. The insurers knew that cooperating with ULR to conceal these side arrangements is a ‘quid pro quo for obtaining business brokered by ULR.”Section C: ULR Enters into Lucrative Side Arrangements with Insurers1. ULR Receives Undisclosed Override PaymentsClause 31: “ULR’s secret override payment arrangements have created potential and actual conflicts with the interests of its clients. The arrangements create extraordinary incentives for ULR to drive business to particular insurers: if a single client moves from one insurer to another, ULR could lose millions of dollars in compensation…”Clause 32: “The incentives are equally compelling for insurers, It is understood that ULR will only direct business to insurers if they participate in the override arrangements. In the words of an Unum underwriter: ‘[u]nfortunately, to play with [ULR], we need the overrides.’ As another Unum employee elaborated, Unum enters into override agreements with ULR because it represents one of the ‘biggest premium opportunities’ and Unum would get ‘0’ of that business if it did not join ULR’s club.”Clause 33: Given this perception, MetLife, the nation’s largest life insurer, paid ULR $9 million, or over 36 per cent of its $25 million override budget in 2003 - a remarkable figure given that Met had override agreements with at least 60 brokers…”Section E: ULR Steers Business to Insurers that Go Along and Cuts Out Those That Do NotClause 50: “The big payoff for insurers who participate in these arrangements is that, despite the appearance of a competitive process, they know that Cox often identifies an insurer as suited for a particular piece of business even before he issues the RFP on behalf of the client. Membership in Cox’s club puts those insurers on the inside track to the business…”Clause 53: “While favouring certain insurers, Cox simultaneously will not deal with those that will not agree to the club’s membership terms. In 2002, ULR and Minnesota Life Insurance Company reached an agreement on override payments, but Minnesota Life insisted that all of ULR’s compensation be disclosed to the client. ULR refused to enter into the agreement and declined to engage in further business with Minnesota Life.”Clause 54: Aetna Inc, one of the nation’s largest life insurers, has not had an override agreement with ULR since February 2001. Since that time, Aetna has had virtually no success in securing new business where ULR is the broker.”Section F: ULR Betrays Its ClientsClause 56: “ULR’s practices have had a detrimental impact on its clients and their employees, as set forth below:1. Viacom: ULR Conspires to Falsify Pricing DocumentClause 57: “In 2004, Viacom retained ULR in connection with renewing its group life and accident employee insurance coverage with Prudential. Through ULR, Viacom requested Prudential to provide a renewal quote. In conjunction with presenting its presentation of Prudential’s renewal quote, ULR asked Prudential to create exhibits which misrepresented that Prudential’s cost for communication services would be the same as ULR’s costs…ULR generally charges $10 per employee for communications services. In contrast, when Prudential charges for the same services, it charges #3.45 per employee, although it ordinarily absorbs the cost in its overhead. Prudential employees resusted ULR at first, but ULR insisted that Prudential provide it with false exhibits.”Clause 58: “Prudential provided ULR with false exhibits, knowing that ULR intended to pass them on to Viacom, ULR then knowingly incorporated the information contained in the exhibits into a ‘Group Life and Accident Insurance Renewal Summary’ which it provided to Viacom. The summary was misleading in that it represented that the cost of communications services would be the same whether performed by ULR or Prudential. Relying on this false and misleading information, Viacom accepted Prudential’s offer and agreed to permit ULR to perform the communications.”2. Marriott: ULR Solicits a Fictitious Quote to Squeeze Aetna Out of the Bidding ProcessClause 59: “In December 2002, Marriott International, the hotel chain, contracted with ULR to obtain both life and disability insurance for its employees, 6590 of whom reside in New York State. ULR first resisted quotes for life insurance. Under the customary procedure, the insurers submitting the three lowest quotes - the ‘finalists’ - each get the opportunity to make more detailed presentations to Marriott, in which they can revise their proposals, and the client can consider non-price factors, such as service.”Clause 60: “Unum submitted a proposal for group life insurance coverage and was accepted as one of the three finalists. Marriott then added new conditions that Unum believed would make it unprofitable for it to continue with its original bid. When Unum informed ULR of its intention to withdraw, ULR protested. If Unum were to withdraw, ULR told Unum, the incumbent carrier Aetna - which had no override agreement with ULR - would become one of the three finalists. ULR had override agreements with the other two insurers and asked Unum to maintain its bid to prevent the possibility that an insurer without an override would win the contract, Unum agreed, but only after it obtained a commitment from ULR that it need not take on business unless an undisclosed and unlikely contingency was met - that the amount of income covered under the policy would increase by one billion dollars. In other words, ULR, in order to guarantee continuing stream from overrides, solicited a bid from Unum solely to block a real competitor, Aetna, from the competition.”"
265;MET;Metlife Inc;2004-10-26T17:05:29Z;Wall St climbs as insurance stocks get boost;;Insurers staged a rally that led Wall Street higher on Tuesday morning amid relief about a wide-reaching probe by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general.By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,853.58 while the broader S&P 500 index was up 1 per cent at 1,105.50. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 1,920.08.The shares of Marsh & McLennan gained 8.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company’s chief executive resigned and Mr Spitzer said he would not pursue criminal charges against the company as part of his wide-reaching probe into the practices of the insurance industry.The ripples of the news gave a lift to the other so-called Spitzer stocks of insurance groups targeted by or involved in the investigation. Shares in American International Group rose 6.4 per cent to $59.73 while ACE gained 6.6 per cent to $37.09. MetLife was 3.4 per cent higher at $36.24 as Aetna put on 4.7 per cent to $88.80.Rob Arancio, trader at Lehman Brothers, said: “A lot of the market action had to do with the relief rally in insurance stocks and decreased concerns about lawsuits there.”Mr Arancio added that there was evidence of a “healthy rotation” of capital into stocks “that have been decimated” recently, such as airlines and homebuilders.The American Stock Exchange Airline index added 3.9 per cent, powered by a 23 per cent rise to $4.65 in Delta Air Lines after JP Morgan upgraded the stock. Also higher were Alaska Air, up 2.7 per cent at $26.31, and Northwest, up 2.8 per cent at $8.50.Among homebuilders’ stocks, Pulte Homes added 5.6 per cent to $54.40 as Lennar put on 2.7 per cent to $44.97 and Centex gained 3.4 per cent to $50.39.On the opposite end of the rotation mentioned by Mr Arancio were technology stocks, which saw selling.Silicon Laboratories saw shares tumble 18.6 per cent to $$28.05 after warning its fourth-quarter results would fall short of expectations, reinforcing bearish views of the semiconductor sector. Hewlett-Packard, down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 and Intel, off fractionally at $21.30 were among the few declining Dow stocks.Bucking the downward trend in technology, Nvidia rose 12.7 per cent to $15.03 after the graphics chip designer reported strong quarterly results.The relief rally in insurers and other sectors helped offset a disappointing reading of the consumer confidence index for this month, which declined more than economists had expected. The Conference Board, the business research group which released the data, said the index was 92.8, its lowest level in seven months.Economists noted the worsening in consumer expectations component of the index and attributed to rising energy costs. While Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics predicted further declines in confidence because of energy costs, Stephen Gallagher at SG Investment Banking deemed that as a “known risk” and dwelled on evidence of increased consumer spending and improving labour markets, “which are key …in the performance of financial markets”.Meanwhile the crude oil price, which had weighed on stocks, retreated after the Norwegian government acted to avoid a strike that could have disrupted production at a time when the markets are jittery about supply-demand imbalances ahead winter.As the third-quarter earnings season continued, Sara Lee, the consumer goods group, saw shares add 2.1 per cent to $22.91 after it reported higher quarterly earnings that investors appeared to dismiss owing to the effect of a fee from an asset sale. Commodity prices and other factors would have caused the company’s earnings to be flat if the fee had been excluded.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin shares were up 1.1 per cent to $54.10 after the company reported a 41 per cent rise in third-quarter profits, raised its 2004 full-year estimate but guided analysts below their forecasts for next year.Halliburton, the oil services group, reported a quarterly loss owing to charges it took to provide for asbestos-related liabilities. Shares were 2.7 per cent higher at $35.28.DuPont shares edged off 2.1 per cent to $41.29 in morning trading after the chemical company swung to profitability for the quarter thanks to growing demand that offset the effects of rising energy prices.
266;MET;Metlife Inc;2004-08-27T20:47:12Z;Wall St slows to a crawl as convention looms;;Like a ghost train in a rainy night, Wall Street stocks moved ahead this week but hardly anyone was there to see it happen.Trading volumes were positively torpid and reached new lows for the year at the New York Stock Exchange during the week. “We'll need a cattle prod to reach 1bn shares today,” said one trader yesterday, and his view was vindicated when 847m shares exchanged hands at the Big Board.While a few stocks received some attention, the broader market edged modestly higher.By Friday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 10,195.01, or 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,107.77 on Friday and was 0.9 per cent higher for the week. The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.5 per cent to 1,862.08, for a weekly showing of 1.3 per cent to the upside.Many market watchers said the torpor was set to continue and worsen next week, when the Republican party holds its quadrennial national convention in New York's Madison Square Garden arena, above the railway station where trains from Long Island and New Jersey bring many Wall Streeters to work.The combined fears about a more tedious commute than usual and possible terrorist incidents have caused even the most workaholic traders to book time off. There were wide expectations for Wall Street to become a ghost town setting as early as lunchtime Friday.The effects of the market-wide languor were felt in the relatively tepid reaction from the stock market to the retreat in oil prices. Having flirted with a $50 price for a barrel of crude, futures begun a decline last Friday that continued this week. By the close of trade on Friday, they stood at $43.18.Nevertheless, concerns that US shoppers might not be as loose with their wallets in the near future were reiterated by some companies even as lower petrol prices gave some cause for optimism.Wal-Mart saw its shares fall by 1.9 percent for the week after it trimmed its August forecast on Monday for sales at stores open at least a year, saying that back-to-school activity had not lived up to expectations.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts shares ended Thursday 10.4 per cent lower but were only 1.9 per cent lower for the week after the purveyor of sugary treats announced a 56 per cent drop in profits, missing forecasts and withdrawing its quarterly and full-year earnings guidance.Likewise, Starbucks shares fell 6.5 per cent on Thursday and were 5.3 per cent lower for the week after disappointing sales figures from the coffee shop operator.Fred's, the discount retailer, saw shares lose 10.9 per cent the same day and 12.6 per cent for the week as it released lower quarterly earnings.However, Target, another discount retailer, sounded a different note from rival Wal-Mart when it reaffirmed its August same-store sales guidance on Tuesday, sending shares 1.4 per cent higher for the session and 2.5 per cent higher for the week.Williams-Sonoma, a retailer of high-end corkscrews and other housewares, said on Wednesday profits rose 55 per cent in the quarter. Shares gained 9 per cent this week.Even if some US consumers might be loath to consume as much, they appeared to still be buying food. HJ Heinz, the company best known for its tomato ketchup, announced a 7.8 per cent rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday, and the news sent shares 2.8 per cent higher, for a weekly gain of 3 per cent. The company said brisk sales of its low carb frozen foods helped the results.In a sign that not all foods are equal, poultry producers came under pressure this week when Sanderson Farms on Tuesday said profits missed analyst estimates. Shares fell 18 per cent for the week, along with those of Pilgrim's Pride, which gave up 16 per cent that days but were only 2.8 per cent lower for the week, and Tyson Foods, which fell 5.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent for the week.Some deal-making also broke the August lull. Toronto-Dominion Bank shares eased 2.4 per cent on Thursday after it announced the purchase of a controlling state in Banknorth, a Maine bank whose shares added 10 per cent on the news a day earlier.BlackRock shares rose 2.4 per cent on the same day and were 10.4 per cent for the week after it announced the $375m purchase of SSRM Holdings, the holding company of State Street Research & Management, from MetLife. The insurer's shares were flat for the week.
