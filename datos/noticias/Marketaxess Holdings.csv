0;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2019-08-30T03:00:29Z;Rise of MarketAxess mirrors demise of traders on Wall Street;Electronic bond-trading platform has delivered better returns than Netflix or Amazon;The news that MarketAxess was about to join an inner sanctum of corporate America stunned Rick McVey.The chief executive of the electronic bond-trading platform had just returned to his office in Hudson Yards in New York after a late-afternoon meeting, to find that the company had qualified for the S&P 500 index of the biggest US companies.“There was an email from a sales guy out in LA who had seen [the announcement] and I nearly fell out of my chair,” he told the Financial Times.Since that day in late June the company’s market capitalisation has added another $2.8bn, a reflection of its position right at the heart of sweeping changes on Wall Street.The days of young men and women barking into phones to connect buyers and sellers — the kinds of scenes associated with the “masters of the universe” chronicled by Michael Lewis or Tom Wolfe — are slipping away. Instead, bonds are being traded electronically and via algorithms, sometimes without any human touches at all along the way.These radical shifts in the $9.3tn US corporate bond market have handed MarketAxess, the industry-leading platform, a 590 per cent rise in its share price over the past five years. That is 13 times the return of the S&P 500, and better than other much-hailed disrupters like Amazon or Netflix.The question now is whether MarketAxess can maintain its dominance, with competitors such as Tradeweb Markets, which went public in a splashy initial public offering in April, nipping at its heels.MarketAxess is also trying to push into new areas, such as the $16tn market for US government debt, where Tradeweb, Bloomberg and Refinitiv — bought this month by the London Stock Exchange — are already fighting it out.Heightened competition is likely to weigh on the company’s earnings growth over the next few years, according to Brian Bedell, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. Goldman Sachs goes further, with a “sell” recommendation, saying that the company’s aggressive valuation — 79 times this year’s earnings, the fifth highest among the S&P 500 — is bound to fall.By its own estimates, MarketAxess handles nearly a fifth of all investment-grade corporate bond trades in the US, up from about 12 per cent five years ago. It also trades just above 10 per cent of all high-yield bonds, up from 3 per cent over the same period.The way Mr McVey sees it, the forces behind his company’s rise have much to do with tightened regulatory requirements on the big banks after the crisis. If big banks can use electronic venues to dip in and out of positions more quickly, they can operate with much leaner trading inventories of their own, and therefore keep capital requirements at a minimum.“They want to continue to provide a service to their clients but they are transitioning to a model where they take less risk, not more risk,” said Mr McVey, a former head of North American fixed-income sales at JPMorgan.The big names on Wall Street continue to struggle to get to grips with the new environment, with many still making cuts to front-line staff to offset sluggish revenues. Morgan Stanley, for example, enjoyed seven days of at least $100m in net trading revenues during the second quarter of 2011. During the same period this year there were none, it disclosed in a recent filing.“The business is clearly under secular pressure,” said Chris Kotowski, analyst at Oppenheimer in New York.Even so, expansion has come at a cost to MarketAxess. In the quarter to June, expenses were up 17.6 per cent to $64m as the company hired more senior executives and technologists. Coupled with higher clearing costs and lower-than-forecast revenues, the numbers missed analysts’ expectations.That puts a premium on top-line growth. MarketAxess this month signed a deal to buy LiquidityEdge for $150m, to get into the $16tn market for trading US Treasuries. Part of the higher expenses includes preparing a partnership with Virtu Financial to trade exchange-traded funds. Among its plans for the future: “portfolios” of trades, which involves trading big baskets of bonds simultaneously.Mr McVey is confident that the company will continue to grow, pointing to the rising influence of algorithms that can price and execute trades without human involvement.That will be particularly felt for smaller deals, he says, which many banks are unwilling to take on because the margins on offer are too small. But he adds that it is no longer just banks looking to use the technology.“The dealer algos are one side of that equation but investors are really starting to invest in automating more and more as well,” said the CEO. “There is still so much more coming in the future.”Investors’ “enthusiastic” reception to the Tradeweb IPO — up about 150 per cent since listing — has been validation for the industry, he added. “It shows fixed-income broadly is in the middle of a structural change.”
1;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2019-08-13T14:45:15Z;MarketAxess to break into $14tn Treasury market with LiquidityEdge deal;;MarketAxess, the US corporate bond trading venue, is to compete with CME Group and Tradeweb in the $14tn US Treasury market after agreeing a deal to buy LiquidityEdge, a small electronic marketplace, for $150m.It will pay $100m in cash and $50 in MarketAxess stock for Liquidity Edge, which is majority-owned by former ICAP executive David Rutter. Shares in MarketAxess rose 0.4 per cent to $364 on the news on Tuesday.Treasuries are the cornerstone of the global bond universe, with nearly $600bn of US government debt changing hands each day. Trading has become more automated in recent years, and high-speed traders have elbowed their way in alongside the investment banks that have long dominated the market. The majority of deals are executed on venues run by Tradeweb, the CME and Bloomberg.Those incursions have been made in the dealer-to-dealer market, where banks trade with each other. LiquidityEdge has carved out a 5 per cent market share by allowing high-speed traders like Jump Trading to connect with institutional investors.Chris Concannon, president and chief operating officer at MarketAxess, said the deal would complement MarketAxess’s dominant position in corporate bonds. The venue will be able to link its credit market with Treasuries, allowing investors to net their positions and save on trading costs.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory approval.
2;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2019-07-24T14:56:31Z;MarketAxess slides as earnings miss expectations;Company bucks bank’s fixed income trading weakness but results disappoint;Shares in MarketAxess, the US corporate bond trading venue, dropped as much as 9 per cent in New York after it missed analysts’ expectations for its second-quarter earnings.The US group, which has a market capitalisation of more than $12bn, reported a 17.3 per cent rise in revenues to $125.5m for the three months to June 30, compared to a year earlier.It also made record operating income of $63m, up 5 per cent year-on-year and diluted earnings per share rose 18.7 per cent to $1.27, below the $1.32 a share consensus forecast by Refinitiv.The venue bucked the trend among investment banks, which have had a weak quarter trading fixed income, by recording a 25 per cent rise in overall trading volume, to $527bn. Even so, “all revenue items trailed our estimates by modest amounts,” said Daniel Fannon, an analyst at Jefferies.MarketAxess said expenses rose 12 per cent to $61m, as clearing costs soared and employee compensation costs rose to $32m. To drive its push into electronic and automated fixed income trading, in January the company hired Chris Concannon, one of the best known executives in the US equity and options industry, from Cboe Global Markets.The news knocked shares of other US exchanges and trading venues. Intercontinental Exchange, which has a fixed income trading platform, fell 3.3 per cent and rival Tradeweb Markets, which trades sovereign debt, fell 3.4 per cent.
3;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2019-04-05T02:19:28Z;MarketAxess muscles into ETF industry with Virtu tie-up;Deal between two groups comes amid shift in way corporate bonds are bought and sold;"Bond trading platform MarketAxess is muscling into the burgeoning exchange-traded fund industry, forming a partnership with high-frequency trader Virtu to capitalise on roaring investor demand for new ways to buy and sell corporate bonds.The tie-up between the two giants of electronic trading will see Virtu’s ETF trading platform RFQ-hub — acquired after Virtu bought rival agency broker ITG for $1bn in cash last year — embedded into MarketAxess, the largest electronic bond trading platform in the US.ETFs have disrupted the traditional way investors trade corporate debt by allowing an entire index to be traded electronically like a stock, rather than the traditional model of buying and selling individual bonds.The alliance underscores how corporate bond trading is evolving as technology plays an increasingly significant role in the market, forcing
big investment banks to retool their staff and operations for a more
electronic era.Chris Concannon, president of MarketAxess, said the growth of the ETF market was a driving force for the increased interest in electronic bond trading.“We think the growth of the ETF market is altering how the underlying bond market is traded and driving much of the automation,” he said. “The portfolio managers we provide bonds to are now interested in trading ETFs. Given that demand we are pretty excited about getting this offering in our clients’ hands.”The trading of fixed-income ETFs is an area where many investors would like to have more tools and transparencyLarge trading groups such as Jane Street and Susquehanna automate ETF trading and have looked to do the same in the underlying bonds, said Mr Concannon. MarketAxess said that close to 30 per cent of trading on their all-to-all electronic platform Open Trading comes from nonbank market makers.The low cost of ETFs had also put fee-pressure on more traditional portfolio managers who have been pushed to seek out more low-cost, electronic ways of trading as a result, Mr Concannon said.The shift blurs the line between active and passive fund management, as portfolio managers paid to pick bonds increasingly look to ETFs as a way to invest.“That’s the irony,” Mr Concannon said. “It allows active managers to use passive instruments to add to their portfolio.”He said that MarketAxess and Virtu have agreed to a revenue sharing agreement as part of the deal, but declined to offer further details about how fees from the platform will be divided.The new partnership will also include adding eNAV to MarketAxess’s platform, which is a tool for investors to calculate the value of a basket of bonds to check if the price of an ETF matches the combined value of the underlying debt.The announcement noted that the arrangement between the two companies was subject to them entering into a binding definitive agreement.“It is an interesting partnership,” said Deborah Fuhr, founder of ETF data provider ETFGI. “The trading of fixed-income ETFs is an area where many investors would like to have more tools and transparency.”"
4;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2019-01-13T11:10:47Z;Equities veteran makes big bet on bond-trading automation;Chris Concannon, former president of Bats Global Markets, makes switch to MarketAxess;Automated trading in debt markets is set to “explode” in coming years amid an influx of new entrants and a rotation away from stocks, according to a high-profile equities executive lured to corporate bond trading venue, MarketAxess.Chris Concannon, named chief operating officer last week, said the opportunity to participate in the structural shift was “a chance that comes along once in a career.”His switch to MarketAxess, a New York-based electronic trading platform which has a market capitalisation of $8bn, is a coup for the $50tn bond market, where deals have historically been negotiated privately and often over the phone.Tougher post-crisis rules on banks have curbed their traditional role as market intermediaries, trading and warehousing debt on behalf of customers. As they try to improve returns on bond trading, many banks have backed electronic venues or networks that match potential buyers and sellers — to limited success. Around a quarter of US corporate bond trading is executed electronically, according to Greenwich Associates, a capital markets consultancy.“It’s a market that deserves a lot of attention given its size and breadth and there’s a lot of evolution,” Mr Concannon told the Financial Times. “The most actively traded stocks are fixed income exchange traded funds (ETFs). There’s huge demand to trade the underlying [assets], using automated trading . . . the level of automation will explode in the years ahead.”His comments come after sharp market moves last month reignited the long-running debate over the role of high-frequency traders, which use high-speed algorithmic trading to execute deals across all assets. Last week JPMorgan argued it was their absence that contributed to volatility in US Treasuries over the holiday period.Mr Concannon started as a lawyer, then took senior roles at Nasdaq, electronic market maker Virtu Financial and then Bats Global Markets, which made him one of the equity market’s biggest names.At MarketAxess Mr Concannon will oversee day-to-day operations and corporate strategy. He hopes to apply his equities and tech knowledge to the company’s Open Trading platform, where all types of dealers and investors can mingle.The platform’s average daily volumes in the third quarter to September 30 surged 58 per cent year-on-year, to $1.4bn. It now accounts for 22 per cent of MarketAxess’s total volume, up from 12 per cent two years ago.Mr Concannon ascribed the evolution of the market, in part, to a new group of electronic market makers that rely on automation. “When I see newcomers to the market. that’s exciting to me . . . I’ve seen that before. When you think about the macro level, that there is a turn away from equities . . . ETFs will consume a lot of the capital.”MarketAxess “had not cracked” the retail market, he admitted, as individual investors’ orders are smaller than those of institutions.However automated traders were more prepared to break up their orders in favour getting the trade done more quickly, he argued.“If you look back in history the markets that have succeeded the most are the ones that have brought together institutional and retail investors in the same place,” he said.
5;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2019-01-07T13:19:34Z;Cboe’s Chris Concannon to join bond trading platform MarketAxess;;Chris Concannon, one of the best known executives in US equity and options industry, is leaving Cboe Global Markets to join MarketAxess, one of the world’s largest corporate bond trading venues.Mr Concannon will become chief operating officer at MarketAxess, which has a market capitalisation of $8bn, the company said on Monday.Mr Concannon joined Cboe as part of a $3.2bn deal in 2016 that combined Cboe, the US exchange best known for its Vix volatility products with Bats, which ended the duopoly of the once-dominant New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq in share trading. Cboe’s equity market value has surged since the deal and it is now worth $11bn.Cboe confirmed Mr Concannon’s departure. Ed Tilly, Cboe chief executive, will take over Mr Concannon’s role as president.“We’ve had a tremendous working relationship and I want to personally thank him for his contributions to Cboe and wish him continued success in his next challenge,” said Mr Tilly.Chicago-based Cboe also said it had promoted Chris Isaacson, chief information officer, to chief operating officer. Eric Crampton has been promoted to chief technology officer.
6;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2018-01-03T11:02:24Z;European bond trading volumes plunge as traders adjust to Mifid II;;Trading in European fixed income assets was exceptionally thin on Wednesday morning, as investors adjust to the continent’s largest regulatory shake-up for a decade.Mifid II legislation came into force on January 3 after almost a decade of development. The reforms, which are designed to improve transparency and competition in financial markets, require far more detailed reporting of trades.Brokers had predicted the changes could depress trading volumes throughout January as the reforms take effect, and data from Trax, a subsidiary of bond-trading platform MarketAxess, pointed to an immediate impact.As of 10am GMT, Trax had recorded just €8.6bn worth of trades in euro-denominated sovereign bonds, 24.5 per cent lower than the average over the last 30 days (which was already unusually low due to the recent holiday season).UK sovereign bond volumes were 11.4 per cent below their 30-day average, while sterling-denominated corporate bond volumes were 46.1 per cent below average.Euro-denominated corporate bonds were the only fixed income class trading around normal levels, with €760m worth of trades, 2.7 per cent higher than the recent average.Read (and listen to) more on the day of the Mifids:
7;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-12-06T08:00:56Z;Steinhoff plunges 60% after CEO resigns amid accounts probe;;Steinhoff’s shares and bond prices both plunged on Wednesday morning, after the South African retailer said its chief executive was resigning and that new information had surfaced regarding “accounting irregularities requiring further investigation”.The news of Markus Jooste’s resignation was announced after markets closed on Tuesday evening, and Steinhoff’s Johannesburg-listed shares fell up to 62 per cent at the start of trading on Wednesday, to R18 per share.Traders also sold the company’s debt, with prices for its 2025 eurobond dropping as low as 40c on the euro, according to data from MarketAxess. The bonds, which have the lowest investment-grade rating with Moody’s, had already been trading below par value since August, but the price dropped more than 40c on Wednesday morning.According to Markit, the data provider, 40 per cent of Steinhoff’s Johannesburg-listed shares were out on loan – an indicator of interest in short-selling the company’s stock – before Tuesday’s announcement. Over a quarter of Steinhoff’s Frankfurt-listed shares were also out on loan, Markit said. Short-selling is a bet that the stock price will decline.Earlier this year, it was reported that the prosecutor’s office in the German state of Lower Saxony was investigating current and former Steinhoff executives on suspicion of giving incorrect representations in accounts. Steinhoff — which is in the midst of an ambitious international expansion — had denied the allegations.On Tuesday Steinhoff said in a statement that it had approached auditing firm PwC to carry out an independent investigation after the new information about accounting irregularities came to light. It has delayed the publication of its audited 2017 consolidated financial statements, and is looking at whether financial statements from previous years will need to be restated.Mr Jooste’s resignation took effect immediately, according to Tuesday’s announcement, with supervisory board chairman Christo Wiese — the billionaire who is the group’s largest shareholder — taking over as executive chairman on an interim basis.As part of its push to become a global discounting group, Steinhoff has completed a series of high-profile international deals — including the purchase of struggling UK discount chain Poundland last year, Australia’s Fantastic, and the US furniture group Mattress Firm. It also spun off its African retail assets into a separate listed company earlier this year in a move to give it control of supermarket operator Shoprite.Last year Mr Wiese’s family investment vehicle borrowed €1.6bn from banks in order to buy 314m shares in a capital raising by Steinhoff to refinance loans that funded its acquisitions of Poundland and Mattress Firm. The vehicle pledged 628m shares, or 15 per cent of Steinhoff’s share capital at the time, as collateral for the loan, according to a regulatory filing.
8;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-10-09T03:01:16Z;Voice brokers fighting to survive Europe’s big shake-up;Mifid II’s sweeping new rules may imperil traditional deal negotiated over the phone;"Will the phone survive Mifid II? That is the question facing the world’s fixed income and over-the-counter derivatives markets — where brokers, banks and asset managers have historically relied on the spoken word to negotiate contracts that hedge against interest rate and currency risk.US regulators pushed more of these trades on to electronic trading venues after the financial crisis with some success, although the industry survived. But the arrival in January of a series of sweeping European market rules, known as Mifid II, is the latest threat.“Voice is not very compatible with what the regulators are trying to achieve,” says Nathaniel Lalone, a partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman, a law firm, adding that Mifid II is a “disrupter”.Legal & General Investment Management, the asset management arm of the UK insurer, last month offered an example of how the EU would like to see the OTC derivatives market evolve.The asset manager conducted its first inflation swap trade via Tradeweb, the fixed income electronic trading venue. LGIM sent out requests to banks connected to the venue for an electronic quote, received three prices in return, clicked a button and the trade was done.Mifid also mandates that details of swaps trades are reported to authorities and, if it is on a regulated trading platform such as Tradeweb, it is the venue’s responsibility to do so.For Philip Hunter, the head of rate trading at LGIM, avoiding the phone also means bypassing the risk that prices move while you are hanging on the line as dealers work out their quotes.“When it becomes a more level playing field and you can access other platforms, we get the benefits,” says Mr Hunter. “It takes 5-10 times that time to price a bilateral swap trade. [This route] meets best execution standards and obligations on reporting. It’s a significant benefit.”Obituaries for the OTC market have long been written and some of the industry’s key figures are sanguine about Mifid II, which has been sevenyears in the making and is designed to benefit users of capital markets by increasing transparency around pricing.They already have electronic venues that compete directly with MarketAxess and Tradeweb. Those that do not have more problems.“There’s a myth that there will be Armageddon for voice brokers because everything will go on exchange — that’s completely wrong,” says Shaun Lynn, president of BGC Partners, one of the world’s largest interdealer brokers. “If you’ve got the technology, like we have, it’s just the next step; or it’s a step change.”He, like others, doubt it will be possible to completely pull apart a market where deals executed on a computer are the result of lots of phone conversations.Some electronic market makers — who see Mifid as an opportunity to break into a market hitherto dominated by banks — worry that the wording in the new legislation is vague enough to ensure that little changes.Part of the regulators’ drive to have trades done electronically is to give customers a choice of quotes for prices on-screen. Yet some worry that two parties to a deal would still be able to negotiate terms on the phone or via chat message, and then put it through on a screen.Furthermore, regulators have granted a number of waivers for large trades above certain thresholds. Without the exemptions, traders fear a large transaction displayed on a screen would alert the rest of the market and the price would move against them.But the trade data will be publicly available only days or weeks later, meaning its use is limited. This, they argue, is at odds with Mifid’s grand aims. ClarusFT, a data provider, estimates that 75 per cent of the risk traded in the euro swaps market will remain “dark” for up to four weeks.The introduction of Mifid II also comes as bank capital rules introduced after the global financial crisis begin to shift the balance of power in the market from banks to the asset managers who need to conduct the trades.“The asset managers are the liquidity providers and liquidity takers now,” says Mr Hunter. And asset managers have large incentives to conduct their trades on regulated electronic venues, given it is the platforms that have the responsibility to report them.“Mifid II will drive a behavioural change,” says Scott Eaton, chief operating officer at MarketAxess Europe, the region’s largest corporate bond trading venue. “Many buyside institutions are looking at trading on a venue as a way around having to deal with reporting requirements and saving costs.”One consequence of Mifid II, he predicts, is that many larger trades will be broken up into smaller ones “but voice brokers will remain a key facilitator for trades of significant size”.But Mifid provides one more significant challenge. The rules require brokers to provide evidence that customers are getting the best prices for their tradesRussell Dinnage, an analyst at Greyspark Partners, a capital markets consultancy, notes Mifid II’s long-term aim is to turn more of the market electronic.“Somewhere along the line, trades need to be digitally recorded. The answer is not so simple . . . but banks need to ensure that if they are still transacting on a voice basis, it needs to be captured in some way.”From next year, picking up the phone won’t be quite so simple."
9;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The 4.2-cent decline made it the second-heaviest faller on the European market, while the company’s dollar-denominated bond maturing in 2022 took the bottom spot.The 2022 bond was trading at 92.3 cents on the dollar, also its lowest price since last December.Thousands of jobs in Canada and the UK have been put at risk by Washington’s decision to back Boeing in its dispute with Bombardier. Boeing alleges that Bombardier had been able to sell its C Series jets at below cost in the US because of unfair subsidies from the UK and Canadian governments.Bombardier is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and its shares will begin trading at 14.30 BST.Read more:
11;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-08-23T16:30:30Z;Venezuelan bonds drop on US trading ban report;;Venezuelan bonds slid on Wednesday on a report that the US government was considering banning trading in the securities by regulated financial groups.The potential restrictions, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, would cover US dollar denominated bonds sold by both the sovereign and the country’s state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA.A final decision would fall to US President Donald Trump, according to the report.The news sent a flurry of debts issued by Venezuela and PDVSA lower, with debts issued by the state oil group accounting for four of the five most heavily traded emerging market corporate bonds, MarketAxess data showed.PDVSA bonds that mature in November 2021 slid 2.5 cents to 37 cents on the dollar, near a low hit earlier this month after Venezuelan political opposition leaders were taken from their homes, according to MarketAxess. Roughly $3bn of Venezuelan sovereign debt due in August 2022 slid to 43.63 cents on the dollar, down more than a cent.US investment banks that act as the middlemen in the trades have started to put the bonds under heightened scrutiny in an attempt to avoid marring their reputations. Earlier this month Credit Suisse banned its traders from buying or selling Venezuelan sovereign bonds due in 2036 or PDVSA bonds maturing in 2022.
12;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-08-05T11:06:34Z;Amsterdam shines as financial groups seek EU access;Dutch city’s infrastructure and skilled workforce are a big attraction;Amsterdam is emerging as one of the beneficiaries as banks and traders search for a new base to access the EU when Britain leaves the bloc in 2019.Frankfurt took an early lead as an alternative to London, with many banks opting to site themselves close to the European Central Bank. But in the last two weeks there has been a rush of financial services companies turning to the Dutch city.MarketAxess and Tradeweb, two of the world’s largest fixed income trading venues, have been joined by MUFG, the Japanese bank, and possibly Royal Bank of Scotland’s NatWest Markets division. They may not be the last.Senior executives are going public on their plans because of the uncertainty over a transitional period to smooth the UK’s departure. British-based companies need to prepare if the UK crashes out of the EU in 20 months’ time without an agreement.MUFG and RBS would expand subsidiaries with EU licences allowing them to passport their services throughout the 27-country bloc. MarketAxess and Tradeweb have relied on the UK’s EU passport and so need to set up separate legal entities. All the moves are likely to involve only tens or hundreds of jobs, while each company’s biggest European operations will be in London.Even so, it has been a reminder of Amsterdam’s strengths. Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, says the bank’s Dutch licence is “purposed” for markets activity, whereas its Republic of Ireland licence is focused on retail and commercial banking. NatWest Markets focuses on trading foreign exchange, interest rates and fixed income.“We’re not just a banking community, we’re a very broad community. We’ve got a lot of independent groups that are competing with the banks. The infrastructure is pretty good. The digital telecommunications lines are fantastic,” says Mark Spanbroek, vice-chairman of the Amsterdam-based European Principal Traders Association, a trade group for high-speed electronic traders.Indeed, the city has a long trading history — it was the home of the world’s first stock exchange, and it created derivatives before the Tulip Mania of the 1630s. It is home to some of the world’s biggest and oldest high-frequency traders. Companies such as IMC and Optiver were pioneers in automated trading, and account for a significant portion of the daily volumes on global markets. ICE Clear Netherlands, the clearing house, will expand next year when it takes over the derivatives and commodities business of Euronext from France’s LCH.Executives also cite the outlook of the country’s regulators as a strong factor. The Netherlands has been one of the UK’s allies in EU financial policymaking, with a more liberal model to trading. Mr Spanbroek says they have a strong understanding of risk management.“By tradition their economic model is German but in other areas they are much more British, Atlanticist in outlook,” says Karel Lannoo, chief executive officer of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels. “On the financial services side they are more open to derivatives than Germany has ever been. The tulip market was in some ways the beginning of the derivatives market.”Other factors play highly in executives’ minds, such as widespread use of English, skilled local staff and its transport links. Amsterdam’s financial district is only 10 minutes from Schiphol airport, and an hour’s flight from London, Frankfurt and Paris. It is also close to Brussels. Eurostar will also begin running regular direct trains from London next year.Collectively they appear to be winning out over the incentives capitals such as Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin or Luxembourg have been offering.“We’ve found that all the regulators around Europe have been very open. We know them because of engagement on Mifid legislation. I wouldn’t single out the Dutch or anyone else,” says Enrico Bruni, head of Europe and Asia at Tradeweb.One London-based trading executive, who had been pitched by several European capitals keen to attract his business, says the Dutch offering had been less impressive than others, and suggested they would be charging higher fees than rivals. “But you go where your relationships are, where you already have business,” he says.RBS is also willing to overlook the country’s decision to enforce a stricter cap on bank bonuses than required by EU law, although Dutch ministers have offered to ease it for foreign banks if they employ at least three-quarters of their staff outside the country.“Amsterdam does have a different remuneration structure, but we believe it is the right place for our business,” says Mr McEwan.But it may be too early to declare Amsterdam as the chief beneficiary of business relocation from London. As Mr Lanoo points out, many big institutions have been silent on their plans. “I think we have to wait before hearing the big moves.”

Tradeweb is one of the world’s largest electronic venues for over-the-counter markets.A number of financial services businesses have opted for Dublin or Frankfurt as the location for their EU operations after the Brexit vote but the Dutch city is also emerging as a viable alternative. MUFG, the Japanese bank, has said it plans to choose the Netherlands as its new EU base for investment banking.Like MarketAxess, Tradeweb also cited a favourable attitude of the Dutch regulator towards trading venues.The City of London is by far the EU’s biggest hub for trading in shares and bonds, making it the home to dozens of specialist electronic marketplaces. During the past 15 years, dozens of trading venues have relied on the UK’s passporting rights for access to markets in Europe from London.Since Britain voted in June, 2016 to leave the EU, most have held off making a final decision on their plans, looking for clarity on the future legal relationship with the EU.“Tradeweb’s imperative has always been to provide our global client base with access to liquidity across a range of products,” said Enrico Bruni, head of Europe and Asia business at Tradeweb. ”“Post-Brexit, for many investors, uninterrupted access to that liquidity requires an independent and fully functional regulated entity within the EU”, he added.Pic: Reuters
14;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-07-26T22:33:31Z;MarketAxess defends its corporate bond trading status;CEO McVey says claims by rival Tradeweb are ‘not up to industry standard’;"MarketAxess, the largest corporate bond trading venue in the US, has hit back at accusations that it is losing market share to Tradeweb, saying its smaller rival is putting out numbers that are “confusing” the market.The broadside by MarketAxess chief executive, Rick McVey, in an interview with the Financial Times, comes after Tradeweb claimed it was the fastest-growing credit platform in the US and investors were spooked by disappointing MarketAxess trading figures for June.The coincidental pieces of news had sent MarketAxess shares lower earlier this month, but Mr McVey came out swinging against Tradeweb.“To me they are confusing the reader rather than clarifying the result and that is not up to industry standard,” he told the Financial Times.MarketAxess reports numbers that only include fully electronic institutional trades, whereas Tradeweb adds in trades conducted over the phone that are then entered into the electronic venue afterward, Mr McVey pointed out. The data are also sporadic; Tradeweb’s last release was from November 2016.“We have phone trade capture too but we would never confuse the audience by commingling that with our electronic trading business,” Mr McVey said.MarketAxess shares rose 2.8 per cent to $205.15 on Wednesday after the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1, down from the $1.11 for the first quarter but above the 88 cents reported for the same period last year, beating analysts estimates. Its stock price is up 39.6 per cent for the year.The company still dominates the landscape for electronic corporate bond trading in the US but competition has heated up in recent years with the arrival of a number of new, start-up venues, and older firms seeking to capitalise on investors’ growing adoption of electronic trading.Earlier this month, MarketAxess suffered a one-day fall of 5.9 per cent in its stock price when it reported June trading volumes for all credit products of $127.2bn. That was above the $126.5bn traded in May, but missed analysts’ expectations.Tradeweb claimed it captured 5.6 per cent market share of US investment grade credit trading in June, with more than $22.3bn in notional volume, up from $9.8bn in November. The purely electronic portion in June was also $9.8bn.“Over the past six months we have had terrific growth in our credit business,” Lee Olesky, chief executive of Tradeweb, told the FT after Mr McVey’s criticism on Wednesday.Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said he had seen an increase in Tradeweb’s market share but that stripping out voice processed trades, as well as retail trades done through Tradeweb Direct, leaves it closer to 1 per cent for the institutional business — a comparable number to those of MarketAxess.Mr Olesky added that volumes in this portion of the business have gone from $1.5bn in November 2016 to $4.5bn in June this year. Raymond James cites MarketAxess’s equivalent market share as 17.4 per cent.“I think the bigger picture point is that we are making significant progress in the credit space,” said Mr Olesky."
15;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-07-26T14:00:16Z;New Greek bond fifth most traded euro debt;;Greece’s new soon to be sold bond is already the fifth most traded euro-denominated sovereign debt in Europe, as Athens marks a successful return to the markets for the first time in three years this week.The high levels of trading in the so-called “grey market” – where investors can buy and sell bonds before they are issued – is a sharp change for Greece’s usually thinly-traded securities.Athens last issued a bond in 2014 and has been broadly locked out of the debt markets after seven years of bailouts. Most of its €320bn in external debt is held by creditors in the eurozone and International Monetary Fund rather than the private sector.Data from Trax, a subsidiary of MarketAxess, shows €160m of the €3bn 5-year bond changed hands on Wednesday. That makes it the fifth highest euro-denominated security and the 17th highest in Europe today.The bond will officially launch on August 1. It attracted 200 investors during its pricing yesterday, with half of its buyers swapping their holdings of an existing five-year bond after the government enticed investors with a €40m premium.Of the new investors buying back into Greece, the US money managers counted for 44 per cent of new money, followed by the UK (26 per cent), Greece (14 per cent) and France (7 per cent), according to data from Bond Radar. Hedge funds accounted for just under a third of the buyers (36 per cent).Greece’s Syriza government has hailed its market return as the latest step in a slow economic rehabilitation. The country is hoping to finally stand on its own feet after a near-decade long depression when its bailout expires next August.The yield on the new debt is also lower than the previous 2014 bond, at 4.625 per cent, and will encourage Syriza to plough ahead with more bond issues in the coming months.Still, the level of demand, which was lower than Greece’s previous foray into the markets in 2014, highlights lingering concerns over the country’s 180 per cent debt to GDP pile and fears that eurozone creditors will not afford major debt relief to Athens at the end of its bailout programme.“Just how convinced the market and indeed senior policy makers within the Greek establishment are about the stability and debt sustainability of the country remain mixed”, said Richard McGuire at Rabobank.Read more:
16;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2017-07-23T12:19:03Z;MarketAxess chooses Amsterdam as EU base after Brexit;Decision in part due to uncertainty over departure transitional period;MarketAxess, one of the world’s largest corporate bond trading venues, has chosen Amsterdam as its main base for the EU after the UK leaves the single market.The US group, which has a market capitalisation of more than $7bn, is to press on with plans to set up a regulated entity in the Netherlands, chief executive Rick McVey told the Financial Times.Although many banks and insurers have gone public with their post-Brexit plans, MarketAxess is the first trading venue to do so. For the past 15 years, the technology driven MarketAxess, which employs just 405 people globally, has used London as the launch pad for its EU operations. Its European customers traded on average nearly $1.5bn in credit products a day in the first half of 2017, more than double the volume two years ago.Mr McVey said the company’s decision was driven partly by the uncertainty around a potential transitional period to smooth the UK’s departure. Although UK ministers appear to be moving towards an agreement that favours business groups, British-based companies currently face disruption if the UK crashes out of the EU in 2019 without an agreement.“As time goes on, the momentum is now shifting towards contingency planning,” Mr McVey said. “We’re hoping [no transition deal] is not the case but we’re preparing for the worst. We mean to be fully regulated and ready to go well ahead of Brexit.”More financial services groups are going public with their plans to ensure they can continue to service EU clients. Last week, Bank of America said it had picked Dublin as the main base for its EU investment banking and markets operations, while it emerged that Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank will be beefing up operations in Frankfurt, the German financial capital.Mr McVey added that the choice of Amsterdam was driven in part by its location in the centre of the continent, and the “sophisticated” attitude of the Dutch regulator towards trading venues.The Netherlands had been one of the UK’s allies in EU financial regulation policymaking, sharing similar philosophies to oversee trading venues and intermediaries that make money from markets. Some high-frequency traders are also eyeing the Dutch city, which is already home to some of Europe’s biggest market makers, including Optiver, IMC and Flow Traders.Mr McVey said it was too soon to tell how many extra employees MarketAxess would need for its Amsterdam base, but the regulated business would have its own management team.The planning by banks, asset managers and trading venues has also been clouded by the need to devote additional staff to prepare for January’s Mifid II markets legislation. The rules are intended to stiffen consumer protection and inject more transparency into over-the-counter markets such as fixed income and exchange traded funds. “The timing of Brexit couldn’t be worse, when people are dealing with Mifid II,” Mr McVey said.MarketAxess also runs a trade reporting business in London, and is developing a new one to comply with Mifid II rules, which has already signed up nearly 90 institutional investors and investment banks. For the present it will remain in the UK. However MarketAxess is making plans for all its companies and may also replicate the UK business in the EU if required.
17;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2016-09-29T13:44:13Z;Options on Deutsche Bank securities pile up;;Deutsche Bank has been in the firing line this week and its stocks and bonds have swung wildly.As investors take bets on the fate of the German lender, open options on its securities have surged to an all-time high and trading in its bonds has rocketed.Speculation that the bank may request, or receive, state aid as it faces the prospect of a $14bn fine from the US Department of Justice has sparked the volatility.On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank shares had plunged as much as 26 per cent from their September high, touching a three decade low, but have since bounced back more than 8 per cent.Options give the holder the right to buy or sell a security at a fixed price by a specific date. The recent Deutsche Bank storm has driven the number of options open on Deutsche securities to a record 3.17m this month, according to Bloomberg data.Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Economics says:The renewed weakness in the troubled bank’s equity is the logical consequence of increasing uncertainty over mounting legal costs.Even if the [DoJ] fine is watered down in coming negotiations, it will increase DB’s need to tap investors for more cash. It also increases the risks that the bank’s CoCos—contingent convertible debt securities—could be triggered, essentially forcing equity conversion of parts of the creditor structure.The price of Deutsche Bank’s CoCo bond hit a seven-month low of 71.4 cents on the euro this week.But this volatility creates opportunities as well as risks, as Suki Mann at CreditMarketDaily notes:If need ever arose, a refusal to bail out Deutsche would unleash an almighty contagion impact that we would get that systemic financial crisis we’re fretting about, and which would plunge us into our darkest period yet… That is, Deutsche Bank is too big to fail.We understand the market’s reaction to the news – after all, we don’t like uncertainty – but the weakness should be seen as an opportunity.This is reflected in the surge in trading of Deutsche Bank’s CoCo bond. The total trading volume so far this month has topped €163m, according to Trax, a MarketAxess subsidiary. That’s more than six times higher than the €24.8m trading volume seen last month.The daily average trading volume this month is €8.6m. That’s the highest since the €12.2m daily average seen in February, when the Deutsche CoCo became the focus of market fears amid concerns over its capital levels.
18;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2016-09-28T13:02:31Z;MarketAxess muscles into US bond trading as banks retreat;Market share puts platform on par with biggest US debt dealers;Equity investors sense a winner from the upheaval transforming the business model of US corporate bond trading.Shares in MarketAxess, the largest electronic bond trading platform, have surged more than 50 per cent so far this year as Wall Street banks retreat from their dominant role as middlemen in buying and selling corporate debt under the cosh of a tougher regulatory environment.“There is a revolution going on,” says Rick McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, whose market capitalisation stands at $6.4bn. “The regulatory changes have been very positive for us.”As tougher capital standards weigh on the ability of banks to warehouse corporate bonds and facilitate transactions for investors such as asset managers, hedge funds and insurers, MarketAxess is encroaching on the hallowed turf of dealers — large orders known as block trades.MarketAxess’s investment-grade block trade volume climbed to $42.5bn during the second quarter of 2016, up from $26.7bn at the start of 2014. As a percentage of the whole market, it is now running around 9 per cent. That puts it on par with the biggest bond dealers in America, according to data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The transformation of the US market for trading debt sold by companies comes as new sales have ballooned. Buoyed by the era of ultra low interest rates, the corporate bond market has swollen from $5tn in 2008 to over $8tn today.While Wall Street banks have reaped the benefit of underwriting debt sales from companies, regulatory changes in the wake of the financial crisis are fundamentally altering the secondary trading model, says Mr McVey.“Most dealers welcomed technology for the smaller flow business but they very much wanted to reserve larger strategic business for themselves,” he says. “Some dealers are no longer trying to hang on.”MarketAxess has grown to account for over 13 per cent of all corporate bonds traded in the US, up from just 4.5 per cent in 2010.In an attempt to plug the gap left by banks’ retreat from supporting secondary market activity, MarketAxess launched Open Trading in partnership with BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world and a significant holder of shares in MarketAxess.This anonymous trading venue allows investors to trade directly with others, without a bank standing in the middle of the transaction. It differs from MarketAxess’s initial model, which retains the relationship structure between banks and clients, with quotes being requested by investors from a group of named dealers. “This is where I get excited,” says Mr McVey. “In the end you are going to see a much better market structure where anyone can trade with anyone. The dealers feared all-to-all trading two or three years ago. You are seeing them get a lot more comfortable.”Open Trading now accounts for 15 per cent of MarketAxess’s volumes, with a third being directly between non-banks as big name institutions like AllianceBernstein have joined BlackRock on the platform. A third of OpenTrading’s volume is also driven by the growth in fixed income exchange traded funds — companies that own bonds that investors can then buy shares in on an exchange. As shares are created or redeemed, the ETF buys and sells the underlying bonds. Fixed income ETFs have grown from around $60bn in assets in 2007 to over $600bn at the end of the second quarter 2016. For junk bonds, around 35 per cent of all trades done on MarketAxess come from ETFs, says the platform.“The ETF growth is fantastic for us,” says Mr McVey. “The more those assets grow, the better we do.”MarketAxess also faces competition, both from existing venues and from new arrivals sensing a growth opportunity. While a number of start-ups have launched in recent years, each claiming to provide a solution to the liquidity concerns of investors, few have made much headway.“It is impossible for anyone to show up late in the game and replicate what we have spent 16 years building,” says Mr McVey. Asked whether he sees any technology that might warrant acquisition of a smaller firm, Mr McVey is dismissive and argues that the cost of an acquisition might be better spent by MarketAxess simply building the technology itself. “We don’t feel like we are missing anything at the moment,” he says.One concern expressed by Mr McVey is that for all the growth seen in electronic bond trading, the market remains vulnerable to a sustained rise in yields. Thanks to regulatory changes, he says, dealers no longer have the capacity to act as a shock absorber during periods of market stress, by warehousing bonds and waiting for price volatility to ease. “The pace of change is improving but we still see too many examples of large investors and large dealers who have not fundamentally changed,” says Mr McVey. “If there is a credit shock I do not think the market is set up to handle it.”
19;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2016-01-13T12:49:26Z;Beer bonds: AB InBev’s bumper issue arrives;;The mega bond has arrived.The second-largest corporate bond ever is coming today as the brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev looks set to complete the first phase of funding its takeover of rival SABMiller, writes Gavin Jackson.The deal will be between $25bn-$30bn in size and will come in six tranches with maturities of three, five, seven, 10, 20 and 30 years, according to people familiar with the matter.Initial guidance for investors suggests the 10-year bond will be priced with a spread above US treasuries of 180 basis points, implying a coupon of about 3.9 per cent.The deal is being run by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Deutsche Bank.The merger between Belgium’s AB InBev and the UK’s SAB Miller to create the largest brewer in the world was agreed in November for a total price tag of $108bn.AB InBev lined up a two-year $15bn bridge loan and a $15bn one-year bridge loan with a one-year extension option as part of a larger $75bn financing package to complete the deal.AB InBev’s credit rating was lowered to A-/A-2 on news of the acquisition by the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s. The company already has $47bn of outstanding bonds and a net debt of 2.6 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, a rough measure of profit.The price of AB InBev’s outstanding bonds coming due in 2023 fell on Wednesday from 97 to 96 according to according to Trax, a subsidiary of MarketAxess.
20;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2015-07-01T08:35:01Z;Bond traders face pitfalls of technology;Tech glitches loom as fixed income embraces electronic trading;As anyone with a laptop, mobile phone or even battery-powered torch understands, technology can go wrong. And it is no different for the plethora of electronic trading venues that have sprung up trying to bolster the market for buying and selling of corporate bonds.In other, more established electronic trading venues like stock exchanges, strict, public protocols exist for dealing with technology problems. There are no requirements for public rule books in bond markets.A few established players have dominated for over a decade, relying on different, proprietary standards. But as banks and institutional investors look seriously at growing an electronic market place, a number of new platforms have set up shop, creating a network of different technology providers all plugging in to each other.“The market is going to get more interconnected with more platforms coming into the market,” says Sotiris Manderis, head of eCredit at HSBC. “We are not there yet, but rules around testing and about how system failures are dealt [with] need to become more formalised and strict.”Banks accept that tech glitches are part of the choice to do business in an evolving market place. But some are concerned that little has been done to prepare for when things go wrong, such as an outage on a platform, or trades being incorrectly executed. Relying on technology for transactions at rapid speeds means glitches will inevitably occur — the issue is how the market deals with them that is important, they say.“We take it as a foregone conclusion there will be technology issues in the future,” says the head of credit market structure at a large US bank. “But I don’t think we have given enough time, or formalised enough requirements, to ensure the new ecosystem we are building is robust. This issue on e-trading is what keeps us up at night.”So far, the issues experienced have been small. But some fear that if more and more trading goes through these platforms and the industry continues gravitating towards an electronic solution, then the problem will grow.“We shouldn’t wait for a big issue before adopting better standards,” adds the US bank’s market structure head. “We’re concerned that this could be a huge systemic issue in the market.”A recent example occurred on June 9, when established platform MarketAxess used a stale US Treasury feed that affected the calculation of bond prices for clients trading investment grade rate corporate bonds. Debt issued by leading companies is priced and traded over US government bond yields that match the same maturity.MarketAxess declined to say exactly how many trades were affected but a source close to the platform said it was about 150. The platform notified those affected and says it has since reconfigured its processes to guard against a repeat of the problem in the future.The MarketAxess platform represents about 16 per cent of the market for US investment grade corporate bond trading, with an average daily volume of more than $2.4bn in May, reflecting some 5,000 trades a day.A spokesperson for MarketAxess said: “The issue was quickly identified and rectified with affected participants.”Traders at banks say it highlights how operational risks are emerging, and it is part of a growing reliance on technology that leaves some unnerved. Unlike stock exchanges, Bond platforms aren’t required by regulators to have public rule books, so few do. Instead, trading is governed by private, bilateral agreements. For some, this is preferential.“I think it’s better off being handled bilaterally,” says a risk manager at a US asset management firm. “Dealers can either reach out to platform and vote with their feet or reach out to their clients to resolve it.”One trading head at a European bank also downplays the issue, saying its agreements with each platform have protocols for dealing with “erroneous” activity, where trades can be cancelled as a result. “It might not be perfect but we are certainly not on a trapeze without a safety net,” he says.But other banks complain that these broad-based terms are not enough, while platforms contest that it might be difficult to do much more.“It’s hard to be overly specific about what you will do in each scenario because you will be reacting to a technical issue and then trying to correct it appropriately,” says the general counsel for one of the established platforms.
21;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2015-03-01T05:46:49Z;Managers turn to dark pools to carry out trades;The usual middlemen have stepped back from the business;Asset managers need another way to trade bonds now that dealer banks have scaled back their operations. Fortunately, electronic platforms are rising to the challenge.Several electronic platforms — sometimes dubbed dark pools because they allow traders to buy and sell securities anonymously — have sprung up in the fixed income sector over the past few years, hoping to capitalise on the current liquidity crunch in the bond markets.Firms such as Investment Technology Group, Liquidnet, MarketAxess and SIX Swiss Exchange, Switzerland’s national stock exchange, have all bolstered their fixed income e-platform offerings.Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at US-based advisory firm Greenwich Associates, says: “Asset managers are feeling uncomfortable with the level of liquidity they are seeing from dealers. That’s why we have so many liquidity solutions coming to the market right now.”Traditionally, bond trading has taken place over the telephone between dealer banks and investors. However, because of stricter capital requirements imposed by regulators following the financial crisis, the usual middlemen in the bond market have stepped back from the business.Mitch Reznick, co-head of credit at UK-based Hermes Investment Management, says the “unintended consequence” of regulation is that it is becoming “more and more difficult” to trade large blocks of bonds. “You do worry that it’s become a ‘buy, but can’t sell’ market,” he says.A study by Greenwich Associates published in January found four in five fixed income institutional investors say executing corporate bond trades with a value of $15m or more is either “difficult” or “extremely difficult”. For this reason, Mr Reznick says, alternative sources of liquidity, such as dark pools, are welcome.The new fixed income e-platforms typically work by enabling investors to buy and sell directly with each other, or by offering a so-called all-to-all service, allowing anonymous trades between dealers, between dealers and customers, and between customers themselves. Some operate on a crossing basis, matching a seller looking to offload a bond with a buyer seeking that exact security.Frank DiMarco, head of fixed income electronic trading at ITG, which last year launched a fixed income dark pool called Posit FI, says that e-platforms offer bond investors many advantages, in addition to increased liquidity.“They allow clients to place larger orders without ad­versely affecting the bond’s price,” he says.“Benefits are found in the containment of information leakage, trading anonymously, and the potential to trade at a more advantageous price.”However, the growth of electronic platforms has not been without criticism.Chief among these is price. Traditionally, an asset manager might approach a number of dealers for a price for their bond.However, if two asset managers are left to negotiate this, it becomes harder to ensure they getting the best price, says Mr McPartland.Mr Reznick says there are also concerns about transparency, because on some e-platforms the market cannot see what the clearing prices are.The anonymity offered by e-platforms is also a worry, as well as a benefit, says Mr Reznick. “You don’t want a risk where you don’t get your bonds or your cash.”Mr McPartland says platforms which operate using a matching model — attempting to link a seller looking to offload a certain bond to a buyer who is looking for that very security — face a particularly tough task. He says even the most liquid corporate bonds, for example, In markets like corporate bonds, even the most liquid bonds “trade fairly infrequently”, he says, meaning which means the likelihood of matching a buyer and seller is slim.Richard Schiffman, open trading product manager at MarketAxess, which offers an all-to-all platform, says: “The challenge is finding a match among all the [bond] securities out there. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack.”Mark Pumfrey, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Liquidnet, which acquired fixed income platform Vega-Chi last year, says the firm expects a matching rate of about 5 to 6 per cent when it unveils its new fixed income dark pool this year, compared to the 10 per cent or more it matches in its equities version.This is why fixed income dark pools need scale, says Mr McPartland. E-platforms will need to attract a large number of users to make them workable and successful, he adds.“Electronic trading in fixed income will grow,” says Mr McPartland. “But with so many entrants, there is not enough room. Only a handful will make it.”
22;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2015-01-21T22:47:03Z;BlackRock and MarketAxess target Europe;US corporate bond trading venture expands into Europe;BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has brought its corporate bond trading venture with MarketAxess to Europe to try to offset the retreat of large investment banks from the market.The alliance has been in operation for a year in the US and is aimed at boosting trading, liquidity and risk management in US credit markets as money managers grow concerned about the difficult environment for trading fixed income securities.New regulatory and capital rules for banks since the financial crisis have begun to have an effect on market behaviour, which affects trading for asset managers like BlackRock, which has responsibility for $4.3tn of money.Banks have become less willing to provide live prices across markets given the higher cost of capital while financial reform has resulted in proprietary trading desks at Wall Street dealers being shut down, removing an important source of liquidity.At the same time the size of the market has continued to grow as expansionist monetary policies, especially in the US, have pushed investors to look to corporate markets for yield.“The liquidity challenge is more of a plumbing challenge than anything else,” said Richie Prager, global head of trading and liquidity strategies at BlackRock. “The [size of the] US credit market is rising so there’s no shortage of capital. The risk transfer mechanism is really gummed up.”The duo this week brought the partnership to Europe. Users of BlackRock’s Aladdin risk management system can access MarketAxess’s Open Trading network of more than 1,000 investor and dealers to access fixed income markets, including European corporate credit and emerging market debt markets. More than 7 per cent of trading in high-grade credit on MarketAxess now takes places through Open Trading compared to just 2 per cent a year ago.Its launch comes ahead of a likely overhaul of Europe’s credit market as new rules, within the Mifid II legislation, mandate more transparency and electronic trading.Rick McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, said the challenges for liquidity in credit in Europe were even more severe than in the US. “If you look at the last 3-4 years, lots of European issuers have been coming over to the market here [in the US] because of the depth and the lower transaction costs.”Aladdin is an investment management technology platform that tracks trillions of dollars of investments for clients including pension funds, central banks and sovereign wealth funds around the globe. Rather than creating another trading platform, it aggregates liquidity from existing venues.He pointed that there were two key differences between US and European markets. “European trading protocols have not been open to all market participants. As a result there’s a limited number of liquidity options for investors in the credit market. And secondly, European regulation has not required transparency in credit markets till now. Mifid II will change that.”To date, the electronic trading of corporate bonds remains piecemeal and concentrated in the execution of smaller transactions. MarketAxess is the dominant US platform, but its high cost of trading has long chafed with the big dealers.
23;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2014-11-04T20:00:59Z;Search for liquidity tests corporate bond market;As banks retreat amid volatile conditions, electronic platforms are focusing on larger deals;Prolonged droughts usually compel cities to invoke water restrictions and perhaps explore fanciful ideas such as cloud seeding. For Wall Street and the vast US corporate bond market, the current liquidity drought appears to have no solution, unless radical changes occur and technology dreamers make their mark.The recent surge in market volatility has underscored the retreat of banks from their traditional role as intermediaries for investors seeking to buy or sell corporate bonds. Tougher capital regulations have made banks less willing to hold inventories of bonds.Meanwhile, the size of the corporate bond market has exploded in recent years, as companies have taken advantage of low interest rates and investors have sought fixed returns, rather than to own equities.The nightmare that haunts regulators and asset managers is that during periods of turmoil, sellers of bonds, led by the $1.5tn of money that has poured into bond funds since 2009, will overwhelm the market, creating massive price dislocations and exacerbating losses for retail investors.James Camp, managing director of fixed income at Eagle Asset Management, says investors have changed how they buy bonds for their portfolios. Rather than owning a significant amount of one specific issue that would be difficult to unload, they focus on buying bonds across different issues sold by a company they like.“Structurally, the nature of the bond market has changed radically. These days a $20m block of bonds gets worked as an order,” says Mr Camp.Alarmed by the liquidity issue, the likes of BlackRock have pushed hard for market reforms, such as standardising bond issuance by companies at regular times of the year. Meanwhile, numerous start-ups plan to build electronic platforms that can replace human traders and sales staff at banks. “A seismic shift is occurring in the credit market and that is why we are seeing new ideas and capital being committed to the market,” says Richard McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, a trading platform.Electronic trading of corporate bonds in the US is dominated by MarketAxess, followed by Bloomberg and the likes of MTS Bonds.com, which was acquired by the London Stock Exchange’s fixed-income platform this year.While electronic trading is gathering pace, the holy grail resides in the execution of bond deals worth $5m and higher. While MarketAxess transacts two-thirds of overall trade volumes in sizes greater than $1m, the industry is focused on creating electronic venues that can fill the $5m sweet spot left by retreating voice-based dealers.Kevin McPartland, an analyst at Greenwich Associates, a consultancy, estimates that 16 per cent of institutional trading of investment-grade bonds is done via electronic platforms, but adds that the number of investors trading at least some of their bonds on screen has jumped to 80 per cent since 2009.“Finding liquidity for round-lot trades, especially those above $5m, is the problem big investors are keenest to solve and where most corporate bond platforms, both existing and new, are focusing their energy,” he says.Initiatives are cropping up. Tradeweb, a leading force in US government and mortgage bonds trading between banks and investors, has launched a platform for corporate debt with the backing of leading dealers.Other new platforms include Electronifie, Bondcube and proposals from Investment Technology Group and Liquidnet, which executes large block trades in equities. Recently, several Wall Street veterans started TruMid Financial, a fixed-income platform that is awaiting regulatory approval.“A lot of them look promising and their approaches are innovative,” says Mr McPartland. He adds that the market will probably evolve towards greater anonymous matching of orders, backed by algorithms that can find specific bond issues held by numerous investors. “There is a need to provide tools, so people can find bonds organically.”Banks are also teaming up with investors to work on a way to connect various platforms in an endeavour known as Project Neptune. Algomi, a company founded by former UBS trader Stu Taylor, also aims to help banks keep better track of the bonds they buy and sell.The big issue for entrants is how quickly they can gain a critical mass of dealers and investors willing to transact with each other and agree on specific modes of trading. Trading platforms also require constant technology upgrades. Incumbents such as MarketAxess are investing heavily and pushing new developments and trading protocols.A source of growth for MarketAxess has come from expanding its “all-to-all” market to 25,000 trades so far this year. This type of trading includes asset managers, dealers, hedge funds, retail bond trading desks and exchange traded fund providers sending in prices and transacting in real time with each other.
24;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2014-02-17T18:07:16Z;Goldman retreats from bond platform;;Goldman Sachs has quietly retreated from its electronic bond trading platform, in a move that highlights the challenges investment banks face in revamping their struggling fixed-income trading businesses.Banks including Goldman, Morgan Stanley and UBS had developed their own electronic corporate bond trading platforms in an effort to more efficiently match buyers with sellers of debt, and make money from facilitating the transactions.But data from 4,000 investment firms compiled by Greenwich Associates show that these alternative platforms – which include Bonds.com, BlackRock’s Aladdin, UBS PIN, Morgan Stanley’s BondPool and Goldman’s GSessions– account for only 1 per cent of market share.People familiar with Goldman’s plans now say that further development of its GSessions platform has been put on hold, after a last-ditch revamp late last year failed to bring in significantly more business from investors.Bond trading has for years been one of Wall Street’s biggest profit generators but new financial regulation and fundamental shifts in the way investors buy and sell debt have forced banks to reconsider how they make trades on behalf of clients.However, big investors have given these bank-run “single-dealer” platforms a collective thumbs-down, forcing banks to consider creating “multi-dealer” platform that would involve most of their rivals.According to the research, the MarketAxess electronic platform continues to dominate trading in corporate bonds, followed by Bloomberg.Market participants say that many components of the GSessions platform were innovative, but the bank failed to reassure investors sufficiently that it was not using data from the trading venue to inform its own team of traders and market-makers.“Clients are very concerned about sharing information, especially giving up information to people who can use that information to their disadvantage,” said a banker at a competing institution.A spokesperson for Goldman declined to comment.Goldman has a long history of developing technology and delaying its implementation – making it possible that GSessions could be revived or adapted for a new multi-dealer platform.Despite efforts to “electronify” the market for big bond trades in a similar way to the stock market, large trades of bonds remain dominated by “voice-brokered” transactions, where an investor calls up a dealer at a bank to make the trade.Bonds come in many maturities and types making them more difficult to trade electronically. Compounding matters is the fact that banks hold far fewer bonds on their balance sheets than they used to, and big investors have developed a tendency to hold debt in their portfolios for longer periods of time.“Single-dealer platforms will evolve from being focused on the execution of the trades to hubs of information,” said Stu Taylor, a former UBS trader who has founded Algomi, a start-up focused on new bond trading technology. “Execution will remain voice-based for the foreseeable future.”
25;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2014-02-17T10:54:45Z;Swaps market prepares for its big bang;;"The US swaps market is expected to begin a shift away from the predominance of telephone trading this week as it joins the 21st century in a move towards more tightly regulated electronic trading venues.The changes are being ushered in by global regulators in the wake of the financial crisis and come into effect on Tuesday, as trading of over-the-counter derivatives moves on to so-called swap execution facilities, or Sefs.Long viewed as a shadowy area of the financial market, OTC swaps trading has been dominated by large global banks and investors since its inception in the 1980s, but the collapse of some banks in 2008 revealed serious shortcomings within this bilateral system.The efforts of regulators led by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been to open up the swaps market to greater competition and price transparency. Last year, the credit risk between buyers and sellers of standard swaps was mutualised via centralised clearing houses, setting the foundation for rapid paced transactions on Sefs.While Sefs facilitate electronic and voice based transactions, many in the industry expect the share of computer driven transactions will quickly escalate from their current very low level.The biggest concern facing the market is whether banks, investors, clearing houses and operators of Sefs are ready for showtime.Jamie Cawley, chief executive officer at Javelin Capital Markets, says the mandated era of swaps trading on Sefs, “will be a bit more dramatic than people think”.He adds: “A number of market participants recognised long ago the inevitability of Sefs coming and have prepared for this. Others however have not.”Ahead of a hard Sef deadline, the CFTC has announced a number of temporary measures aimed at providing relief from possible last minute problems that could hamper an orderly start for Sefs.Lee Olesky, chief executive officer at Tradeweb, says: “It’s hard to measure readiness collectively across the market; there will be bumps in the road as the market makes the transition to Sef trading.”Meanwhile there has been a scramble among some clients to sign up for Sef access, particularly at Bloomberg, whose data terminal is ubiquitous across trading floors.“We are seeing quite a sizeable chunk of people coming on to the platform,” said Ben Macdonald, president of Bloomberg’s Sef. “The Sef is part of the terminal and it’s very integrated into our clients’ work flow.”For interdealer brokers used to high commissions from executing billions worth of notional derivatives over the telephone on behalf of banks amid a raucous trading floor atmosphere, the winds of change are certainly blowing.Michael Spencer, chief executive of ICAP, the biggest interdealer broker and which began in the 1980s with a specific focus on the then fledgling interest rate swaps market, is under no illusions that the old ways of doing business are ending.“The market in interest rate swaps is still predominantly voice brokered but it’s not where we see it in the longer run,” he says.ICAP, which has large electronic franchises in Treasury and currency trading, is expected to be more able than many of its rivals to weather the competitive landscape, as the likes of Bloomberg, Tradeweb, MarketAxess, the CME Group and start-ups vie for a slice of the swaps market.As swaps begin trading on Sefs, an early shakeout is expected among the 20-or-so competing platforms.Rick McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, says the proliferation of venues, all interpreting the rules differently, will cause problems for dealers and investors. The high cost of running a venue will also be significant, he adds. “By the end of the year we will be down to around seven venues,” he predicts.Mr Olesky says, based on the current size of the swap market, that it is hard to see demand for more than several Sefs across different asset classes.Tradeweb, which has been facilitating US electronic derivatives transactions for more than eight years, is looking to provide investors with ways to trade swaps on a Sef, from streaming prices, anonymous order books, to a request for quote function.“We are not picking a particular model, the market will evolve,” says Mr Olesky. “We have prepared ourselves for a number of outcomes and protocols given the different types of customers in the market.”Mr Cawley says: “Sef volumes will increase and it remains to be seen whether customers and dealers use voice or trade electronically on Sefs, but the market will be forever changed.”"
26;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2013-04-23T20:45:06Z;BlackRock and MarketAxess join forces;;BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, is teaming up with a widely used trading platform for US corporate bonds in an attempt to concentrate volume in one venue and offset the retreat of Wall Street dealers from supporting this $9tn market.The alliance marks the boldest initiative by key players in the corporate bond market to mitigate the withdrawal of support from Wall Street banks, operating under tighter capital standards in recent years.It sets the stage for BlackRock and MarketAxess to stake a major claim in a market that is on the cusp of being transformed by computerised trading.More than 1,000 asset managers, insurance companies and broker-dealers utilise the MarketAxess platform and this will now connect to BlackRock’s investment system, Aladdin, that hosts $14tn in client assets.Market Axess says that it accounts for the majority all corporate bonds traded electronically, but that figure represents only 13 per cent of overall daily volume in the US market. BlackRock said that clients of its Aladdin systems were responsible for around 30 per cent of daily trading volume in corporate bond markets.The need for a centralised venue that concentrates trading volume has animated investors for some time as the retreat by Wall Street banks has made it harder to actively buy and sell large amounts of debt.“The liquidity challenge is alive and well,” said Richard Prager, head of trading and liquidity strategies for BlackRock. “Ultimately, a more open trading network will be successful. What we are doing is stating this is the platform with a choice of many trading protocols that will be a more meaningful liquidity pool for the market.”Richard McVey, chief executive officer at MarketAxess said: “Dealers still play a critical role in the future of the corporate debt market, but institutional investors need a new solution to complement the role of dealers.”In recent years, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS have launched electronic trading systems for their clients, while platforms such as Bonds.com, Bond Desk, and TradingScreen have sprung up to try to become a focal point for trading bonds.Complicating the path to a fully electronic marketplace that is comparable to equities is the unique nature of corporate bonds. Unlike a common stock, there are thousands of individual bond issues, that has created a fragmented marketplace.“To have these two heavyweights join forces and look to concentrate liquidity in one place is a positive development for the fragmented corporate bond market,” said Will Rhode, principal at Tabb Group.This comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether regulation could nudge the corporate bond market in a direction that would cut trading costs for investors. At a roundtable earlier this month, the commission floated a number of ideas designed to improve price transparency and liquidity, although industry players warned against imposing one-size-fits-all rules that might disadvantage big investors trying to exit large bond positions.Additional reporting by Stephen Foley
27;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2013-04-08T17:29:09Z;US corporate debt activity at new low;;Activity in the US corporate bond market has plunged to a new low, raising questions over its ability to absorb any change in investor sentiment after several years of strong performance.The percentage of the value of the high-grade corporate bond market that turns over each year, through sales in the secondary market, has fallen from close to 100 per cent before the financial crisis to less than 73 per cent, according to figures compiled by MarketAxess from Trace data.The rolling 12-month turnover is now lower even than it was at the depths of the crisis when trading froze in many parts of the financial markets.Fund managers have expressed concerns about the falling activity, which they blame in part on post-crisis reforms that have curtailed Wall Street’s ability to act as a middle man in bond trades.Higher capital requirements and the Volcker rule banning proprietary trading have helped push dealers’ inventories of bonds lower.Other factors that are playing a role include the rise of “liability-driven investment” strategies, under which pension funds lock up longer dated bonds to match specific future payouts, and low market volatility.Dealing firms have laid off fixed-income trading staff as profitability has fallen.Alexander Young Sedgwick, head of research at MarketAxess, said the work of fund managers who want to rebalance their bond portfolio has become “incrementally harder” as market turnover has reduced.Investors have put record sums into bond funds and market strategists have begun debating the potential effects of a “great rotation” out of bonds and into equities, should interest rates start to rise.“It raises the question of whether the market has sufficient liquidity to handle that and how expensive it is going to be,” said Mr Sedgwick.Bob Smith, chief investment officer at Sage Advisory Services, a fund manager in Austin, Texas, said a turn in the bond market would be the first test of liquidity since the Dodd-Frank reform laws.Dealer inventories are now less than a quarter of the $235bn peak reached in 2007, according to Federal Reserve data.“Do dealers have the balance sheet to hold significant amounts of inventory and are they holding it for a sufficient length of time?” asked Mr Smith. “We will require it to facilitate trading in the those dark down days.”A Securities and Exchange Commission meeting next week will address price transparency, liquidity and trading activity in the bond market, as the regulator considers whether to introduce reforms to the market’s structure. New electronic bond platforms, including MarketAxess, Bonds.com and TradingScreen, are springing up to match buyers and sellers without Wall Street market makers.
28;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2012-11-02T19:02:00Z;MarketAxess to double size in Europe;;MarketAxess, the US owner of an electronic platform for trading corporate bonds, is more than doubling the size of its operations in Europe ahead of new rules bringing transparency to bond trading on the continent.The company is planning to acquire Xtrakter, a financial market data group owned by the settlement services group Euroclear, for $42m in cash. The price is about 1.8 times the company’s expected revenues this year.The deal, announced to Xtrakter’s 70 London-based staff on Friday morning, reflects coming changes to the fixed income markets as the EU rolls out new regulations in the aftermath of the credit crisis.The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II) mandates “consolidated tapes” to record bond trades by 2014, and MarketAxess chief executive Rick McVey said Xtrakter was positioned to be a leading player in data reporting.“A big part of the appeal of the acquisition is thinking forward to expanding services in keeping with regulatory proposals calling for more transparency in fixed income and reduced settlement times,” Mr McVey said.Xtrakter will apply to supply trade data under the “approved publication arrangements” envisioned by Mifid II. It also sees opportunities to provide trade matching services to speed up settlement times, as Europe moves to a two-day settlement cycle.Euroclear, meanwhile, is focusing on investment opportunities arising from rules mandating the clearing of derivatives previously traded over the counter, and has launched new products to help trading groups manage new collateral requirements. The company agreed to buy Xtrakter four years ago from the International Capital Market Association.“Post-acquisition, we will continue working with Xtrakter and MarketAxess to deliver further transparency and efficiency to the international capital markets,” said Tim Howell, chief executive of Euroclear.Nasdaq-listed MarketAxess has 30 employees in London out of 240 worldwide and receives about 10 per cent of its revenues from Europe. The company announced third quarter results on Friday, showing revenues up 3.6 per cent to $48.3m, as it expanded its estimated market share of US high-grade bond trading from 11.6 per cent to 12.5 per cent, based on Trace volume data. Rising costs meant net income was essentially flat at $13.5m.The Financial Services Authority will have to bless the acquisition of Xtrakter, which is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2013.
29;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2012-03-28T19:06:25Z;Bond traders switch to electronic processing;;"Electronic processing of bond and other fixed-income trades is surging globally as traders seek to reduce the risk that their counterparties will go bust.The jump is taking place as banks prepare for a series of new rules demanding transparency for the formerly opaque market.Automation of fixed-income trades jumped 21 per cent in 2011 compared with 2010 globally, according to Omgeo, a trade processing company.There was a large jump in automation of trading in wholesale funding markets, which includes complex securities, it added.That included an 85 per cent jump in automation in the Americas and a 69 per cent jump in Asia. Europe leads in automation of fixed-income trading and saw slight growth last year.Unlike equities and foreign exchange, where electronic processing of trades is the norm, most fixed-
income trades in the US are processed manually.But increasing numbers of large dealers of bonds and other fixed-income products are turning to electronic trading in order to reduce the cost of holding large inventories of bonds, which carry higher capital charges under new Basel III rules.Goldman Sachs is exploring automation of some fixed-income markets and other banks, such as UBS, have already launched platforms.Although banks are fighting Dodd-Frank regulation, they believe that they can profit from the shift.Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, recently predicted “record profits in the next year or two”.MarketAxess, an electronic bond trading platform that works with banks, saw its market share of all bond trading rise from 8 per cent in 2010 to more than 11 per cent last year.Brokers have been under intense pressure from customers and regulators to become more transparent.Following the financial crisis in 2008, trading in markets such as credit derivatives virtually halted on fears that trades would fail if a counterparty blew up.That led to new rules in the Dodd-Frank Act that required that more derivative trades be handled by a central counterparty and that trading become more automated and electronic.In recent months, there has been renewed scrutiny on brokers’ back-office functions following the collapse of MF Global and the discovery that $1.6bn in customer funds had not been properly accounted for.Low rates are also playing a role in rising demand for automation.Near-zero US Federal Reserve interest rates have allowed buyers in manually processed trades to delay delivering the cash to complete a trade since they are not giving up any income.The New York Federal Reserve imposed a penalty earlier this year on failures to deliver mortgage-backed securities. Such failures hit their lowest level since 2009 in March, according to Fed data."
30;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US dealers desert corporate bond market;;US corporate bond issuance and trading volumes have rebounded sharply this year, but the presence of large Wall Street dealers continues to shrink.Dealers have traditionally held inventories of corporate bonds to facilitate trading for their clients. Over the past six months, they have cut sharply these holdings ahead of tighter constraints on their capital and the divestment of proprietary trading desks, both the result of emerging regulatory frameworks such as Basel III and the ‘Volcker rule’.Long-term corporate bond holdings by primary dealers hit a fresh low of $45bn in the week ended January 25, according to Federal Reserve data., Ahead of the financial crisis, dealers held more than $200bn of corporate debt.That has resulted in poorer market liquidity, because trade sizes have dropped and spreads between offers to buy and sell, a key measure of the cost of trading, have risen, according to figures compiled by MarketAxess, which operates an electronic bond trading platform.Fears over Europe’s debt crisis have eased, luring investors back to bonds with the higher yields than US Treasuries. Risk premiums, or spreads to Treasuries, on investment-grade rated corporate bonds have tightened to about 200 basis points from 234bp so far this year.The scale and speed of the rally has surprised some observers. Some market participants say the lack of dealer support is helping to accelerate this year’s corporate bond rally as previously high inventories were sold into a bullish market by dealers taking profits.“Dealer inventory serves as a buffer when the market is rallying. In the current environment, dealers may not be able to meet demand immediately, which is exacerbating volatility on the upside,” said Peter Toal, head of the leveraged finance syndicate for the Americas at Barclays Capital.“Similarly on the downside, when the market is trading lower, it will drop more precipitously.”The dealers’ lack of support for secondary trading means the sale of new debt issues have become more attractive for investors seeking large exposure to credit.“It has been challenging to source secondary paper,” said Lisa Coleman, head of global investment grade corporate credit at JPMorgan Asset Management. “As a result, we rely on the new issue calendar to ensure that we keep invested as we receive inflows.”
31;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2012-01-20T11:56:44Z;MarketAxess wins Brazil approval;;MarketAxess, a US operator of corporate and government bond trading platforms, has won approval to trade Brazil’s local currency debt as the Latin American country’s high yields and attractive growth prospects lure more investors.The Nasdaq-listed platform said on Thursday it had received authorisation from Brazil’s central bank and securities commission, CVM, to offer electronic trading of government and corporate debt denominated in reals.“We believe access into this marketplace represents an important development for our emerging market clients, eager to participate in one of the world’s fastest growing local currency debt markets,” said Kevin McPherson, MarketAxess’s head of sales.“We currently have 10 dealers prepared to provide liquidity in Brazilian local currency bonds on the platform and expect that number to grow,” he said, adding that he had seen strong interest from Europe and North America.MarketAxess is preparing to become a “swap execution facility”, a category of trading venue under debate by US regulators that would serve as a neutral site for over-the-counter derivatives trades in the US.However analysts have raised concerns over sufficient liquidity in the market to sustain fierce competition from rival execution providers such as Tradeweb, Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, interdealer brokers such as Icap, BGC Partners and GFI Group, and a host of independent trading firms and marketmakers.Mr McPherson estimated the average daily volume in the Brazilian local debt market at about $5.1bn.Recent volatility in global markets, which caused Brazil’s real to plummet almost 20 per cent against the dollar between July and October last year, has sapped demand for local currency-denominated emerging market debt as investors have flocked to the dollar.However, the market for local currency debt in Brazil is still expected to continue to grow as the nation’s companies look for alternative sources of funding, especially given the underperformance of the domestic equity market.According to Dealogic, issuance in Brazil’s domestic corporate debt market hit an all-time high in 2011, increasing 16 per cent to $9.4bn.Steady economic growth of about 3 per cent last year, a rapidly expanding middle class, political stability and the prospect of further upgrades by rating agencies has made Brazilian debt increasingly desirable.With Brazil’s benchmark interest rate still above 10 per cent, even after Wednesday’s 50 basis point cut, the bond market offers investors some of the highest yields in emerging markets.
32;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2011-12-04T19:17:09Z;Broker-dealers eye common technical standards;;Many of the world’s largest broker-dealers are working to agree technical standards for open-source software in a move that could help open electronic trading in fixed-income markets to new entrants.Discussions between a group of 13 banks, which include Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, over IT standards are at an advanced stage with an announcement expected early in the new year. They hope the development will cut rising IT costs and kick-start changes similar to those that have transformed equity trading in recent years.The move towards common standards for trading for government and corporate bonds comes as the industry prepares for a sweeping overhaul of derivatives and fixed-income markets.In the wake of the financial crisis, global regulators are looking to force more transparency on markets. They have mandated pushing more trading of fixed income and derivatives on to approved electronic trading platforms that operate similar to exchanges, with trades cleared by a central counterparty.Regulators in Europe have also been keen to open the market to new entrants. The European Commission’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive of 2007 brought new entrants to the equity market, which lowered fees but also fragmented the market.In Europe electronic government-bond trading, as well as fixed-income derivatives trading, is largely conducted on a handful of inter-dealer platforms.Up to 40 venues, including Bloomberg, Tradeweb and interdealer brokers such as Tullett Prebon and BGC Partners, are expected to convert their trading platforms to comply with the new rules, allowing them to also offer electronic fixed-income derivatives trading.However some regulators have worried that there will be fewer entrants than forecast as high IT costs dissuade brokers from using new venues.Historically each venue has created its own proprietary protocol, or software language, and each investment bank has to create a custom-built platform to connect to the venue.It costs roughly five times more to connect to a bond market platform than to an equity trading platform.Brokers, under pressure to cut costs, are pushing for an industry standard that cuts the amount of specialist software coding. The industry push has received support from many of the fixed income trading venues set to adjust to qualify for the new electronic platforms, including MarketAxess, Tullett Prebon and GFI Group.Regulators are also keen to seen a common industry standard as they create electronic audit trails to monitor markets.The industry push has received support from many of the fixed income trading venues likely to become SEFs and OTFs, including MarketAxess, Tullett Prebon and GFI Group. Regulators are also keen to seen a common industry standard as they create electronic audit trails to monitor markets.The standard is based on the Fix protocol that is used for carrying data and trading messages around the world’s equity markets and is being carried out by Etrading Software, a UK consultancy.The new working group is aiming for ratification of the protocol for fixed income by the end of the year. The other broker-dealers in the group are: BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale and UBS.
33;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2011-11-17T21:44:11Z;Jefferies sells off on funding concerns;Investors cheered by positive economic data;Jefferies plumbed new year lows on Thursday as bond traders sold the investment bank’s debt. Shares closed down just 2.2. per cent to $10.09 but earlier fell as low as $9.50, the first time the stock has fallen below $10 since November 10, when analysts highlighted the size of the bank’s exposure to eurozone sovereign debt.Jefferies has since taken steps to show its eurozone positions are manageable, halving its exposure in a single morning of trading at one point. But Thursday’s sell-off appeared to be linked to concerns about how the company funds itself.At 4pm, Jefferies’ benchmark bond, expiring in 2018, yielded 856 basis points more than US Treasuries of similar maturities, an increase of the spread by 135bp over the course of the morning, according to MarketAxess data.Better than expected unemployment data – new claims fell to their lowest in seven months– kept the S&P 500 steady in the morning session despite a renewed spike in eurozone bond yields. But just before 12.30pm, the benchmark index tumbled 25 points in a matter of minutes, with traders variously blaming a breach of technical levels or deadlock in Congress’ budget super committee.The S&P 500 closed off 1.7 per cent to 1,216.15, once again dashing bullish investors’ hopes that US markets can break free from eurozone shackles.”Europe has been driving the market for a long time, and it will be driving the market for a long time to come,” said Channing Smith, a fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent, with investment banks hard hit. Goldman Sachs fell 3.5 per cent to $92.30, and Morgan Stanley was off 3.6 per cent to $14.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 11,770.80, but the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2 per cent to 2,587.99, as poor results from data storage company Netapp weighed on tech stocks.Netapp slumped 12.3 per cent to $35.64 after lowering guidance for the current quarter. The data-storage products maker blamed “unexpected weakness” at nine large accounts, and some analysts gave management the benefit of the doubt.“In our view, NetApp’s woes seem to be macro and competitive in nature and not due to execution mis-steps,” JPMorgan analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote to clients.But fears of falling demand for storage products hit related stocks, with hard disk drive manufacturer Western Digital off 5.8 per cent to to $25.26 and semiconductor supplier SanDisk Corp off 3 per cent to $49.52.Applied Materials fell 7.5 per cent to $11.53, despite unveiling solid profits of 34 cents a share in the third quarter.Orders from solar panel manufacturers for the company’s semiconductor products tumbled almost 75 per cent quarter-on-quarter to just $86m, forcing the company to lower forecasts for the current quarter, as solar firms cut back on expansion.Stephen Chin at UBS said Applied’s recent acquisition of Varian, another semiconductor manufacturer, could lead to a spike in implanter sales offsetting lower solar and display sales in 2012.Sears Holding Corporation dropped quickly after the bell, as the department store chain announced third-quarter losses, excluding some items, of $2.57 per share, an increase of almost 50 per cent compared to the loss for the same period in 2010.Shares recovered slightly but closed down 4.6 per cent to $65.19.Perry Ellis International saw its market capitalisation fall by more than one-third to $13.70 after it slashed full-year earnings per share guidance to $2 per share, compared to analyst expectations of around $2.50. The fashion retailer blamed heavy spending on promotions, which had not resulted in the expected increase in sales.MeadWestvaco was the stand out performer in the S&P 500, up 5.9 per cent to $29.51 after announcing it will spin off its consumer and office products unit and merge it with ACCO Brands in a transaction valued at about $860m. Shares in ACCO rose 26. 4 per cent to $8.80.CF Industries Holdings fell 10.2 per cent to $149.96, and Mosaic tumbled 7 per cent to $50.76, as falling corn prices raised fears that demand for fertiliser will far.“The perception among investors is that as the price of corn drops farmers cut back on fertiliser use,” said Colin Isaac, chemicals analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Although that does not always turn out to be the case, but fertiliser stocks are highly correlated to the corn price.”AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 5.5 per cent to $1.72, after hitting an 8 year intra day low of $1.63. Bankruptcy fears spiked again, on reports that American did not plan to restart negotiations with its pilot union, and chances recede of a deal to rein in costs.
34;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2011-11-03T17:43:26Z;Market prepares for transparency;The industry has not been idle ahead of changes to trading and reporting rules;The derivatives industry in the US is on the cusp of a new era with the major players embracing key elements of reform ahead of final rules under the Dodd Frank Act emerging in the coming months.The key areas of reform involve the clearing the bulk of over-the-counter derivatives, mandatory post-trade reporting and the trading of standardised derivatives on Swap Execution Facilities or exchanges.While final rules are still being written and will not emerge until later this year and into 2012, the major players in OTC derivatives, global banks, inter-dealer brokers and providers of electronic trading platforms have not been idle.The big dealing banks are jockeying for position in spite of the likelihood that greater transparency in swaps trading will reduce revenues.“We have put a lot of resources toward making sure we will be ready to clear and electronically trade derivatives when the rules are finalised,” says Jon Kinol, global head of rates at Credit Suisse.“Liquid sectors of fixed income markets will trade electronically, but the less liquid areas will continue rely on human interaction,” adds Mr Kinol.Kevin McPartland, director of fixed income research at Tabb Group says a recent survey of the industry revealed that the vast majority of top and mid-tier dealers told the US based Consultancy they are ready for the new rules and waiting to see the final guidelines.“Despite the unknowns, complexities and costs, the dealer community feels that it is ready for change,” says Mr McPartland. “Yes, lobbying will continue on both sides and politics will persist, but the dealer community sees the advantages of a mostly cleared swaps market.”But given the potential for the rule making process being delayed well into 2012, there is some concern that preparing for change may prove costly.“There is a lot of industry preparation taking place, but market participants and potential SEFs face an interesting catch 22, in that there are concerns they may go down the wrong path before the rules are finalised,” says Sonali Das Theisen, director in credit trading at Barclays Capital.“A fair amount of CDS index trading is now electronic, whereas single names are lagging as the industry waits to see how the SEF rules are finalised,” she adds.In spite of concerns about final rules for transacting swaps being too strict the derivatives industry is making strides in terms of clearing, building infrastructure and setting in place electronic trading systems.“Electronic trading is accelerating ahead of the final rules being written by regulators,” says Lee Olesky, chief executive officer at Tradeweb. “Our business model is benefiting from the prospect of swaps trading in a regulated environment and on a platform that is transparent and open to investors.”Tradeweb recently announced a 90 per cent increase in notional trading volume on its global multi-dealer-to-client interest rate derivatives platform for the third quarter of 2011 versus the same period last year.Tradeweb, Bloomberg and MarketAxess, who each support dealer to client trading in derivatives have all tested their platforms with trades via dealers and institutional clients that are seen being ‘Sef’ compliant under the current proposed rules.Rick McVey, chief executive officer at MarketAxess, a platform for trading derivatives, told a recent conference on Sefs: Trading technology is ready today. Many of us have critical mass in our networks, we have 900 institutions firms and 80 dealers, similar to competitors.”At the same conference, Jeff Gooch, chief executive officer at MarkitSERV, which processes OTC trades between users, stressed the importance of managing the introduction of new rules.“Final rules are needed so we can tweak existing platforms and test new systems,” he says. “Most participants say they need two months for testing”.Among the leading inter-dealer brokers or IDBs, such as Icap, BGC Partners, Tradition, GFI and Tullett Prebon, the electronic trading of swaps in Europe is accelerating and these intermediaries for banks are positioned to introduce dollar Sefs once the rules are clarified.“We are already well placed to take up the new regulations and so technology will not be a problem,” says Ron Levi, chief operating officer at GFI. “We have very agile development teams across the IDBs but clarity around the regulation is needed.”Mr McPartland says Tabb’s survey of the industry showed: “There is some consensus among those surveyed that platforms with an already liquid electronic cash market have an advantage.”He adds: “This bodes particularly well for BGC Partners, Bloomberg, ICAP, MarketAxess, Tradeweb and at least one new SEF entrant.”The clearing of swaps is also rising with more trades being placed in centralised counter parties, or CCPs. While the business is largely bank to bank and dominated by LCH for interest rate swaps and Ice Trust for credit derivatives, the CME said it set monthly clearing records in September for both products.
35;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
36;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2011-10-03T22:42:10Z;Quick View: Swaps industry reveals frustration;;Interdealer brokers are renowned for not holding back their punches and that was well advertised at the second annual gathering of the Wholesale Markets Brokers Association, Americas (WMBAA) in New York on Monday.Interdealer brokers such as Icap, BGC Partners, Tullett Prebon, Tradition and GFI will take a leading role in running swap execution facilities. These are the new trading venues for swaps that are designated under the Dodd-Frank act. Also, electronic trading platforms run by Tradeweb, MarketAxess and Bloomberg are also likely to be at the forefront of the looming SEF era.A year ago, when the WMBAA held its inaugural gathering in Washington, its members were mainly focused on informing regulators and politicians about the beneficial role played by interdealer brokers in over-the-counter derivatives markets.At that juncture, no one knew how the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission, in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission, would interpret Dodd-Frank and write provisional rules governing the trading of swaps on an SEF.After 12 months of proposed rules, public comment and delay, there is not only a palpable sense of frustration at the slow pace of formalising the inner workings of Dodd-Frank, there is also plenty of opposition to the approach being taken by Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC.The tussle between the swaps industry – and make no mistake, the views from members of the WMBAA chime with those of the big swap dealers, who are happy to sit in the background on this – and Mr Gensler revolves around how transparent trading in OTC derivatives should be once swaps are centrally cleared and executed over a SEF.Mr Gensler, who gave the keynote speech at Monday’s conference, reiterated his stance on transparency under Dodd-Frank.“When markets are open and transparent, price competition is facilitated and costs are lowered for companies and the people who buy their products. In addition, transparent markets are safer and sounder for all participants,” Mr Gensler said.“There are those who might like to roll them back and put us back in the regulatory environment that led to the crisis three years ago,” said the chairman. “But economists have agreed for decades that transparency in markets actually reduces costs. Furthermore, we’re hearing from a growing number of market participants – including people in this audience – who have said they would like to lower regulatory uncertainty and get going on reform.”But the leading interdealer brokers believe the CFTC is pushing too hard with a prescriptive approach that mirrors the way it regulates listed exchange-traded derivatives.This, they argue, stands to impair liquidity and potentially even send activity offshore from the US if other regions adopt easier rules.At a panel discussion on SEFs, Chris Ferreri, managing director at Icap, highlighted the mobility of the OTC world when he said this is a “very portable marketplace” and “with a click of a mouse, you can set up trading systems elsewhere”.Michael Gooch, the chief executive officer at GFI, said the risk of firms and swaps trading moving offshore cannot be dismissed and that the real danger is the death of liquidity.“The risk will go way beyond moving offshore,” Mr Gooch said. “It is the drying up of liquidity.”A much more likely scenario is that the market will adjust to a new regulatory reality and the trading of swaps will more likely follow what has been seen in equities over the past decade, with big swap trades being broken up into smaller parcels, resulting in more trades over time.For all the frustration and wrangling that will undoubtedly unfold ahead of the finalisation of rules for SEFs next year, the big members of the WMBAA are at least in the pole position. Once the rules are finalised, these players will be enshrined and, moreover, have the power to ward off new arrivals.As Mr Gooch put it, he expects “the first 10 to 15 SEFs out the door will own this business”.
37;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2011-09-15T00:39:47Z;Broker-dealers launch OTC standards push;;Thirteen of the world’s largest broker-dealers have joined an industry-wide push to agree technical standards for the trading of interest rate and credit default swaps in a move they hope will increase liquidity and cut IT costs for trading in the over-the-counter derivatives.The group of 13 banks, which includes Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, has formed the Fixed Income Connectivity Working Group to define open technology standards as the market prepares for a deepening push into electronic trading in fixed income.The G20 group of leading economies has pushed for more over-the-counter derivatives trading to be conducted on electronic trading platforms as part of tighter safeguards of the global financial system. Sweeping financial regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the impending review of Mifid in Europe are set to create approved electronic venues for fixed income trading – called “swap execution facilities” in the US and “organised trading facilities” in Europe.Up to 40 venues, including Bloomberg, Tradeweb and interdealer brokers such as Icap and BGC Partners, are expected to convert to these platforms to meet the new rules. However, each of those venues historically has had its own proprietary protocol, or software language, and each investment bank has to create a custom-built platform to connect to each venue.While there have been some swap market initiatives to define technical industry standards for post-trade services, there has been no equivalent industry initiative for technical standards covering pre-trading.The industry push has received support from many of the fixed income trading venues likely to become SEFs and OTFs, including MarketAxess, Tullett Prebon and GFI Group, because best practices are an integral part of the new technical standards, rather than an addition to them.Global regulators and authorities are laying down standards covering trading of over-the-counter derivatives but have not mandated specific rules covering agreed computer language. However, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US Securities Exchange Commission and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association are understood to be following the developments.The work has been carried out by Etrading Software, a UK-based financial technology consultancy, and is based on the Fix protocol that is used for carrying data and trading messages around the world’s equity markets. The open Fix protocol that is being agreed could also be used to define technical standards for trading in other asset classes, including fixed income cash markets, commodities and currencies.The new working group is aiming for ratification of the protocol for fixed income by the end of the year. The other broker-dealers in the group are: BofA Merrill Lynch, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Société Générale and UBS.
38;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2011-04-15T18:47:42Z;Survey gives thumbs up for new swap trading;But market participants say SEFs won’t reduce risk;A survey of US derivatives users by the Tabb Group reveals that a vast majority believe the introduction of new swap trading platforms will be good for the market, but nearly half think systemic risk will not be reduced.By July, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securites Exchange Commission are expected to have approved final rules for over-the-counter derivatives trading in the US.Under the Dodd Frank Act, swaps that are centrally cleared must trade on a Swap Execution Facility, or SEF. These are trading venues that allow multiple participants to buy and sell swaps with each other. Interdealer brokers such as Icap and GFI, and vendors such as Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess are set to roll out SEFs once regulators have defined the rules.Tabb said they surveyed upwards of 140 market participants including major dealers, interdealer brokers, new SEFs, exchanges, asset managers, hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, clearinghouses, regulators, end users and others.The results from several questions revealed that 87 per cent of respondents believe SEFs will be good for the OTC derivatives market.But in terms of reducing systemic risk, Tabb said 40 per cent of respondents think SEFs will not achieve that aim.“The fact that 40 per cent of market participants didn’t see the creation of SEFs reducing systemic risk means either Washington missed the mark or SEFs are not a part of the systemic risk story at all…that’s left to clearinghouses and repositories,” said Kevin McPartland, senior analyst at Tabb and author of the report.This week, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), at its annual meeting highlighted concerns about clearinghouses.Meanwhile, 95 per cent of the survey’s participants believe that some interest rate swaps will ultimately trade via a central limit order book, with 79 per cent saying this will happen by the first quarter of 2013, if not sooner.Regulators see electronic trading as boosting transparency, cutting costs and aiding the monitoring of risk exposures. Currently fewer than 5 per cent of US swaps traded between banks and their clients are executed on electronic platforms, say dealers.Many of the big customers and dealers in US swaps contend that a futures type model is the wrong approach for OTC swaps that trade less frequently and in much larger sizes than futures.ISDA and Sifma, the main industry lobby groups, estimate that the average size of US swaps in the five- to 10-year sector is $75m, with a significant number of trades in excess of $200m. In contrast, they say 95 per cent of five-year Treasury note futures trades are less than $5m in size.In other findings, 70 per cent of respondents told Tabb they are concerned more standardized OTC products might not be as effective in filling their needs as in the past, while 57 per cent believe the ideal number of SEFs for each asset class is 3 to 4.Tabb said the vast majority of respondents believe SEF consolidation will begin in two years or less following rule implementation.Separately, Barclays announced on Friday that it had executed and cleared a fully electronic interest rate swap trade with Citadel via CME Clearing, using Bloomberg’s Fixed Income Trading (“FIT”) platform.The bank said: “The transaction represents a first for both Barclays Capital and for Bloomberg FIT, being the first time that Barclays Capital has cleared an interest rate swap electronically at CME Group, and the first time that Bloomberg’s execution service has executed a fully-electronic CME Group-cleared interest rate swap.”Citadel also executed a swap and cleared the trade at LCH.Clearnet Ltd’s clearing service, SwapClear, with Barclays and Bloomberg.
39;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2010-05-21T16:41:29Z;GM bonds become macro proxy as distressed players sell out to equity funds;;This article is provided to FT.com readers by Debtwire—the most informed news service available for financial professionals in fixed income markets across the world. www.debtwire.com——————————————————————————————————–General Motors bonds, once an exclusively distressed debt play, have emerged as one of the most actively traded proxies for investors betting on a broader economic recovery, a trader, three sellside analysts, and three buyside sources told Debtwire.The volume and frequency of trades in the stub-debt left over from GM’s bankruptcy soared since the beginning of the year, according to data from MarketAxess. Weekly volume in the benchmark USD 3bn 8.375% notes due 2033 hovered between USD 100m and USD 200m per week in 1Q09 before spiking to USD 600m in the first week of April.Trading then slackened off a bit, but in the past three weeks, activity ranged between USD 600m and USD 1.1bn, according to MarketAxess. The bond rallied from 29.50 in late February to 38 by the end of March and has since spanned a 32-39 range, closing at 34.75 today.Equity-focused funds contributed the bulk of the new liquidity as distressed players took the opportunity to exit, said the sellside analyst and the trader. Holders of bonds don’t receive coupons, but when GM executes an IPO they will be entitled to 10% of the float plus warrants for an additional 15%. That makes the instruments more of an equity option than a high-yield bond, both in terms of payoff and volatility.The 8.375%s are only one of the USD 27bn in securities that were left in Chapter 11 when the new GM emerged through a 363 sale in July 2009. Recovery values for the bonds depend on when GM executes the IPO, how the new equity performs in the market and when a bond holder decides to cash out of the investment, said the second sellside source.Estimates from various sellside research reports peg the recovery value in the mid-30s to mid-40s, with buy recommendations across the board, the second sellside source said. Estimates for the company’s EBITDA vary from a conservative USD 12bn in 2011 to a more bullish USD 15bn, said the source.A GM spokeswoman said the company will IPO when the conditions are right and declined to comment further.Aside from the company’s quarterly earnings, the main driver of the bonds price is the seasonally adjusted annual rate of vehicle sales, all the sources said. GM reports the number of cars it produces and sells on a monthly basis, providing investors a relatively regular flow of information to work into models, the sources said.GM sold a total of 183,091 vehicles in April through its four brands, a 20% increase from the same month last year. Year-to-date the company has total sales of 652,444 vehicles, a 31% increase over the sales of the four brands last year, according to a company release. The company posted USD 31.5bn of revenue and USD 865m in net income for 1Q10, compared to revenue of USD 22.4bn and a net loss of USD 6bn in the same quarter last year, according to a company release.Other factors such as consumer sentiment and raw material costs weigh heavily on the company’s earnings as well, making GM as good an indicator as any of US macroeconomic health, all the sources said.GM’s ascendance as a proxy play marks a shift for high-yield bond markets as mega-LBOs such as HCA, Energy Future Holdings (TXU) and First Data (FDC) played that roll in recent years. And while there are other liquid credits that are just as tied to the broader economy, such as TXU or even rival automaker Ford, bonds backing those companies are fixed income securities that pay out regular coupons and are valued differently, said the second sellside source said.A GM spokesperson did not return calls.——————————————————————————————————–For more information or to inquire about a trial please email sales@debtwire.com or call Americas: +1 212-686-5374 Europe: +44 (0)20 7059 6113 Asia-Pacific: +852 2158 9731

He replaces Steve Gallagher, who will become a consultant to the company.Richard McVey, MarketAxess chief executive, said Mr Ellis had “extensive experience in bond and derivative markets and has successfully built new businesses in the credit default swap and technology space.”Before CreditTrade Mr Ellis, a former British army captain, headed Mutant Technology, a financial software company. He began his career in financial services at Barclays Bank International, where he became managing director of the financial products group, a cross-asset class structured derivatives business.MarketAxess said Mr Gallagher had “successfully led the European business to higher levels of profitability during his three-plus years in the UK”.

41;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2006-08-22T16:03:03Z;MarketAxess seeks a bigger slice of the inter-dealer cake;;MarketAxess, an electronic multi-dealer trading platform for corporate bond investors, is tackling the fall in trading volumes with an effort to take market share in the inter-dealer cash bond business.The company estimates that 25 per cent of daily corporate bond volume is conducted between dealers.With its current business model almost wholly dependent on client cash bond trading, the fall in volumes has had MarketAxess feeling the pinch.The company has seen its share price tumble by more than 30 per cent since January 2005, and its investment in a credit derivatives index platform has yet to prove itself.Its new inter-dealer platform, DealerAxess, was launched in June.MarketAxess said that seventeen dealers were currently trading US high-grade corporate bonds anonymously and electronically among themselves.Rick McVey, MarketAxess chief executive, said dealers were keen to promote electronic inter-dealer trading in corporate bonds as a way of cutting costs.“Dealers were trading corporate bonds between themselves the same way they did 20 years ago. They did not see that as sustainable in today’s environment of greater transparency and regulatory demands, and pressure on margins,” said Mr McVey.In the inter-dealer business, which remains predominantly voice-brokered, MarketAxess’ electronic platform is competing against Cantor Fitzgerald, GFI Group and Tullet Prebon.Mr McVey said DealerAxess fees were lower than rivals, at $90 to $100 per million for each side of the trade, with variable fees and monthly minimums to be phased in.
42;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2006-05-30T23:33:06Z;Kinder Morgan shares soar on buy-out proposal;;Shares in Kinder Morgan, the US oil and gas pipeline group, rose nearly 19 per cent - and the value of its bonds tumbled - on Tuesday as Wall Street reacted to the $13.5bn takeover bid tabled by a consortium including the company’s top executives and private equity firms.The proposal marks another example of the power of private equity groups in corporate America, where some of the largest companies are being lured away from public markets in multi-billion dollar buy-outs supported by management.Tuesday’s market reaction highlighted how differently such deals are greeted by different classes of investors. While shareholders were celebrating the premium valuation in the offer and the prospect of a bidding war, bondholders worried that the proposed additional debt financing would damage the company’s credit.The company’s longest-dated bonds fell more than 10 per cent from their last traded levels, according to data from MarketAxess.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, the rating agencies, said they might downgrade the company to junk if the deal went through. “The sharp increase in debt contemplated in the [Kinder Morgan] buyout offer would likely lead to a multiple notch ratings downgrade into the ‘BB’ category,” said Todd Shipman, an analyst at S&P. Kinder Morgan is currently rated BBB, two notches above junk.Meanwhile, the company’s shares moved up 18.8 per cent to $100.31, or slightly above the offer price of 100 per share. This suggests that many on Wall Street are speculating that the consortium – which includes Goldman Sachs, American International Group, Carlyle and Riverstone – will have to raise its offer to clinch a deal.One US energy banker suggested there was also the possibility of a counterbid, from players such as TransCanada or Enbridge, although such a move would be complicated in the absence of support from Mr Kinder, who holds a 20 per cent stake in the company. Other private equity groups active in the energy arena might also examine an offer, he said.If accepted, the proposal has the potential of setting a number of records: it would be the largest ever management buy-out at $20.4bn including debt, and involve the largest ever equity cheque written for a single private equity transaction, at $4.5bn.The bid for Kinder Morgan prompted a rally in shares of other midstream energy groups, including Williams Companies, which had risen 3 per cent by the close, and El Paso, which was up 1.7 per cent.Bankers at Goldman Sachs and lawyers at Weil Gotshal & Manges advised the consortium on the bid, which will have to be approved by a special committee of independent Kinder Morgan board members.
43;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2005-09-19T18:45:59Z;Platform for dollar swaps unveiled;;"Thomson TradeWeb has become the first multi-dealer platform to offer dollar-denominated interest rate swaps, weeks ahead of a similar offering by rival Bloomberg’s SwapTrader.Interest rate swaps, which enable users to remove the interest rate risk from a transaction, make up the biggest segment of the global derivatives market.The notional amount outstanding for interest rate derivatives stood at $184 trillion at the end of 2004, up 29 per cent from the previous year, according to data from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.The bespoke nature of many swaps has made it difficult to automate the trading process, but the vast and growing market has led to fierce competition in bringing at least a portion online.Both TradeWeb and SwapTrader launched multi-dealer trading in euro-denominated swaps earlier this year. SwapTrader has single-dealer trading in
dollar-denominated swaps.“We are expanding our services to the derivatives world because of growing investor and dealer demand to trade and process these instruments electronically,” said Lee Olesky, president of Tradeweb.TradeWeb’s latest move comes just a week after rival MarketAxess narrowly beat it to the punch in the credit default swap arena by rolling out the first non-interbank electronic trading for CDS indices – a product widely used by hedge funds. TradeWeb is scheduled to bring out its CDS product by the end of next month.Innovation in the credit derivatives industry is focused on addressing back office delays and errors that some fear could constrain the growth of the market."
44;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2005-09-12T01:07:42Z;Electronic derivatives trading begins;;Fund managers will be able to trade credit derivatives electronically for the first time from Monday, according to MarketAxess, the operator of the new system.Dealing in the complex products has boomed in recent years with hedge funds, and now more traditional fund managers, using them for hedging and investment purposes. But the bespoke nature of many instruments has made it difficult to automate the trading process, leading to backlogs of unconfirmed trades that alarmed regulators.MarketAxess will initially offer trading in credit default swap, or CDS, indices, the most heavily traded credit derivatives. The indices are based on individual CDS instruments, which are a form of insurance against a company's default.A rival CDS index trading platform from TradeWeb is set to go live by mid-October.The two companies hope to attract users with the promise of greater automation and reduced paperwork, typically available only to big credit derivatives dealing banks in the past.Much of the innovation in the credit derivatives industry is focused on addressing unglamorous back office delays and errors which some fear could constrain the growth of the market.Regulators have also ratcheted up their pressure on the industry. Now 14 leading investments banks have been summoned to meet the New York Federal Reserve this week to discuss these problems.But electronic trading platforms are only part of the solution, as many large hedge funds still prefer to trade by telephone so as to benefit from big investment banks' knowledge of market activity. For some funds, it can also be more efficient financially to have banks act as so-called prime brokers, trading on their behalf.To move even those trades towards full automation requires back office improvements as well as innovation in the trading area.Several developments have recently been announced that are intended to improve the automation of trade settlement and reduce errors and delays by standardising credit derivatives trades.As part of this effort the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, an industry group, is working to standardise documentation.Its latest project is a new procedure to simplify the process of assigning an existing trade to a third party, a particular problem area for the industry.The procedure could be published as early as Monday, according ISDA.
45;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2005-08-11T20:58:07Z;MarketAxess raises stakes in CDS trading;;MarketAxess, the operator of an electronic bond trading platform, plans to launch trading of credit default swap indices in September, the company said on Thursday.It is in a race with TradeWeb, its main rival in the dealer-to-client market, to be the first to offer trading in credit derivatives as well as cash bonds. TradeWeb plans to launch its new service at around the same time.The market for credit derivatives – and, in particular, index products such as the iTraxx and Dow Jones CDX indices – is relatively new and has been growing far more rapidly than the more mature market for so-called “cash” bonds, thanks in part to the increasing use of derivative products by hedge funds.“We need to be in that space,” said Barry Goldenberg, credit derivatives product manager at MarketAxess. “It is critical for our penetration of leveraged accounts, and hedge funds in particular. They trade a lot more CDS than bonds.”As part of its move, MarketAxess said on Thursdsay it had signed up for an industry standard system that helps reduce processing errors by accurately identifying the reference entities underlying credit derivative trades.Delays and errors in handling trades have caught the eye of financial regulators in recent months, boosting efforts in the industry to provide fully automated systems for confirming, matching and settling trades – a goal referred to as “straight through processing”.MarketAxess has subscribed to a referencing system – known as Red – provided by Markit Group, a specialist in valuing complex financial instruments.The company also said it would feed information to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the industry-owned organisation that has a near-monopoly of settlement services for shares and bonds traded in the US and is increasingly involved in processing derivatives trades.“The implementation of the MarketAxess electronic trading platform for the credit indices is made that much easier by the use of Red,” said Peter Axilrod, managing director of new business development at DTCC.“Matching on Red identifiers for all credit derivatives greatly enhances the value of our service.”DTCC collects information from both parties in a trade, and attempts to match it. At least until recently, around 60 per cent of incorrect matches resulted from the two parties’ entry of different reference entities or obligations, according to Mr Axilrod – sometimes simply because of spelling errors or incorrect company names.The Red system aims to eliminate such problems by giving a unique identifying code to each legal entity and each specific obligation that is used as the basis for a derivative product.The system has recently become widely used among big credit derivatives dealers, but it has been “a little more difficult” to persuade their customers to adopt it, according to Mr Goldenberg at MarketAxess.He said more customers could begin using Red identifiers once credit derivatives can be traded on the MarketAxess platform. “We already have all the buyside people using our system [to trade cash bonds],” he said.Following the launch of CDS index trading, the next step for MarketAxess is to add single-name CDS trading to its platform – something the company plans for some time in 2006, according to Mr Goldenberg.
46;MKTX;Marketaxess Holdings;2005-05-18T18:36:45Z;New CDS trading platform on track;;MarketAxess said on Wednesday its electronic trading platform for dealing in credit default swap indices was on course to launch in the second half of the year.The announcement followed a similar statement by rival Tradeweb last week and highlighted the increased attention being paid to the trading of credit derivatives.Both platforms expect to launch by the end of the year. While dealer-to-dealer systems already exist, these would be the first allowing customers direct access to a dealing platform.“Credit derivatives continue to play an increasingly important role in the fixed-income credit markets,” said Richard McVey, chief executive of MarketAxess, who said the new platform was a “logical progression”.CDS trading volumes have leapt in recent weeks as the downgrading of General Motors and Ford to junk status by Standard & Poor’s prompted investors to seek greater protection against the risk of a debt default.“We’re very much behind the commoditisation of CDS indexes,” said Paul Humphrey, global head of fixed-income e-Business at ABN Amro. By standardising the trading units, customers are expected to feel more comfortable holding the complex products.ABN Amro is one of 11 dealers MarketAxess is working with, alongside DTCC, an automated trade-processing provider.MarketAxess said that developing more standardised trade-processing procedures for clients was fundamental to encouraging trading growth.“Ultimately, this is what customers are demanding at the moment,” added Mr Humphrey.
