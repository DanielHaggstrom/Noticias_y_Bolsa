0;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Rising interest rates punish US power sector;Heavily indebted utilities shore up balance sheets as financing costs increase;US utilities, sustained for years in a warm bath of favourable financial conditions, are facing a cold shower.An expected rise in interest rates and the shake-up of the tax system passed into law at the end of last year are threatening to squeeze utilities’ finances. Already, the S&P 500 utility sector index has dropped 13 per cent from its peak in November.Duke Energy, one of the largest US utility groups by market capitalisation, on Tuesday gave an indication of the changing times, saying it planned to raise $2bn from selling shares this year and would cut its five-year capital spending plan by $1bn. Lynn Good, chief executive, said the share sale was needed “to maintain the strength of our balance sheet”.FirstEnergy, another large utility, last month announced a $2.5bn investment in shares and convertible preferred shares, backed by investors including Elliott Management and GIC, to pay off debt, contribute to its pension fund, and “strengthen the company’s investment-grade balance sheet”. The colder financial climate is expected to prompt other utilities to rethink their capital allocation, pushing some of them towards disposals or acquisitions.An immediate impact from expectations of rising interest rates has been to make utilities less attractive investment propositions. Listed utility groups generally make most of their income from regulated assets, which means that their earnings and dividend payments are steadier and more reliable. That makes their shares behave more like bonds.In a note on Wednesday, strategists at JPMorgan listed 50 “bond proxies” that were “stocks to avoid in a rising rate environment”. More than half of them were utilities, including Duke, Exelon, NextEra Energy and American Electric Power.Beyond the “bond proxy” effect, higher interest rates also threaten to disturb the cosy financial equilibrium that has supported US utility companies through a turbulent time for their industry. Demand for electricity in the US is stagnating: total power consumption was slightly lower last year than in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, there has been a dramatic shift in the fuel mix. Since 2010 the proportion of US electricity generated by coal-fired plants has dropped from 45 per cent to 30 per cent, while the proportion from gas rose from 24 per cent to 32 per cent and the proportion from renewables rose from 4 per cent to 10 per cent.But through all that, the US utility industry has been able to prosper. The sector index rose 82 per cent from the start of 2010 to November 2017. The relatively comfortable position of US utilities has been in sharp contrast to their European peers, which have undergone a gruelling decade of financial pressures and forced restructuring.A key reason for that has been the low cost of two of the US industry’s principal inputs: natural gas, and money. Utilities have been able to keep regulators happy with modest increases in rates, while increasing their earnings and dividends. Gas seems set to stay cheap but the cost of money is rising.Although many US utilities are heavily indebted, there is no imminent financing crisis looming. The utilities in the S&P 500 have debt with an average maturity of 14.5 years, JPMorgan calculates, and only 19 per cent of their debt matures by 2020. Over time, however, rising interest rates will put upward pressure on their costs. In their regulated businesses, the utilities should be able to recover those increased costs from their customers. But the more companies try to raise rates, the greater the risk that they will face challenges from regulators.The problem is compounded by the impact of the new corporate tax system. The changes are complex and will affect different companies in different ways, but one common effect of the system is that it squeezes the utilities’ cash flows.The main rate of corporate tax has been cut from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, and regulators are expected to insist that customers benefit from that reduction with lower bills. In the long run, companies will be able to recoup the lost income, according to Todd Shipman of S&P Global Ratings. “Rates will be lower today and then higher in the future,” he says. In the short run, however, the loss of revenue means that cash flows will be squeezed. The result is likely to be that some utilities’ credit ratings will be cut, Mr Shipman says. “I don’t expect a lot, but there almost inevitably will be some.”Merger and acquisition activity in US utilities slowed sharply last year after a hectic 2016. This year, rising interest rates could help spur a revival in dealmaking, according to Kenyon Willhoit of PwC, the professional services group. Some companies will be prompted to sell assets to reinforce their balance sheets, while others will see opportunities to buy.“It provides another reason for utilities to look to the merger and acquisition market to supply additional growth,” Mr Willhoit says.

Mr Duhnke is the staff director and general counsel to the Senate’s committee on rules and administration, and previously served as staff director and general counsel for the Senate’s banking committee.The SEC also announced four other new members of the PCAOB:The PCAOB was created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to keep tabs on audits of public companies and broker-dealers, after the massive accounting scandal that helped take down Enron. It is overseen by the SEC, whose chairman, Jay Clayton, said in a statement:“Bill, Jay, Kathleen, Jim, and Duane bring substantial experience to the Board and a shared commitment to serve in the interests of our Main Street investors. Their individual and collective talents position the PCAOB to execute its mission effectively in our local, national, and international markets.”
2;EXC;Exelon Corp;2017-05-30T17:24:37Z;Three Mile Island faces closure 40 years after partial meltdown;Exelon says state support could save site of most serious US civil nuclear accident;Three Mile Island, the power plant that was the site of the most serious US civil nuclear accident, will shut down in 2019 unless it is given additional government support, the company that owns it has said.The planned closure is a sign of the intense competition from cheap gas-fired generation that is jeopardising the economics not just of new reactors, but even of existing nuclear plants.One of Three Mile Island’s two reactors has remained closed since it suffered a partial meltdown in 1979. The other has continued to operate, and is licensed to keep running until 2034. But on Tuesday Exelon, the electricity group that owns the plant, said it planned to close Three Mile Island around the end of September 2019, with the loss of 675 jobs, unless there were “needed policy reforms” from the state of Pennsylvania.Illinois and New York State have already introduced subsidy mechanisms to keep reactors open, and Exelon is lobbying Pennsylvania to introduce something similar, such as including nuclear plants in its Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard that supports wind and solar power. Three Mile Island has been losing money for five years.The flood of cheap gas released by the US shale boom has driven down wholesale power prices and made it more difficult for nuclear plants to compete with gas-fired generation, while the sluggish economy and rising energy efficiency have meant that electricity demand growth has been weak.US electricity generators have largely given up on the idea of building new nuclear plants, with the delays and cost overruns at the new Westinghouse reactors being built in Georgia and South Carolina an additional disincentive. The focus in the industry now is simply on keeping alive the plants in service today.The Three Mile Island accident led to only a small radioactive release that had no detectable health effects on the plant’s workers or the public, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. However it led to widespread changes in safety regulations for US nuclear plants, and contributed to a sharp slowdown in approvals for new reactors in the late 1970s.New nuclear construction in the country was then stopped just about completely by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, meaning that the US has a large fleet of ageing reactors.Several closures of nuclear plants for largely economic reasons have been announced in the past few years, including Kewaunee in Wisconsin, Fort Calhoun in Nebraska and Vermont Yankee in Vermont.Exelon warned last week that Three Mile Island had been unsuccessful in an auction to offer generation capacity for PJM, the electricity market that stretches from New Jersey to Tennessee, meaning that it was “economically challenged”. The fact that there is only a single reactor running at the site, the legacy of the 1979 accident, means that its costs are higher than for larger nuclear plants.As the US continues to invest in renewable energy, and its costs continue to fall, wind and solar power may also become significant competitive threats to nuclear power across the US.For the time being, however, nuclear plants account for the great majority of electricity generated without creating greenhouse gas emissions in Pennsylvania. Nuclear power provides 38 per cent of all the state’s electricity, and 93 per cent of its emissions-free electricity, Exelon said.Jesse Jenkins of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said closing Three Mile Island would be “a significant step backwards for the low-carbon share of the energy mix”.Maria Korsnick of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry group, said support for existing reactors was also important to preserve US nuclear engineering capability in the face of rising competition from China, South Korea and other countries.“Right now, we have the world’s largest fleet of reactors. We have a window of opportunity to export our technology. But it’s not going to last for ever,” she said. “At stake is maintaining our global leadership standing.”
3;EXC;Exelon Corp;2016-10-03T16:28:59Z;Sell-off continues in US utilities after dismal Q3;;The shares of US utilities groups slid on Monday on the heels of the sector’s worst quarter since 2009 after an upbeat factory sector report bolstered confidence in the economy.The Institute for Management said that the US manufacturing sector flipped into growth mode in September. The purchasing manager’s index jumped to 51.5, from 49.4 in August, crossing the 50-line that separates expansion from contraction.The reading topped Wall Street expectations of 50.4 and came as an indication that manufacturing, which has been weighed down by a strong US dollar, trouble in the energy sector and sluggish global growth, may have stabilised after a disappointing start to 2016.The report “supports our view that the early-year decline in manufacturing is likely complete”, said Rob Martin an economist at Barclays. “We expect manufacturing largely to move sideways this year, but today’s data, combined with solid orders and exports reported last week, point to some upside risk to the manufacturing outlook”.Utilities stocks came under pressure in the third quarter as several top Federal Reserve officials began publicly advocating for a rate rise, warning over the risks of the economy overheating. Higher interest rates are seen as bearish for the sector, since it is often used by investors as a proxy for bonds given its hefty dividend yields.Utilities had also posted strong gains in the first six months of 2016, leading to concerns among some strategists that prices had accelerated too far beyond potential earnings.The strong data on Monday reinforced the negative sentiment, and also pressured the policy-sensitive two-year Treasury note, sending the yield rising by 3.2 basis points to 0.794 per cent.The S&P 500 utilities group dropped as much as 2 per cent, following a 6.7 per cent fall in the third quarter.AES Corp was the worst performer, sinking 4.4 per cent to $12.28. The power company was thrown a one-two punch, with both the upbeat economic data, and a downgrade by analysts at UBS to “sell” from “neutral”.Exelon, a larger utility, declined by 1.7 per cent to $32.75.
4;EXC;Exelon Corp;2016-08-09T16:07:05Z;Freepoint makes foray into retail energy;;Freepoint Commodities, a trader of bulk materials from oil to copper, is entering the retail energy business.The US-based company said Tuesday it was launching Freepoint Energy Solutions to supply commercial and industrial customers with power and gas, reports Gregory Meyer in New York.The venture aims to replicate the success Freepoint’s founders had in retail energy when they ran Sempra Energy Trading, a leading commodities trader of the previous decade. Sempra’s retail energy business was sold in 2010 to Noble Group of Hong Kong, which Noble put up for sale again this year as it seeks to stabilise its finances.“Given our management’s history, this really feels like a re-launch of the retail energy business at Freepoint,” David Messer, chief executive, said in a statement.Retail power and gas businesses tend to generate steady cash, helping offset volatile earnings from commodities trading. Sources close to the Noble sale process said the company had received a significant number of indicative offers, with final bids due by September. Noble has valued its Noble Americas Energy Solutions business at over $1bn.Last month, the New York utility Consolidated Edison reached a deal to sell its retail electricity and natural gas business to Constellation, a unit of power generator and utility operator Exelon, for an undisclosed sum.Freepoint said it had hired Bradley Quester as president of the new energy solutions business. He previously served at Constellation, Direct Energy and Guttman Energy.
5;EXC;Exelon Corp;2016-07-20T16:25:03Z;Uranium prices hit 11-year low;Mining production lags behind demand but inventory build up pressures key nuclear input;Uranium prices have hit an 11-year low as the market struggles with oversupply of the key nuclear material, belying predictions for strong growth in nuclear power in countries such as China.The price for uranium hit $24.9 a pound on Monday, its lowest level since 2005, according to Ux Consulting, which tracks the lowest available price in the market for delivery within three to 12 months.The global uranium market is still suffering from inventory built up before the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 slashed projections for demand for the fuel. That caused uranium prices to fall by almost 60 per cent from a record high of more than $70 a pound, partly driven by banks and funds in anticipation of a Chinese-led surge in demand.“Primary mine supply still lags behind demand but the difference has been made up from secondary supplies — including sales from government inventories and re-enrichment,” Edward Sterck, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in London, said. “Excess inventory has allowed utilities to be price selective.”In the US, the world’s largest consumer of uranium, nuclear-powered utilities have since had to compete with cheaper gas as well as renewable energy. Last month US utility Exelon said it would permanently shut down two nuclear plants in Illinois.China has also purchased a lot of uranium over the past few years — it imported about 65m pounds last year and Ux estimates it has an inventory build up of around 280 million pounds.In addition, nuclear power remains unpopular in Japan, which has turned to oil, gas and coal for electricity generation since Fukushima. Only one nuclear reactor is expected to come online this year against an original forecast of 10, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. A total of 32 reactors are subject to lawsuits, it said.The weakness in the uranium market has led producers to cut output. In April Canadian uranium company Cameco, which owns the world’s biggest uranium mine, said it would reduce output from its Canadian and US operations in response to the low prices.Cameco’s uranium sales fell 16 per cent in the first quarter to 5.9m pounds. The company’s shares have dropped 19 per cent this year.The uranium price over the next 12 months the price is likely to be fairly flat, according to Nicolas Carter, executive vice-president at Ux Consulting.Still, some investors are betting on an eventual rebound in uranium prices, as nuclear power continues to expand in China.China still relies on coal for around 70 per cent of its energy demand but the country is expected to shift towards renewable and nuclear power sources. The country is likely to add 420 gigawatts of generation capacity by 2020 with 95 per cent of the growth coming from nuclear or renewable sources, Bank of America said in a report on Wednesday.In June Vancouver-based uranium explorer NexGen Energy sold $60m in five-year convertible debt to CEF Holdings and other shareholders. CEF is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchinson Holdings.Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald say they eventually expect a “violent move” in the the price of uranium as utilities eventually need to buy to cover requirements. Many utilities have signed long-term contracts at prices of $40 but these are expiring in the next few years, they said.“While the size of the spot uranium market is unknown, we note that it is not infinite and primary production from mines has been short of global demand for over a decade,” the analysts added.
6;EXC;Exelon Corp;2015-09-03T16:47:11Z;Exelon / Pepco: DC folly;Deals, like idealism, struggle to survive in the US capital;"Washington DC: a place where idealism, and now merger synergies, go to perish. Nearly 18 months ago, the large US utility Exelon signed up to buy Pepco Holdings in a $12bn deal. Pepco is a regional utility. Its power transmission businesses cover various parts of the east coast, including Washington. Exelon is best-known as the largest operator of nuclear power plants in the US. Heavy investment in those plants has proved unlucky. Cheap fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal have rendered nuclear power uneconomic.The addition of Pepco was intended to help shift Exelon towards a regulated utility model, deriving its earnings from distributing power — a business where investment returns are guaranteed by regulators.But that arrangement can mean kowtowing to sometimes touchy local authorities, as Exelon discovered last week. The Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia refused to approve the acquisition, saying it was not in the “public interest”.As is often the case in negotiations with regulators, Exelon had offered a series of concessions — such as creating new, unionised jobs, making annual charitable donations and passing on some deal cost savings to ratepayers. These giveaways often feel parochial and contrived, or worse, but the nature of local politics demands them. Ultimately, the commission worried that Pepco would become a cog in the wheel of a behemoth, and less responsive to local customers. Perhaps; but those concessions did have local value, as would Pepco having a better-capitalised parent. The PSC may have been emboldened by a climate of heightened regulatory scrutiny of consolidation across other industries.Exelon had expected that earnings per share accretion of 8 per cent would result from the deal (its enterprise value is $50bn). It and Pepco both plan to appeal against the PSC decision. A settlement could be reached, or there could be an appeal to a federal court. It could be two years between the signing of the Pepco transaction and its completion. Progress in Washington does not come quickly.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

However, user growth slowed to less than 1 per cent from the first quarter.Planet Fitness climbed 6 per cent to $17.81 after all nine investment banks that underwrote the initial public offering of the chain of budget gyms initiated coverage with ‘buy’ or buy-equivalent ratings, including Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Jefferies.Price targets from the nine banks ranged from $19 to $25 a share, compared to the $16 price the company sold shares for this August.Analysts with Baird said that Planet Fitness had created a “disruptive model” poised to take market share, while those with Jefferies said it was the “logical beneficiary of favourable industry trends given its extensive store base, compelling value proposition and brand strength.”“Planet Fitness disrupted the $23bn US health club industry when the company launched its high-value, low-price business model, helping to create a fundamental shift in how consumers are spending their exercise dollars,” said Jerry Gray, an analyst with Cowen & Company.JC Penney shares rose 2 per cent to $9.11 after analysts with Deutsche Bank upgraded the department store chain to ‘buy’ from ‘hold’ on the view same-store sales and margins will improve.“New chief executive Marvin Ellison is now driving the next step of applying the science of retail to bring JC Penney up the curve in pricing and markdown optimisation,” said Paul Trussell, an analyst with Deutsche.Rival chains fell on Monday, with Dillard’s down 0.3 per cent to $92.51 and Sears Holdings dropping 2.2 per cent to $26.71.Netflix shares slid 2 per cent to $115.35 after the company said it would not renew its licensing deal with Epix over the weekend, removing blockbuster titles such as Hunger Games: Catching Fire, World War Z and Transformers: Age of Extinction from its US service at the end of September.Utilities were the worst performing industry on Monday, with the S&P 500 utility index sliding 1.6 per cent to 214.28 following comments from policymakers on Saturday that the US central bank could raise rates in September.Duke Energy slid 2 per cent to $70.91, Exelon declined 2 per cent to $30.76 and FirstEnergy weakened 1.6 per cent to $31.96.Overall, US equities slipped following weaker than expected manufacturing reports from the Greater Chicago and Texas regions.The S&P 500 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,972.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 16,528.03.

8;EXC;Exelon Corp;2015-08-25T17:21:38Z;Regulators reject $6.8bn US utility deal;DC rebuff to Exelon’s takeover of Pepco sends chill through a sector seeing rapid consolidation;The deal frenzy in America’s utility sector suffered a serious setback after a local regulator blocked Exelon’s acquisition of Pepco, a $6.8bn deal which would have created one of the largest utility companies in the US.Shares of Pepco tumbled as much as 20 per cent after the Public Service Commission of the District of Columbia said the deal would harm local consumers. Pepco provides electricity to communities in the Washington DC and Maryland area.“The commission concluded that, taken as a whole, the transaction as proposed by Exelon and Pepco is not in the public interest,” according to a statement released by the three-member commission on Tuesday.“At a time of change in the energy field, Pepco’s ability to adapt will be constrained by an increased management bureaucracy. We are also concerned about the inherent conflict of interest that might inhibit our local distribution company from moving forward to embrace a cleaner and greener environment.”The decision is likely to be controversial as the $6.8bn deal was approved by public service commissions in Maryland and Delaware. Both companies said they were reviewing their options.The regulatory rebuff could also cast a shadow on other high-profile utility deals agreed this year.Southern Company, one of the largest utility groups in the US, agreed on Monday to acquire natural gas distribution and retail company AGL Resources for about $12bn, including debt. In February Iberdrola, the Spanish electricity group, agreed to buy UIL for about $4.6bn including debt, to add to its existing US utility and wind power operations.Following the decision Pepco’s shares dropped as low as $21.61, rallying slightly to $22.85 by lunchtime in New York. When the merger was announced in April last year, Exelon valued Pepco at $27.24 a share.We continue to believe our proposal is in the public interest and provides direct immediate and long-term benefits to customers, enhances reliability and preserves our role as a community partnerShares in Exelon , which has a market capitalisation of about $27bn, dropped nearly 4 per cent to $30.70.“We are disappointed with the commission’s decision and believe it fails to recognise the benefits of the merger to the District of Columbia and its residents and businesses,” Exelon and Pepco said in a joint statement.“We continue to believe our proposal is in the public interest and provides direct immediate and long-term benefits to customers, enhances reliability and preserves our role as a community partner.”Failure to complete the merger would represent a big blow for Exelon, the Chicago-based utility which hoped that a deal would help it add 2m new customers and generate savings of up to $80m a year.The Midwestern group, which is best known for being the leading nuclear power producer in the US, also hoped that the acquisition of Pepco would help it diversify its business into the safer regulated utility sector.Revenue growth for large utility groups has been slowing because of rising energy conservation, making it difficult for them to raise earnings.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Amid a nasty session for equities, a large US utility, Southern Company, said it would acquire its smaller rival in Georgia, AGL Resources, for $12bn in total transaction value (against Southern’s enterprise value of nearly $70bn). Based on retail customers, Southern Company will become the second-largest US natural gas and electricity transmission company, just behind Exelon. Utilities shares traded mostly lower on Monday but fell far less than those in other sectors. And after falling out of favour for much of the year, a rally — even a relative one — must feel sweet for power distributors.Until recent weeks, worries over impending interest rate increases had punished utilities, whose hallmark is hefty dividends among slow earnings growth. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 Utilities Index was down 11 per cent, trailing the broader S&P 500 by 12 percentage points. However, since then the utilities index is up by 9 per cent while the broader benchmark is down 4 per cent.The likelihood that the Federal Reserve will delay rate increases past September seems to have grown with the worldwide market turmoil. As such, the safety of utilities whose dividend yields are approaching 5 per cent has become more attractive.Despite the sector’s return to favour, recent merger and acquisition activity has been mostly defensive. US power consumption growth has not rebounded since the financial crisis and dealmaking has been one way to boost earnings. Separately, utilities have been splitting into those focused on safer, regulated power transmission (such as Southern and AGL) and those who want to be in the riskier business of producing and selling power based on speculation on market prices.The underlying economics of utilities are still not pretty and rising rates — whenever they come — will hurt their shares. But their moment in the sun is not over just yet.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com

As we talk to institutional clients, they’re highly convicted that with quantitative easing, Europe and Japan are a much easier bet than the US is.”The S&P 500 slid 1.7 per cent to 2,044.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.9 per cent to 17,662.94.

Conversely, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed a moderation in activity in the US, although it remained above the trailing 12-month average and indicated the 16th consecutive month of expansion.“The global readings on the manufacturing sector fall into three camps. Activity is humming in North America, stalled in Europe and most of Asia, and dreary with minor declines in most of the rest of the world,” Michael Montgomery, an economist with IHS Global Insight, said.Companies on the benchmark US index, which generate 46 per cent of sales abroad, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, slumped as investors sold off positions in the technology and industrial sectors.Utilities, which are less exposed to currency movements and earn a far lower portion of revenues abroad, advanced.Since the year’s start, utilities have been among the best performing sectors on the S&P 500 – rising 11 per cent, trailing only the 14 per cent gain by the healthcare industry.Shares of Exelon advanced 1 per cent to $34.57, NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $31.19, Entergy rose 1 per cent to $78.04 and Southern Company increased 1 per cent to $44.09.Shares of pharmaceutical companies with potential treatments for the deadly Ebola virus rallied after the Centres for Disease and Control confirmed that the first case of Ebola had been diagnosed in the US on Tuesday.Shares of Canadian drugmaker Tekmira Pharmaceuticals surged 18 per cent to $24.99, while NewLink Genetics, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last month to proceed with clinical trials of its Ebola vaccine, advanced 7 per cent to $22.95.Lakeland Industries, the maker of protective suits to combat Ebola in west Africa, climbed 30 per cent to $9.01.Shares of fee-based consumer review site Angie’s List, surged 19 per cent to $7.59 after the FT reported that it hired bankers to review strategic options including a possible sale.Angie’s List executives are not tied to the sale, people familiar with the matter said. The stock remains 50 per cent lower this year to date.America’s biggest automaker, General Motors, rose after it unveiled plans to double profit margins to 9 to 10 per cent as measured by earnings before interest and tax adjusted for special items.The Detroit-based automaker also reported that September vehicle sales rose 19 per cent from a year ago. Shares of GM climbed 2 per cent to $32.49.Overall, the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,946.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.4 per cent to 16,804.71.

13;EXC;Exelon Corp;2014-08-14T20:42:41Z;Utilities climb amid appetite for haven assets;;Utilities led a languid trading day as markets digested stagnant European economic activity as a drop in yields on German and US treasuries made the sector comparatively more attractive.Investors shifted back into haven assets, particularly higher dividend-paying equities in the US, and out of higher growth sectors including the technology industry.The reversal into US utilities, including Pinnacle West, Entergy and Exelon, which all climbed more than 1 per cent, followed a difficult quarter for the sector.Since the start of July, utilities have lagged behind all others on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 5.2 per cent.Analysts with Credit Suisse noted that much of the weakness at the end of July related to “market concern over Fed activity and the threat of rising interest rates”.Sluggish activity across Europe, which economists with IHS Global Insight said faced significant growth constraints, and a Federal Reserve cautious of lifting rates amid a fragile recovery, has made utilities more appealing.“Fiscal policy is still generally restrictive, despite increased flexibility over countries’ fiscal targets, and tight credit conditions persist in several countries amid still significant banking sector problems,” said Raj Badiani, European economist with IHS.The Dow Jones Utilities Average advanced 0.8 per cent to 545.91 while the Russell 2000 technology index declined 0.2 per cent to 2,047.88.Shares of Pinnacle West rose 1.8 per cent to $54.35, Entergy climbed 1.5 per cent to $73.01 and Exelon advanced 1.2 per cent to $31.83.Cisco shares were under pressure after the company said it would lay off 6,000 employees, or 8 per cent of its workforce, beginning in its current fiscal quarter as it seeks to trim costs and better compete with rivals.The San Jose, California-based company said it would incur a pre-tax charge of $700m relating to the restructuring.Cisco, like venerable tech giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard, has found difficulty lifting revenues, particularly as emerging markets struggle to maintain economic growth rates seen over the past decade.John Chambers, the Cisco chief executive, highlighted the “economic and geopolitical challenges” in China, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and Thailand for some of the weakness.Cisco declined 2.6 per cent to $24.54 while HP rose 0.8 per cent to $35.59.Berkshire Hathaway, the company controlled by billionaire Warren Buffett, soared to $200,000 for the first time on Thursday.The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s class A shares advanced 1.6 per cent to $202,850 valuing Berkshire at more than $326bn.Kohl’s buoyed the wider department store sector after it said profits exceeded expectations as it trimmed costs and saw an uptick in July sales.The Wisconsin-based retailer said quarterly sales fell 1 per cent to $4.24bn.Profits were little changed at $232m, or $1.13 per share. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.07 a share.Kevin Mansell, chief executive, told analysts on a call that the company saw sales momentum at the start of July, reporting “a positive comp for the first time in several months”.The results followed figures from Macy’s on Wednesday, which fell short of analyst forecasts.Kohl’s shares rose 3.3 per cent to $56.91. Rival Dillard’s edged up 0.2 per cent to $115.60 while JC Penney climbed 4 per cent to $9.74, ahead of stronger results which lifted the stock another 5 per cent to $10.24 in after-market trading.Restaurant chain Noodles & Co tumbled 16 per cent to $21.16 after the company said second-quarter profits and sales missed analyst expectations as same-store sales declined.The company said overall sales advanced 11 per cent from a year earlier to $99.5m as it continued to open new restaurants, while profits climbed to $3.5m, or 11 cents per share.Overall, US equity markets advanced as new figures showed recent jobless claims hovering near pre-crisis levels.The S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent to 1,955.18 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 16,713.58. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,453.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
14;EXC;Exelon Corp;2014-07-03T17:11:50Z;Utility stocks cool with temperatures;;Energy utility company stocks cooled along with US midwest and east coast weather forecasts, with natural gas prices trading near their three-month lows.The price of gas fell to $4.36 midweek from a spike to a high of $6.15 in February following the severe winter weather patterns. In the past three days, the price had fallen sharply from $4.60, said Travis Miller, a Morningstar analyst.The drop was the consequence of cooler than expected weather forecasts, and demand for power to run air conditioners and fans fell.“This is the biggest drop since February after the polar vortex,” Mr Miller said. “Utilities had a big run in gas prices after the polar vortex. It had a big spike and a big drop.”It was not unusual to see investors rotating their funds from utilities into more growth-oriented sectors, particularly in a rallying market, he noted.The fallers in the S&P 500 were led by Public Service Enterprise Group, the New Jersey-based utility company, down 3 per cent to $38.16.The Tampa-based TECO Energy fell 2 per cent to 17.71. New Orleans-based Entergy fell 2 per cent to $76.97, and North Carolina’s Duke Energy fell 1 per cent to $71.39. Chicago-based Exelon fell 2 per cent to $33.97.By contrast, the S&P 500 gainers were led by Petsmart, the US’s largest retailer of pet items, rising 13 per cent to $67.28 after hedge fund Jana Partners expressed interest in buying the company.Jana Partners on Thursday disclosed a 9.9 per cent stake in Petsmart and pushed management to examine options for the company.Jana, run by Barry Rosenstein, amassed its stake after a difficult first quarter for Petsmart in which sales missed expectations.Shares in the company have fallen roughly 12 per cent over the past year.A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made clear that, with its almost 10 per cent stake, Jana expected Petsmart to look at options including a sale, better operating performance and a return of capital to investors.Shares in tobacco groups Lorillard and Reynolds American jumped on merger speculation, after a CNBC report that the two were nearing a deal, following on rumours of talks earlier this year.Shares in Lorillard, maker of Newport and other brands, jumped 5 per cent to $64.41. Shares in Reynolds, maker of Camel, Pall Mall, Winston and others, rose 2 per cent to $61.56.Shares in truck manufacturer Paccar added 5 per cent to $67.25 after Volkswagen denied claims it was interested in making a bid for the company.Speculation of a potential bid for Paccar surfaced late on Wednesday after analysts at Sanford Bernstein said that the head of Daimler’s truck division had told investors that Volkswagen was eyeing a bid for the US truckmaker.Washington-based Paccar had been seen as offering the potential for VW to gain a foothold in the North American market where it lacks a presence.Volkswagen has been trying to integrate its truck operations more closely as it says that could help it achieve extra synergies of at least €650m annually within the next 10 to 15 years.That will help it boost its challenge to rivals Daimler and Volvo. VW’s truck assets comprise Scania, MAN and VW commercial vehicles.Christine Ritz, a VW spokeswoman, denied the reports to media outlets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to breach the 17,000 level for the first time, reaching 17,068.26 by close, buoyed by a much stronger than expected employment report.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,985.44 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 4,485.92.
15;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US power producers: indie label;Volatility to be found in pure-play electricity generators;Market volatility may be at 10-year lows, but it is still there, if one knows where to look. One intriguing spot: the US independent power producers. IPPs, also known as “merchant” or “competitive” plants, generate electricity. Power transmission is then left to utilities whose returns are mandated by regulators. This week the third largest independent was created when PPL Corporation separated its generation business from its utility. It combined those generating assets with a group of power plants owned by private equity firm Riverstone Holdings to form a new public company, Talen.Talen and its IPP peers are a wager on the upward, if erratic, trajectory of electricity rates. IPPs have had a nice run of late – but the rally should not be enough to erase memories of high-profile busts.The integration of generation and distribution is fading. Exelon recently expanded its regulated utility exposure through the $4bn acquisition of Pepco. Duke Energy, meanwhile, is trying to sell 11 midwest power plants.PPL’s deal to jettison its power-generation business is cleverly structured. The combination with the Riverstone unit is tax-free and the 15 gigawatts of combined capacity is concentrated in two desirable regions: the densely populated mid-Atlantic and fast-growing Texas.In an era of low returns, investors prefer that utilities protect their dividend (PPL’s yield is 4 per cent) and leave power price speculation to the likes of Talen. Of late though, speculation has been a good business. Shares in NRG Energy, the largest IPP, are up a third in the past year. A harsh winter helped it boost its 2014 cash flow outlook by a fifth. Over the longer term, the hope is that the price of natural gas and electricity demand both edge up, combining to boost power rates. Volatility, though, cuts in both ways. Prominent power producers Energy Future Holdings, Dynegy and Calpine guessed wrong on electricity prices (and capital structure) and found bankruptcy.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex
16;EXC;Exelon Corp;2014-05-30T22:10:17Z;Retailers suffer on sales dip forecast;;Disappointing guidance from retailers on Friday continued a lacklustre earnings season for the sector, felled by an uneven economic recovery, heavy discounting and the lingering effects of severe winter weather.Express, Guess and Pacific Sunwear offered a sobering outlook for the second quarter, all forecasting same-store sales to dip further.Executives at Guess, the largest of the three by market capitalisation, told analysts that trends across its business lines remained “soft”. For the quarter to May 3, sales fell 5 per cent to $523m, dipping in Asia, North America and Europe. The retailer also reported a loss of $2.1m in the quarter compared with a profit of $9.9m in the same period a year earlier.Express, the clothing retailer formerly owned by Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands, said sales fell 10 per cent to $461m, below analyst expectations. The company also said it expected same-store sales to fall by a “negative mid to high single” digit in the second quarter and that it could report a loss of as much as $2.5m.Guidance was not much better at Pacific Sunwear, which forecast same-store sales to fall as much as 5 per cent in the second quarter despite warmer weather.The results are some of the last from the country’s largest speciality retailers, capped by declining sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters.FBR Capital Markets analyst Susan Anderson, speaking of Express, said she remained on the sideline until overall industry dynamics improved and gross margins and same-store sales began to stabilise.Shares in Guess declined 5.13 per cent to $25.50, while those of Express fell 7.48 per cent to $12.61 and Pacific Sunwear slid 17.69 per cent to $2.42.Off-priced retailer Big Lots proved an exception, as consumers continued their hunt for discounts in the quarter.Sales rose 1 per cent to $1.28bn in the period, ahead of Wall Street expectations, while profits fell to $3.3m, largely due to losses from discontinued operations. Shares in the retailer jumped 13.14 per cent to $42.44.Shares in Allergan rose 5.6 per cent to $167.46 after Valeant Pharmaceuticals raised a takeover bid for the second time in a week as it hopes to secure a deal that would value the maker of Botox at close to $53bn.Valeant, which has teamed up with Bill Ackman, the activist investor, in its pursuit of Allergan increased its offer to $72 a share in cash, up 23 per cent on its previous bid. Investors are also offered 0.83 Valeant shares for each Allergan one they own, unchanged from the previous proposal. Valeant shares were up 1.59 per cent.Exelon, the power company, was among the top performers on the benchmark S&P 500 after analysts at Jefferies upgraded the company to ‘hold’ from ‘underperform’.The investment bank said an improving commodity outlook for forward power prices would benefit Exelon, sending shares 2.14 per cent higher to $36.83.“Based on higher estimates the company currently is trading at a price-to-earnings discount to other electric companies,” analyst Paul Fremont said.Glu Mobile, the mobile game maker, slid on Friday after the company said it had sold 8.6m shares at $3.50 apiece, roughly 14 per cent below Thursday’s closing price.The company said it would use the roughly $28m raised for working capital and other general purposes, as well as possible acquisitions or investments. Shares fell 10.47 per cent by the close to $3.64.Shares of Lionsgate, the studio behind The Hunger Games, declined 11.51 per cent to $26.13 after the company missed sales expectations for the quarter to March 31. Net revenues fell 8 per cent to $722m, while profits tumbled 70 per cent to $49m.Overall, equity markets were little changed, despite a number of closely watched economic reports in the US. Consumer spending fell 0.1 per cent in April, compared to expectations for a 0.3 per cent rise, figures from the Commerce department showed.Although April’s dip followed the biggest rise in spending in March since 2009, it offered a cautionary note for economists already forecasting a robust rebound for the US economy this quarter.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,923, its fourth record close in five sessions, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched 0.11 per cent higher to 16,717.17.

17;EXC;Exelon Corp;2014-05-28T15:42:50Z;Power industry braced for US carbon rules;;Next Monday, President Barack Obama is expected to launch the most significant environmental policy of his presidency: proposed rules to curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.Many of the critical details of the plan from the Environmental Protection Agency are still under wraps. It is already clear, though, that the new regulations are likely to have a significant impact on the consumers and producers of electricity.Gas-fired generation, renewables such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency will be favoured, while the struggling US nuclear industry could be thrown a lifeline. Coal, which generates roughly twice as much carbon dioxide as a modern combined-cycle gas-fired power plant, will be the worst hit.The rules for new plants proposed by the EPA in 2012 have the effect of preventing the construction of any new coal-fired plants that do not have some capacity to capture and store their CO2 emissions.The rules for existing plants would be much less restrictive. Gina McCarthy, the EPA’s administrator, has promised a “flexible” approach, which would allow states freedom to decide for themselves how to reduce emissions, although it is expected to set at a national level the targets they would have to hit.Its proposals are sure to be thoroughly tested in the courts. “You can expect this to be a wildly litigated document at every level,” says Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst at UBS.Some companies, though, will be more troubled by the rules than others. Research published on Wednesday by Ceres, a group that works with investors to campaign on social and environmental issues, shows how widely their emissions vary.Among the largest generators, companies with a high rate of emissions relative to their total power output include Ohio-based American Electric Power and Missouri-based Ameren. Other high emitters include Energy Future Holdings, the Texas utility group that sought bankruptcy protection last month, and MidAmerican Energy, owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. At the other end of the spectrum is Exelon, which relies heavily on nuclear power.One consequence of the Environmental Protection Agency’s new carbon dioxide rules may be a wider role for the fledgling US emissions trading schemes such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which covers nine states in the northeast of the country.It has not yet been formally confirmed, but it seems very likely that participation in the RGGI or a similar scheme would be accepted by the EPA as a way to comply with its regulations . . .Continue readingThe differences are striking: AEP emitted more than eight times as much carbon dioxide as Exelon for every megawatt hour of electricity that it generated, according to the most recent data, for 2012.The prospect of carbon regulation puts low-emitting companies at an advantage, particularly in the 17 US states that have more or less competitive electricity markets, rather than tightly regulated utilities.Calpine, one of the relatively low emitters which specialises in competitive markets, is urging the EPA to push for significant cuts. “The EPA should propose something that has meaningful reductions,” says Derek Furstenwerth, Calpine’s senior director of environmental services. “It’s not worth all the effort that we’ll be going to if they only have token reductions.”Conversely Southern Company, which created emissions at a rate about 40 per cent higher than Calpine, is suggesting the EPA should hold back.The new rules “should not infringe upon states’ authority to develop performance standards and flexibility to choose compliance mechanisms”, it says. It is arguing for the standards to be based on what measures to reduce emissions are practicable not at a state level but at each individual plant, which would allow for much smaller cuts.Creating fewer emissions has not so far been an infallible route to superior investment performance. Exelon’s shares have dropped 25 per cent in the past five years, while AEP’s have more than doubled.If they are allowing the industry to retire nuclear plants prematurely, it would significantly impede their ability to hit their national carbon targetsHowever, some investors are starting to use greenhouse gas emissions as a factor when making decisions about where to put their money. Calvert Investments, a Maryland-based fund manager, in March launched an investment strategy based on comparisons of companies’ performance in areas including greenhouse gas emissions and resource use.Stu Dalheim, vice-president of Shareholder Advocacy at Calvert, says investors are becoming increasingly concerned about climate change, and the Obama administration’s plans show how companies are operating in a “carbon-constrained world”.One way in which that may manifest itself is in better prospects for US nuclear generators. Exelon and Entergy have been under pressure because the economics of their reactors are threatened by cheap gas. But UBS analyst Mr Dumoulin-Smith argues that carbon limits will make it much less likely that regulators will allow otherwise viable plants to shut purely for economic reasons.“If they are allowing the industry to retire nuclear plants prematurely, it would significantly impede their ability to hit their national carbon targets,” he says.The technical details in the regulations would make a significant difference to their effects. For example, Entergy emits at about half the rate of Southern Company, but over 2006-12 Entergy’s emissions were roughly unchanged, while Southern’s fell 27 per cent. So how much credit should Southern gain for that improvement?It is a reason for every US electricity company to be nervous as they look ahead to next week.Chuck Barlow, vice-president of environmental strategy and policy at Entergy, says the company’s “very manageable” carbon risk is a source of competitive strength. But he is also concerned that the EPA should not be too ambitious with the emissions cuts it demands.“We believe we’ve put ourselves in a good position to comply with a carbon rule,” he says. “But they do need to make sure it is flexible enough for us to cope with the regulations.”
18;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Uneconomic US nuclear plants at risk of being shut down;;"More US nuclear power plants are at risk of closure because they are no longer economic, industry leaders have warned, jeopardising the administration’s hopes that the reactors can help support energy security and limit greenhouse gas emissions.Exelon and Entergy are among the US power generators facing pressures to close some of their nuclear plants, as a result of lower electricity prices, competition from cheap gas, and sometimes political opposition.For a list of the US nuclear power plants being shut down and those at riskSee belowOn Wednesday Ernest Moniz, energy secretary, said the government would offer $6.5bn in loan guarantees to support the construction by a consortium led by Southern Company of two new reactors at Vogtle in Georgia, scheduled to start up in 2017-18.Over the next five years, however, it is possible that more nuclear capacity will be shut down in the US than started up. The country has a patchwork of regulatory systems, with competitive retail electricity markets in 20 states, and it is in those states that nuclear power is under pressure.Where nuclear plants have to go head-to-head with gas-fired plants, and with wind and solar power that are supported by regulatory mandates, they are finding it hard to compete.“Competitive markets can be efficient, but right now they aren’t,” says Marvin Fertel, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry group.“We’ve seen a real problem that needs to be fixed.”It has been clear for years that the shale gas boom made it hard for costly new reactors to compete. Over the past year, though, it has become clear that even some existing plants are no longer commercially viable.About 3.6 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity were retired last year, compared with 4.5GW of coal-fired capacity, according to the US government’s Energy Information Administration.While existing US nuclear plants may face an increasingly uncertain future, the new reactors being built by a consortium led by Southern Company in Georgia are at least making reasonably good progress, so far.Continue readingOf the four nuclear plants where closures were announced in the past 18 months, two – Duke Energy’s Crystal River in Florida and Edison International’s San Onofre in California – were already shut down and required multibillion-dollar repairs that made the economics of restarting them particularly challenging.The two decisions that really rattled the industry were the closures of Dominion Resources’ Kewaunee plant in Wisconsin and Entergy’s Vermont Yankee in Vermont. Both were running fine and licensed to keep going into the 2030s, but became uneconomic to keep in operation.Now executives and analysts are warning that several other reactors are threatened by a similar fate.Chris Crane, chief executive of Chicago-based Exelon, one of the largest nuclear generators in the US, warned earlier this month that some of the company’s reactors were losing money “due to the low prices and the bad energy policy that we’re living with”.Speaking on a call with analysts to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results, he said: “If we do not see a path to sustainable profits, we will be obligated to shut units down to avoid the long-term losses.”New Orleans-based Entergy has not issued such direct warnings. Leo Denault, chief executive, told analysts on its call this month that the company had been “exploring opportunities” for its nuclear plants, but “we didn’t find anything that we liked. And we like owning them better”.However, analysts at Morningstar, the research company, have identified two of Entergy’s plants, Pilgrim in Massachusetts and James A. Fitzpatrick in New York, as among those at greatest risk of closure. Its Indian Point plant near New York City is also under heavy political pressure.Morningstar argued in a note last November that Entergy’s plants generally had a “a long-term competitive advantage”.However, Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS wrote in a note last week that its reactors selling in competitive markets were “fundamentally challenged and driving downside to [the] shares”.Figures published this month by the NEI show that across the 61 nuclear plants in the US – 35 of them with more than one reactor – operating and capital costs averaged about $44 per megawatt hour generated in 2012.Cheap US coal has made gas-fired electricity uneconomic and accelerated a capacity shortfall in the UKContinue readingThat compares reasonably well with a new gas plant that will cost about $47 per MWh to run, according to the EIA, but there is a wide variation in nuclear plants’ costs. The best-performing quarter of the fleet cost only about $28 per MWh in 2010-12, while the worst cost more than $62 per MWh.Security and safety measures following the 9/11 attacks and the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, and a generally tougher line from regulators, have been putting upward pressure on costs.Nuclear plants’ prospects also depend on which market they serve. In the Miso grid region of the midwest, where wholesale power prices averaged about $35 per MWh in the first half of last year, even the lower-cost reactors are under pressure.In regulated markets, where generators are allowed a guaranteed return, nuclear’s prospects are much better. Duke, for example, operates all of its reactors in regulated markets, and Lynn Good, its chief executive has said she is confident they can continue as part of the company’s fleet for decades to come.Re-regulating competitive markets to support nuclear plants would be a controversial move, but may be the only way to prevent the US industry shrinking further.Nuclear power: on the way outPlants that are planned to be shut downSan Onofre in California, pictured, operated by Edison International

19;EXC;Exelon Corp;2013-07-30T15:03:15Z;EDF to exit US nuclear power over impact of shale gas;;EDF, the world’s biggest producer of nuclear-powered electricity, is to pull out of nuclear production in the US, citing the “revolution” in US energy markets caused by the advent of shale gas.But Henri Proglio, chief executive of the French group, said the drop in prices caused by shale gas had “no significant impact” on plans to build new nuclear capacity in Britain, where EDF is locked in long-running negotiations with the government over terms for constructing new atomic power stations.“We continue to work with the British government and expect to have a decision by the end of the year,” Mr Proglio said, declining to give more details.He was speaking as EDF, boosted by the effects of a cold winter in its main European markets, reported a better than expected 6 per cent like-for-like growth in core earnings and raised its forecast for the full year to growth of at least 3 per cent, from a range of 0-3 per cent.EDF, majority owned by the French state, announced that it was pulling out of CENG, its joint venture in the US with Exelon which operates five nuclear plants. Exelon will take over operation of the CENG plants while EDF will exercise a put option to sell its 49.9 per cent stake in the venture between 2016 and 2022. EDF will also receive an immediate special dividend of $400m.EDF, which operates France’s 58 nuclear plants, had originally planned to build four new nuclear plants in the US. But Mr Proglio said the prospects for nuclear power in the US had been hit by “a true revolution” caused by the exploitation of shale deposits, which had “completely reshaped the landscape of electric power generation in favour of gas”.Mr Proglio said EDF would switch its focus in the US to renewable energy sources.However, he said the effects of shale gas would not alter the “well reasoned” long-term decision by successive British governments to opt for new nuclear capacity to help the UK meet carbon emission targets without the lights going out.EDF, also hit by the retreat from nuclear power in Japan and Germany, is keen to increase capacity in the UK where it already operates existing plants and is a major electricity distributor. But negotiations with the government to build two new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset have been painstaking.The two sides are wrangling over the capital cost of the project, which could be a €14bn investment, and the “strike price” – the guaranteed long-term price for electricity produced by the new reactors. A person familiar with the talks said in May that consensus had been reached that EDF should achieve a 10 per cent return on investment in the plant.EDF said underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 6 per cent to €9.7bn in the first half against the same period last year on revenues up an underlying 4.3 per cent at €39.75bn. Net income was up 3.5 per cent at €2.9bn.Mr Proglio said the cold winter and improved hydropower performance were behind the rise, with EDF also set to benefit from an increase in regulated consumer tariffs in France of 5 per cent in each of this year and next.But Thomas Piquemal, finance director, said consumption by big industrial customers was down 10 per cent in the first half, with only a modest “decrease in the decrease” in June.EDF said it had made savings of €360m in the first half as part of a programme to cut costs by €1bn in the whole year, helping it reduce net debt to €33.7bn at the end of June, down from €39.2bn at the end of 2012.

20;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;New Jersey nuclear plant in storm warning;;The Oyster Creek nuclear power plant on the coast of New Jersey, the oldest large commercial reactor in the US, has issued an alert warning of high water levels as a result of hurricane Sandy, which hit the east coast on Monday night.The alert – the second-lowest of four levels classified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission – signals “actual or potential substantial degradation in the level of safety of the plant”, but no dangerous release of radioactive material.Chicago-based Exelon, the owner of the plant which is about 70 miles south of New York and 60 miles east of Philadelphia, shut down the facility for refuelling last week, but radioactive spent fuel stored at the site could potentially cause problems.The NRC said water levels in the structure used to take in water for cooling exceeded “high water level criteria” at about 8.45pm EST, because of a combination of a “rising tide, wind direction and storm surge”. It added that it expected water levels to subside over the coming hours.The NRC pointed out that all US nuclear plants had back-up diesel generators to provide power for cooling systems in emergencies, and had flood protection above the levels of the predicted storm surge.“Key components and systems are housed in watertight buildings capable of withstanding hurricane-force winds and flooding,” it added.Under the alert, the NRC says, any potential releases of radioactive material would be limited to a “small fraction” of the levels that would cause concerns about human health.The more serious levels of incident, site area emergency and general emergency, could involve potentially dangerous releases of radiation.Other recent alerts raised with the NRC have included a fire at a plant in Nebraska and an earthquake near a plant in Virginia, both in 2011, and a tornado that hit a plant in Michigan in 2010. All of those problems were resolved without developing into serious incidents.The fact that the Oyster Creek reactor is not in operation does not in itself mean that it is risk-free. Unit 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan was also shut down when the earthquake and tsunami hit in March 2011, but tackling its spent fuel pool to make it safe has been a slow and complicated exercise.The Indian Point reactor in New York state, about 40 miles north of New York City, also closed one of its two units because of “external electric grid issues”, according to its owner, New Orleans-based Entergy.Entergy said on Twitter that the water had reached a maximum level of 9’8” and then subsided, and there was “no challenge to plant due to this water level”.The other nuclear plants in the region affected by Sandy were all still operating normally on Monday evening, except for Dominion Resources’ Millstone 3 plant in Connecticut, which is operating at reduced output to help balance the grid.
21;EXC;Exelon Corp;2012-09-24T19:20:14Z;Nuclear plant plans move closer;;Britain’s plans for a new generation of nuclear plants will take a big step forward this week when three consortiums submit bids for Horizon, the energy group with licences to build nuclear reactors in Anglesey and Gloucestershire.The battle for Horizon, a joint venture between German utilities RWE and Eon which the two put up for sale in March, amounts to a high-stakes contest between three different reactor types, with each consortium saying their design is the right foundation for Britain’s coming nuclear renaissance.UK efforts to build new nuclear power plants involve three main ventures:●Horizon plans two reactors at Wylfa, Anglesey and two more at Oldbury, Gloucestershire. It was put up for sale in March by German energy groups Eon and RWE, with final bids due this week. Reactor makers Westinghouse and Areva have teamed up with Chinese investors to launch rival bids, with Hitachi of Japan also in the mix.●EDF of France plans two reactors at Hinkley Point, Somerset and then two more at Sizewell, Suffolk, with a final investment decision due by the end of the year. Centrica, owner of British Gas, has an option to invest in the plants.●The NuGen consortium comprises GDF Suez of France and Iberdrola of Spain. Scottish and Southern Energy pulled out last year. NuGen plans to build reactors near Sellafield, Cumbria, but a final decision is not due until 2015.“This decision is going to have big implications for the UK, in terms of inward investment, the impact on our manufacturing supply chain and competition,” says Richard Clegg, nuclear director at Lloyd’s Register, the risk management group.Each of the three consortiums is led by a big reactor manufacturer – Westinghouse Electric and Areva, both of whom have formed partnerships with state-owned Chinese groups, and Hitachi. Areva has teamed up with China Guangdong Nuclear Power, and Westinghouse with State Nuclear Power Technology, as well as Exelon, the US power generator. Hitachi is leading an international consortium which has no Chinese role.The deadline for formal bids expires on Friday, with a sale expected to close by the end of the year.At stake is the opportunity to create a bridgehead in one of the industrialised world’s most promising nuclear markets. Nuclear is critical to UK government goals of cutting emissions and keeping the lights on, amid a looming energy gap.That has made it a big draw for developers hit by a cooling of interest in atomic energy after the Fukushima disaster, including moves by Japan and Germany to phase it out altogether.“The UK is a fundamental building block of our business,” says Ric Perez, president of Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba of Japan.Areva and Westinghouse enjoy an advantage over Hitachi in that their reactor designs are much closer to being approved in the UK under a process known as the generic design assessment, or GDA.Regulators issued interim acceptances of Areva’s EPR reactor and Westinghouse’s AP1000 in December but flagged up outstanding issues. Areva has been dealing with these and expects to gain full acceptance soon. That puts it ahead of Westinghouse, which decided to pause its GDA process in December.“We’re halfway round the Ascot racecourse while others are still in the starting stalls,” says Rob Davies, Areva’s head of UK nuclear new-build. Anyone else who wants to enter the UK market “has not even started a process that could last three to four years,” he says.Westinghouse denies it is at a disadvantage. “We decided that when we had a customer for the AP1000 we would restart the GDA process,” says Mike Tynan, chief executive of Westinghouse UK. He says the hiatus “would not impact the forecast commercial operation date for the reactor.”Hitachi is offering a third design, the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, which is licensed in the US, Taiwan and Japan but has yet to be submitted to UK regulators.The company already has four ABWRs operating in Japan, with a fifth 94 per cent complete.An insider says Hitachi’s advantage is that the ABWR is “proven technology” and takes only three and a half years to build – less than rival designs, which can take twice as long. He says even with a four-year design assessment process, Hitachi could still finish building its first UK reactor in 2022 – potentially sooner than its competitors.Indeed, the issue of building schedules has been a painful one for Areva. Its two EPRs under construction in France and Finland are behind schedule and over-budget.Areva says this is often the case with first-of-a-kind reactors, and thanks to the so-called “fleet effect”, the cost of reactors falls as more are built. It stresses the EPRs it is building in China have been on time and on cost, partly thanks to the discipline and project management skills of partner China Guangdong – one of the world’s top nuclear developers, with 18 nuclear plants under construction.Areva points to a presentation by China’s National Energy Administration which shows the EPRs being built in China are 11 per cent cheaper than the AP1000s, in terms of average investment per unit of installed generating capacity.Advocates of the Westinghouse bid say Britain could benefit from having a diverse range of reactors. The EPR will be built in the UK even if Areva’s consortium does not end up buying Horizon: EDF Energy is expected to build two of the French-designed reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset.“The UK needs diverse technologies for new nuclear, in order to ensure security of supply, value for UK manufacturing and more UK jobs for the long-term,” Mr Tynan says.That view is backed by others. “The government will not want to have all their eggs in one basket,” one nuclear industry consultant says.Areva disagrees. “Staying with one design gives more opportunity for UK companies to gear up to supply because their order books will be longer,” says Mr Davies. He says the UK nuclear building industry perished precisely “because it had too many designs and could not agree on one.”
22;EXC;Exelon Corp;2012-07-22T19:08:21Z;Two consortiums interested in reactors;;The management of Horizon, the energy group, and government officials are to start detailed talks with potential investors, including Chinese state-owned power groups, about building nuclear reactors in Anglesey and Gloucestershire.At least two consortiums have told the government and Horizon, which is being sold by German energy groups Eon and RWE, that they are interested in bidding for the venture, which plans to build new reactors near the sites of existing nuclear plants at Wylfa, Anglesey, and Oldbury, Gloucestershire.The first is led by Toshiba Westinghouse, the Japanese-owned nuclear reactor manufacturer, in partnership with State Nuclear Power Technology Corp of China and Exelon, the US power generator.The second comprises Areva, the French state-controlled reactor manufacturer, and China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp, possibly in partnership with other energy groups and investors.SNPTC is a subsidiary of China National Nuclear Corp set up to develop “third-generation” nuclear technologies and already has joint ventures with Toshiba-Westinghouse. CGNPC is also state-owned and is building new reactors with Areva in southern China.It is thought that GE Hitachi, the US-Japanese nuclear joint venture, is also interested in bidding, but it would be at a disadvantage as it has not started the long process of getting its reactor technology licensed in the UK, unlike Areva and Toshiba Westinghouse.People familiar with the bidding process say detailed due diligence work had now started on submitting final bids for Horizon by the end of September, including meetings early this week between Horizon management, government officials and representatives of Toshiba Westinghouse.Areva and Horizon declined to comment, while Toshiba Westinghouse could not be reached.Luc Oursel, chief executive of Areva, said in July that RWE and Eon were expected to make a decision on a successful bidder “probably by the end of the year”. They announced the sale of Horizon in March as a result of the German government’s decision to phase out nuclear power following last year’s crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi reactor in Japan.Rosatom, Russia’s state-owned nuclear group, had expressed an interest in building reactors in the UK, but would be seen as less desirable because, like GE Hitachi, it has not yet begun the process of getting approval for its reactor designs from the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation.The new wave of nuclear development in the UK is being led by EDF, the French state-controlled energy group, which is aiming to make a final decision by the end of the year on whether to build a new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset in partnership with Centrica, owner of British Gas.Horizon’s nuclear projects are less advanced, and a joint venture between Iberdrola of Spain and GDF Suez of France is not due to make a final decision on building a new reactor at Sellafield in Cumbria until 2015.Additional reporting by Leslie Hook in Beijing
23;EXC;Exelon Corp;2012-05-03T21:33:57Z;Chinese groups eye UK nuclear programme;;"The Chinese government could end up with a stake in Britain’s nuclear programme, with two Beijing-backed energy groups involved in talks to buy the Horizon consortium from its German owners.Eon and RWE put their joint venture, which plans to build two reactors in Britain, up for sale in March, prompting widespread fears about Britain’s energy strategy. Nomura was appointed last week to find a buyer.At least two loosely formed consortia are weighing up rival bids for the Horizon sites at Wylfa in north Wales and Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire. Western utilities, Chinese state-owned power companies and sovereign wealth funds are involved in talks, the Financial Times has learnt.The discussions are being closely watched by the UK government, which is relying on the success of a nuclear programme to ensure that the country meets its energy needs in the next decade – and its climate commitments beyond that.“The stakes really are high, this is about the lights staying on,” a Whitehall insider said.Officials are aware that the prospect of China investing in Britain’s nuclear energy programme will not escape criticism.Centrica has indicated that it might withdraw from a separate consortium with EDF, the French energy group, to build other nuclear plants.GDF Suez, which controls the Nugen joint venture with Iberdrola, the Spanish energy group, warned last week that it would not make any decision on whether to invest in a new nuclear site in Cumbria until 2015.Horizon had hoped to get its first new nuclear station operational by 2020, a timetable that may now slip. The joint venture could generate up to 6,600 MW of power.According to three people familiar with the matter, the government and Horizon have been talking to two fledgling consortia although “the parts are still coming together”.One potential bidder is GDF, which is considering a joint bid with its Nugen partner, Iberdrola.The other potential consortium involves Japan’s Westinghouse, owned by Toshiba, with a western utility, a Chinese group – either China Guangdong Nuclear Power or China’s State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation – and potentially a sovereign wealth fund.George Osborne, the chancellor, has been trying to drum up Chinese investment in British infrastructure.Chinese investment in UK energy will be controversial but is not unprecedented: Guangdong owns Kalahari, a UK uranium company, and PetroChina has invested in Grangemouth, the Scottish oil refinery.The joint venture needs owners with deep pockets who can pay for the building costs.Exelon, a US power group, has also expressed an interest in buying Horizon. But EDF has been discouraged from bidding on the basis that the government wants a broad spread of interest.Britain has almost unanimous political support for its nuclear programme; a vote on nuclear expansion in November 2010 was passed by 520 to 27.GDF Suez, Eon, Iberdrola and RWE declined to comment. Npower, RWE’s UK arm, said it was confident that it would sell Horizon.Exelon said it “continually evaluates all opportunities to add value for our shareholders, including M&A”."
24;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-12-21T22:37:04Z;DoJ tells Exelon to sell three plants in Maryland;;The US Department of Justice on Wednesday said it would require Exelon, the US power company, to divest three power plants in Maryland before approving its $7.9bn acquisition of rival Constellation Energy.The DOJ’s antitrust division said the asset sales were vital to retain competition as the combined company will have assets worth about $72bn, annual revenues of about $33bn, and will control up to 28 per cent of the generating capacity in the mid-Atlantic region.The Exelon-Constellation deal, announced in April, follows a series of similar moves in the struggling US energy industry. The sector has turned to consolidation to offset the impact of weak electricity prices and other headwinds.In total, Exelon will have to sell plants with a generating capacity of more than 2,600 megawatts of capacity but that represents a very small portion of the combined company’s overall generating capability.“We are pleased to have reached yet another important milestone in completing our merger with Constellation,” said Christopher Crane, Exelon president and chief operating officer. “We continue to expect that we will finalise the merger in early 2012.”Earlier this month, Exelon reached a tentative settlement with several state and local regulators after agreeing to provide a package of benefits to Maryland, the city of Baltimore and other parties worth about $1bn.Still, the deal still has to clear a number of other regulatory hurdles, including final court approval of the DoJ settlement and reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.In midday trading, Exelon shares, which have held steady over the year to date, rose about 2 per cent to $43.06 on the news. Constellation shares, which have gained about 30 per cent over the year to date, climbed about 2 per cent to $39.16.
25;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;EPA toughens rules on US power emissions;;The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday released tough new rules that will impose for the first time nationwide limits on the emission of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from certain US power plants.“This has been 20 years in the making,” Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, said in Washington. “This is a great victory for public health.”The EPA estimates that the total health and economic benefits of the new standards will be as much as $90bn a year. Power plants are among the largest US source of pollutants such as mercury that have been linked to a range of disorders, including developmental problems in children.Ms Jackson also touted the job-creating potential of the new rules. While the measures will cost about $9.6bn to implement, she said that installing and maintaining new pollution controls would provide 46,000 short-term construction jobs and 8,000 long-term utility jobs.The regulations have provoked a storm of criticism from owners of coal-fired power plants that may have to pay for expensive retrofits to their plants, or even be forced to shut them down, to meet the new standards.Steve Miller, head of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a lobby group backed by US coal miners, said the rules would “destroy jobs, raise the cost of energy and could even make electricity less reliable”.However, the energy industry has been far from united on the issue. Owners of nuclear power and gas-fired power plants such as Exelon have backed the measures, arguing that they will encourage a switch to cleaner technologies.Eric Svenson, vice-president of policy and environment at PSEG, the New Jersey-based power company, said the rules were “overdue” and praised the EPA for adopting a pragmatic approach.In its final ruling, the EPA offered some concessions to the power industry. The agency said it would encourage state authorities to give companies longer to implement new emission reduction technologies and made several technical adjustments to its earlier proposals.Mr Svenson noted that, despite the outcry from some interest groups, much of the industry was already compliant with the new standards. PSEG has already spent about $1.6bn on upgrading three of its power plants.According to the EPA, which has been trying to regulate power plant emissions for about two decades, there are about 1,100 coal units and about 300 oil-fired units at power plants in the US that will be covered by the rules.Susan Tierney, managing principal with Analysis Group and a former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Energy, said the rules would provide “certainty for investment decisions in the electric power industry”, adding that the EPA had already regulated toxic pollution from most other important sources.Frances Beinecke, president of the National Resources Defence Council, said: “We can breathe easier today. After decades of industry-induced delay, the EPA did exactly what it was designed to do: look out for our health and our environment.”
26;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-11-17T10:59:22Z;US hotrod plants turn to ‘uprates’;;"Nuclear engineers in America today have become like custom car mechanics. With the great majority of US electricity companies deciding that new reactors are too expensive to build, the industry’s focus has been on squeezing more power out of its existing fleet. Like hotrods, US nuclear plants are being tuned and tweaked for maximum performance.Cheaper, simpler and more flexible than new plant construction, “uprates” to increase a plant’s output by installing new equipment are generally much more attractive to investors. Exelon, the largest US nuclear generator, which embarked on its second programme of uprates two years ago, argues that they are one of the most cost-effective means available for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power generation.The latest new nuclear plant to come on line in the US was Watts Bar 1, in Tennessee, in 1996. Since then, though, the country has added about 4,400MW of additional nuclear capacity through uprates; equivalent to four new reactors.However, this apparent miracle source of cheap power is also exhaustible: there are limits to how far any reactor can have its electricity output boosted.For new nuclear construction in the US, the most significant reactors have not been the ones that melted down at Fukushima, but the new ones under construction at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France, which have gone far behind schedule and over budget.The biggest problem is not public resistance to nuclear power and concerns about safety, but the reluctance of investors to finance multibillion-dollar projects that carry such huge commercial risks.Worldwide, the nuclear industry invariably has heavy government involvement, whether through state ownership or intervention in the market. The more laisser faire approach of the US exposes private sector investors, both shareholders and lenders, to the risk of failure.Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a think-tank that promotes energy efficiency and renewable power, says: “There is too much cost and financial risk to attract investors to nuclear. Not a single new nuclear plant is being built anywhere in a wholly free-market transaction.”The two nuclear construction projects that are making real progress in the US, Southern Company’s plan for two new reactors at the Vogtle plant in Georgia, and Scana’s for two more at the Summer plant in South Carolina, both rely on significant participation by public sector utilities and favourable attitudes from regulators, allowing costs to be passed on to customers. Vogtle is also backed by an $8.33bn federal government loan guarantee, standing behind more than half the project’s $14bn cost and putting taxpayers’ money at risk in the event of a default.Even so, the companies are still facing significant commercial risks.It is understandable that Tom Fanning, the chief executive of Southern Company, has a TV screen in his office where he can watch the progress at the Vogtle site around the clock: his future will depend on the project’s success. Southern’s commitment, based on its 45.7 per cent stake in Vogtle, is $6.1bn; about one-sixth of its market capitalisation of $37.5bn.For the much smaller Scana, the commitment is even greater. It expects to invest $5.8bn as its 55 per cent share of the $10bn Summer project: more than its $5.5bn market capitalisation. Moody’s, the rating agency, downgraded Scana’s debt in September, describing its nuclear plans as “transformative” and “out of scale to the size of the company”.Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace, is now a co-chair of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, an industry-backed group that campaigns for nuclear power, in part because of its role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He argues that the lack of effective risk-sharing between investors, companies and government is standing in the way of a revival of nuclear investment.“The capital markets are nervous,” he says. “The piece that has to come is a clear signal from government that it will back the industry with loan guarantees.”As things stand, he says, the conditions and administrative complexity attached to loan guarantees have in some cases actually made them a deterrent to investment, rather than an incentive.Power uprates, on the other hand, do not need loan guarantees. The increased capacity is much cheaper than for new build – Exelon has estimated an investment cost of $2.2m-$2.5m per added megawatt, about half that of a new reactor – and also comes in bite-size chunks rather than a single lump. An uprate project will typically add tens of megawatts to a plant’s capacity, and at most about 300MW.Exelon’s plan to add up to 1300MW, about 8 per cent, to its nuclear capacity by 2017 though 17 uprates at nine plants is not going to transform the company, but is a much more reassuring prospect for investors than if it had decided to add the same amount by building a new plant.As the largest unregulated generator in the US, selling its power on the open market, Exelon is exposed to swings in electricity prices, and the slump in those prices sent its shares down from more than $91 at their peak in 2008 to about $44 today.Hugh Wynne, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, says the nuclear uprate plan is a way to offer growth to shareholders, while avoiding the cost and risk of new nuclear plant construction. Similarly, Exelon’s $7.9bn attempt to buy Maryland-based Constellation Energy, now under review by regulators, would add 3.7GW of nuclear capacity to Exelon’s 17.0GW nuclear fleet at a fraction of new build costs.“That’s the strategy: they are grinding earnings growth out of uprates, out of some relatively small renewables projects, and out of expected cost savings from the Constellation deal,” he says.“And that makes sense. The companies that tend to get their comeuppance are the ones that bet the farm.”There will come a time, however, when all the possible uprating has been done. The modifications involved typically fall into two categories: fitting more advanced instruments, to allow reactors to be run at finer tolerances, and using larger and more sophisticated equipment such as turbines and transformers on the power generation side of the plant. It is the second type that can deliver the largest output gains, but the maximum increase that has been approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is 20 per cent.There may be further technological fixes available in the future.Lightbridge, a company that is developing an innovative nuclear fuel that could deliver a 17 per cent output increase from existing reactors, this month signed up a new advisory board including executives from Exelon and Duke Energy and Dominion, two other leading nuclear generators, in a sign of their interest in the new fuel.Ultimately, however, the US will be forced to address the question of how many new nuclear plants it wants.“It’s a bit odd that the most powerful country in the world should be outdone for nuclear construction by so many other places,” says Mr Moore.“There are countries that are building more reactors, and many that want to start producing nuclear power for the first time. A lot of other countries have made very significant progress.”"
27;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-10-27T04:05:57Z;Exelon backs tighter pollution standards;;"Exelon, one of the largest US electricity groups, has backed tighter federal standards for pollution control, saying they can be met without excessive damage to energy supplies by the increased use of natural gas for power generation.That sets Exelon against other leading US power groups, which have warned that new regulations will drive up electricity prices and could threaten the reliability of supplies.The argument, presented by Exelon in a report published on Thursday, will strengthen the hand of the US government’s Environmental Protection Agency in its attempt to impose tighter controls on pollutants from coal-fired plants, which has been described as a regulatory “train wreck” by Republicans.It will also chip away at the case for further government support for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.John Rowe, Exelon’s chief executive, told the Financial Times: “The EPA’s emissions rules are actively helpful, because they force some of the oldest, dirtiest coal plants off the grid, and create room for cleaner, more efficient gas plants.”Exelon, which is the largest generator of nuclear power in the US, stands to benefit from closures of coal-fired plants.Two proposed EPA emissions regulations have been particularly controversial: the cross-state air pollution rule, which limits sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain; and the air toxics rule, which controls pollutants such as mercury and arsenic.Power groups including Georgia-based Southern Company and Texas-based Luminant, which is part of Energy Future Holdings, have argued strongly that these rules will force shutdowns of coal plants, costing jobs and putting strain on the electricity system.Mr Rowe expressed scepticism that the new rules would threaten the reliability of power supplies. “I see very few areas where there are real reliability issues, and where they exist, it’s often because people weren’t prepared.”However, Exelon is also arguing that, while the EPA’s targets can be hit, some government policies, such as states’ support for renewable energy, are expensive and ineffective ways of achieving pollution control objectives.It is publishing calculations showing costs and emissions under various scenarios, which show that a mix of increased use of gas, greater energy efficiency and updates to the power output of existing nuclear power plants is a far more cost-effective strategy than investing heavily in wind, solar and new nuclear plants, or fitting emissions reduction equipment to old coal plants.The opening up of large reserves of previously uncommercial US gas through the techniques of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has raised hopes that prices will remain low, making gas an attractive fuel for power generation.US natural gas is about $3.60 per million British thermal units, down from over $13 in 2008.“Every forecast we can find says that with shale gas, prices are going to stay low for at least a decade, and maybe longer,” Mr Rowe said.He added that states’ policies to support favoured energy sources such as renewables, nuclear and advanced coal were distorting market forces and preventing the lowest-cost solution – gas – from being more widely used.Renewable portfolio standards, which specify the proportion of electricity that must come from sources such as wind and solar, were not too expensive if kept to 10-15 per cent, he said, but California’s target of 33 per cent by 2020 was likely to be hugely costly, at $100-$200 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions avoided. In comparison, the Waxman-Marley bill that failed to pass though Congress in 2009 envisaged a carbon price of $17-$22 per ton in 2020."
28;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-10-13T19:34:47Z;Exelon takes on EDF over Constellation bid;;"Exelon, the Illinois-based electricity generator, has gone into battle with EDF of France over the US group’s $7.9bn bid for Constellation Energy, the Maryland-based power company.EDF, which has a nuclear power joint venture with Constellation, on Wednesday launched an attempt to block the deal, telling Maryland’s public service commission, the state’s energy regulator, that the takeover could be ‘”substantially detrimental both to EDF and to Maryland”.On Thursday, Exelon hit back, saying it was “perplexed” by the French company’s arguments, and added: “EDF’s approval is not required for the merger to proceed.”The Maryland commission will begin hearings on the proposed deal the week after next, and plans to deliver a decision by January 5 next year.The conflict has cast a shadow over Exelon’s plans, announced in April , to use the takeover of Constellation to create a better fit between its power generation and supply businesses.The merged group would rank alongside Georgia-based Southern Company as the largest US energy utility by market capitalisation, worth about $36bn.EDF has a 7.3 per cent stake in Constellation, making it the company’s second-largest shareholder, but the focus of its concerns is their nuclear power joint venture, Constellation Energy Nuclear Group, which owns five reactors with a combined capacity of about 4,000 megawatts.EDF and Constellation formed an alliance in 2008, including a joint venture to build new reactors, but after relations between the two companies became increasingly strained, and hopes of a large-scale new nuclear programme in the US faded, they unwound that joint venture a year ago.However, EDF retained its holding of 49.99 per cent in CENG, which is worth about $300m a year in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to the French group.In his testimony to the Maryland regulator, Jeffrey Johnson, a director of CENG who spoke on behalf of EDF, argued that the takeover of Constellation by Exelon would prevent CENG expanding any further because of competition concerns; create a conflict of interest because Exelon would want to support its own wholly owned nuclear plants more than the joint venture, and hurt employment and tax revenues in Maryland because management would be transferred to Exelon’s headquarters out of the state.He urged the regulator to block the deal or, failing that, to insist on “ringfencing” to protect CENG’s autonomy.In response, Exelon said the deal would not affect EDF’s relationship with CENG or its ability to build new generating plants.It added: “EDF will be unharmed by the merger, a transaction that will bring significant benefits to BGE [Baltimore Gas and Electric, Constellation’s supply business] customers, the Maryland economy and both companies’ shareholders.”"
29;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-08-07T18:25:06Z;M&A by US energy utilities at four-year high;Broader, more diversified businesses the goal;Mergers and acquisitions by US energy utilities rose to their highest level for four years in the first half of this year, emphasising how consolidation is being driven by low prices for natural gas, demand for heavy investment and more willingness by regulators to accept deals.PricewaterhouseCoopers, the professional services firm, says $52bn of deals for electricity and gas companies were announced in the first six months of this year – the strongest such period for M&A since 2007.The largest deals announced to date this year have been Duke Energy’s $26bn acquisition of Progress Energy, Exelon’s $11.5bn deal for Constellation Energy, and AES’s $4.7bn takeover of DPL. All the valuations include debt.John McConomy, PwC’s US utilities and power transactions leader, said recent deals were often driven by energy companies’ attempts to broaden and to diversify their businesses.The shale gas boom, which has caused a rise in US natural gas production as the industry has opened up reserves in shales and other rocks previously unviable economically, has driven down prices for both gas and electricity.Companies that have relied on power generation for a high proportion of their earnings have sought to cut their exposure to electricity price risk by acquiring a larger customer base – which generally delivers more stable returns – or regulated businesses that earn profits agreed by state authorities.Mr McConomy said: “For some companies Wall Street has been saying to them: ‘You are too heavily weighted in the non-regulated business, and you need some more regulated earnings.’”The objective of securing more regulated business drove the first substantial acquisition of a UK utility by a US energy company for about a decade: PPL’s $6.4bn purchase of Central Networks, the British electricity distribution company, from Eon of Germany.Another factor behind recent deals has been the need for companies to grow so they have the financial strength needed to fund heavy investment programmes to replace ageing assets and to meet fresh environmental regulations.Mr McConomy said it was not yet clear what effect the recent market turmoil would have on the sector. “Most utilities in the sector feel pretty positive about the future,” he said. “If we see more rock and rolling [in the markets] we’re going to have to see how that affects things.”M&A in the sector slumped after the financial crisis that began in 2007, recovered in 2010 and then gathered strength in 2011.
30;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-04-29T02:45:20Z;Exelon to buy Constellation in $7.9bn deal;;Exelon, the largest US power company, is buying its rival Constellation Energy in a $7.9bn all-share deal. The acquisition would diversify Exelon’s business, give it more retail customers, and allow it to use its greater financial strength to improve profitability.After years of slow progress in the consolidation of the fragmented US utility sector, with regulators thwarting several proposed deals, the pace of merger and acquisition activity has accelerated since last year.The Exelon/Constellation deal follows Duke Energy’s move in January to acquire Progress Energy, offering $13.7bn in stock and taking on $12.2bn in net debt, and the agreement last week for AES to buy Ohio-based DPL for $4.7bn including debt.In all three deals there are common themes. Weak electricity prices are pushing generation companies to reduce their exposure to power markets and seek more stable retail businesses and regulated assets, said industry bankers.Creating larger utilities with access to cheaper funds should also reduce risk in the industry, after many companies found themselves starved of funds during the financial crisis.Exelon and Constellation said on Thursday that their deal was a good fit because it provided a better match of generation capacity and customer demand.Exelon expects to generate about 165.9 terawatt hours of electricity this year, but has demand from its own customers for only 107.8 TWh, while Constellation expects demand for 105.99 TWh but will only generate about 60.2 TWh.A better match between generation and customers reduces market risk and improves profitability, the companies said.Exelon also sees an opportunity to save money at Constellation by borrowing at more favourable rates. It has a BBB+ grade from Fitch, the rating agency, which was affirmed with a stable outlook on Thursday, while Constellation is rated BBB-.However, that financial strength is unlikely to be deployed towards investment in new nuclear plants. John Rowe, Exelon’s chief executive who will step down once the deal is completed, on Thursday repeated his long-held line that building new reactors was commercially unattractive while electricity and gas prices were at their present levels.Mr Rowe will be replaced as chief executive by Exelon’s chief operating officer, Chris Crane. Mayo Shattuck, CEO of Constellation, will become chairman.The deals stymied by regulators in the past include a planned tie-up between Constellation and Florida’s FPL, scrapped in 2006 after opposition in Maryland.However, people close to the deal pointed out that the Maryland regulator had a new group of commissioners, and that the state had approved the merger between FirstEnergy and Allegheny in January.Barclays Capital, JPMorgan, Evercore and Loop Capital Markets advised Exelon on the deal. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse advised Constellation.
31;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-04-28T21:35:45Z;US GDP data weigh on markets;;Wall Street continued to trend upwards following the multiyear highs reached in the previous session, but sentiment was held back slightly by mixed earnings reports from industry bellwethers ExxonMobil and Procter & Gamble and disappointing data on US economic growth.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company by market capitalisation, reported a 69 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn, largely on the back of high oil prices. A record performance in Exxon’s chemicals division also helped, and earnings came in at $2.14 per share, ahead of the $2.07 expected by analysts.But the recent jump in energy prices had left the markets with extremely high expectations for the oil giant, and so the stock was down 0.5 per cent at $87.34 following the results. The stock has still gained 19.3 per cent, however, since the start of the year.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Procter & Gamble reported weak sales growth of less than 1 per cent in developed markets and said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.But thanks to emerging market growth, overall net sales increased by 4.5 per cent, which helped to negate any negative impact on the stock from slower domestic growth. The stock was mostly flat throughout the day, but was up 0.8 per cent at $64.50 at the close.These mixed results left the wider markets struggling for direction for much of the session, but in late trading the overwhelming optimism in the markets thanks to the surprising good earnings season so far won out.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,360.48, its highest point since June 2008. The S&P has risen 1.8 per cent this week as first-quarter earnings have largely beaten forecasts. So far, 78 per cent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have beaten analysts’ expectations, ahead of the 73 per cent beat-rate in the last quarter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,763.31 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,872.53.Sentiment was not helped by news that the rate of growth in the US economy had slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the 3.1 per cent rate in the same period a year ago. This was below the 2 per cent growth rate expected by economists.“We can see that headwinds like commodity price inflation and the slow rate of job creation are dragging on the US economy,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Hennion & Walsh. “This raises concerns about the sustainability of the US economy when the government stimulus comes to an end,” he said.Starbucks also reported mixed results, leaving the coffee chain 0.8 per cent lower at $36.88. The company reported worldwide net earnings up 20 per cent to $261m as well as a 20 per cent rise in sales growth in China, but margins were hit by higher coffee prices.In deal news, Constellation Energy rose 5.7 per cent to $36.26 after Exelon agreed to buy the electricity generator and utility operator. Exelon shares were up 1.7 per cent to $42.18.The all-stock deal valued at $7.9bn would create a US utility to rival Duke Energy and Progress Energy as the country’s largest power group. Duke was up 0.8 per cent to $18.68 while Progress added 0.8 per cent to $47.32.Sprint Nextel added 6.7 per cent to $5.11 after reporting that its loss had narrowed by nearly half as the wireless carrier continued to add customers.Aetna results were another bright spot, with the stock rising 4.1 per cent to $41.45 after the health insurer raised its 2011 profit target and reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Ebayreported steady earnings growth for the first quarter of 2011, driven mainly by its payment arm. But investors were disappointed, and the stock was down 0.1 per cent to $34.Eastman Kodak, the troubled photography group, sank 10.1 per cent to $2.85 after swinging to a first-quarter loss of 92 cents a share. The company also reported that revenues fell 31 per cent amid continuing declines in its film segment.Evergreen Solar slumped after the company said it may need to raise cash to continue operations after first-quarter sales fell short of expectations. The stock tumbled 31.7 per cent to $1.42.Skechers lost 7.5 per cent to $19.02 after the maker of Shape-ups toning shoes reported first-quarter profit of 24 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate by 20 per cent.
32;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-04-28T19:28:30Z;Exelon/Constellation: star-crossed deal?;Multiple sets of regulators need to be mollified before takeover goes ahead;Exelon’s all-share $7.9bn bid for Constellation Energy would cement its status as the largest US nuclear plant operator. It would also probably enhance earnings per share. That is not a great accomplishment these days for deals financed by idle cash or cheap debt, but doing so through an all-share deal with a bid premium is impressive. Synergies, the pixie dust of the merger world, are a modest $260m annually (mainly from reduced overhead and collateral) by 2013, just half a per cent of combined enterprise value and 4.5 per cent of operating costs. That is below average for utility mergers.So why does the deal work? Because Exelon can offer something like cheap debt: expensive shares. Not only do investors value Exelon’s earnings more highly than Constellation’s, but they pay a 70 per cent premium per megawatt of owned generation. Exelon has simply been a far more stable, better-run company than Constellation.Constellation nearly went bust in 2008 and had to be rescued by a Berkshire Hathaway unit that agreed to buy it for cash. France’s EDF then swooped in with a richer package in order to secure a nuclear joint-venture that has since soured. Constellation’s latest retail push, while probably wise, has not been rewarded in the stock market.Berkshire’s opportunism and EDF’s desperation came in handy for Constellation’s owners, but only enough to salvage a negative 9 per cent return over the past decade. By contrast, an investment in Exelon grew shareholder wealth by two-thirds.If the deal works then both sets of shareholders should be pleased, but that is a big “if.” Not only have two outright bids for Constellation failed but Exelon has seen three acquisitions go poof and multiple sets of regulators need to be mollified. The stars will have to line up just right this time.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
33;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
34;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-04-20T15:22:38Z;AES to buy DPL for $3.5bn in consolidation bid;;"AES, the Virginia-based global power producer, has agreed to buy DPL, a regional energy company, in a transaction valued, on an enterprise basis, at $4.7bn.Under the terms of the deal, announced on Wednesday, AES will pay $30 per share in cash to DPL shareholders, for a total of $3.5bn for the equity, and assume $1.2bn in net debt. The purchase price represents close to a 9 per cent premium to DPL’s closing stock price of $27.59 on Tuesday.The deal follows a string of moves in recent months as the sprawling US power sector, of some 250 midsize and large utilities and distribution companies, attempts to consolidate.The process has been difficult; regulators have scuppered previous merger attempts by utilities, making companies uncomfortable about their own prospects.FPL, which owns Florida’s largest utility, abandoned a $11.4bn takeover attempt of Constellation Energy group in 2006 after a face-off with regulators in Maryland, where Constellation is based. Exelon, a utility based in Chicago, dropped its plan in 2006 to buy Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey amid concerns by regulators in that state.In both cases, legislators raised concerns that the combined utility groups could lead to higher power rates.Activity picked up again this past year, however, when Duke Energy announced its $13.8bn takeover of Progress Energy and Northeast Utilities announced its acquisition of Nstar for $4.1bn in shares.Paul Hanrahan, AES president and chief executive, said: “We are concentrating our growth efforts in a few key markets, including the US utility sector, where we see opportunities to leverage our global platform of 40,500MW and 11.5m utility customers’’.He expects the acquisition of DPL to benefit from the regional scale provided by its nearby utility business at Indianapolis Power & Light. DPL serves more than 500,000 customers in West Central Ohio.DPL will remain a standalone business, with local management and corporate functions, but it will be able to leverage the expertise and resources of AES’ global portfolio. DPL headquarters will remain in Dayton, and the company will continue to use the local name.The deal remains subject to approval of DPL shareholders and state and federal regulators. AES expects approvals within six to nine months.AES has committed bridge financing in place from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Financing will include a combination of non-recourse debt, the re-issuance of corporate debt at AES that was temporarily paid down in 2010, and cash on hand.AES shares rose more than 2 per cent, to $12.75, before the market opened. Shares of DPL soared 8 per cent to $29.92.Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial adviser, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom served as legal counsel to AES. DPL’s financial adviser on the transaction was UBS Investment Bank, and its legal adviser was Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft."
35;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Doubts raised over US atomic plants;;US regulators have privately expressed doubts that some of the nation’s nuclear power plants are prepared for a Fukushima-scale disaster, according to documents released by an independent safety watchdog.Internal Nuclear Regulatory Commission e-mails and memos obtained by the Union of Concerned Scientists questioned the adequacy of back-up plans to keep cooling systems running if off-site power were lost for an extended period.Those concerns seem to contrast with the confidence US regulators and industry officials have publicly expressed since Japan’s nuclear accident began on March 11, commission officials said.Edwin Lyman, a UCS nuclear expert, said: “While the NRC and the nuclear industry have been reassuring Americans that there is nothing to worry about – that we can do a better job dealing with a nuclear disaster like the one that just happened in Japan – it turns out that privately NRC senior analysts are not so sure.”The e-mails are part of an NRC review of how operators of plants in Delta, Pennsylvania, and Surry County, Virginia, would cope with a prolonged power failure that knocked out cooling systems.In an e-mail on July 28 2010, one NRC staffer said contingency plans for the Peach Bottom nuclear plant in Pennsylvania “have really not been reviewed to ensure that they will work to mitigate severe accidents”.Another undated document said back-up plans included storing equipment that could be useful “when used by knowledgeable operators if post-event conditions allow”.The document went on to note: “If little is known about these post-event conditions, then assuming success is speculative.”The Peach Bottom site, located in Delta and operated by Exelon, uses a General Electric reactor with a similar design to four of the reactors at Fukushima.Officials at the NRC and Exelon did not immediately respond to calls seeking a comment.
36;EXC;Exelon Corp;2011-01-10T20:25:37Z;Duke and Progress hail risk reduction;;Duke Energy and Progress Energy said their deal to create the largest US utility group was intended to create a less risky business that would be better able to execute their plans for heavy capital investment that has ramped up steeply in recent years.Duke Energy is acquiring Progress in a $13.7bn stock-based deal and taking on $12.2bn in net debt.The combination of the two companies, both based in North Carolina, creates a merged group with a market capitalisation of about $36bn and more than 7m customers.Cost overruns at Duke’s innovative low-emissions coal power plant at Edwardsport, Indiana, now expected to cost almost $2.9bn, roughly double the original estimate, have shown how the power supply business can be hit by financial shocks.That project has caused an outcry in the state and provoked pressure on regulators to stop Duke passing on the costs to customers.Duke plans total capital spending of $23bn for the merged group during 2010-12, up 18 per cent from $19.5bn for the two companies in 2007-09.Capital investment allows regulated utilities to earn increased profits, providing they hold costs down and are allowed by regulators to raise prices.The merged company, which will retain the name Duke Energy, would have greater financial strength, geographic spread and diversity of regulators, its executives said.The proportion of Duke’s earnings before interest and tax that come from regulated activities also rises from 77 per cent to 85 per cent for the merged group.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said that while the deal had not changed its grade for either company, both rated Baa2, the acquisition had “several positive attributes”.Jim Hempstead of Moody’s said: “The inherent logic behind the merger is the consolidation of two homogenous, capital-intensive companies, to spread fixed costs across a larger asset platform.”S&P, another rating agency, reiterated its A- grade for Duke, and put Progress, previously BBB+, on watch for a potential upgrade.Being larger should also help the two companies manage their portfolios of nuclear plants, according to one person familiar with the deal. Progress owns four nuclear sites, while Duke has three.Although both companies have expressed interest in building new reactors, competition from cheap gas-fired generation and uncertainty over government incentives, including controls on greenhouse gas emissions, have damped hopes for new nuclear construction in the US.Past attempts at large power utility deals in the US, including Constellation’s proposed merger with Florida Power and Light, and Exelon’s with PSEG of New Jersey, were stymied by regulators.Duke and Progress hope they can avoid that because the only state regulators that need to approve the deal are North and South Carolina.JPMorgan and Bank of America advised Duke, while Lazard and Barclays Capital advised Progress.
37;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Loan terms generate US nuclear obstacles;Pro-nuclear politics stymied by anti-nuclear economics;The US Congress heralded a new dawn for the country’s nuclear industry in 2005, approving federal loan guarantees for reactor construction projects.After a three-decade hiatus following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, nuclear power appeared to be on the verge of a renaissance, with more than 20 new reactor projects proposed by US companies.In a sign of growing political support for nuclear power as a way to secure energy supplies and curb greenhouse gas emissions, Barack Obama, the US president, proposed a further $36bn in loan guarantees.Yet as the politics have swung in favour of nuclear power in the US, the economics have swung against it. By the end of 2008, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission had received applications approvals for 22 new reactors. Last year, there was just one further application, and this year there have been none.Constellation Energy’s decision that it cannot proceed with its $10bn Calvert Cliffs 3 project in Maryland under the loan guarantee terms offered by the government, appears to have dealt a fatal blow to one of the new plants that stood the best chance of going ahead.The short-term problem for the nuclear industry is weak US power demand, which is deterring investment in all types of generation.After falling in the recession, electricity consumption has been recovering this year but is still expected to fall short of its 2007 level.For reactors that will operate for 60 years or more, however, these cyclical fluctuations should not be decisive.The more fundamental problems are the regulatory system and uncertainty over the long-term outlook for electricity prices.In the fragmented electricity market in the US, regulatory frameworks differ widely. In some states, power companies are able to pass on any costs of generation to their consumers, subject to approval from regulators.Southern Company in Georgia has that approval for its Plant Vogtle project, enabling it to raise finance and start preliminary work at the site. It has also secured the only federal loan guarantee agreed so far, for $8.3bn of the estimated $14.5bn cost of building two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.Many other utilities, however – including Constellation – are operating in competitive electricity markets, where nuclear plants have to justify themselves economically against other forms of generation. In those markets, the outlook has been transformed in the past three years by the surge in US production of natural gas from previously uneconomic sources such as shale, which has raised the prospect that electricity prices will be held down, and that gas generation could be competitively advantaged, for many years to come.As John Rowe, chief executive of Exelon, the largest nuclear generator in the US, put it: “Gas is queen.”The challenging competitive position means the private sector will not finance new reactor projects in those markets without loan guarantees. Yet the commercial risks mean the guarantee offered to Constellation was on terms that the company considered prohibitively expensive.The rueful joke in the industry is that the only companies that can get federal loan guarantees are the ones that do not need them.Meanwhile, the one political action that could make a difference to the outlook for nuclear power – imposing a carbon price through a cap-and-trade system or a tax – is off the agenda for the foreseeable future.James Connaughton, Constellation’s vice-president for corporate affairs and policy, said he believed the new plants would eventually have to be built.“There is no reasonable scenario by which we can meet the government’s aims for energy security, air quality and cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, without building in excess of 100 new nuclear plants,” he said.“But the huge roadblocks in the way mean that we will end up doing what we know we must, but with needless delay and at much greater expense.”
38;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-10-08T22:39:54Z;Testing times for dementia diagnosis;;One of the most familiar sounds on the Care of the Elderly ward is that of one person instructing another to “begin from one hundred and count backwards by seven”. It is rarely said just once, but repeated, with variations, at increasing volume: “By seven! No! Backwards!”If you were to look round the curtain for the source of this noise, you would most likely find a medical student, or a first-year doctor – for this is a job that tends to be shunned by the higher ranks – and an elderly person, who may be trying to fold a piece of paper in half and place it on the floor, or draw two overlapping pentagons.They are completing the Mini Mental State Examination, or MMSE, a quiz that aims to provide an objective measure of cognitive function by marking the brain’s ability out of a total possible score of 30. It is one of the primary tools used in the UK to diagnose and plan treatment of dementia.There are an estimated 750,000 people in Britain living with dmentia. There are several forms, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most common. The onset of dementia is often insidious: the path from forgetting the occasional birthday, to having to attach a post-it note to the toaster to remind you that it makes toast can be subtle. There is no distinctive rash, no unequivocal test for dementia (though brain scans can be helpful) so bedside tests like the MMSE are important for diagnosis.The only treatments with any evidence behind them are for Alzheimer’s disease rather than vascular dementia: donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl) and rivastigmine (Exelon). NICE, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, still rations access to these drugs by MMSE score. They are recommended “for people with Alzheimer’s disease of moderate severity only (that is, those with an MMSE score of between 10 and 20 points)”. The number matters, although NICE does accept that the MMSE may give misleading scores in people who were particularly well (or poorly) educated prior to their memory problems, or in non-English-speakers, or in those with learning disabilities.Other questions, to do with how the test works in the clinical setting, are less measurable and so less easy to answer. Can patients learn the quiz? (most people will undergo it more than once, as they encounter new doctors, or as part of staging of their memory loss). Or – particularly in hospital – can they even hear it? If everyone else on the ward can hear the command to “spell ‘World’ backwards”, perhaps the subject cannot.The MMSE was designed in 1975 by two American psychiatrists, Martin and Susan Folstein. Easy to administer, quick and free, it soon became the standard test worldwide. It has been well validated, though rarely rigorously interrogated: some researchers have found holes, in its emphasis on verbal skills over other forms of thought, for example. Most doctors can remember chunks of it verbatim (though few can remember it all: memory is a tricky thing). Many use it, as NICE suggests.Not many know that it is no longer free. The MMSE is now copyrighted by an American company called Pyschological Assessment Resources and it can no longer be reproduced without permission. The test is slowly vanishing from websites and textbooks, and hospitals and surgeries must now pay to have people draw pentagons. As this canny reclamation of a worn but ubiquitous tool suggests, the Folsteins’ own cognitive skills appear entirely intact.Sophie Harrison is a hospital doctor in South Yorkshire.
39;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-09-16T17:05:41Z;NRG to buy Green Mountain Energy;;NRG Energy, a US power generation company, is to acquire Green Mountain Energy, a retail provider of clean energy products and services, underlining the interest among generators to expand their renewable energy portfolios.The $350m cash deal, announced on Thursday, will add to solar and wind projects already complementing NRG’s traditional fuel sources, ranging from nuclear to coal and natural gas.It will enable privately held Green Mountain to expand beyond the residential and commercial customers it has, mainly in Texas and the New York metro region.This deal marks the second time this month that a US power supplier has bought into the renewables sector. On September 1, Exelon, the biggest nuclear generator in the US, announced plans to buy John Deere Renewables for as much as $900m to gain a foothold in the wind power industry.There is renewed interest in investing in energy, which has been damped for several years by uncertainty surrounding the economy and proposed energy legislation. While that uncertainty has not cleared, the companies with cash are keen to spend and deals are gathering momentum.The Blackstone Group, an investment and advisory firm, said in August it would acquire Dynegy, a US power generator, in a $4.7bn deal, including the assumption of debt. The deal includes an agreement for Blackstone to sell four of Dynegy’s natural-gas fired assets to NRG for $1.36bn cash.NRG also added to its renewables portfolio in June, when it acquired South Trent Wind, a wind farm in Texas, for $111m.“A permanent and fast-growing portion of the American population is seeking to live sustainably across all key phases of their lifestyle, including the energy they use in their homes, at work and in their personal transportation,’’ said David Crane, NRG president and chief executive.“Increasingly, NRG, with our expanding portfolio of wind, solar and biomass initiatives, working with and through Green Mountain, is poised to become the clean energy provider of choice for Americans who want to make a difference for the environment,’’ he said.NRG said the acquisition would contribute $70m to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation annually. The deal is expected to close mid-November.Its operating revenues for the six months ended June 30 were $4.35bn. It had $2.17bn cash on its balance sheet.Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co Securities noted that NRG is not integrating its operations with Green Mountain, which will be run as a standalone business, so there will be no synergies. In a research note, it added, that the firm was “not sure of the value of adding a competing retail brand name.’’NRG shares edged slightly lower to trade at $21.75 at midday in New York.
40;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-09-12T21:45:49Z;Wind: Unexpected lull after decade of following wind;;For most of the past decade, wind energy generation has enjoyed continuous growth, becoming the biggest source of new generating capacity in some of the world’s biggest energy markets, including Europe and the US.But in the past two years, that picture has changed markedly. The industry has received its first serious setbacks in a decade, which have transformed the outlook for the sector.In July, the US wind industry body – the American Wind Energy Association – published figures showing a collapse in the capacity added in the sector. In the second quarter of this year, only 700MW of wind turbines were installed in the US, down 71 per cent from the same period last year.It is set to get worse, according to AWEA, which is forecasting that installations for the whole year are likely to be as much as 45 per cent below 2009 levels.The reversal followed a sudden slowdown in Spain, which had been one of the most active markets for wind energy. It resulted from the dire financial situation and cooling government support for large renewable energy subsidies.Contrast this with the situation only two years ago, when the US, with 25GW of installed capacity, overtook Germany – which had 24GW – as the world’s biggest producer of power from wind.Spain, with 17GW of installed capacity, came third in the global market.What happened?The recession certainly played a big role, particularly in Spain’s case. Companies found it much harder to gain the investment they needed.In addition, as the recession bit, energy demand weakened, which contributed to lower energy prices, which made wind a much less attractive investment.But in the US, there was an additional dimension to the problem, as legislation that would have provided a boost to renewable energy was stalled. Wind companies had been banking on the legislation to bring in a renewable energy standard (RES) that would mandate the use of a certain amount of energy from sources such as wind and solar.The AWEA, in its gloomy forecast, pointed to the lack of a renewable energy standard as the main factor behind the slowdown in the sector.“The US wind industry is in distress,” says Denise Bode, chief executive of the AWEA. She urged lawmakers in the US to bring forward rules that would aid the sector, and spur economic growth. “Democrats, Republicans, environmental groups, labour unions, and companies across the country all strongly support the RES because it is essential for creating hundreds of thousands of American jobs, reducing carbon emissions, and increasing American independence from foreign oil.”The worsening outlook has prompted some consolidation in the sector – including a recent deal that brought two unlikely partners together. Exelon, the US’s biggest nuclear generator, announced plans to buy John Deere Renewables for about $900m, taking advantage of depressed prices in the wind industry to gain a foothold in renewables.Matt Becker, leader of the Green Energy Tax Services practice at BDO, the accountants, says: “There is so much uncertainty around the pending legislation that the industry has become stagnant waiting to see where the cards will fall. Without knowing exactly what tax incentives are available, energy companies have shied away from taking on any major projects until the legislation is finalised.”Barclays announced in August that because of the difficulties in the key US and Spanish markets, it would reduce its forecast for new wind installations around the world next year by 4 per cent, forecasting additional capacity of 35.3GW instead of the 36.9GW that it had been projecting.Most of that growth is likely to be in Asia. While growth has faltered in the US and parts of Europe, China has been the biggest wind success story of the past few years. By the end of last year, the country had doubled its wind capacity, which stood at 12GW in 2008, to more than 25GW.In 2009, according to the Global Wind Energy Council, new private and public sector investments in core clean energy leapt by 53 per cent in China, and the country added 37GW of total renewable power capacity, which was more than any other country.“China’s wind farm development was the strongest investment feature of last year by far,” says GWEC.China has an official target of 100GW of wind capacity by 2020. At current rates, it will easily surpass that goal.For companies in Europe and the US, the growing strength of China is an opportunity and a threat.Turbine manufacturers including Vestas, General Electric and Siemens have set up factories in China to capitalise on the rapidly emerging market.However, politicians in the US and Europe have expressed concerns that the “green jobs” they were hoping would be created in their countries may turn out to be jobs in China. The race for investment is on.
41;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-08-31T23:07:52Z;Exelon to buy Deere’s wind power unit;;Exelon, the US’s biggest nuclear generator, has announced it will buy John Deere Renewables for as much as $900m to gain a foothold in the wind power industry.Exelon’s attempt to diversify underlines the lack of momentum in the US nuclear industry, despite support given by the Obama administration earlier this year.Under the agreement, Exelon will acquire 735 megawatts of operating wind capacity for $860m. The deal provides for an additional $40m upon commencement of construction on 230 advanced development projects.About 75 per cent of John Deere’s output was sold under long-term power purchase agreements. As part of the deal, Exelon can pursue 1,468MW of new wind projects in various stages of development, including the 230 in advanced stages. It has the option of not continuing with some of the projects.The acquisition signals renewed interest in investment in the energy sector that has been damped for several years by uncertainty surrounding the economy and proposed energy legislation.“Uncertainty really does stifle investment,’’ said Peter Robertson, independent senior advisor for oil & gas at Deloitte and former vice chairman of Chevron’s board. “All of these threats of pending changes add onto the uncertainty.”While that uncertainty has not cleared, those who have stockpiled cash are keen to spend it and deals have gained momentum in recent months.Exelon has long been a proponent of clean energy legislation and built up its nuclear portfolio as a low-carbon option. It says it is the least carbon-intensive of the large US electric utilities. This transaction marks its entry into owning and operating wind projects.Exelon, with more than $17bn in annual revenues, will finance the transaction with debt from one of its subsidiaries, Exelon Generation.It had been banking on nuclear as the US fuel of the future, given the momentum for carbon reduction in recent years. But as that momentum has slackened, nuclear’s renaissance in the US has faded.In February, the Obama administration tried to spark interest in nuclear, announcing $8.3bn in loan guarantees to help Southern Co build two reactors in Burke, Georgia.Southern was among four companies named last year as being considered to share $18.5bn in federal loan guarantees to build new nuclear power facilities after reticence about potential disasters meant no reactor had been built in the US in almost three decades.
42;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-08-31T20:59:15Z;US stocks flat as early gains erased;;US stocks were flat on Tuesday after fears that the Federal Reserve may have ruled out large scale asset purchases erased earlier gains made on the back of positive consumer spending and housing data.The S&P 500 closed a fraction higher at 1049.32, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,014.72 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3 per cent to close at 2,114.03.An onslaught of weak economic data pushed the S&P 500 down 5 per cent over the month, making it the worst August in nine years. The financial sector led the month’s fallers, down 7.9 per cent in August, followed by industrials, which fell 7.3 per cent and information technology stocks, which declined 7.2 per cent. Telecoms and Utilities were the month’s only risers.Investors were disappointed on Tuesday after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Committee showed members would only consider large-scale asset purchases if the outlook for the economy weakened “appreciably”.Markets had been cheered on Friday when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke suggested a greater willingness to act.“It is clear that the focus of discussion at the FOMC is on what further measures may be implemented to support the economy, and that those arguing that a “do nothing” approach is the best strategy are increasingly in the minority,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “Still, the minutes reveal enough difference of opinion to suggest that nothing substantial is in the cards anytime soon barring a complete economic collapse.”Before the minutes, US equities had flipped between positive and negative territory in response to mixed economic data.Both the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index and the S&P/Case Shiller home prices index were slightly better than expected but the Chicago purchasing manager’s index came in just under economists’ estimates.The consumer confidence figures dominated, cheering investors for much of the day, but the S&P 500 retailers closed flat with earlier risers Gapdown 0.1 per cent at $16.89 but JC Penney climbing 2.5 per cent to $19.98.The homebuilders also gave up earlier gains to end down 0.1 per cent. Analysts said the rise in home prices was distorted by the first homebuyer’s tax credit which has since expired.Monsanto lost 5.8 per cent to $52.65 after it became the latest company to revise down its outlook for the full year.The seed company said earnings would be towards the lower end of its previous forecast and below the consensus projection of $2.49 per share. IIn deal news, Saks, the lossmaking luxury retailer, jumped 19.7 per cent to $7.90 after it was reported that it could receive a bid of $11 a share, or $1.7bn, from a consortium of US and UK private equity groups.Shares in Lions Gate Entertainment, the film and TV company that makes the hit series Mad Men, jumped 10 per cent to $7.14 after activist investor Carl Icahn announced his intention to raise his bid for the shares in the company that he does not already own.The recent spate of acquisitions continued as 3M, which bought its last company Cogent Technologies on Monday, said it would acquire Israel-based Attenti Holdings.Attenti, which is being bought for about $230m, provides technology that tracks prisoners on parole. Shares in 3M edged down 1.4 per cent to $78.55.Deere & Co, the world’s largest maker of farm equipment, said it would sell John Deere Renewables, its wind energy business, to electricity supplier Exelon Corp for $900m. Shares in Exelonadvanced 0.5 per cent to $40.72 while Deere & Co shares also pushed higher by 0.5 per cent to $63.27.AIG, the bailed-out insurer, fell 0.2 per cent to $33.93 after the sale of its Taiwan life insurance unit to a Hong Kong-based consortium was blocked by local regulators.In earnings news, Dollar General, the discount retailer majority-owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, beat expectations and raised guidance for the full year. However, the shares fell 0.3 per cent to $27.31.
43;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-08-31T19:19:18Z;US wind power;Utilities snap up wind projects as sector growth stalls;Much like the wind itself, the business of harnessing its power comes and goes in great gusts. The US is now in one of the painfully quiet periods – wind power installations in the first half of the year were down 71 per cent versus a year ago and 57 per cent from the same period in 2008 with further declines expected next year – but it has become an opportune time to go green for big, dirty utilities.Exelon’s $900m purchase of Deere & Co’s wind development unit for a little more than $1,200 a kilowatt plus some juicy tax credits and projects under development seems to be a wise move and may presage more deals.All sorts of power plants, not just wind, now sell for below replacement cost due to low wholesale power demand. But many existing wind projects are a far safer bet than buying more traditional assets since project financing was usually only made available on the basis of long-term power offtake agreements that remove market risk.Even though the urgency to develop renewable power has faded for the time being as climate legislation has been delayed indefinitely, power companies that think in the long term crave a meaningful “renewable footprint” for when the regulatory winds shift. This could come in the form of a federal renewable portfolio standard, coming on top of existing state rules that will in effect make existing wind projects more valuable.For a huge generator such as Exelon, with 25,000 megawatts of capacity, it takes big deals to move the needle in terms of its mix anyway. Taking advantage of a bear market in renewable assets to get a head start, and doing so in a way that enhances earnings with little market risk, is more than just whistling in the wind.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
44;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-05-13T16:48:23Z;US nuclear power plans hit by waste dispute;;"The Obama administration’s efforts to foster a renaissance in nuclear power in the US are coming up against an old dilemma – what to do with the waste.The climate bill before the Senate envisages the construction of the first US reactors in more than three decades as a solution to both global warming and the country’s addiction to oil; an expansion supported by President Barack Obama and Republicans at a time of new concerns about the safety of oil drilling.But the issue of spent fuel storage is haunting US nuclear ambitions. In March, Mr Obama announced that Yucca Mountain, the country’s only prospective nuclear waste repository, would be shut before ever opening.The 20-year-old facility outside Las Vegas has cost the government about $9bn (€7.1bn, £6.1bn). Mr Obama promised during his election campaign that he would kill the project on the urging of Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, whose Nevada constituency opposes it. The closure has shaken the nuclear power industry during what some are calling its long-awaited revival.The largest nuclear power company, Exelon, has said it will not construct new plants until progress is made on storage. “This is a major impediment to the development of new nuclear sites,” said John Rowe, Exelon’s chief executive. The Senate climate bill, sponsored by John Kerry, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, and Joe Lieberman, an independent senator from Connecticut, increases the existing nuclear loan guarantee programme from $18.5bn to over $50bn. Such a programme could spur the construction of a dozen nuclear plants. But the bill leaves the question of waste storage unanswered.Lawmakers, utilities and trade groups have protested against Yucca’s closure, claiming that Mr Obama has a legal obligation to move forward with it. “We consider the department’s actions contrary to the clear intent of Congress and regard your proposal as prematurely and unwisely removing deep geologic disposal from the options to be considered,” a group of top Democratic congressmen wrote in a letter to Mr Obama last month.Meanwhile, 16 utilities have sued the US Department of Energy to halt the government’s collection of $750m in annual nuclear waste disposal fees, arguing that the country no longer has a disposal plan after closing Yucca Mountain. In the wake of Yucca’s closure, the Energy Department appointed a commission to address the issue of long-term nuclear storage. Several commissioners acknowledged to the Financial Times that a deep repository was a necessity, but expressed doubts that the political will for such a project existed. “Members of Congress are not keen on opening up the site selection process if the nation’s nuclear dump might end up in their backyard,” said Robert Alvarez, a senior energy adviser in the Clinton administration. States that have been most active in nuclear energy production are now recoiling. Washington and South Carolina filed lawsuits against the federal government in April, claiming that the energy department was supposed to begin taking spent fuel from utilities for disposal at Yucca Mountain by 1998.“The original bargain was that this waste was going to taken off their hands,” said Mr Alvarez. “But now interim storage sites all over the country feel they’re going to be stranded with this stuff – and there is more coming.”"
45;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-04-11T21:56:17Z;Mirant and RRI in $3.1bn merger;;"Mirant and RRI Energy, two US power companies, have agreed to merge, creating one of the largest independent power producers in the US.The two will combine in an all-stock merger to form GenOn Energy, a power producer with 24,700MW of electric generating capacity and a market value of about $3.1bn.GenOn will be the second largest power producer in terms of US generating capacity, after Exelon.US power producers suffered in the downturn as the credit crisis shut off financing to the fragmented sector.Analysts say the industry is ripe for consolidation, given that the US has more than 250 mid-size and large utilities and distribution companies. However, financial constraints have not been the only roadblock; regulators have scuttled previous merger attempts by utilities.For example, FPL, which owns Florida’s largest utility, abandoned a $11.4bn takeover of Constellation Energy in 2006 after a face-off with regulators. And Mirant in 2006 withdrew an $8bn hostile offer for rival NRG, after its target refused to engage in negotiations and Mirant’s own shareholders expressed doubts about the deal.Then last year Exelon abandoned a hostile bid for NRG after failing to win over NRG’s investors.Edward Muller, chairman and chief executive of Mirant, will lead the combined company until his planned retirement in 2013. Mark Jacobs, president and chief executive of RRI, will serve as president and chief operating officer before taking over from Mr Muller.The two have been talking for some time about putting the companies together, which both operate in regions such as the Mid-Atlantic and in California, though with little direct overlap.Mr Muller told the Financial Times on Sunday: “the value creation that Mark and I have seen in this transaction was there at all points of the cycle and in all economic times.”The companies believe they can save $150m in costs each year through merging the companies from 2012.The combined company had cash balances of $2.9bn at the end of December and Mr Jacobs on Sunday suggested that GenOn could act as a consolidator in the future. He said, “I think our industry is still a fragmented one …If we can find other opportunities that can create value for our shareholders then of course we will consider them.”Under the agreed deal, structured as a nil-premium merger, Mirant shareholders will receive 2.835 shares of RRI stock for each share they own. That is worth about $11.20 a share, based on RRI’s closing price of $3.95 on Friday.Mirant shares ended the week at $10.73.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty"
46;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-02-18T01:43:46Z;Energy companies fight own emissions corner;;After making common cause for years, the energy companies campaigning for legislation to curb US greenhouse gas emissions are finding that what divides them may be as important as what unites them.On Tuesday, BP and ConocoPhillips, the oil and gas groups, withdrew from the US Climate Action Partnership, which campaigns for climate legislation.They say they need to make their case for themselves as the debate moves from whether an emissions cap is needed, to how it would be implemented.As the details come into focus, oil and gas companies are being split off from the power generators such as Duke Energy, Exelon and NRG Energy, which remain members of the USCAP. The oil and gas companies say they still want an energy and environment bill to be passed, but do not want just any bill. In particular, they are concentrating on lobbying for legislation promoting natural gas as a way to reduce carbon emissions.Oil companies argue that many of the bills that have come before Congress place an unfair burden on motor fuels and offer too many concessions to coal.The Waxman-Markey bill that passed in the House of Representatives last year, for example, allocates 2 per cent of allowances to fuel producers but makes them responsible for 44 per cent of emissions.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, said last year the proposed legislation could threaten the sustainability of the US refining industry, costing US refiners $100bn (€73bn, £64bn) a year within three years. That would hit an industry under pressure from a drop in demand.On top of that, the industry is upset President Barack Obama’s new budget outlines about $80bn in tax increases on the US oil and gas industry.Jim Mulva, chief executive of Conoco, explained the bills in Congress seek unnecessarily punitive measures on the industry while ignoring the “critical role” natural gas could play in reducing carbon emissions. Natural gas is about 50 per cent less carbon intensive than coal.Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s national trade organisation, said: “We do not understand how the Obama administration and Congress can advocate subsidies for nuclear energy, wind and solar while calling for new taxes on natural gas.” Mr Nichols said he was not surprised BP and Conoco left USCAP.Royal Dutch Shell, the last remaining big oil company in the USCAP, shares Conoco Phillips’ concerns but the company will stay in USCAP to “remain engaged”.
47;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-02-12T00:22:33Z;US power groups to merge in $4.7bn deal;;"FirstEnergy agreed on Thursday to acquire Allegheny Energy for $4.7bn in an all-stock deal that would create one of the largest utility groups in the US.The combined company would have 10 regulated power utilities across seven states; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia. It would have 24,000 megawatts of generating capacity from coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil and renewable power.Some analysts think a deal between FirstEnergy and Allegheny could lead to more tie-ups in the utility sector, which they say is ripe for consolidation. Karl Miller, founder of MMC Energy, noted that the US has more than 250 mid-size and large utilities and distribution companies.But regulators have scuttled previous merger attempts by utilities. FPL, which owns Florida’s largest utility, abandoned a $11.4bn takeover attempt of Constellation Energy group in 2006 after a face-off with regulators in Maryland, where Constellation is based. Exelon, a utility based in Chicago, dropped its plan in 2006 to buy Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey amid concerns by regulators in that state.In both cases, legislators raised concerns that the combined utility groups could lead to higher power rates.Anthony Alexander, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer, said he did not anticipate any problem with regulators, given two of the six states involved do not require formal approval, and in the other four the companies have good relationships with regulators.“We have very strong …customer satisfaction ratings in those states. We are active in the communities,” Mr Alexander said.FirstEnergy said it expected to close the deal with Allegheny in 12 to 14 months. They expect the combined company, which would have more than 6m customers, to have $16bn in annual revenue and $1.4bn in annual net income, combining year-end 2009 figures.Under the agreement, Allegheny shareholders would receive 0.667 shares of FirstEnergy common stock for each share of Allegheny they own. Based on the closing stock prices for both companies on Wednesday, Allegheny shareholders would receive a value of $27.65 per share, or a total of $4.7bn. FirstEnergy also will assume about $3.8bn in Allegheny debt.The offer represents a premium of 31.6 per cent to the closing price of Allegheny on Wednesday, and a 22.3 per cent premium to the average stock price of Allegheny over the last 60 days."
48;EXC;Exelon Corp;2010-01-29T15:00:09Z;Obamatomic;;America’s last president may have called it “nook-yuh-lur energy” but he and the Republican party were seen as the industry’s biggest proponents since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. After some initial uncertainty, it is becoming clear that Barack Obama may do even more for atomic energy than his predecessor.High energy prices, improved technology and awareness of global warming have all conspired to put nuclear power back on the agenda in recent years. Even so, the daunting cost and regulatory pitfalls of building new reactors mean that government support is vital. For all its enthusiasm, the Bush administration only succeeded in providing loan guarantees of $18.5bn for new reactors in 2005 versus almost $80bn for renewable energy.Given the typical cost of $6bn-$8bn for a single reactor and the fact that Exelon, America’s largest utility, only has a market value of $30bn, guarantees are critical. Mr Obama’s proposal to triple loan guarantees could pave the way for the first few new reactors in decades to come on line by 2017. Based on government forecasts for greenhouse gas reduction, nuclear would have to grow from 20 per cent to 33 per cent of the US generation mix by 2050. With older plants closing by then, this may require 187 reactors at a cost of $1,300bn.Although some on the left criticised Mr Obama’s support for nuclear energy in Tuesday’s State of the Union address, he received applause from both sides of the congressional aisle and is hardly making a U-turn. He appointed nuclear physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and represented Illinois, which has 11 of America’s 104 reactors, in the Senate. Unlike his predecessor, Mr Obama not only appears supportive of a nuclear renaissance but is putting his money where his mouth is, with correct pronunciation to boot.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
49;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-11-30T23:01:09Z;Industrial groups warn over US climate law;;Industrial companies operating in the US are warning that they will face a heavy regulatory burden should US Congress fail to pass climate change legislation.The companies fear that without legislation, the US Environmental Protection Agency would impose its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions or states would introduce different carbon pollution regimes.Peter Molinaro, head of government affairs at Dow Chemical, the largest US chemicals group, told the Financial Times that the proliferation of such initiatives would present “an enormous administrative burden” for companies that operate across different regimes.“Manufacturers are having enough trouble in this country competing with foreign companies,” Mr Molinaro said. “We’d be adding administrative and cost burden where we shouldn’t.”Alison Taylor, vice-president of sustainability for the Americas at Siemens, the German engineering group, said businesses needed to know the price of carbon for planning reasons. “How do you have one price of carbon if you’ve got four or five different regimes?” she said.President Barack Obama had hoped that Congress would pass cap-and-trade legislation before next week’s United Nations Climate Change conference in Copenhagen.However, the focus on healthcare and the economy means he will arrive in Denmark empty-handed.Nevertheless, Mr Obama is expected to pledge that the US will cut carbon emissions.A climate bill was squeezed through the House of Representatives in June, but a bipartisan proposal that could be presented in the Senate as soon as this week faces an uphill battle.“The chances of getting a bill passed continue to be very uncertain,” said David Brown, head of federal affairs at Exelon, the biggest operator of nuclear power plants in the US.That raises the prospect that US states or regions could initiate their own mandatory regimes or that the Environmental Protection Agency could impose greenhouse-gas emissions limits.The US already has one mandatory regional cap-and-trade programme in the form of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which includes 10 north-eastern states.Without federal legislation, similar schemes are likely to spring up elsewhere.California last week announced a plan for its own cap-and-trade system.The climate change issue has split the business world.Trade associations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, and big energy groups such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron oppose the climate bill that passed the House, saying it will kill off US manufacturing jobs.That stance has alienated companies that support the measure.Nike and Apple are among the businesses that have withdrawn from the US Chamber of Commerce over its stance on the issue.
50;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-10-23T22:50:44Z;US business group in dispute on reform;;Both sides deny they are conducting a feud. But anyone standing between the White House and the venerable Chamber of Commerce headquarters across Washington’s Lafayette Square should don a flak jacket.“The White House thinks the chamber is not cool and that the cool companies are companies like Google,” says Bruce Josten, the chamber’s head lobbyist, whom George W. Bush nicknamed “Big guy”.“But if you look at the source of the biggest new demand for electricity it’s the companies with the large servers.”The dispute, which has pitted the chamber against almost every big White House initiative, including its plans to tackle climate change, healthcare reform and financial regulatory reform, illuminates how divided US business has become.Ten years ago, the chamber might have spoken uncontroversially for most of its 3m members on climate change or healthcare. Today, many of them dispute its stances.Four companies, including Apple and Exelon, quit the chambers in protest last month over its opposition to the climate change bill, which has since stalled in the Senate.Their disquiet had been exacerbated when the chamber’s senior environmental spokesman likened the debate over global warming to the notorious “monkey Scopes” trial of the 1920s on the teaching of evolution.Mr Josten admits it was a “stupid thing to say”. But he points out that the chamber has long supported action on climate change, which it accepts is man-made. “What we object to is this bill in particular, not tackling climate change in general,” he says. “The White House is trying to divert attention from the fact that the Democratic party is hopelessly divided on all these issues by picking a fight with the chamber.”The fall-out goes beyond words. Since the start of the year the chamber, which is arguably Washington’s most powerful lobbying organisation, has spent $37m (€24.6m, £22.6m) opposing healthcare reform.It has launched a campaign for “American Free Enterprise”, highlighting the alleged dangers to the free market system under the Obama administration, including its plan to change the law to make it easier for workers to join a trade union – a bill that has also stalled.The chamber has also taken a strong stance against Barack Obama’s proposals to set up a consumer financial protection regulatory agency, which probably contributed to the dilution of the bill in the House of Representatives this week.Again, the chamber argues that it does not oppose financial reform in general and has been pushing for rationalisation of Washington’s “gaggle of regulatory agencies” since the Enron debacle of 2001.None of which cuts any ice with Mr Obama, whose officials have infuriated the chamber by depicting it as an “antiquated” lobby group.One official, pointing to the fact that other organisations, such as the Business Roundtable, back climate change legislation and healthcare reform, said: “We leave it to the chamber to evaluate whether their positions on key issues are in line with their membership.”The official added that there was “no feud” with the White House. Yet the president has picked up the habit of meeting the chief executives of companies independently, rather than going through the traditional gatekeeper across Lafayette Square.In the past few months Mr Obama has had three lunches with chief ex­ecutives, representing the kind of new economy companies who backed his campaign.These include people such as Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, Howard Schultz, chief of Starbucks, and even Mike Duke, chief of Walmart, which has turned into an unexpected ally to the Democratic party on healthcare and climate change.So far, Tom Donohue, the head of the chamber, is not among Mr Obama’s lunch guests. “Washington is changing and meeting with business leaders directly is simply to gather their ideas and seek their input,” said the White House official. “There is less of a need for a middle man.”As one Democratic lobbyist puts it: “It is one thing to be attacked. It is another to be ignored.”
51;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-10-11T21:40:31Z;Gilead tops list for best investor value;;"In a volatile decade for the corporate world and its investors, Gilead Sciences, Apple and British American Tobacco stood out for their performances, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group.The three companies top the list for creating the most value for their shareholders relative to peers that trade on the same home stock market.Gilead, the US medical device company, posted a total return more than 36 per cent better than the average listing, BCG said.Something that was more remarkable was that the company outperformed the market every year from 1999-2008.Apple, maker of the ubiquitous iPod music device and other consumer electronics, produced a total return 25 per cent better than that of the average company.BAT, a consumer goods company, boasted a return of almost 18 per cent above its local market average, according to BCG.There were four mining and materials companies, including Brazil’s Vale and BHP Billiton of Australia, and four medical technology manufacturers within the top 25.Although some of the top performers clearly benefited from some of the decade’s sweeping trends – for example, globalisation and rising commodity prices – the list’s overall diversity suggest there is more than one way to generate consistently good returns for investors.“When you get to top ranks, the secular trends don’t matter as much,” said Eric Olsen, a senior partner at BCG and one of the study’s authors.“It’s what you do with your company’s strategy, your capital deployment and your management agenda,” Mr Olsen added.Utilities such as Exelon of the US and Germany’s Eon found spots on the Top 25 list, as did mature industrial companies, including Lockheed Martin, Schlumberger and United Technologies.McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble also made the list.Mr Olsen and his co-authors’ study will be released on Tuesday.They observed that the decade’s most successful companies often took one of four pathways.They each delivered sales growth well above their home country’s gross domestic product; they churned out enough cash to appease investors; they transformed their portfolio of businesses through a series of timely acquisitions and divestitures; or they simply found a combination of ways to exceed shareholders’ expectations consistently.Gilead and Apple benefited from surging demand for their products, while the renewed focus of McDonald’s on boosting margins even as growth slowed rewarded investors with a total return of 7.9 per cent above the market average, Mr Olsen said.Of course, the Top 25 companies now have more in common than just an impressive 10-year total return: they face the daunting task of remaining at the head of the ranking for the next decade, he said.“It’s a matter of being able to beat expectations continuously,” Mr Olsen said.“That’s hard to do.”"
52;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-27T21:35:05Z;M&A;Managers are no longer sheltering from the crisis;"No. That is what you would expect a target company to reply when an unsolicited bidder comes knocking. And “no” is what a series of unwanted bidders have lately got. Bottlers have rejected PepsiCo’s unsolicited offers. Anglo American has snubbed Xstrata. Oil company Venture Production is resisting a £1.3bn bid from UK utility Centrica. Meanwhile, Resolution’s offer for British fund manager Friends Provident has run into the sand. What is noteworthy, however, is that these hostile bids have been tabled at all. Only four months ago, the world was supposedly headed for financial Armageddon.The return of hostility is an encouraging sign. It shows animal spirits are returning to corporate boardrooms. Managers are no longer sheltering from the crisis under the table. Worldwide there are twice as many hostile bids around, as a percentage of total deals, than there have been annually, on average, since 2000. In some countries, there has been an absolute rise too. In the UK there have been more hostile bids so far this year than in all of 2008, even excluding Xstrata/Anglo, according to Dealogic.This makes economic sense. Many industries need restructuring. Companies with strong balance sheets that have weathered the crisis are now taking opportunistic pot-shots at weaker peers. Targets naturally respond that these offers undervalue their “true value”, as they are based on recently depressed share prices.That has put acquirers in a bind. They have been reluctant – or unable – to get the extra financing they need to make knockout cash offers with juicy premiums. That is how US utility NRG Energy effectively rebuffed Exelon. Indeed, the only big mergers and acquisitions restructuring taking place is where government financial backing is available – as in the state-guaranteed loans on offer in the car industry. Hostility has come back, but not credit with it. Until it does, acquirers’ bark may prove worse than their bite.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

53;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-21T19:39:06Z;Exelon retreats after NRG shareholder rebuff;;Exelon dropped its $7.5bn hostile bid for NRG Energy on Tuesday after the rival US power producer’s shareholders voted to install its own nominees to its board of directors rather than candidates proposed by Exelon.Exelon took its fight to NRG shareholders after NRG’s board rejected its takeover offers repeatedly and refused to negotiate unless Exelon raised its bid substantially. Exelon had nominated up to nine candidates to NRG’s board and proposed to increase the board’s size.NRG shareholders voted down Exelon’s proposals and re-elected four NRG directors, according to preliminary results, and signalled more broadly an unwillingness to sell the company at the current price.Shares of NRG, which has been resisting Exelon’s advances since October, rose 3.4 per cent even as the prospect that Exelon would pay a premium for them evaporated. “We like NRG better as a stand-alone story,” said the research arm of energy-focused firm Tudor Pickering, saying NRG shares were worth $32 without the takeover offer.Shares of Exelon, which said it would cancel its offer if none of its candidates was elected, rose by 2.7 per cent, to $53.32 at midday.“The NRG shareholders have spoken, and Exelon will move on,” said John Rowe, Exelon’s chairman and chief executive, in a written statement after the vote. Exelon said it was “unwilling to raise its price to a level that would undermine Exelon’s own value proposition”.Exelon’s latest offer, which it made on July 2, had comprised 0.545 Exelon shares for each share of NRG, a 12 per cent increase on its initial bid.NRG contended that Exelon’s higher offer still undervalued the company dramatically, and said it set the floor for a broader process to sell the company at too low a level to justify an auction. NRG has tried to rouse other suitors who are willing to pay a substantial premium to Exelon’s bid, but has been unsuccessful.Chicago-based Exelon has suffered a string of failed takeover attempts since 2003, when it scrapped plans to buy an Illinois utility from Dynegy after running into resistance from lawmakers.Three years later, Exelon decided to cancel its $17bn deal to buy Public Service Enterprise Group when lengthy negotiations failed with regulators who were demanding concessions.Mr Rowe said Exelon would now “redouble” its focus on its own growth opportunities, in part by expanding its low-carbon nuclear power generation output.
54;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-19T22:05:03Z;Exelon faces vote in bid for NRG;;Shareholders of NRG Energy, which has been fighting off a hostile takeover bid from rival Exelon for nine months, will have their chance on Tuesday to endorse NRG’s own nominees to its board of directors or to support candidates proposed by Exelon.Exelon recently raised its bid for NRG, which is now worth roughly $7.5bn, but NRG rejected the improved offer on July 8, claiming it still heavily undervalued the company.NRG has refused to negotiate with Exelon until it boosts its bid to a level NRG feels is more appropriate.In an effort to draw NRG to the bargaining table, Exelon has proposed up to nine new candidates to NRG’s board and requested that the board’s size be increased to 19 members.NRG’s shareholders will vote on those proposals on Tuesday , and the vote’s results are likely to dictate the direction in which the takeover fight heads.Exelon says it will abandon the takeover effort if none of its nominees are elected. If its full roster of nine new nominees is elected, Exelon plans to “press forward with determination toward completion of the proposed transaction”.If four new nominees are elected, which would keep the size of NRG’s board at 14 members, Exelon hedged its bets and reserved the right not to continue with its bid.NRG stressed in a letter last week to its shareholders that the four major US proxy advisory firms have recommended they vote for NRG’s four nominees and against Exelon’s proposed nominees and efforts to expand the board.David Crane, NRG’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in a recent interview that other companies were “definitely” interested in buying NRG. However, he said Exelon’s initial bid was so low that it set the pricing floor for a potential auction beneath a level he was willing to entertain.NRG has approached Spain’s Iberdrola, Germany’s Eon and France’s EDF to gauge whether they would substantially exceed Exelon’s bid, according to a person close to the matter, but it has not dredged up a buyer.“NRG continues to believe that Exelon’s hostile proposal is inadequate, highly conditional and does not compensate NRG stockholders for the value our company has created,” NRG said last week.In response to NRG’s efforts to find a “white knight” suitor, Exelon said it found it “odd that NRG engaged in a ‘market discovery’ process for over eight months without talking to Exelon”.Exelon pledged to stay disciplined on pricing but said it was prepared to raise its bid if further analysis indicated that NRG was worth more.
55;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-08T23:21:57Z;Wall Street rallies in choppy trade;;"US stocks rallied late on Wednesday to end a choppy session close to where they began as investors waited cautiously for the start of the earnings season, due to open after the bell with results from Alcoa.The aluminium maker gained 1.6 per cent on an otherwise bearish Tuesday after Klaus Kleinfield, the chief executive, said he was “very optimistic” about sales. The stock swung on Wednesday as investors bet on whether the company would beat its estimates, and ended the day 0.5 per cent up at $9.46.It then jumped in the post-market session after the company reported a narrower loss than had been expected.Meanwhile, NRG defied a bearish energy sector as the price of oil continued to tumble after the company rejected a fresh takeover offer from utility company Exelon as too low.The increased bid was made last week, but NRG rebuffed the offer on Wednesday, saying it fell “far short”. NRG gained 5.8 per cent to $23.35, while Exelon closed 1 per cent up at $48.21.Financial stocks also suffered, in spite of the promise of revenues from mortgage purchases, as new mortgage applications were shown to have risen 10.9 per cent last week.Investors were more concerned with predictions from the International
Monetary Fund that the global economic contraction this year would be slightly worse than previous estimates and that the recovery was “likely to be sluggish”.Those words were echoed by G8 leaders, who are meeting in Italy this week. A G8 draft document read: “Significant risks still remain to economic and financial stability.”Citigroup and Bank of America lost 2.6 per cent to $2.62 and $11.84, respectively.“The overwhelming theme is still one of trepidation,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “Moving into earnings season, a lot of people now think those green shoots were at best weeds. There doesn’t seem to be any
reason to buy financial stocks right now.” But the stock market was able to rebound off its lows during the afternoon after a well-subscribed auction of 10-year government debt reassured investors about the state of US finances.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 879.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 8,178.41 and the Nasq Composite index dropped 0.1 per cent to 1,747.17.“There has been a reassessment of the profit outlook as last week’s weak unemployment report suggested consumption is not going to be nearly as strong as stock prices suggested when the S&P was at 940,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.The most significant support came from the healthcare sector, where Amgen surged 13.9 per cent to $59.50 after the company said its lead experimental drug, which helps strengthen bones, performed better than a potential rival in a clinical trial.It was joined in early trade by Amylin, Alkermes and Eli Lilly, which rose after the companies said an application for a jointly developed weekly diabetes drug had been accepted by the Food and Drug Agency.But all three gave up those gains amid the wider sell-off. Amylin ended 1.4 per cent lower at $12.29, Alkermes was down 0.3 per cent at $10.23 and Eli Lilly was 0.2 per cent worse off at $33.42.There was some strength from copper miners after Citigroup upgraded Free-port McMoRan and Southern Copper. Both gained 0.2 per cent to $45.10 and $19.16, respectively.Consumer stocks were more resilient, however, with results from Family Dollar providing a boost.The budget retailer jumped 12.4 per cent to $31.18 after profits surged 36 per cent and the company said fourth-quarter profits would be in line with or above current estimates.But Pepsi Bottling Group fell in spite of beating analysts’ expectations as sales fell short of what investors had hoped. Its shares dipped 0.4 per cent to $33.53.In the technology sector, Google claimed first blood in its latest battle with Microsoft. Google plans to launch a PC operating system to rival Windows and saw its shares climb 1.5 per cent to $402.49. Those for Microsoft rose only 0.1 per cent to $22.56."
56;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-08T16:06:56Z;NRG rejects sweetened bid from Exelon;;NRG Energy, which has been fighting off the takeover advances of rival electricity supplier Exelon since last October, rejected a higher offer worth $7bn made by Exelon last week and said Exelon should be willing to pay more.NRG, which claims Exelon’s initial offer “grossly undervalued” the company, said on Wednesday that the higher, all-stock bid still did not recognise NRG’s growth potential and the additional value it has created in recent months.NRG’s shareholders would contribute an average of 30 per cent of the merged company’s cash flows while receiving a stake of just 18 per cent, the company said, and would not be adequately paid for NRG’s assets, including the recently-purchased retail business of Reliant Energy.Exelon said when it sweetened its bid on July 2 that it was including the value of the the Reliant business, along with additional cost savings it expected to extract once the companies were combined. Exelon’s new offer would pay 0.545 of an Exelon share for each NRG share, which valued NRG’s shares at $26.36 at mid-morning on Wednesday.As part of its argument for a higher offer, NRG boosted its liquidity projections and raised its estimate for 2009 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to $2.5bn from $2.175bn.
57;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-02T22:14:16Z;Renewed NRG;;"The recession created many motivated sellers – but buyers sometimes need to show more motivation, too. In hindsight, Exelon’s bid last autumn to become America’s largest electric utility by buying NRG was far from the knockout blow necessary to win over shareholders. Eating its words about not sweetening its “very sweet” offer, it justified Thursday’s 12.4 per cent increase weeks before NRG’s crucial annual meeting by identifying further cost savings. In fact, its first offer was opportunistic and it had little choice given the appreciation of NRG stock that had left the original offer at a 4 per cent discount.NRG management’s cool reception last year made sense and served shareholders well. But they should not reflexively reject the latest offer. True, the premium remains modest and is still 40 per cent below NRG’s price a year ago. Much has changed in eight months though, including visibility about power prices. They may stay weak for quite some time based on the forward natural gas curve, reducing the intrinsic value of low-cost coal and nuclear plants. Exelon’s decision to slow down a large nuclear development of its own keeps NRG’s more viable South Texas Project attractive. Financial markets have recovered enough that Exelon’s need to refinance NRG’s debt is no huge obstacle.The divestitures a deal makes necessary still hurt, but the cost savings Exelon touts appear realistic and the advantages of a bigger, better balance sheet are meaningful. Some analysts argue the new offer is still low and too late. Perhaps. But deciding to remain independent is not as attractive as last October. If the original offer was the proverbial bird in the hand versus two in the bush, the new one is more like one and a half in the bush.E-mail the Lex team confidentially

58;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
59;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-07-02T20:44:48Z;Wall Street slides on jobs report;;"US stocks took a pounding on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index turning negative for the year as investors reacted to data showing many more people lost their jobs in June than expected.Analysts had far underestimated the number of new non-farm employees who would lose their jobs during the month, and even though the unemployment rate and the number of people claiming jobless benefits on a weekly basis were both better than expected, the market sold off heavily.Consumer stocks were directly hit by concerns over joblessness, and retailers felt some of the worst effects. Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."
60;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Exelon sets out ‘final’ bid for NRG;;"Exelon on Thursday increased its hostile bid for NRG Energy by 12 per cent to about $7.5bn and called the move its “best and final offer’’.The US electricity producer, which has been trying since October to acquire its rival, said it had decided to raise its offer after identifying another $1.5bn in cost savings.These would result from combining the businesses and adding in the benefits of NRG’s recent purchase of a retail business from Reliant Energy.In total, Exelon said it could squeeze out $3.6bn- $4bn in operational synergies by melding the businesses together and transforming NRG.The Chicago-based company said it was confident it could refinance NRG’s $4.7bn of senior notes and other debt and still maintain investment grade credit ratings.NRG has repeatedly rejected Exelon’s earlier offer, which stood at 0.485 of an Exelon share for each NRG share.The new offer raises that exchange ratio to 0.545 of an Exelon share per NRG share.NRG urged shareholders to take no action while its board reviewed the revised offer.NRG has scheduled an annual shareholder meeting on July 21 and Exelon plans to agitate at that meeting for the election of proposed alternate nine independent directors to NRG’s board.Shares in NRG were 2.8 per cent lower at $25.31 in early New York trading, while Exelon was down 2.3 per cent at $50.36.A drop in Exelon’s share price since the offer was made – amid the economic crisis and concerns about the impact of impending carbon legislation on the power industry – had cut into the premium it was offering.In addition, it appeared support for the hostile takeover was declining; Exelon said in June that only about 12 per cent of NRG’s outstanding shares had been tendered under its offer, well below the 51 per cent it had received in February.“This is our best and final offer, and we will use the time leading up to the NRG annual meeting to communicate the value of our new offer to NRG shareholders,’’ said John Rowe, Exelon’s chairman and chief executive.NRG, whose management has resisted the Exelon bid as insufficient, said after the increased offer: “NRG’s board of directors will carefully review Exelon’s revised proposal with its advisers and determine the appropriate response promptly.’’In the event of a change of control at NRG, its debt must be refinanced.Exelon said it had continued to pursue NRG because of the long-term value that could be created by industry consolidation.“This is a done deal, and my money is on Exelon,’’ said Karl Miller, a senior industry adviser.“The NRG board and management are wasting shareholder money fighting a futile effort to entrench themselves.”"
61;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;NRG Energy desperate to stave off Exelon bid;;NRG Energy is becoming increasingly desperate in its efforts to stave off a hostile takeover by Exelon and become the largest US power producer.Its decision this week to acquire Reliant Energy’s Texas retail business, using $287.5m in cash, left analysts wondering why that deal would be better than one with the bigger, more creditworthy Exelon.The answer is that it is not, leading some analysts to conclude NRG’s executives and board are protecting their jobs at the expense of shareholders – a practice that will not be tolerated in this market, particularly in a sector that is ripe for consolidation.Mark Williams, finance and economics professor at Boston University, believes that, with Exelon, NRG shareholders would get a financially strong corporate parent, geographical diversity and stability of cash flow.“We are in a global storm,’’ Mr Williams said. “Yet the acquisition of Reliant is the equivalent of heading out in the storm with an undersized boat.“In a financial [hurricane] Katrina, I would rather be on an Exelon freighter than on an NRG fishing boat pulling the Reliant dingy.’’NRG insists it is being undervalued by Exelon’s offer to buy it for $6.2bn, with the all-stock offer based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share, representing a value of $26.43 for each NRG common share (based on Exelon’s closing price of $54.50 on October 17).Yet NRG’s share price has continued to fall since then, to below $20, as the economic downturn, combined with insecurity about the cost of carbon emissions under an Obama administration, has worsened.There are more than 250 mid- and large-size utilities and distribution companies in the US, and many of these are carrying substantial debt loads, said Karl Miller, an industry consultant.They cannot refinance, he said, and cash flow from operations to fund debt payments is dropping.Many are being forced to sell strong power and gas assets, a practice he expects will increase through 2009 and 2010.NRG is not opposed to consolidation but wants a “reasonable’’ offer. And while Exelon’s battle for control of NRG has put other potential acquirers on notice that no groups want to accept their values have dropped so far so fast, analysts believe they will be forced to do so.“The industry has to consolidate,’’ Mr Williams says. “It will be market driven, instead of executive driven. These people are going to die on the vine or be swallowed up.’’Exelon already has won support from holders of 51 per cent of the outstanding shares of NRG common stock, leading it to extend its offer until June 26, while seeking regulatory approvals.Shareholders, it seems, are ready to move on, with or without the executives.
62;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-01-29T22:29:32Z;Europe could spark off US energy deals;;"The US utility industry is ripe for consolidation.During the past two years, there has been only $128bn of energy utility deals in the US; less than half the $286bn value of deals in the European Union, according to PwC, the professional services firm.Merger and acquisition activity, by value, slowed in most regions but more sharply in the US than in the EU.In Europe, however, there is now likely to be a “pause for breath”, says Mark Hughes, European utilities leader at PwC.“Many companies have got to where they need to be,” he explains. There are loose ends to tie up, such as the 25 per cent in Endesa of Spain owned by Acciona, a Spanish construction company, widely expected to be bought by Enel of Italy.But unless it is forced by the Brussels-led push to liberalise energy markets, the pace of activity is likely to subside.In the US there may be a lot more to come. Europe is increasingly dominated by a few large pan-European groups, but the US remains a patchwork of some 20,000 local companies. Some suppliers are tiny, with as few as 20 customers, and even the biggest are merely middle-ranking companies by European standards.America has no equivalent of the European market leaders such as EDF of France, with a market capitalisation of $95bn, and Eon of Germany, with a capitalisation of $70bn.The biggest listed US energy suppliers are companies such as Exelon, worth about $38bn; Georgia-based Southern Company, worth about $27bn; and FPL of Florida, worth about $21bn.Colette Lewiner at the Capgemini consultancy estimates the top 20 US generators produce only 27 per cent of the nation’s electricity.That fragmentation makes America a very tempting target for ambitious European companies, which are generally unable to develop any further at home.Florence Roche of Société Générale says: “In the US, the acquisitions are generally moderate in size, so they are quite manageable for the big European utilities.”The US energy industry is experiencing credit crisis turbulence, causing problems for the more heavily indebted companies. Environmental policy has made coal-fired generation – the source of half of America’s electricity – less attractive for investment.With highly stable, often regulated, revenues, European utilities are among the companies with readiest access to capital in troubled markets.Ms Roche says European energy companies are particularly interested in sectors where they can have a competitive advantage over US rivals, such as renewables and nuclear power.Such strategic logic is behind moves such as Eon’s $1.4bn acquisition of the US wind assets of Airtricity in 2007, and Constellation’s $4.5bn sale of half its nuclear business to EDF, agreed late last year.Analysts expect more deals, with bidders from within and outside the US. NRG Energy of New Jersey is the target of a hostile bid by Exelon, which wants to make itself America’s largest electricity generator.NRG has said it is to investigate other possible offers. Bankers say it has been trying to interest several European groups.Strong shareholder support for Exelon’s move on NRG may well encourage other takeover attempts, says Karl Miller, an independent industry adviser. “This is going to give buyers heart. People are going hunting, and we’re going to see more hostile bids.”Dynegy, Reliant Energy, AES and Mirant are on his list of possible targets, as they may face financial pressure. Dynegy, the electricity generator, has been on analysts’ radar after its decision at the beginning of the month to dissolve its joint venture with LS Power Associates to develop coal-fired power plants.LS Power, which already owns 40 per cent of Dynegy, has the right to bid for the rest of the company after April 2.Dynegy points out that in November it had $855m in cash on the balance sheet. Mr Miller says it is not enough to have financial resources.Energy companies also need to show they have a growth strategy."
63;EXC;Exelon Corp;2009-01-16T15:06:34Z;Wind of change in air-conditioning sector;;When it comes to making air-conditioning systems more energy efficient and less polluting, Maurice Gunderson, senior partner at CMEA Ventures, sees improving building standards as key.Mr Gunderson focuses on investments in new and innovative energy sources and technologies at CMEA, a venture capital firm focused on life sciences, high technology and energy and materials investments. He notes there have been advances in air-conditioning controls and parts, but he insists much of the waste comes from inefficient buildings, which could be better insulated and planned to limit the amount of air-conditioning used.Yet because air-conditioning is “invisible”, he says, it is often the most neglected parts of a building despite being a large energy consumer.Indeed, Anne Pramaggiore, executive vice president in charge of customer operations, regulatory and external affairs for ComEd, an electric distribution company, notes that heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) can account for as much as 40 per cent of a building’s annual energy usage. Consequently, any efficiency improvement in these systems can mean big savings on customers’ energy bills.Some of those efficiencies will come by way of legislation, according to Bart Powelson, director of the commercial air conditioning market for Emerson, which provides heating, air-conditioning, and refrigeration solutions for residential, industrial and commercial applications. He says that, as of January 2010, new air-conditioning systems in the US must eliminate the use of R-22, a gas refrigerant that depletes ozone when it leaks.“That has our industry facing an upheaval,” Mr Powelson said.A new refrigerant, known as R-410A, a non-ozone depleting refrigerant, is most favoured to replace R-22 in air-conditioning. And while consumers will not be required to convert their old systems, they will find it harder and more expensive to find parts and servicing for the R-22 systems, which he believes will lead to conversions to the new system.Not only is R-410A cleaner, but systems using R-410A also are more efficient, Mr Powelson said.And new commercial systems will be required to be 10 per cent more efficient as of 2010, he said, which means suppliers are making the new R-410A systems that much more efficient to serve as the new standard.He expects the Obama administration to further increase efficiency standards: “I don’t think this is the final step.”Ms Pramaggiore of ComEd, a unit of Exelon, said utilities are starting to provide switches on air-conditioning systems that enable them to cycle on and off a customer’s system periodically to limit usage or shut off once power prices reach a certain threshold, such as 14 cents a kilowatt hour. New technology is emerging, and ComEd is testing systems designed to enable customers to set their air-conditioning system to turn on an hour before they get home from work and shut off when they leave in the morning – lest they forget.“We are thinking about this whole environmental movement in terms of trying to define electric service for the 21st century,” Ms Pramaggiore said. “It’s a complete paradigm shift.”To help in the transition, Frank Ramirez, co-founder and chief executive officer of Ice Energy, is among those working to improve the air-conditioning units themselves. His company has created a technology that creates ice in off-peak hours and uses it as a source of cooling during the high-use part of the day.“The Department of Energy underwrote this technology,” Mr Ramirez said. “But efficiency went the way of the dodo bird when oil prices went down.”He believes that will not happen with this current drop in oil prices, having faith the Obama administration will continue to stoke interest in such improved technologies because of its bigger focus on reducing impacts on climate change.John Breckenridge, a managing director of Good Energies, one of the largest global investors in renewable energy, suspects that, under Obama, there is going to be a lot of money spent to stimulate the US economy. He said those funds must be spent on areas that are of fundamental benefit to society.His company has thrown its finances behind Ice Energy and Microstaq, which has developed a more precise and reliable air-conditioning valve.By simply developing a more precise sprayer on the valve, which enables the compressor to work less, Microstaq has reduced the amount of energy used by air-conditioning systems by 10-20 per cent, according to Doug Penry, Microstaq’s director of HVAC sales and business development.Every little bit helps. For, as Mr Ramirez puts it, “No worse engineering exists, save, maybe, the two-stroke engine, than air-conditioning.” He and others hope the world’s focus on clean energy will finally lead to improvements.
64;EXC;Exelon Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Exelon stalks NRG;;"Some people just won’t take no for an answer. In spite of the rarity and complication of hostile deals in the utility sector, Exelon is showing more persistence than its takeover target, NRG, thought likely when it launched its bid in October to create the largest US power producer.Both sides seem emboldened by a non-binding tender offer that expired on Tuesday that saw 46 per cent of NRG’s shareholders support the offer. Yes, it was a minority but Exelon has now extended the tender period and will have a strong bargaining chip if more than half the shareholders support it by the time of its general meeting in May. NRG’s staggered board might have allowed it to delay Exelon for years but a bylaw allows the expansion of the board, rendering this moot.NRG originally thought time was on its side. As financing woes faced by some peers in the independent power sector faded and power prices stabilised, NRG thought its shares would outperform Exelon’s. This has happened, but slowly, as the original 37 per cent premium implied by Exelon’s share offer has now more than halved. With the economy likely to remain weak and credit still tight, its ability to appreciate its way out of Exelon’s clutches is limited. At the same time, credit has loosened just enough to make Exelon’s need to refinance billions in NRG debt more plausible, credit ratings be damned.NRG’s argument that the deal undervalues it has merit, but the lingering credit crunch gives more weight to Exelon’s most convincing argument – that it is in a far stronger position to finance NRG’s nuclear projects, which are closer to approval than its own. Improving fundamentals would likely give NRG the ability to thrive independently, but its impatient shareholders may be in a mood to take the bird in the hand versus two in the bush.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

65;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-11-27T17:48:44Z;US contractors spur nuclear construction;;Nuclear contractors and vendors, hoping to jump-start construction of the first new US nuclear plants in 30 years, are offering financial support and pledging to assume a larger share of the completion risks.Public concern over the safety of nuclear power has effectively shut down new plant construction for decades. But the US government has been offering incentives to spur development. And now groups that supply equipment to the industry are also moving to offset some of the enormous costs of new construction.The US government has offered $18.5bn in loan guarantees to encourage the construction of 14 nuclear power plants. Last month, it said it had received 19 applications from 17 electric power companies for $122bn in loan guarantees.“The aggregate estimated construction cost of these 14 projects is $188bn,” Standard & Poor’s said in a recent report.The ratings agency considers construction as “the overriding risk” for new nuclear units in the US, noting labour and material cost increases are particularly high for nuclear plants given their specialised labour needs, material intensity and a tight supply chain for key components. These obstacles have been compounded by new technologies which have not yet been used in the US, as well as a new, untested, regulatory process for nuclear plants.While the global financial crisis is expected to ease the costs of construction labour and materials, there are new fears about whether an administration under president-elect Barrack Obama will support the loan guarantee programme given the growing federal commitments to bolster financial institutions and possibly the automobile sector.“While the ongoing financial crisis has many people worried about whether they will get government loans, there is also talk of major nuclear vendors providing some funding,” said Ken Metcalfe, a nuclear electric generation expert and president of the Kenrich Group, a business and litigation consulting firm.NRG Energy, which last year filed the first application to build a new nuclear plant in the US in decades, is combining with Toshiba of Japan, a builder of advanced boiling water reactors, by forming a joint venture to develop and build new nuclear projects in North America.Toshiba will be the main contractor on NRG’s new projects. It also will invest $300m in the joint venture, Nuclear Innovation North America, over the next six years in return for a 12 per cent equity stake.“We’re very positive on the support Toshiba is providing, technically and financially,” David Crane, NRG chief executive, told the Financial Times.The industry has been stunted in the decades following the nuclear accident at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant in 1979, which exposed the region to radiation. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986, which killed more than 30 people in Ukraine, added to concerns about reactors close to towns and cities. In the US, some projects were subsequently blocked even though they had already been approved.Yet the 103 nuclear power plants now operating in the US are so old they are being forced to get 20-year extensions on their 40-year operating licences. Even though they provide 20 per cent of the nation’s energy, no provisions have been made to continue that supply, much less increase it, once the plants are deemed too old to operate.That is why the Department of Energy has been encouraging a wary nuclear power industry to expand by providing financial incentives to apply for licences to build new plants.The federal loan guarantee programme is an important part of financing these projects, said Tom O’Neill, vice-president of new plant development for Exelon Nuclear. He said Exelon, a major US power provider, “is ready to be in a position to go forward if there is a realistic and favourable assessment of the critical risks”.In Louisiana, officials have invited members of a joint venture being formed by nuclear technology supplier Westinghouse and Shaw Group to build a facility to construct components.
66;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-11-12T03:14:59Z;Exelon goes hostile after NRG rebuffs $6bn bid;Deals looming for US power sector;Exelon launched a hostile takeover battle for rival NRG Energy on Tuesday, after NRG rejected its unsolicited $6.2bn offer to combine the companies into the largest US power producer.The power sector has recently turned into fertile ground for potential transactions.Dynegy, another US power company, also hired Goldman Sachs and Greenhill to advise on its strategic options, an insider said.In addition to the activity surrounding Exelon, NRG and Dynegy, Warren Buffett agreed a $4.7bn deal in September to buy Constellation Energy, a nuclear power producer, and Reliant Energy is now weighing options for its business.Share prices of electricity companies have halved since July but have steadied somewhat since since Exelon bid for NRG last month.A banker said: “These are very capital intensive businesses that have gone through a lot of trauma, and there’s some significant dislocation in terms of value.”Exelon, after being rebuffed by NRG on Sunday, said it would launch an exchange offer on Wednesday for all outstanding shares of NRG at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share. That offer, which valued NRG’s shares at $26.43 each based on Exelon’s October 17 closing price of $54.50 is unchanged from its original offer of October 19.NRG Energy, which rejected the offer as “risky’’ and “opportunistic’’, said the deal undervalued its business and might not be completed because of the rough financing markets. Exelon refused to bid against itself and raise its price, opting instead to take the matter straight to shareholders.Another insider who expected Exelon’s move to start a protracted battle, said: “I think we’ve got two bulls locking horns.”Dynegy, for its part, may be looking to weigh its options ahead of the expiration in April of a standstill agreement with partner LS Power, which has a significant stake in Dynegy.At that time, LS will have the option to sell its stake or try to buy more, if not all, of Dynegy.Private equity groups such as Texas Pacific, KKR, Blackstone or First Reserve might normally look at Dynegy as a potential investment, possibly in partnership with LS, industry sources said.But the constrained credit markets could make a deal incredibly difficult.“Everyone is running a process, with timing that couldn’t be worse,” one banker said.Dynegy said the company did not comment on “market rumours or speculation.”
67;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-11-09T23:15:57Z;NRG rejects Exelon merger bid as ‘risky’;;NRG Energy, the US power producer, on Sunday rejected as “risky” and “opportunistic” an unsolicited $6.2bn merger bid by Exelon to ­create the US’s largest power producer.After three weeks of considering the October 19 bid, David Crane, president and chief executive of NRG, told the Financial Times the deal undervalued NRG and was at risk of being completed, given Exelon’s difficulties financing the deal.In a rejection letter, sent on Sunday, Mr Crane told John Rowe, the chairman and chief executive of Exelon: “Your obvious difficulties on both the debt financing and credit rating front since your public bid supports our conclusion that, even apart from your proposal’s substantial undervaluation of NRG, your proposal is so highly conditional that it has severe implementation risk for which NRG shareholders are in no way compensated.”Exelon’s all-stock offer was based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share, representing a value of $26.43 for each NRG common share, based on Exelon’s closing price of $54.50 on October 17.Mr Crane said that was below NRG’s price before the crisis took hold, when Wall Street reflected “true value”.Indeed, Mr Crane said, Exelon’s offer would leave NRG shareholders with 17 per cent of the combined company, while contributing 30 per cent of that combined company’s recurring cash flow in 2008.Exelon’s bid came as the credit crisis hit the equity and debt markets – the power industry depends on these to fund massive projects. While that made NRG a cheap target for Exelon, it also complicates Exelon’s ability to complete the deal.Bankers said that NRG has about $8bn debt which, upon a change in control, must be refinanced. They said Exelon would like NRG to help it refinance: “Exelon doesn’t have the money to do this deal.”In addition, NRG fears its company will not be put to good use within Exelon, given, two days after the bid, Exelon’s corporate credit rating was downgraded and placed on credit watch with negative outlook. It is now one notch from being rated below investment grade. Such a rating would result in incremental costs and collateral posting on their hedges.Mr Crane told the FT Exelon has said it is committed to restoring its company to “solid investment grade”.Yet, Mr Crane said: “We want to be working for the shareholders, not the credit ratings agencies.”That means sticking with NRG’s growth plan instead of building its credit rating. NRG late last year filed the first application to build a new nuclear plant in the US in 29 years.Exelon said: “Our board will review the NRG response and we will determine our next steps.”
68;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-11-02T23:02:21Z;Energy industry is running out of steam;;"The credit crisis has cut off much-needed financing for the US power sector, which equity investors have abandoned en masse, setting the stage for a string of mergers or bankruptcy filings.In the past month, two potential mergers have been announced: Warren Buffett’s bid on Constellation Energy and Exelon offered to take over NRG Energy. Analysts say Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Calpine, AES and Mirant are likely to be next on the list, with investors betting against them in both credit and equity markets.This is similar to the situation these companies found themselves in after Enron, when the US’s biggest unregulated energy trader collapsed in 2001, taking with it confidence in the entire sector. NRG and Mirant eventually sought bankruptcy protection. The others shed valuable assets and restructured to remain afloat.“This feels like 2001-2002 all over again,’’ said Mark T Williams, professor of finance and economics at Boston University. “It’s an environment exactly like what followed Enron; investors have lost confidence and the equity and debt markets have priced this in.’’Bruce Williamson, chief executive of Dynegy, said his company has $2bn of liquidity, including $855m cash, and no significant debt maturities due until 2011. Therefore, he says, the credit crisis should not affect the company.“Everybody has been lumped in together,’’ Mr Williamson said. Yet Dynegy, he said, has a steady cash stream, as it costs it about $25 a megawat hour to produce power and while prices peaked at about $85 per mwh, they are now only down to about $65 per mwh, which still leaves a healthy profit.“It’s important for investors to not take all power companies and lump them together,’’ Mr Williamson said. Yet Boston University’s Mr Williams said the bottom line is Dynegy’s share price is down to $2.5 and is conveying a lack of confidence, indicating suppliers, creditors, trade partners and bankers are positioning themselves to reduce their direct exposure.“The stock, if it remains under the cost of a cup of Starbucks coffee, Dynegy will not stay independent long,’’ Mr Williams said.Karl Miller, founder of MMC Energy and senior industry advisor, believes there will be widespread consolidation among the more than 250 mid- and large-size utilities and distribution companies in the US over the next 12 to 18 months.“People are not going to stop using electricity,’’ said Bill Holloran, a senior vice president at Day & Zimmermann, the largest power operations and maintenance firm in the country.That is why Mr Miller believes large pools of money will flow into the sector in the coming years to invest in the US’ ageing distribution infrastructure and much-needed new capacity. He said private capital will fill the gap developing from companies lack of access to public equity and debt markets, and to meet new energy and infrastructure needs, enabling deals to go through.“This will be a tremendous boom time for the healthy private equity/hedge funds and other private infrastructure funds that have the executive talent, execution capabilities to invest into the sector, consolidate weak energy companies and profit from the overall energy supply/demand deficit across all energy commodity products,’’ Mr Miller says.The key, he says, will be establishing a bona fide physical presence in the sector, with companies focused on managing risk, not just establishing a speculative trading desk as a proxy, which has led to the demise of many hedge funds and financial institutions in energy commodities, in both the crisis of confidence in the sector in 2001-2002 and this time around."
69;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-10-20T20:47:40Z;Bernanke comments give lift to Wall St;;An easing of the strain in money markets coupled with the prospect of a fresh economic stimulus package helped Wall Street begin the week with a strong rally.The market was cheered by comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, who said he backed more government spending to help stave off a protracted slowdown.After a sharp afternoon rally, the S&P 500 closed up 4.8 per cent at 985.40 while the Nasdaq Composite index was up 3.4 per cent at 1,770.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.7 per cent to 9,265.43.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, fell 24.3 per cent although, at 53.22, it continued to indicate heightened distress. Last week, the index shot up to breach 80 for the first time in its 18-year history.The energy sector led the rally, up 11.2 per cent overall. Halliburton jumped 13.9 per cent to $20.80 after the energy services group beat Wall Street’s expectations for third-quarter earnings.Weatherford International, which also posted better-than-expected results, gained 15.5 per cent to $16.96. National Oilwell Varco gained 22.2 per cent to $31.26.Oppenheimer upgraded several energy stocks, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, which rose 10.2 per cent to $74.99 and 11.6 per cent to $69.61 respectively. The sector also received a boost from oil prices, which rallied above $74 a barrel.At least 139 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.JPMorgan said that, as of last week, investors’ attention had “seemed to shift to the realisation that the economy is slowing…We are into the throes of earnings season. And on that front the news has not been so hearty.”The bank said that, so far, third-quarter earnings had fallen 35.4 per cent year-on-year, although they had increased 10.5 per cent excluding financials.Early on Monday, financials were the only sector not to find positive territory. They later rallied to stand 2.8 per cent higher, although underperformed the market.Peter Cardillo, market economist at Avalon Partners, said the equities market had a “brighter outlook” now that historic levels of stress in money markets had begun to ease following a series of vast interventions from authorities around the globe.Still, insurers Prudential and Metlife came under renewed pressure after Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on the pair due to the possible need for writedowns. Prudential lost 1.5 per cent to $41.15 although Metlife, down earlier in the session, rallied to stand 6.1 per cent higher at $33.03.General Growth Properties was among the biggest drags on the S&P, down 8.7 per cent to $5.59, on reports that the real estate investment trust was trying to sell up to $2bn in preferred shares to lower its debt.Credit card stocks posted modest gains ahead of results from American Express, which added 4.4 per cent to $24.35, due after the market closed. Investors will be keen to hear whether or not the Dow component’s high-income customers have fallen behind with payments or curtailed spending.In the consumer sector, Mattel lost 2 per cent to $14.16 after the toymaker’s earnings fell short of analyst forecasts. Rival Hasbro dipped 4.2 per cent to $28.87 even though its figures topped expectations.The consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors were up 3.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent, respectively.Technology, meanwhile, stood 3.3 per cent higher. Bucking that trend, Yahoo edged down 0.3 per cent to $12.86 after reports emerged that the internet search group may cut more jobs than already disclosed.Cisco added 5.9 per cent to $18.96 after Morgan Keegan raised its recommendation to “outperform”.Texas Instruments and SanDisk added 1.9 per cent to $17.98 and lost 7 per cent to $14.42 ahead of results due later in the day.Elsewhere, Eaton added 1.8 per cent to $45.22 after the manufacturer warned of a “significant slowdown” in demand.Among utilities NRG Energy rose 29.3 per cent to $25 after Exelon, the nuclear power operator, made an unsolicited $6.2bn offer to acquire the group. Exelon added 0.2 per cent to $54.59.
70;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-10-20T20:24:00Z;Exelon stalks NRG;;It took less than five months for NRG to go from being the hunter to the hunted. Utility Exelon now seeks to acquire it and become the largest US power producer.In May, NRG tried and failed to buy gas-fired giant Calpine in an audacious bid for dominance in wholesale power. Much has changed since then and little of it has been good for NRG, helping to slice 55 per cent off of its value and make its assets, particularly coal and nuclear plants, ripe for the picking by less-leveraged Exelon.But it looks unlikely that NRG’s board will roll over, despite the proposed 37 per cent premium to Friday’s close. Unless NRG faces the same type of problems financing collateral that pushed Constellation Energy into the arms of Berkshire Hathaway at a bargain price last month, it is better-served toughing out the nasty period that has seen weak wholesale power prices crush its margins. Future projects will be harder to finance for the junk-rated company, but this is no reason to sell.If Exelon must mount a hostile bid, one problem it faces is that a recovery in natural gas prices this winter would embolden NRG shareholders to vote against a deal as power margins recover. This might happen months before affected states grant regulatory approval.Another problem is that the new company would have to divest about 6 per cent of their combined capacity in a weak market and that a change of control would force Exelon to repurchase several billion dollars of NRG’s debt. Exelon has not yet secured financing and a deal would dent its own credit rating.Even with these headaches, Exelon reckons the all-share deal is an attractive one and they are probably right. NRG’s shareholders, though, would be selling out below fair value and would likely opt to stay independent.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click hereLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

71;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-09-19T19:13:41Z;EDF set to launch bid for US group;;EDF of France is planning to go on the offensive to protect its foothold in the US with an offer for Constellation Energy, the electricity utility that agreed on Thursday to a $4.7bn (€3.2bn) takeover by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.The board of the French utility agreed in an emergency meeting on Friday to back a joint bid with a US partner, as required under US regulations.The bid comes as it puts the final touches to its €15bn offer for British Energy, the UK’s nuclear operator, which owns 50 per cent of AmerGen Energy in the US. British Energy’s US partner is Peco, part of Exelon Generation Company.People close to Constellation said on Friday night that they had not yet received an offer from EDF, but others familiar with the French group’s situation said one was to be made on Friday night. It was possible EDF had found a US partner interested in Constellation’s exploration assets, one person suggested.EDF last year set up a joint venture with Constellation that was to have been its launchpad into the potentially lucrative US nuclear market.The French group’s board met on Thursday to consider a $500m capital injection into the US utility, which has been struggling to stem a crisis of confidence over its cash resources. But it said the conditions had not yet been met for an offer and EDF’s plans were pipped by the bid from Mr Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy group.The French company is determined to secure its position in Constellation, where it has a 9.5 per cent stake. Constellation claims to be one of the biggest suppliers of electricity in the US and has a portfolio of power plants across the country, with a particular focus on nuclear energy.On Tuesday, Constellation scrambled to find a buyer or secure an emergency capital infusion, when it became apparent that its investors were losing confidence in the stability of its commodities trading operations and credit ratings.Mr Buffett, whose investments are seen as high-quality seals of approval, has espoused being “greedy when others are fearful”. He has a history of investing in the US power sector, after buying shares of NRG Energy and lending to Williams, Reliant and TXU at hefty interest rates.Constellation will issue $1bn of preferred equity to MidAmerican at an 8 per cent yield as part of the deal, which was expected to close within nine months.Both companies’ boards of directors have approved the transaction, but it is subject to further financial review and a definitive agreement has not yet been signed.The deal was announced as early as possible in order to calm Constellation’s investors, who had driven its share price down nearly 60 per cent this week.
72;EXC;Exelon Corp;2008-03-16T19:04:37Z;Innovation can cause ‘carbon margin’;;"When Direct Energy, the power producer, realised it was only a matter of time before federal legislation was introduced penalising carbon emissions, it decided to set up a business that would help soften the blow.The electric utility’s new unit upgrades customers’ insulation, air conditioners and furnaces, making them more energy efficient. Direct Energy says it has proved successful with customers wanting to reduce their energy bills. As well as providing a new income stream, the power producer is also cutting down on the amount of carbon emissions it will have to pay for in the future.The company is one of a number of energy producers reducing their greenhouse gases ahead of future legislation.While the White House has not set out climate change policies, most energy companies expect that the next US administration will introduce legislation penalising their emissions of greenhouse gases.Larry Goldenhersh, chief executive of Enviance, which provides an internet-based compliance measuring and tracking system, says: “This issue has the potential to fundamentally alter the balance sheet of these companies. They could be forced under future
federal legislation to pay $13 to $40 a ton for carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, which would easily add $100m of annual costs on some balance sheets.”Deryk King, Direct Energy chairman and chief executive, says: “This is a marathon we are engaged in. This is going to take a decade to play out and we have to start now. Not just for the environment, but also if the power sector wants to limit its exposure to federal legislation on climate change expected in 2009.”Standard & Poor’s John Whitlock calls the discharge of carbon dioxide the “single biggest challenge” regulated electricity utilities will tackle this year. After all, the electricity utility industry produces a third of industry’s greenhouse gas emissions.Priscilla McLeroy, a director at Arthur D Little, the consultancy, says many companies, such as Direct Energy, are finding innovative ways to make profit margins from managing their carbon exposure. She calls it the “carbon margin”. The margins are derived not just in savings through energy efficiencies and avoided environmental taxes but in following Direct Energy’s lead and creating new revenue streamsSome energy groups are investing in new technologies.AEP is partnering technology vendors to install carbon capture equipment at one of its plants, while NRG is among those testing a process being developed by GreenFuel Technologies to use algae to consume carbon before it is harvested to make biofuels.Exelon, a leading US energy supplier, has been among the most aggressive in reducing its carbon footprint. It sold most of its coal-fired power plants seven years ago and is moving to build one of the nation’s first nuclear plants in decades. It runs its transport fleet on predominately biofuel or hybrid vehicles, is developing efficiency products for its customers and recently renovated its headquarters with energy efficient lighting, air conditioning and appliances that cut its electricity consumption by almost 50 per cent.John Rowe, Exelon chairman, president and chief executive, says: “Our goal is reduce, displace or offset the equivalent of our entire carbon footprint by 2020.’’Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, notes that more than 50 per cent of coal plants announced since 2000 have been cancelled because of looming carbon legislation on top of escalating costs underpinned by the global demand for talent and supplies.However, there is a downside to power producers’ focus on upcoming carbon legislation. Many are limiting much-needed investment in baseload generation because of fears over the costs of carbon legislation.Geir Vollsaeter, special adviser on climate change and carbon management for law firm Alston & Bird, says: “The US needs new generation urgently as the power demand/supply gap is widening.’’He is concerned about potential blackouts in coming years: “The situation is pretty critical in a lot of states with getting new generation on line.’’"
73;EXC;Exelon Corp;2007-03-04T19:14:07Z;Impact of the TXU bid;;The defining feature of the TXU takeover bid is its peculiar marriage of private equity’s largesse with the US green lobby’s newfound political power. But the Texan utility’s shareholders are not the only ones who stand to profit from this.TXU might have scaled back its plans to build new power plants – a decision announced alongside the deal – even without pressure from environmentalists. But the green angle is important. Wood MacKenzie estimates the industry had planned to build 53 gigawatts of new coal-fired capacity by 2012. TXU has removed 13 per cent of that already. More important, other utilities will think twice about building new coal-fired plants. Renewable and nuclear power cannot fill the resulting gap in the near term, so that means more gas-fired plants, which emit less carbon dioxide than coal. That, in turn, means high and volatile power prices in the near-term.Higher bills could eventually erode public support for action on climate change. By then, though, power generators themselves may have already accepted that the world has moved on. In a parallel with the early 1990s, when legislation to curb sulphur dioxide emissions came in, the industry may prefer the certainty of an agreed federal climate action plan, rather than the constant threat of new laws or a patchwork of state-level initiatives.As in Europe, generators with existing coal and nuclear plants should profit from a US power market linked to gas prices and are likely to start factoring a carbon cost into prices within, say, five years. Those in regions with little spare capacity and poor grid links should do particularly well. Citigroup identifies southern California and the area between Washington DC and Boston as two very constrained areas. That should benefit the likes of Constellation Energy, Exelon and Entergy. Higher power prices will also stoke sector valuations in another way. If TXU does fall to the barbarians, expect more generators to be taken private.
74;EXC;Exelon Corp;2007-02-26T18:42:21Z;Green promises help with TXU endorsement;;In dressing up their bid for TXU, the Texas-based utility, in a shiny green mantel, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group showed their presentational skills at their best.Their promises to reshape TXU’s environmental strategy, including the cancellation of eight of the 11 coal-fired power plants that the company planned to build in Texas, won them the endorsement of campaign groups such as the Natural Resources Defence Council - potentially valuable allies in what could be a contentious bid.The environmental issues raised by the bid are genuine, and the commitments made by KKR and TPG are sincere.As the US moves towards policies to curb carbon emissions, it is significant that the buyout partners say that TXU will throw its weight behind the campaign for mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions, and will cut its own emissions in the next decade.Like other power companies such as Exelon, they clearly see policy change as inevitable, and want to play a part in shaping it.Asked about the economic benefits of emissions cuts, John Wilder, TXU’s chief executive told the FT: “The economic case is negative. It’s fundamentally investing capital with meagre returns and in some cases no return at all. But it’s part of a broader long term approach to the business. It allows to have a social license to invest for the longer term.”But there are also some very sound reasons for TXU to drop its planned investment in power plants that are more hard-nosed than high-minded.The plan to add 11 power plants generating about 9,000 megawatts to TXU’s capacity was both commercially and politically ambitious.Politically, it stirred up a storm of criticism from environmental groups, and ran into trouble with the Texas authorities.Commercially, it involved a heavy spending programme. TXU boasted last year that while it was building its new plants it was likely to be investing more in Texas than the refining and micro-electronics industries put together. Its capital spending would have been about 135 per cent of its earnings from 2006-10.For a lean, cost-conscious private equity owner, such a large investment programme was never going to be appealing.Even without the bid, TXU might have had to think again about its spending, according to Anthony Damiano of Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, in Houston. The delays put into the programme by the political opposition, and rising costs for big capital prjects, were threatening its viability.“TXU made it very clear that part of the reason for doing this expansion so quickly was to keep the costs down, and delays getting the permits had raised the costs,” Mr Damiano said.“It raises the question of whether this deal is a way to get out of TXU’s difficulties in achieving this plan. If so, you have to say it has been brilliant, both for the PR spin and in terms of getting a getting a good valuation.”Another consequence of cutting back its planned increase in capacity will be to tighten the balance of supply and demand in the Texas electricity market.By cutting its investment plans, TXU is reducing the risk that there will be oversupply in the Texas market for the forseeable future.The more likely danger is that the market will go short. The standard measure of spare capacity in the power sector is the reserve margin: the excess of available generating capacity over peak-load demand.The generally agreed international standard for a comfortable reserve margin is about 15 per cent. Without TXU’s investment programme, it calculated, the reserve margin in Texas would drop to just 5 per cent early in the next decade. With that planned investment, the margin would have been 17 per cent.With three new coal-fired stations going ahead, and an old gas-fired station brought back into service, TXU will be able to go some way to fill that hole.But when regulators weigh up the bid, the risk of further blackouts in Texas, which has suffered from falling reliability of pwer supplies, are likely to be a focus of attention.Additional reporting by James Politi in New York
75;EXC;Exelon Corp;2007-01-17T18:31:32Z;Power companies endorse emissions cap bill;;In a sign that US electricity companies are recognising that the Democratic-controlled Congress will seek to impose aggressive climate change initiatives, six companies, including Exelon, one of the largest utility companies, on Wednesday endorsed a bill that would reduce their projected emissions by 25 per cent below projected levels by 2020.Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Democrat from California, and co-sponsor of the cap and trade bill with Tom Carper, a Democrat for Delaware, said the bill was the first time “major industry groups have endorsed a cap and trade bill which establishes emissions reductions as deep and aggressive as this bill”.The six companies, which have broken ranks with the rest of the industry, represent 15 per cent of the US electricity market and operate in 42 states. They include Calpine, Entergy, Florida Power and Light and PG&E Corporation.However, critics say that the six companies have a comparative advantage over rival power companies, in that they are less dependent on creating power from coal and have been more active in moving to nuclear power and wind power.Peter Darbee, chief executive of PG&E, which operates California’s largest utility company, acknowledged there was a degree of self interest by the companies. “There was a lot of push-back against global warming, but in the last few weeks there has been a view of the need to take proactive action to deal with this, otherwise we will be viewed as unconstructive. We want to be at the table.”Ms Feinstein said electricity companies accounted for a third of all US emissions, and that the bill was the first of five bills that would address global warming, including one to raise fuel economy standards by 10 miles per gallon over the next 10 years and a cap and trade proposal for the industrial sector.“You’ve got a cap and trade in seven north-eastern states, and in Europe and also California is looking to enter a cap and trade system.”She acknowledged resistance on Capitol Hill. “Coal dominates and is in 40 states, which makes garnering votes here in the Senate very difficult, so we decided whether there was some parts of industry with which we could work.”The White House also remains firmly opposed to cap and trade.The proposal underlines rising interest in cap and trade on Capitol Hill.
76;EXC;Exelon Corp;2006-09-24T19:20:42Z;US greenhouse gases;;Somewhere, somehow, someone’s going to pay. Two decades after starring in Commando – a film with a storyline as subtle as its tag-line – Arnold Schwarzenegger is gunning for greenhouse gases. California’s governor is at the vanguard of efforts to cut emissions. Last month, the state passed legislation to that effect. Meanwhile, seven northeastern states will cap emissions for power producers and allow them to trade permits from 2009, much like the European Union’s existing system.The White House may be no nearer to turning green – especially when it comes to taxing gasoline. But events like Hurricane Katrina are causing ordinary Americans to think again about climate change. Heavyweight potential presidential nominees on both sides of the political divide back federal emissions controls. Critics should remember that, in spite of a history of tough green measures, California’s economy has outpaced that of the US as a whole since 1970.The EU’s big mistake was to grant too many free emissions permits to power plants – basically handing them money without boosting investment in greener technologies. In the US, any eventual mix of free and auctioned permits would have big effects on utilities. The marginal generators, which set the price, are usually coal or gas-fired plants which would have to incorporate the cost of permits. That would widen margins for low-cost, carbon-free nuclear plants, but could hurt coal-fired generators.Citigroup has tried to quantify the effects of a hypothetical federal cap-and-trade system. In spite of uncertainties, the base-case scenario suggests a double-digit percentage point boost to the net present value of nuclear generators such as Exelon and Entergy. Coal-heavy rivals fare less well, especially in markets where cleaner gas-fired plants set prices or if more permits are auctioned rather than given away. Utilities investors should keep an eye on Arnie.
77;EXC;Exelon Corp;2006-05-31T01:06:42Z;NRG Energy rejects $8bn offer from Mirant;;"Mirant Corporation, the Atlanta-based electricity producer, on Tuesday night made an $8bn unsolicited approach to take over rival NRG Energy in a deal that would create the largest non-utility power company in the US, dominating the nation’s most populated regions.The cash-and-stock bid from Mirant, which is supported by an $11.5bn financing commitment from JPMorgan Chase, was made public after NRG earlier this month rejected the offer.Mirant is proposing to pay $57.16 per share for NRG in an equal mix of cash and stock.NRG on Tuesday night issued a statement responding to the latest offer, saying it was “not in the best interests of its shareholders.”“Having spent considerable time analysing Mirant, its assets and prospects…we have concluded that Mirant is a company and stock with flat earnings, little to no growth opportunity beyond 2007,” the statement said.Specific terms include the ability of NRG shareholders to receive $57.50 per share, valuing the company at a 33 per cent premium to its Tuesday closing price of $43.01. Mirant shares closed at $25.25.A successful takeover of NRG would position Mirant as the dominant player in non-utility - or merchant and contracted - power generation in Texas, the MidAtlantic region, the NorthEast and California. It would also mark the union of two companies that only recently emerged from bankruptcy. Both collapsed in the wake of the demise of Enron in 2001.The proposal comes as the US energy industry is experiencing a bout of consolidation. On Monday, a consortium of private equity firms offered $13.5bn to take over Kinder Morgan, the oil and gas pipeline company, in deal backed by management. US utilities have also participated in the dealmaking activity, but transactions such as FPL’s $11.5bn takeover of Constellation and Exelon’s $13bn bid for PSEG have encountered stiff regulatory hurdles.Mirant does not expect to be faced with the same obstacles, and believes a deal could close before the end of the year. The company is likely to woo NRG inevstors by describing benefits such as $150m in annual cost savings from corporate level integration; coal purchasing synergies ; and similar approaches to hedging.A takeover of NRG would come only a year after the NRG acquired Texas Genco, the Texas -based power group, in a landmark transaction for the four private equity owners that previously owned the assets and made about five times their money on the deal.These included Blackstone, Texas Pacific Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hellman & Friedman.Lawyers at Wachtell Lipton advised Mirant, along with bankers at JPMorgan, which provided exclusive advisory services as well as the financing."
78;EXC;Exelon Corp;2006-03-31T21:31:27Z;Inflation anxiety sparks sell-off in US equities;;Leading US equities lost ground this week as investors fretted over a build-up of inflationary pressure in the world’s largest economy, but still managed to record their strongest first quarter for seven years.Any hopes investors had harboured that the Fed might adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates under the new chairmanship of Ben Bernanke were quashed on Tuesday. The central bank raised rates by 25 basis points and warned further tightening might be necessary to combat inflation.The news sparked an equity sell-off, which was exacerbated on Thursday as an unexpected spike in the quarterly core personal consumption expenditures index – an inflation measure known to be closely scrutinised by the Fed – sent 10-year Treasury yields to their highest level in 22 months.Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the biggestleading fallers with utility Exelon falling 3.4 per cent over the week to $52.90, house builder Toll Brothers losing 2 per cent to $34.63, and bank Citigroup easing 1.2 per cent to $47.24.General Motors also weighed on sentiment as it tumbled 6.1 per cent to $22.65. The carmaker’s recent woes continued as its bankrupt parts supplier Delphi said it would seek to end certain supply contracts with GM and disclosures in its annual report prompted Standard & Poor’s to say it might downgrade the company’s credit rating further.There was no respite for investors on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent at 11,109.40, the S&P 500 eased 0.4 per cent to 1,294.85, while the Nasdaq Composite was unchanged at 2,312.82.Over the week, the S&P fell 0.6 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.5 per cent. But for the quarter the two indices both rose more than 4 per cent – their best performance since 1999.However, the Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend this week, rising 1.2 per cent amid increasing demand for technology stocks. The index recorded a 6.4 per cent rise over the quarter, its best performance since the tech bubble burst in 2000.Investors snapped up shares of wireless technology companies this week following Nokia’s upbeat guidance for the mobile phone industry.Nokia said it expected global handset sales to rise 15 per cent this year, up from its previous estimate of 10 per cent. The guidance dovetailed with a note from Cowen & Co. that said the outlook for the handset market was largely positive.NYSE-listed shares of Nokia rose 1.1 per cent to $20.72 over the week. Rival Motorola added 2.6 per cent to 22.91 and Texas Instruments, the world’s largest maker of mobile phone chips, rose 5.1 per cent to $32.47.Interest in telecommunications stocks was further boosted by the possible merger between telecom equipment maker Lucent and French rival Alcatel. Although Lucent shares were largely unchanged over the five sessions, speculation that more consolidation in the sector might be ahead drove shares of other network equipment makers higher. JDS Uniphase rose 3.5 per cent to $4.17 and Ciena gained 1.2 per cent to $5.21.Computer makers also performed strongly. Sun Microsystems rose 3.2 per cent to $5.13 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock by two notches from “underweight” to “overweight”. The broker said it believed the company was set to launch a restructuring over the next six months which would give it an significant opportunity to improve its financial performance.Google, which joined the S&P 500 yesterday, saw its shares advanced 6.6 per cent to $390.00 as index fund managers added the stock to their portfolios.Apple Computer, meanwhile, rose 4.6 per cent to $62.72 this week on expectations that the delay of Microsoft’s forthcoming Vista operating system would boost sales of the group’s Macintosh computers during the crucial holiday sales-fuelled fourth quarter.Elsewhere, Surging metal prices boosted aluminium producers Alcoa and Alcan, pushing their shares up 2.4 per cent to $30.56, and 0.9 per cent to $45.73, respectively. Copper producer Phelps Dodge, up 7.2 per cent to $80.53, was given an extra lift after Morgan Stanley upgraded its recommendation on the stock from “equal-weight” to “overweight”.
79;EXC;Exelon Corp;2005-12-19T14:10:29Z;FPL to buy Constellation for $11bn;;FPL Group on Monday agreed to acquire Constellation Energy in an $11.1bn all-stock transaction which analysts expect will trigger further consolidation in the US power-generation market.Shareholders in Florida-based FPL would hold 60 per cent of the enlarged entity, which would adopt the Constellation Energy brand and have pro forma annual revenues of $27bn, ranking it third in the US market behind the products of two other takeovers announced over the past 12 months.The new Constellation Energy would retain both well-regarded management teams and have a diversified mix of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power stations serving more than 7m customers.The two companies said a combination would also create the largest power producer in competitive markets, reflecting the complexities of the partially-deregulated US system and the pressures faced in regulated markets where retail and commercial prices are often capped in long-term supply agreements.“What you see here is a clear trend,” said Mark Williams, an energy expert at Boston University. ”FPL’s business is about 80-90 per cent regulated, and Constellation’s is about 75 per cent unregulated.”The two companies estimated the proposed deal would generate $200m-$250m in annual synergies after three years and expect regulatory approvals to take 9-12 months.Recent legislation and regulatory decisions have also increased the likelihood of further consolidation, and the stock prices of potential takeover candidates such as First Energy and Northeast Utilities have climbed in their wake.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently approved the planned purchase of PSEG by Exelon to create the largest US power producer, though the deal still has to secure other clearances. Ferc also backed the purchase of Cinergy by Duke Energy and MidAmerican’s acquisition of PacifiCorp.The new energy bill has added to the momentum, said Mr Williams. “Congress lifting the ban on interstate mergers lifts the flood gates. If you’re a medium to small-sized utility, watch out. If you’re a bigger utility, watch out, there might be ones that want to expand into your area.”The terms of the proposed FPL/Constellation deal are in line with media reports last week, with each common share of Constellation converted into 1.44 shares of the enlarged entity, a premium of 15 per cent on the average exchange ratio in the previous 20 days.FPL would have nine of the 15 board seats, with FPL head Lewis Hay taking on the chief executive role while Constellation’s Mayo Shattuck would become chairman.

81;EXC;Exelon Corp;2005-05-09T18:08:35Z;Duke Energy to buy Cinergy for about $9bn;;"Duke Energy on Monday agreed to buy Cinergy for $9.1bn in stock, a combination of two utilities that dominate the regulated gas and electrical businesses in parts of south-east and midwest US.The deal marks the second large merger since December in the US power industry, where regulatory obstacles and risk aversion among chief executives have prevented consolidation in recent years.Duke, based in North Carolina, will remain the second largest US utility after Exelon, which agreed to buy PSEG of New Jersey for $13bn five months ago. But the purchase of Cinergy will expand Duke's geographic reach into Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky - and increase its size to include $70bn in assets, $36bn in market capitalisation, 5.4m retail customers, $27bn in annual revenues and $1.9bn in annual net income.Duke has for at least one year been on the hunt for a merger partner. In September, Duke discussed a deal with FPL, the Florida utility worth about $15bn in market capitalisation.Those discussions broke down, and in December the company launched exploratory talks with Cinergy.Under the terms of the deal, Cinergy investors will receive 1.56 Duke shares for every Cinergy share.Based on Friday's closing prices, this exchange ratio values Cinergy at $45.80 - or a 13.4 per cent premium.Jim Rogers, Cinergy's chief executive, will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Paul Anderson, chief executive of Duke, becoming chairman of the enlarged Duke.One of Mr Anderson's priorities in finding an acquisition target for Duke was to select a company that could help revive its merchant operations, which, like many of its competitors, had been hit by the post-Enron crisis of confidence.The deal will also better position the enlarged Duke for a separation of its gas and electrical businesses, which it has been considering, according to people familiar with the matter.""This union is a great strategic fit and leaves us well positioned for continued consolidation in the energy sector, as both the electric and gas businesses will have the scale to stand alone,"" Mr Anderson said.The companies expect to produce cost savings of $400m within three years. About 1,500 jobs would be cut through attrition, early retirement and severance programmes, they indicated.Duke shares fell 1.87 per cent in morning trading to $28.81 on Monday. Cinergy shares rose 5.32 per cent to $42.53 - just below the offer price.UBS advised Duke, with Lazard providing a fairness opinion. Cinergy was advised by Merrill Lynch."

The Nasdaq Composite pulled back from an early rally, falling 0.3 per cent to 2,127.85.The three leading US indices have notched modest gains this month following a rally that began in late October and gained steam in November in the wake of the US presidential election.Last week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both touched 3½-year highs, and yesterday, Standard & Poors, the investment resarch group, said that it expects operating earnings on the S&P500 index to top $160bn in the fourth quarter - a new record. .Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach, said that, although he expected Wall Street to continue to gain ground through the year-end, economic growth was likely to slow in 2005 as the effects of rising interest rates take hold and prices rise to make up for the falling value of the dollar.Bullish investors focused on the short term were cheered in early trading by upbeat reports from Intel and Nokia, two bellwether tech stocks.Semiconductors rallied in early trading after analysts at JPMorgan raised their fourth-quarter earnings forecast for Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker. But investor sentiment later soured, pushing Intel shares down 0.3 per cent to $22.70 by the closing bell. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, fell 2.6 per cent to $21.84, while National Semiconductor fell 1.3 per cent to $17.40.Chipmakers have been hit this year by sagging demand that left many companies with bloated inventories and reduced pricing power. Although some investors welcomed the improved earnings forecast for Intel, one trader cautioned that chipmakers would not be out of the woods until there were clear signs of an inventory correction in 2005.Telecommunications equipment stocks were also in the spotlight after the chief executive of Nokia told the Financial Times he was confident that the market for mobile phones would grow by 10 per cent in 2005. Nokia's US-listed shares rose 0.6 per cent to $15.24.Shares in Motorola, a Nokia competitor, fell 0.3 per cent to $16.95.The pharmaceuticals sector continued to reel from Friday's warning that Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis medication had increased the risk of heart attacks in patients in clinical trials. Pfizer, which fell 11 per cent after the announcement on Friday, fell 5.7 per cent to $24.94 after the company said it would stop advertising the drug.Merck, which withdrew its arthritis painkiller after studies revealed that it increased the chance of heart problems, fell 0.3 per cent to $31.51.Energy stocks were among the best performers yesterday, led by Exelon, the nuclear power company. Exelon shares rose 2.8 per cent to $43.05 after the company announced a $13.2bn deal to buy Public Service Enterprise Group, a New Jersey-based rival. PSE shares jumped 7 per cent to $50.56.Monsanto, the life sciences group, rose 2 per cent to $52.49 after it said that operating profits should be better than expected in the first-quarter thanks to its booming trade in bio-engineered seeds.McAfee was the big loser among software stocks. Shares in the company, which specialises in anti-virus software, fell 6.8 per cent to $26.98 after Microsoft said it had chosen another company to provide virus-scanning services to customers of its Hotmail e-mail network. Shares in Trend Micro, the Japanese company chosen by Microsoft to replace McAfee, jumped 8.5 per cent to $54.78.Shares in Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, rose 0.4 per cent to $52.20 after it said sales last week had been stronger than expected. Kmart, a rival retail group, fell 1.9 per cent to $98.40, however, while shares in rival Target were flat at $50.54. Stephanie Hoff, analyst at Edward Jones, said that retailers had been forced to offer discounts to get people into stores following a week start to the holiday shopping season.""What that probably means is that margins [for the holiday season] will still be okay, but not as good as they could have been,"" she said.Fannie Mae, the embattled mortgage finance group, fell 1.3 per cent to $69.42 following reports that it had deferred a decision about whether to dismiss Franklin Raines as chief executive in the wake of an accounting scandal."
83;EXC;Exelon Corp;2004-12-08T22:03:51Z;Bush urged to accept fuel emissions limits;;The Bush administration and Congress should accept a mandatory programme of tradeable permits to limit greenhouse emissions and tighten fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, according to the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy.The commission which includes leading energy executives, former lawmakers and academics was set up three years ago and aimed to forge a politically viable national energy plan, bridging the gulf between those concerned with the environment and those focused on economic growth.The administration was widely criticised in its first term for failing to canvass a wide range of interest groups before pushing forward its energy plans. Efforts to pass a broad energy bill in the last Congress failed by just two votes in the Senate in November last year. The administration has resisted compulsory limits on emissions in favour of voluntary restraint by industry.Phil Sharp, one of the leading figures on the commission and a former chairman of the House energy subcommittee between 1986 and 1995, said the group's plan would impose mandatory constraints on carbon emissions but would cap the potential cost to industry.“The big barrier to any action of emissions has been concerns in industry that the costs were uncertain and might be too high,” Mr Sharp said. “This side has been winning but our plan meets these concerns.”The commission included leading executives from industries traditionally reluctant to endorse ambitious emission restraints, including John Rowe, chairman and chief executive of Exelon Corporation, Archie Dunham, former chairman of ConocoPhillips, and Martin Zimmerman, former vice-president of corporate affairs at Ford Motor Company.The key recommendations of the commission included a mandatory programme of tradeable permits to limit greenhouse emissions that would cap the initial cost at $7 (€5.2, £3.6) per metric tonne of carbon dioxide.The plan would also tighten fuel efficiency standards for US vehicles. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards were introduced after the 1973-74 oil embargo in an effort to reduce dependence on overseas oil. The standard has essentially been unchanged since 1987. There would also be $3bn spent over 10 years in incentives for carmakers to build efficient hybrid-electric and advanced diesel vehicles.The commission has briefed the White House and Congress leaders, including Pete Domenici, Senate Energy Committee chairman. The committee is expected to draft a new energy bill early next year and Marnie Funk, its spokeswoman, said senators would be receptive to new ideas. However, she was sceptical that measures to tighten fuel efficiency standards could be passed.
