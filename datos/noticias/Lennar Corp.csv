0;LEN;Lennar Corp;2019-06-25T13:51:23Z;New data point to softening US housing market;Home price gains moderate in April while new home sales fall in May;Investors were faced with a soft batch of US housing data, showing continued moderation in home prices and declining new home sales, but signs of returning buyers and early-stage construction approval.Tuesday’s data points, ranging from an index of home prices and new home sales to building permits, come against a backdrop of growing concern about the outlook for the US economy and debate about whether and when the Federal Reserve might begin to cut interest rates.House prices in across 20 major US cities rose 2.5 per cent year-on-year in April, according to the Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index. That was down from a rise of 2.6 per cent in March, which was revised down from 2.7 per cent, and a touch lower than the 2.6 per cent economists had forecast.Bright spots were Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tampa, which all saw year-on-year price gains of between 5.6 per cent and 7.1 per cent.“Home price gains continued in a trend of broad-based moderation” Philip Murphy at S&P Dow Jones Indices said in an accompanying statement.Rising mortgage rates in the first quarter of 2018 contributed to a drop-off in the housing market last year. Even though mortgage rates have since reversed course, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate below 4 per cent, “the [year-on-year] house price moderation that coincided with the 2018 uptick in rates has not changed course”.Other industry statistics backed up that observation, Mr Murphy said, pointing to rising national supply of housing that suggests weaker demand and a current potential trend that is seeing price increases normalise around their real long-run averages.Also disappointing were data from the Census Bureau out this morning that showed the number of new home sales fell to a five-month low of 626,000 in May. That was down from an upwardly revised 679,000 (previously 673,000) in April and below economists’ forecast for 680,000. The 7.8 per cent month-on-month drop was the steepest since December.Some players in the market are more upbeat about the moderation in house prices. Lennar, one of the US’s three biggest homebuilders, reported quarterly results on Tuesday that topped Wall Street estimates, and said affordability was a key factor drawing buyers back to the market.Stuart Miller, chairman, said the company “benefited from both first quarter deliveries postponed by weather as well as a recovering housing market” adding that moderation of home price growth in the second half of last year and lower mortgage rates “stimulated both affordability and demand, leading homebuyers back to the market.”Lennar reported a 2 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to $5.6bn in the three months ended May 31, which zipped past the median forecast of $5.1bn in a survey by Refinitiv. Net earnings of $1.30 a diluted share were 38 per cent higher than a year ago and ahead of Wall Street forecasts for $1.14 a share.At the more encouraging end of housing market data this morning, the number of building permits rose by 5,000 to 1.299m in May, according to data from the Census Bureau. The 0.7 per cent month-on-month increase was the quickest pace since November.
1;LEN;Lennar Corp;2019-03-27T18:10:00Z;US homebuilder stocks near 7-month high as outlook improves;Sector bucks wider Wall Street sell-off as Lennar and KB Home signal thaw in market;US homebuilders bulldozed through a rough day for US stocks on Wednesday, posting solid gains after a pair of companies in the sector signalled a thaw in the housing market this spring.Lennar, the nation’s largest homebuilder, reported first-quarter orders that exceeded its own expectations amid a decline in mortgage rates and moderating home prices. KB Home, whose quarterly profits topped analysts’ forecast, also offered a view that the housing market is recovering from its 2018 slog.The Federal Reserve’s about-face on interest rates last week, when the central bank pencilled in zero rate increases this year, should “help to sustain the favorable macro environment,” according to KB Home chief executive Jeff Mezger.“Overall, the backdrop for the homebuilding industry is positive, and we are optimistic about our ability to capture the demand for homeownership,” Mr Mezger told analysts during an earnings call.The builders’ optimism drove gains across the sector on an otherwise tough day for US stocks. The Dow Jones US Home Construction Index surged 3.3 per cent to hit its highest level since September 5. PulteGroup was among the biggest winners with a 4.7 per cent gain, while Lennar advanced 4 per cent.Homebuilders have faced headwinds from elevated prices and interest rates that kept potential buyers on the sidelines, as well as higher lumber prices and a labour shortage. But the industry appears to be pointing toward a brighter future, encouraged by wage growth and a recent drop in borrowing costs that has lured buyers back into the market.Lennar executive chairman Stuart Miller noted that the group saw increased interest in purchases as the first quarter progressed, “part of an improving and stabilizing housing market.”“We continued to see choppiness in the marketplace during our first quarter, consistent with what we highlighted on our fourth quarter conference call. However, during the quarter, mortgage interest rates subsided and ultimately pulled back and home prices moderated providing a catalyst for the new home market to correct itself,” Mr Miller said in a statement.Mortgage rates sank to an average of 4.45 per cent from 4.55 per cent in the week ending on March 22, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said Wednesday, well below a peak of 5.17 per cent in November. The group also found that applications for home loans rose 9 per cent last week.“As we move into the heart of the spring selling season, we are optimistic that we will see a continued improvement in the demand for new homes,” Mr Miller added.Lennar reported a 24 per cent increase in new orders year-over-year during the latest quarter to 10,463 units, aided by its acquisition of CalAtlantic Group. The result topped the high end of Lennar’s prior guidance range of 9,700 to 10,000 units.Order growth and Lennar’s upbeat comments on the real estate market overshadowed a disappointing bottom line as earnings per share of 74 cents, up from 53 cents a year earlier, missed Wall Street forecasts by a penny.KB Home meanwhile said it expected stronger revenues in the second half of fiscal 2019 amid “improving market conditions” and expectations that it can capitalise on demand during the busy spring selling season. In the quarter ending on February 28, the Los Angeles-based company registered earnings per share of 31 cents, better than the 26 cents analysts expected.
2;LEN;Lennar Corp;2019-01-09T15:14:27Z;US housing market uncertainty prompts Lennar to scrap guidance;Builder says higher home prices and rising mortgage rates weigh on results;Softness and uncertainty in the domestic housing market has prompted Lennar, one of the three biggest homebuilders in the US, to refrain from issuing earnings guidance for fiscal year 2019.The decision came as the Miami-based company said higher home prices and rising mortgage rates weighed on its fourth-quarter results, steering it towards revenue that missed analysts’ forecasts.The impact of higher home prices and borrowing costs has been felt across the broader universe of US homebuilding stocks, many of which finished 2018 in bear markets.Stuart Miller, chief executive, said he believed the company was “well positioned to continue our solid performance” in the new year, but warned that “due to continued softness and uncertainty at this seasonally slower time of year, we are deferring guidance for fiscal year 2019 until the markets further define themselves.”Notwithstanding the Federal Reserve’s decision in December to raise interest rates for the fourth time in 2018, there have been some signs of life in US housing data. Mortgage applications jumped 23.5 per cent in the week ended January 4, the biggest jump since October 2015, data on Wednesday morning showed. Meanwhile, housing starts hit their highest level since August, according to the most recent data for the month of November.During the final three months of last year, Lennar was not alone among peers in warning that higher interest rates and elevated house prices would weigh on new orders and completion rates.New orders jumped 64 per cent from a year ago to 14,154 homes in the three months ended November 30, but this missed the 14,485 average from analysts, according to Refinitiv. Gross margin on home sales was 21.4 per cent in the quarter, down one percentage point from a year ago.That flowed through to revenue of $6.46bn in the quarter, up 71 per cent from a year ago, but below Wall Street forecasts for $6.53bn. Excluding a series of items related to major acquisitions last year — which had given a substantial year-on-year boost to revenues — reported earnings came in at $1.96 a diluted share.Lennar shares were up 2.1 per cent in early trade on Wednesday morning, better than the 0.2 per cent gain for the S&P 500. The company’s stock shed nearly 40 per cent in 2018, but is up by 12 per cent so far this year.
3;LEN;Lennar Corp;2018-11-28T17:59:08Z;Homebuilder stocks weighed down by surprise drop in new home sales;;US homebuilders came under pressure on Wednesday as investors balanced a surprise drop in new-home sales with hopes that mortgage rate increases may subside.Lennar fell as much as 3.1 per cent, and Toll Brothers tumbled 4 per cent at its intraday low after the US Census Bureau said sales of newly built homes were down 8.9 per cent to their lowest level since March 2016.Homebuilders clawed back amid a broader market rally in reaction to a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell. Lennar, KB Home and DR Horton were higher in midday trading. Toll Brothers and PulteGroup edged 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent lower, respectively. The broader S&P 500 rallied 1.4 per cent.In a speech in New York, Mr Powell said the Fed’s monetary policy is not following a “preset” path and interest rates “remain just below” the so-called neutral rate, which neither boosts nor restricts economic growth. Investors took the remarks as a sign that the central bank may be nearing the end of its rate-rise cycle.Rising mortgage rates, along with a dearth of available homes, elevated prices and higher material costs, have weighed on the broader real estate sector this year. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a loan balance of $453,100 or less was 5.12 per cent for the week ending November 23, compared with 4.23 per cent in January, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Sales of existing homes in the US rose in October to end a six-month losing streak, but the National Association of Realtors warned last week that interest rates are scaring off first-time homebuyers and sales could further decline before stabilising.
4;LEN;Lennar Corp;2017-11-03T21:40:02Z;US tax reform plan hits buyout groups and homebuilders;Republican proposals to overhaul deductions weigh on stocks;Shares of Apollo Global Management logged their largest weekly decline in almost nine months as investors weighed the implications of Republican legislators’ plan to overhaul the US tax system.One of the country’s largest private equity groups led a decline that also hit several of its peers, including Blackstone and KKR.Investors were parsing the 429-page proposal to cap the tax deductibility of interest payments exceeding 30 per cent of income, which could hurt buyout firms that use debt to finance most of their acquisitions.“This is a proposal — this is before the lobbyists and bankers try to move the football down the field,” said Richard Farley, chairman of law firm Kramer Levin’s leveraged finance group.“It is a long way from saying interest deductibility is going away, which a lot of people feared. As a starting point, it’s not great.”Apollo was 3.3 per cent lower for the week at $31.29 by close of trading. Blackstone and KKR also notched their second consecutive weeks of declines, with losses of 1.8 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively. By contrast, rival Carlyle Group was up 0.7 per cent for the week.In the credit markets, the tax proposals were seen as a concern for highly leveraged companies where reduction in the corporate tax rate may not offset the loss of interest expense deductions.“Spec-grade companies pay relatively little in taxes, in part due to the tax shield from the interest deduction,” said Christina Padgett, an analyst at rating agency Moody’s. “Leveraged buyouts and industry sectors with the highest debt-to-ebitda leverage are among the most vulnerable.”Shares of homebuilders also slipped, as the tax plan would limit Americans’ ability to deduct mortgage interest costs from their taxable income. It would deny the tax break to buyers of new homes worth more than $500,000.The Dow Jones US Select Homebuilders index closed 0.7 per cent lower for the week, following a 2.3 per cent drop on Thursday, marking its first weekly decline in two months.Toll Brothers lost 3.6 per cent for the week while Lennar slid 5.8 per cent.“The biggest winners,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors, “are small-caps because their effective tax rate is much higher than large-caps.”The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalisation stocks was 0.9 per cent lower for the week. The S&P 500 index of large multinational companies was 0.3 per cent higher for the five trading days.Mr Chiavarone cautioned that the tax reform proposals still had to be pushed through.“The first thing that everyone realised is that what we saw today is not going to become law,” he said. “It is an important next step that takes principles and puts them into a policy perspective.”
5;LEN;Lennar Corp;2017-11-02T14:38:07Z;Homebuilders hit after Republicans propose cap on mortgage-interest deduction;;Homebuilders were in investors’ firing line on Thursday after US House of Representatives Republicans proposed plans to place new limits on the amount that homeowners can claim in tax credits on their mortgage interest costs.One of the sacred cows in the US tax codes, the home mortgage interest deduction can result in massive annual tax savings for those who live in areas with high real-estate prices, and it has played an important role in keeping house prices frothy.Under the tax reform bill unveiled by Republicans earlier this morning, the ability to deduct mortgage interest costs from taxable income will only be allowed for new home purchases under $500,000.The news sent shares in the country’s largest homebuilders lower.Toll Brothers skidded 6.3 per cent to $43.74, while Lennar, which this week agreed to buy smaller rival CalAtlantic for $5.7bn, was down 2.3 per cent to $55.66. DR Horton shed 1.4 per cent to $44.11 and KB Home shed 3.3 per cent to $26.64.
6;LEN;Lennar Corp;2017-10-30T11:27:10Z;US homebuilder Lennar to buy CalAtlantic in $9.3bn deal;;Lennar has on Monday unveiled plans to buy competitor CalAtlantic Group in a $9.3bn deal that the duo says will create the biggest US homebuilder.Under the terms of the deal, which includes the assumption of $3.6bn in debt, each CalAtlantic share will be valued at about $51.34. That represents a premium of 26.8 per cent to its closing price on Friday.“This combination is first and foremost to enhance shareholder value. The transaction is accretive before deal costs in fiscal year 2018 and significantly accretive in fiscal year 2019,” said Lennar chief executive Stuart Miller.“This combination increases our scale in the markets that we already know and in the products we already offer to entry level, move up and active adult customers.”The pact comes at a time when the supply of homes on the US market has remained low, pressuring sales of previously owned homes.The combined group would have posted revenues over the past 12 months of more than $17bn. The tie-up is expected to generate annual cost savings and synergies of approximately $250m, with approximately $75m achieved in fiscal year 2018.CalAtlantic shares jumped 8.8 per cent in pre-market trading.
7;LEN;Lennar Corp;2017-07-11T20:36:51Z;US homebuilders retreat after Barclays downgrades;Wall Street stocks mixed ahead of Fed commentary and a number of earnings reports;The vigorous rally this year for US homebuilders is built on an increasingly shaky foundation, Barclays warned on Tuesday, weighing on shares of several large groups in the industry.Analyst Michael Dahl cut Lennar, PulteGroup and Tri Pointe Group to “equal weight” while hitting luxury builder Toll Brothers with an “underweight” rating.All four stocks have posted large gains in 2017, ranging from a 34 per cent rise at Pulte and a 16.7 per cent increase at Tri Pointe.Investors have bid up the sector given the strength in the housing market, strong returns in the stock market that have boosted wealth and low inventories of previously owned homes.In fact, Mr Dahl believes the rate of the start of new single-family home construction will rise 9 per cent in 2017 and 8 per cent the following year.“This is not a bearish call on housing,” he said, noting, however, that “our views on housing and homebuilder stocks are not always one and the same”.Mr Dahl pointed to a Barclays survey showing that buyer traffic moderated last month, suggesting that “demand trends have started to decelerate”.“Agents blamed a combination of worsening affordability and lack of quality inventory,” he said.At the same time, homebuilders face “continued land and labour pressures” and material-cost headwinds that could weigh on profit margins, Mr Dahl said.“At minimum, builders appear to face a high bar over the next several months to justify these higher valuations,” he added.Pulte fell 1.6 per cent by the close of trading in New York to $24.67, Lennar slid 1.5 per cent to $53.73, Tri Pointe declined 0.7 per cent to $13.40 and Toll Brothers fell 1.9 per cent to $40.19.Meanwhile, the broader equities market was mixed as the Trump Russia controversy deepened with Donald Trump Jr tweeting an email exchange with a Russian lawyer, and investors were eagerly awaiting commentary due on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve chair, a heavy slate of earnings and the beginning of the corporate reporting season.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,425.53, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 21,409.07 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.3 per cent to 6,193.30.“Markets still appear to be cautiously awaiting [Janet Yellen’s] testimony to Congress tomorrow and a several key data points on Friday, including June [consumer price index] readings and the start of second-quarter earnings season for the banks,” said Peter Cecchini, head of equities derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald.Stock traders were also eyeing shares in the latest batch of US initial public offerings that have fared poorly since making their stock market debuts.Snap, the parent of Snapchat, tumbled 9 per cent to $15.47 after getting hit with a Morgan Stanley downgrade. It is now trading below the $17 that it floated shares at in March.Meal-delivery service Blue Apron also dropped 12.3 per cent to $7.14, below its June offer price of $10.
8;LEN;Lennar Corp;2016-12-19T16:08:01Z;US homebuilders lifted by upbeat Lennar results;;Homebuilder shares rallied on Monday after Lennar, the second-largest US homebuilder, posted upbeat fiscal fourth quarter results. Shares in the Miami-based company jumped three per cent to $44.69 after it said profits climbed to $313.5m or $1.34 a share in the three months ended in November, compared with $281.6m or $1.21 a share in the prior year quarter. Total revenues jumped nearly 15 per cent to $3.4bn. Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of $1.28 a share, on sales of $3.3bn.Revenues were driven by a nine per cent increase in new orders of homes to 6,598. The dollar value of those new orders rose 12 per cent to $2.4bn.US housing has been supported by strong job gains, improving wages and historically low mortgage rates, that have only recently begun to shift higher.“With the anticipation of a new President focusing on accelerating economic growth, we believe that our fortified balance sheet, our diversified business model and our refined product offerings, will continue to hold us in good stead in a high-growth economy, despite the potential of moderately rising interest rates over the next several years,” Stuart Miller, chief executive, said.The rally in Lennar shares also pushed other homebuilders higher on Monday. KB Home shares climbed 2.5 per cent to $16.95, Toll Brothers shares rose 1.7 per cent to $32.14, PulteGroup shares advanced 2.7 per cent to $19.34 and shares in Hovanian Enterprises jumped 3.6 per cent to $2.88.
9;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;LEN;Lennar Corp;2016-09-19T21:05:41Z;Pulte, Lennar and DR Horton rise on strong US builder sentiment;Equities give up earlier gains as investors await monetary policy decisions;The shares of US homebuilders kicked the week off in the black as investors cheered upbeat data on new home construction.The S&P 500 homebuilding index rose 1.6 per cent on Monday after a closely watched report that showed homebuilder sentiment jumped this month.PulteGroup rose 1.5 per cent to $19.87, Lennar advanced by 1.7 per cent to $45.09 and DR Horton climbed 1.6 per cent to $30.46.The National Association of Home Builders’s gauge rose to 65 in September, from 59 the month prior. That beat Wall Street estimates of 60, and matched the October 2015 reading — the highest since 2005.“As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing market continues to move forward,” said Ed Brady, NAHB chairman.Still, there “remains a big disconnect between what homebuilders have been saying and what they have been doing”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. Indeed, Mr Shapiro noted that the NAHB index had risen to levels last seen when construction of single-family homes were proceeding at a significantly swifter clip than it is today.Elsewhere, energy shares also climbed as crude oil gained. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, rose 0.6 per cent to $43.30 a barrel. International standard Brent was up 0.4 per cent at $45.95 a barrel.The gains followed Venezuela saying Opec countries and other big producers were close to a deal to stabilise output, and amid tumult in Libya.Kinder Morgan, an energy infrastructure group, rose 2 per cent to $21.90, while oilfield services company Halliburton climbed 1 per cent to $41.44.In the biotech sector, Sarepta Therapeutics almost doubled earlier in the day after the US drugs regulator approved its treatment for duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal childhood disorder.Some analysts expected the Food and Drug Administration to knock the drug back after an advisory panel voted to reject the medicine amid scepticism from the agency’s scientists.The shares were up as much as 99.6 per cent to $56.18. The stock later retreated slightly, ending the day nearly 74 per cent higher at $48.94At the close of trade, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,139.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 18,120.2, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.2 per cent to 5,235.The utilities, real estate and financials sectors led the way higher, while telecommunications, healthcare and information technology lagged behind.Investors await monetary policy decisions this week from the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.The market-implied odds of a rate rise this month from the Fed have fluctuated in a wide range in recent weeks as investors have parsed mixed economic data and commentary from top officials. The probability that the central bank will increase rates for the first time since December 2015 stood at just 20 per cent on Monday, down from 32 per cent two weeks ago.“We believe the data have met the Fed’s threshold” to raise rates, economists at Barclays said on Monday, adding however that “we view this as a close call”.

Net income advanced 58 per cent to $105.5m, or 61 cents per share.“Through the first three weeks of August, the beginning of our fourth quarter, our non-binding reservation deposits are up 23 per cent,” said Douglas Yearley, the company’s chief executive. “Every region showed growth in contracts of anywhere from 9 per cent to 29 per cent.”The report preceded stronger than expected new home sales in the country, which climbed 12.4 per cent to an annualised pace of 654,000 units, according to the US Census Bureau. The figure marked the fastest pace of newly built home sales since 2007.“Homes are literally flying off the shelves here with a record pace for this long recovery from the great recession,” said Chris Rupkey, an economist with the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ. “We expect the sales gains to continue with the labour market tightening and wages starting to pick up.”Shares of Toll Brothers advanced 8.8 per cent to $31.91. Rivals in the industry also climbed on the results, with Lennar up 3 per cent to $47.94, DR Horton rising 2.9 per cent to $32.99 and KB Home gaining 4.9 per cent to $16.13.US stock markets neared record levels on Tuesday with the benchmark S&P 500 briefly coming less than one point from touching its all-time high.The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to 2,186.9 on the day in New York.

Revenues rose 14.8 per cent to $2.7bn, also beating analysts’ estimates.“The homebuilding market continued its slow and steady recovery sustained by low interest rates, modest wage growth, positive consumer confidence and low unemployment levels combined with tight inventory levels,” said Stuart Miller, chief executive.The group added that deliveries rose 12 per cent on a year-on-year basis to 6,724 homes while new orders were up 10 per cent to 7,962 homes.The upbeat sentiment from Lennar comes as data have painted a mixed picture of the strength of the US economy. Indeed, job growth slowed sharply in May while capital investment has remained sluggish, factors that some economists have said could weigh on the housing market.Lennar’s shares rose as much as 3.3 per cent to $48.18, however the rally turned and they ended the day 0.9 per cent lower at $46.22. Meanwhile, KB Home, which was set to post its earnings after the closing bell in New York on Tuesday, rose by 0.6 per cent to $14.57.Elsewhere, United Continental’s shares flew higher after the group unveiled a brighter revenue outlook and a $3bn plan to cut costs and drive sales higher.United said passenger unit revenue, an important metric for airlines, will probably decline by 6.5-7.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the second quarter, compared with a previous estimate of a fall of as much as 8.5 per cent.The group also said it was making “improvements across the commercial organisation” that are expected to generate $1.5bn in value, along with cost structure improvements that may produce a $1.3bn benefit.It also plans to create $300m in value by running more reliably, which will cut costs associated with delays and cancellations.The shares jumped 3.5 per cent on Tuesday to $44.91, cutting their year-to-date loss to 21.6 per cent.CarMax, a used car retailer, skidded after posting disappointing profits and sales figures.The company said its net earnings declined by 3.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $175.4m. Earnings per share of 90 cents missed market expectations by two cents. Sales rose 2.8 per cent to $4.1bn, also missing forecasts of $4.2bn.CarMax’s shares dropped 4.9 per cent to $48.16 and have declined by 30.4 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 0.3 per cent to 2,088.9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced by 0.1 per cent to 17,829.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 4,843.8.The energy, telecommunications and technology sectors posted the best performance while materials, healthcare and consumer discretionary struggled.Market strategists said that, despite the modest fluctuations on Tuesday, volatility might increase in the run-up to, or after, the referendum on Thursday by UK citizens over whether the country should part ways with the EU.
13;LEN;Lennar Corp;2016-03-29T20:13:35Z;Homebuilder Lennar’s profits build on US housing market strength;Wall Street stronger after Janet Yellen Fed speech;Lennar shares climbed on Tuesday after the US homebuilder posted better than expected quarterly results amid strength in the housing market.The Miami-based company said its profits climbed to $144.1m, or 63 cents a share, in the quarter to the end of February, compared with $115m, or 50 cents a share, in the same period the year before. Revenues jumped 21.2 per cent to $2bn as home deliveries and prices both rose.Wall Street analysts expected profits of 52 cents a share on sales of $1.9bn.Forward-looking indicators, including the number of new orders and the size of Lennar’s backlog climbed higher as well, “keeping us well positioned going forward”, the company said.“We continue to believe that the housing market is continuing its slow and steady recovery driven by years of under production, tight inventory levels, attractive interest rates and the lowest unemployment levels since 2008,” chief executive Stuart Miller said.Indeed, a closely watched report released on Tuesday showed home prices continued rising at more than twice the rate of inflation in January in the latest indication the housing market remains robust even after the Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark interest rate in December for the first time in almost a decade.Lennar’s shares jumped 3.2 per cent to $48.19, cutting their year-to-date loss to 1.5 per cent. The rally also lifted the shares of other homebuilders: DR Horton rose 2.8 per cent to $30.69, while PulteGroup rose 2.2 per cent to $18.51.Elsewhere, shares of Chipotle fell after an analyst at Wedbush cut his rating on the stock to “underperform” from “neutral”.Nick Setyan warned that Chipotle’s current valuation reflects an “overly optimistic outlook regarding [its] path to recovery” from a string of food safety issues that roiled the US burrito chain last year. He added that a sales recovery by 2018 “is the best-case scenario, not the base-case scenario”.At the same time, Chipotle’s profit margin will probably come under pressure from increased safety measures, labour costs and other operating expenses, Mr Setyan reckons.The shares fell 3.2 per cent on Tuesday to $460.64, bringing their decline of the past 12 months to less than a third. Still, they have recovered by 12 per cent since hitting a low in January.The energy sector also fell amid a sell-off in the price of crude oil. West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, dropped 2.2 per cent to $38.55 a barrel, while international marker Brent crude shed 2.3 per cent to $39.37 a barrel. After rallying in mid-February, concerns are again mounting about high supplies and tepid global demand.Transocean, an offshore rig operator, was one of the worst performers on the S&P 500 energy index, dropping 4.4 per cent to $8.88. Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 5 per cent to $21.46.US markets were stronger after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen reiterated a cautious outlook in a speech that highlighted the risks posed to the US by a global economic slowdown.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 2,055.02, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 17,633.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.7 per cent to 4,846.62.

They closed up 0.43 per cent at $16.30.They did, however, lower their price target on the stock to $22.50 from $24.The upgrade was driven by expectations for improving home order growth and above average earnings per share growth in 2016, according to Michael Rehaut, an analyst at JPMorgan. He also cited the stock’s “attractive relative valuation”. PulteGroup shares fell 17 per cent last year.The move arrived on the back of a recent sell-off in shares of US homebuilders.The S&P 500 homebuilder index, which includes just DR Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar Corp, has declined 16 per cent since the start of December.Meanwhile, JPMorgan’s portfolio of US homebuilders has declined 21 per cent over that period.But Mr Rehaut argued that the recent decline in homebuilder stocks was overdone, noting that “housing’s key fundamental drivers across demand, supply and affordability remain relatively unchanged, in our view, over the last several months”.Housing starts — a measure of the amount of work started on homes — for single-family homes and sales of newly built homes are estimated to grow 10 per cent, while home prices are expected to rise between 3 and 5 per cent this year, similar to 2015.JPMorgan also upgraded Meritage Homes to “overweight” from “neutral”. Its shares closed up 0.48 per cent to $29.21.Wednesday was marked by differing fortunes for the shares of America’s two largest carmakers.Shares in General Motors jumped as much as 5.3 per cent to $31.90 after the company raised its profit forecast for this year as the post-recession boom in car sales extends into a seventh year. They closed up 0.63 per cent at $30.49.As an added sweetener for investors, GM lifted its dividend by 2 cents to 38 cents a share while more than doubling a share buyback programme to $9bn.However, the stock remains down more than 9 per cent this year after a torrid first week of trading.By contrast, investors dumped shares of Ford even after the Detroit-based company said its operating margins in 2016 would at least equal those of last year, and introduced a special dividend.Analysts at UBS pointed out that the forecast was at the “low end” of a previous range and were puzzled that Ford anticipates higher costs given the price of many raw materials have been falling.Ford’s shares were 5.06 per cent lower at $12.20. They are down around 13 per cent this year.The S&P 500 struggled to hold on to a third day of gains as energy and consumer discretionary stocks dragged the index lower.By the close the S&P 500 was down 2.5 per cent to 1,890.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 2.21 per cent to 16,150.49 and the Nasdaq Composite was down more than 3.4 per cent to 4,526.40.

Alibaba’s shares dropped 5.9 per cent to $72.77.Several casino companies that have large operations in Macau fell sharply amid fears that a cooling Chinese economy and a corruption crackdown by Beijing will keep gamblers away.Wynn Resorts, which generated 58.7 per cent of its revenue from Macau in the third quarter, sold off by 9.4 per cent to $60.19. Las Vegas Sands dropped 9.1 per cent to $39.79.Also in the red on Thursday were so-called cyclical stocks, which tend to be sensitive to economic fluctuations. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of heavy machinery, dropped 3.4 per cent to $63.94, a steeper fall than US markets more broadly.Metals miners suffered as the price of copper, a key industrial commodity, slumped 1.6 per cent, touching the lowest level since 2009. Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, slid 9.2 per cent to $5.61.Elsewhere KB Home shares fell 14.8 per cent to $10.05 after the homebuilder reported disappointing fourth-quarter results.The Los Angeles-based company reported profits of $44.1m, or 43 cents a share, on sales of $985.8m. This was short of Wall Street estimates for earnings of 50 cents a share, on sales of $1.1bn.KB Home delivered 2,580 homes last quarter, up 16 per cent from a year ago, but chief executive Jeff Mezger said inclement weather and labour shortages in some markets had “tempered” deliveries and “ultimately impacted our profitability for the quarter”.Homebuilders came under pressure after the disappointing results and amid a broader market sell-off. DR Horton fell 4 per cent to $28.53, Lennar slid 4 per cent to $43.43, and PulteGroup dropped 4 per cent to $16.22.Meanwhile Walgreens Boots Alliance said its net earnings in the quarter to November 30 had been 30.5 per cent higher than in the same period in 2014.

Revenues rose 24 per cent to $2.5bn.Analysts had forecast earnings of 79 cents a share, on sales of $2.4bn.The company said orders of homes climbed 10 per cent in the third quarter to 6,495, while deliveries increased 16 per cent to 6,318 homes.“The new home and rental markets continued to have significant pent-up demand, which positions us well for years to come,” said Stuart Miller, chief executive.“This demand is driven primarily by a large production deficit built up over the last several years, an increasing millennial population, reasonable affordability levels and high-rental occupancy rates.”Shares of Lennar rose as much as 2 per cent to $52.95 before paring back all gains to $51.59 by markets close.Micron Technology shares gained 2 per cent to $15.75 after analysts at Barclays initiated coverage on the stock with an “overweight” rating and a price target of $20.Recent weak demand and pricing trends in memory chips called Dram, dynamic random-access memory, have weighed on the stock.Now analysts argue that the “near-term risk is already priced in” and that price trends should improve in 2016 as demand from PCs and handsets picks up.US stocks began the week on the front foot following the late sell-off last week after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,966.97, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 16,510.19.

That is a place-holding figure that typically changes.Freeport paid $9bn for two oil and gas producers, McMoRan Exploration and Plains Exploration and Production, in 2013, when crude was trading at far loftier levels.The company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FMOG. Barclays will advise on the listing.Ford shares gained 1 per cent to $15.50 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy” and raised the price target from $18 to $19.“The key driver is a superior growth outlook at Ford as it starts to see the volume, mix, and pricing benefits from the F-150 launch in the second half of 2015, as well as still improving positioning in China,” Patrick Archambault, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said.Meanwhile, shares of General Motors fell 3 per cent to $35.16, after Mr Archambault and his team downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral” and cut their price target from $47 to $40.Netflix shares jumped as much as 3 per cent after the streaming site’s board approved a seven-for-one stock split plan.

In a filing with US regulators, however, Whiting said the company was not “pursuing any significant strategic transaction at this time”.The news came alongside plans to sell 35m new shares and raise $1.75bn in convertible bonds.Chesapeake Energy was given a boost after the company cut its budget further. The Oklahoma City-based company cut its 2015 capital budget by $500m to a range of $3.5bn to $4bn on Monday, amid the drop in crude prices.Chesapeake had already lowered its budget for capital expenditures by more than a fifth from a year earlier, expecting in February to spend between $4bn and $4.5bn this year.In 2014, the company’s capital expenses before acquisitions totalled $5.8bn.The company said it would also lower its rig count 55 per cent from a year earlier to between 25 to 35. Chesapeake shares advanced 1 per cent to $14.26.A higher than expected rise in February new home sales boosted homebuilder shares on Tuesday. PulteGroup climbed nearly 2 per cent to $21.94 and shares of Lennar climbed 2 per cent to $50.44.Overall healthcare and utilities led the S&P 500 lower after a rally in technology stocks gave up its gains.The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 2,091.50, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased 0.6 per cent to 18,011.14 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.3 per cent to 4,994.73.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
20;LEN;Lennar Corp;2015-03-15T18:02:17Z;Week ahead: Fed looms large;UK Budget, Israeli election and Iran talks expected to dominate the week;"The US Federal Reserve looms large over a busy week ahead.Investors will be scrutinising the next statement from the Federal Reserve as debate rages over when the central bank will raise rates. While investment banks for the most part expect an increase in June, markets continue to wager that it will not arrive until September or October.Outside Washington, attention will centre on the UK budget, Israeli elections and the next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme. Below are a few of the main events to watch in the week ahead.Federal ReserveThe US central bank will hold a critical meeting this week after laying the groundwork earlier this year for the first rate rise since the financial crisis. Economists on Wall Street expect the Fed to remove the word “patient” from its policy statement on Wednesday, signalling that the first increase could come in the next few months. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed will testify following the release.UK BudgetGeorge Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers his final budget of this parliament on Wednesday; the country’s general election takes place in May. The budget may include tax cuts in an attempt to soften austerity measures before voters go to the polls in an election whose outcome is hard to predict.Israeli electionIsraelis head to the polls on Tuesday in a hotly contested election between Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and Isaac Herzog, the centre-left opposition leader. Mr Herzog is the frontrunner and recent polls showed his alliance, the Zionist Union, three or four seats ahead in its attempt to lead the next coalition government in the Knesset.IranThe next round of talks on the Iranian nuclear programme begin in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday and are expected to last at least five days. Mohammad Javad, the Iranian foreign minister, will meet John Kerry, US secretary of state, and policy makers from the six world powers to seek an agreement before the self-imposed June deadline.EarningsThe US fourth-quarter earnings season has largely drawn to a close, with just three S&P 500 listed companies yet to report. In the coming week one of the remaining multinationals, Tiffany & Co, will report. First-quarter results will also start to trickle out, with figures due from FedEx, Nike, Oracle, Lennar and General Mills.Outside the US, BMW, Enel, Porsche, Cathay Pacific, Finmeccanica and China Mobile report earnings.The Week That Was, In Four ChartsThe slide in the euro accelerated against the US dollar in the latest week, prompting some investment banks to forecast that the two currencies will go to parity, as the European Central Bank unleashed its bond-buying programme. On Friday the euro dipped below 1.05 to the dollar, a 12-year low.The slide in the euro has provided a fillip for European corporates exposed to the US market; these groups must convert earnings abroad back into the bloc’s currency. That, coupled with the start of quantitative easing, has sent investors piling into European stocks as they exit the US.US equity markets found some comfort from the heady pace of buybacks, which when coupled with dividends surpassed the $900bn mark last year for the first time. The consistent buying of stock by US corporates reached $553.2bn in 2014, according to data from S&P Dow Jones indices.Financials staved off losses recorded by much of the broader market after the Fed did not fail any of the big US banks’ capital plans, paving the way for a rise in dividends and share buybacks. The approved programmes include double-digit dividend increases at Morgan Stanley, Discover Financial and Capital One.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt"

That compared to a backlog of $2.1bn at the end of 2013.The results lifted the broader homebuilding sector. Shares of Lennar rose 3 per cent to $44.89, PulteGroup increased 3 per cent to $21.21 and KB Home advanced 2 per cent to $12.42.Roper Industries, the industrial technology company, said fourth-quarter profits rose 12 per cent to $186m, or $1.84 a share. Sales increased 6 per cent to $946m.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $1.79 a share on sales of $955m. Adjusted earnings of $1.85 a share topped analysts’ estimates.The Sarasota, Florida-based company now expects first-quarter earnings to range between $1.47-$1.53 a share, compared to Street consensus forecasts for $1.51 a share. Shares of Roper Industries rose 4 per cent to $155.70.Mattel shares fell 5 per cent to $26.64 after the maker of Barbie dolls reported a 59 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits. Bryan Stockton resigned as chief executive and chairman.

23;LEN;Lennar Corp;2014-11-03T11:27:00Z;The Silver Economy: Downsizers transform US housing landscape;Shift to three-generation family homes and ‘ageing but active’ complexes spreads worldwide;"Phoenix, Arizona, is at the heart of efforts to address the US’s demographic time-bomb.Three years ago the third-largest US housebuilder, Lennar Corporation, chose Phoenix to launch its new line of multigenerational housing – a product that aims to exploit the shift from nuclear families to a form of shared living that was more the norm 100 years ago.Lennar’s Next Gen home includes a built-in apartment, designed to allow members of the wider family to live alongside but semi-independently. By far the biggest buyers of the 2,000 Next Gen homes sold to date have been families with grandparents who are still active but want to be closer together, according to Lennar regional president Jeff Roos.Next Gen is being chosen by about 40 per cent of buyers on the sites where it is being offered as an option, Mr Roos says.“It really makes sense for people who are either doubling up their households [with their children] or haven’t yet retired,” he says. “The grandparents can downsize and have a much closer relationship with their grandchildren.”Next Gen is the latest innovation from major US housebuilders that have already built up a substantial customer base of older people through what they dub “active adult” communities – traditionally designed houses with lower age limits on who can buy them, and surrounded by leisure facilities such as golf clubs and restaurants.US companies such as Lennar and PulteGroup have pioneered these lifestyle-oriented new housing developments aimed at an ageing but fit and active demographic.This is the part of the housing market that has bounced back most strongly since the financial crisis, according to Sharon Dworkin Bell, a senior vice-president at the US National Association of Home Builders. “Since the start of the year it has really taken off,” she said. “Builders working in this section of the market have never been so busy.”The message is beginning to percolate through to large-scale housebuilders in other parts of the world that are changing their focus in response, shifting away from young home buyers and towards the older market.In Britain, Barratt Homes and McCarthy & Stone are both developing new products to target downsizing baby boomers, while New Zealand market leader Ryman Healthcare is expanding its active retirement villages concept into Australia.“The ‘younger older’ age group of people in their 60s are looking for more freedom to enjoy their leisure years,” says Gary Day, land and planning director at McCarthy & Stone. “It’s a great business opportunity to capture a market that we know is there waiting for us.”Established builders also face competition from leisure providers, which are seeking to expand into the lifestyle and health end of the older people’s housing market.For example Japan’s biggest holiday club group, Resorttrust, is adding senior living areas to its developments.It has launched 500 rooms so far and aims to expand to 2,500 units with a “high-end, hotel-like living environment” for healthy people, and “back-up provided by the group’s healthcare network” for nursing care.Like other developers Resorttrust is just following the market. Between 2000 and 2050 the number of people in the prime house-buying age group of 20-40 years old is set to fall across developed nations by 4 per cent to 330m, according to OECD forecasts. Meanwhile the number of people aged 60 and over is set to increase by nearly two-thirds, topping 381m.How industries ranging from technology to entertainment are waking up to the opportunities provided by the world’s rapidly ageing population

Further readingThey will be healthier than any senior cohort before them: more than three-quarters of US citizens aged 65 and over rate their health as either good or excellent, according to figures from the US Department of Health & Human Services. And at age 85 and over, two-thirds of people still report being in good health.Today’s retirees can expect – with average luck – two decades of life ahead of them. For those who are fit, well and quite possibly still working, the thought of a traditional retirement community may not appeal. But neither does the thought of having to move house each time your health deteriorates, or your support needs increase.As technology evolves and building design becomes more sophisticated, senior living developers are finding that the answer lies in adaptable homes. As a result specialist housebuilders are creating buildings that a fit, healthy 60-something can stay in for the rest of their lives.One of the world’s largest senior living providers is Brookdale Senior Living, in the US. Brookdale offers its customers a flexible menu of support options and nursing care, helping people to stay either in their own home or in the same community as they age.Earlier this year Brookdale announced it was to merge with rival company Emeritus. The reason? It cited opportunities in this “age in place” market as a key rationale."

The results missed expectations for earnings of 40 cents a share on sales of $646.6m.“The failure to achieve a substantial increase in pre-tax income consistent with expectations and soft new order growth that is materially below consensus will likely pressure the stock,” Robert Wetenhall, an analyst with RBC, said.The results contrast with several improving economic data points, including new home sales figures reported on Wednesday, as well as better than expected results this month from Lennar, the country’s second-largest homebuilder.Homebuilder confidence, another closely watched indicator, also remains at pre-crisis levels.KB Home shares sank 5 per cent to $16.07, while other homebuilders were less affected. Lennar, PulteGroup and DR Horton each fell less than 1 per cent to $39.96, $18.33 and $21.19, respectively.Shares of Citizens Financial, which remains majority owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, rose 7 per cent after the bank’s New York debut to $23.08 on Wednesday.The lender’s stock initially opened at $21.50 after pricing at that level late on Tuesday evening.

A reading above 50 indicates more homebuilders view conditions as good than poor.Lennar shares climbed 5.7 per cent to close at $41.36, DR Horton rose 2.9 per cent to $22.23, PulteGroup advanced 2.51 per cent to $19.41 and KB Home increased 4.24 per cent to end at $17.45.Activist investor Nelson Peltz launched an attack on DuPont on Wednesday, urging the company to make radical changes.In a letter to DuPont’s board, Trian Partners, Mr Peltz’s investment firm, said it “believes the reason for DuPont’s persistent underperformance is very simple: DuPont’s conglomerate structure is destroying value.”Mr Peltz, who is also agitating for change at PepsiCo, said he had made his criticism public after a year-long dialogue with DuPont’s management broke down.“We speak and meet with shareholders frequently, and while it is our policy not to comment on discussions with specific shareholders, we have had a constructive dialogue with Trian,” DuPont said in a short statement.DuPont shares advanced 5.2 per cent to close at $69.25.Shares in software maker Adobe fell 4.85 per cent to $67.30 after the company said sales in its fiscal third quarter and projections for fourth-quarter revenues were short of Wall Street expectations.The number of subscribers to Adobe’s Creative Cloud service – which provides access to Photoshop and other desktop applications for a monthly fee – climbed 502,000 and is now at 2.81m subscribers.Adobe said it expected adjusted earnings of between 26 and 32 cents a share on sales as high as $1.075bn in its fourth quarter, below forecasts for $1.09bn.General Mills shares slumped 4.42 per cent to $50.83 after the company said profits and sales in its fiscal first quarter fell short of Wall Street estimates.The Cheerios and Wheaties maker reported a 25 per cent decline in profits from a year earlier to $345m, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $4.27bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast profits of $426m on $4.38bn in revenues.Rival Post Holdings ended 0.61 per cent lower at $35.84 while Kellogg declined 1.68 per cent to $62.80.Overall, US equity markets were little changed ahead of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy decision.The S&P 500 rose 0.13 per cent to close at 2,001.57 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.15 per cent higher at 17,156.85.

The company expected to earn $1.44 a share.The retailer also promised another $3.5bn worth of share buybacks for the rest of the year.Home Depot’s shares had previously lagged behind the broader S&P 500 index performance. However, by the close of trading it had matched the overall market gain of 7.6 per cent in the year to date.Fresh optimism over the consumer and housing sector also lifted shares in Lowe’s, another home improvement retailer, ahead of its second-quarter earnings expected on Wednesday.Shares rose 2 per cent to $51.52, building on gains on Monday after Credit Suisse analysts upgraded the company to a ‘buy’ recommendation.Among other retailers to shine was TJX Companies, owner of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, surging almost 9 per cent at $58.56.The company reported an 8 per cent increase in net income for the quarter ended August 2, earning $518m over the period.Higher than expected store sales drove earnings, in addition to improved merchandise margins and clothing sales, the company said.The company reported an adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents, exceeding analysts’ expectations of 73 cents. The retailer also narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to a range between $3.08 and $3.16 per share, from between $3.05 and $3.17 previously.Shares in Ross Stores, a fellow discount retailer, rose 4 per cent at $69.31 on the back of the more positive sector news, ahead of its own second-quarter earnings release on Thursday.Teen clothing retailer Aéropostale regained investor confidence after reappointing Julian Geiger as its chief executive. During his previous stint as CEO between 1996 and 2009, Mr Geiger helped grow sales to $1.9bn by 2008.News of the appointment sent the shares up 19 per cent to $3.87. However the company’s stock is still nearly 60 per cent lower than a year ago.The ever fickle teen market has plagued a number of companies.Shares in Elizabeth Arden fell 23 per cent at $15.05 after announcing a worse than expected sales decline in the fourth quarter. The beauty products company reported a net loss of $157m, or $5.24 a share.Poor sales of celebrity fragrances, such as Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift brands, contributed to the decline. Revenues plunged 28 per cent in the three months ended in June, to $192m, a significantly bigger decline than analysts had expected.In a bid to reassure investors, Elizabeth Arden said next year it would continue to focus on stabilising the business as it embarked on a multiyear plan to restore profitability. It also announced a strategic investment by Rhône Capital, the private equity firm that last year took an investment in Arden competitor Coty.Shares in the home building sector had a second day of gains on the basis of improving data.

Sales climbed 28 per cent from a year earlier to $2.1bn, in line with forecasts.The company was forced to take a $55m charge relating to the Chicago housing market, which executives characterised as “very weak”. William Wheat, chief financial officer, noted DR Horton “[did] not have another concentration of underperforming communities” on the scale of the Chicago market.Rival PulteGroup struggled to jump start sales growth. Revenues rose less than 1 per cent from a year earlier, trailing forecasts.Sentiment across the sector soured further after figures from the Department of Commerce showed an 8.1 per cent decline in new home sales in June and a steep downward revision to May figures.“We still think the housing market will continue to recover given the upbeat news in most other housing indicators,” Daniel Silver, an economist with JPMorgan, said. “However, the persistent weakness in the new home sales data in recent years suggests that conditions are not completely favourable across the housing market.”Since the year’s start, the Philadelphia Housing Index, a gauge of the homebuilding industry that holds a market capitalisation above $95bn, has fallen 5 per cent.DR Horton shares slipped 12 per cent to $21.93 while PulteGroup declined 3 per cent to $19.24. Peer Lennar dipped 3 per cent to $39.26 and NVR fell 3 per cent to $1,131.67.The tech sector also remained in focus on Thursday, as better than expected results from Facebook offset declines at two closely followed industry peers.Facebook shares surged 5 per cent to $74.98 after the company’s profits eclipsed Wall Street forecasts and its mobile advert network continued to grow.The shares have now doubled from when they were first sold in a May 2012 public offering best remembered for technical failures on the opening day of trading.Wall Street analysts said the scale of the rise in profit margins was the biggest surprise. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, Facebook’s operating margin climbed to 59 per cent in the quarter from 44 per cent a year earlier.Results at Angie’s List and TripAdvisor failed to excite investors.Shares of Angie’s List, the contractor and plumbing review site, tumbled 19 per cent to $8.21 after the company forecast third quarter sales as much as 7 per cent below consensus expectations.TripAdvisor shares declined 5 per cent to $101.79 after the tech company reported earnings below analyst forecasts, despite a 31 per cent jump in sales.Analysts with broker Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their rating on TripAdvisor to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ following the quarterly results.Overall, the Nasdaq technology index rose 0.6 per cent to 2,185.03.Under Armour, the maker of sports apparel, led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said sales surged 34 per cent from a year earlier to $610m, buoyed by sales of new running shoes.Shares of the company, which also lifted its full-year sales outlook to as much as $3bn, soared 15 per cent to $69.55.Caterpillar remained under pressure after executives warned it was “too soon to suggest” that its mining business, which underpinned much of its success earlier this decade, was turning around.Caterpillar net revenues fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $14.2bn as sales in its resource division slid 29 per cent.

Sales are expected to range between $36bn and $36.5bn, also ahead of consensus expectations.“We think it is possible more of the beat was due to healthcare reform; in which case it would appear that HCA’s increase in guidance for the year is rather conservative since that benefit will continue,” Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman said.The results sent shares of HCA almost 11 per cent higher to close at $60.99. Rival hospitals also climbed following the report. Tenet Healthcare advanced 8.32 per cent to $48.71, Community Health rose 8.57 per cent to $46.25 and LifePoint Hospitals increased almost 6 per cent to $65.06.Shares of US homebuilders rose after a report from the National Association of Home Builders showed confidence of builders touching a six-month high in July.The housing index climbed above 50 as sales slowly picked up after a slump exacerbated by the cold winter. A reading over 50 indicates more home builders view the market positively than negatively.Confidence was lifted by rising buyer traffic and improving expectations of sales in the coming six months.“This is the first time that builder confidence has been above 50 since January and an important sign that it is strengthening as pent-up demand brings more buyers into the marketplace,” Kevin Kelly, the chairman of the association, said.Lennar shares rose 2 per cent to end at $40.69, KB Home advanced 2.21 per cent to $18.01, Hovnanian increased 3.14 per cent to $4.60 and DR Horton climbed 2.15 per cent to end at $24.69.Yahoo was under pressure after the Sunnyvale-based web portal and search engine said sales continued to slide. Yahoo said first-quarter sales, excluding traffic acquisition costs, fell 3 per cent from a year earlier to $1.04bn.Chief executive Marissa Mayer said she was “not satisfied with the results” and that Yahoo had to “work faster to ameliorate the negative trends” in the company’s display advert business.Ms Mayer has relaunched several web portals in the past year in an effort to woo consumers to its sites, including new sites on food and technology.Despite those investments, the company continues to forecast declining sales. Yahoo executives expect third quarter sales to fall as much as 6 per cent from a year earlier to $1.02bn.Shares of Yahoo slipped 5.11 per cent to close at $33.79.Intel rose 9.27 per cent to $34.65 after it reported revenues climbed to $13.8bn from $12.8bn in the same quarter a year earlier, helped by corporate demand for traditional PCs.Sales of PCs in the US rose in the first quarter, according to research groups IDC and Gartner, as companies ditch computers using Windows XP, Microsoft’s now obsolete operating system.The unexpectedly better picture for PC sales has helped make Intel one of the best-performing technology shares this year.International Game Technology shares advanced 9.16 per cent to $16.92 after Gtech, the Italian-owned gaming technology group, said it would buy the company for $6.4bn.Gtech, which is best known for operating Italy’s state lottery, said it planned to merge with IGT under a newly formed UK holding company.It added shareholders in Las Vegas-based IGT, which designs and makes computerised gaming systems, would receive $13.69 in cash plus 0.1819 shares in the new company, equivalent to $18.25 per share.Overall, US equity markets drifted higher. The S&P 500 climbed 0.42 per cent to close at 1,981.57 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.45 per cent to 17,138.20.

NVR shares gained 0.4 per cent to $1,150.60 and PulteGroup shares increased 0.4 per cent to $20.16.The latest report from the National Association of Realtors showed pending sales, seen by economists as a better indicator of the future direction of the market, had climbed. This followed a lift in sales of existing and new homes last month also.Pending sales rose 6.1 per cent in May, more than three times what was forecast and the best single month since 2010.May’s data, which the pending sales figures add to, suggest that momentum has at least picked up since the winter.Shares in volatile retail group American Apparel fell 6.8 per cent to 90 cents after the company said it had rejected founder Dov Charney’s request for a special shareholder meeting, days after the company unveiled a poison pill plan to defend itself against a hostile takeover.Shares in the company on Monday were 53 per cent lower than a year earlier.Mr Charney, the ousted chief executive, said the purpose of the meeting was to fill vacancies on the board, among other governance tasks.The board announced on Saturday that it had adopted a one-year stockholder rights plan hours after Mr Charney, the company’s largest shareholder, had launched new efforts to increase his 27 per cent stake in the indebted company.The company, which holds $250m in debt, said the pill would be triggered if any shareholder with more than 15 per cent of its shares planned to increase his or her stake.Yahoo shares climbed 3 per cent to $35.13 after a Piper Jaffray analyst upgraded the technology company’s shares to “overweight” from “neutral”, with a target price of $43, up from $37.The upgrade was made on the grounds that the company’s stake in Alibaba was undervalued at its current price.“As we get nearer an Alibaba IPO, a more realistic valuation should be reflected,” said analyst Gene Munster in a note.The company’s core business is expected to continue to grow below industry rates, he said. But Alibaba “could more than make up for the challenges at the core”, he said.Shares in newly listed GoPro continued to rise 13 per cent to $40.55 following its market debut last week at an issue price of $24.On its first day of trading, shares in the company, popular with extreme sports fans for its wearable video camera, rose 31 per cent, kicking off its initial rising trend. The company boasts a market capitalisation of $4.99bn.The S&P 500 rose 0.04 per cent to 1,960.23 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.15 per cent to 16,826.60. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.23 per cent to 4,408.18.US equities were set to finish the quarter on an overall note despite Monday’s mixed trading – a positive close will see the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices record a sixth straight quarter of gains.That is the longest streak of quarterly advances for the Nasdaq since 2000 while for the S&P it is the best run since 1998.For the latest quarter, the S&P was up 4.7 per cent compared with 1.3 per cent in the first quarter.

At the time, fears of stretched valuations weighed on the broad Nasdaq Internet index. Netflix itself was pressured by fears the costs to stream its service over internet providers like Verizon and Comcast could surge in the future.Netflix shares rose 3 per cent to $443.65 by close of trading on Tuesday, capping a recovery from the low of below $300 struck in April amid the broad sell-off in the tech-related sector.Analysts with Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the film streaming company with an ‘overweight’ rating and $500 price target, which would make it only the 14th US company with a market capitalisation of more than $1bn that trades at or above that price.Morgan Stanley estimates Netflix will reach 108.6m paid subscribers by 2020, as domestic growth slows and the company shifts its focus abroad. The investment bank projects that 48 per cent of total subscriptions by that date will originate outside the US, with a heavy focus on Europe and Latin America.“Proven success in initial markets provides a road map to success in new markets and, as in the US, scale should allow Netflix to leverage content investments and drive margins,” analyst Benjamin Swinburne said.The investment bank also tempered concerns around the net neutrality debate, which has seen Netflix sign agreements with Comcast and Verizon to provide faster service to subscribers.“The regulatory risk for internet service providers is asymmetric, with significantly more downside than upside. Imposing further restrictions in the last mile, including aggressive metered billing or peering charges, could backfire,” Mr Swinburne added.Shares in Expedia rose on a broker recommendation, up 4 per cent to $77.62 after Susquehanna Financial Group upgraded the travel bookings website operator to “positive” from “neutral”, with a new target price of $90.Earnings per share estimates for 2014 and 2015 were respectively 3 per cent and 4 per cent too low and the “valuation isn’t stretched”, according to analyst Brian Nowak.Expedia was expected to have three sources of growth over the two years within its core brands, and monetisation trends were improving, Mr Nowak said. Susquehanna has subsequently raised its 2015 earnings per share estimate by 5 per cent. Its 2014 estimate remained unchanged.The cooling in the housing market evident in the latest figures from the US Commerce Department caused investors to look more critically at the home building sector.Though Wall Street economists expected a narrower decline in starts, new home construction fell 6.5 per cent from a month earlier in May, to an annualised pace of 1.001m new homes.Building permits, a leading indicator of “groundbreaking” on new homes, also declined in the month, falling 6.4 per cent to an annualised pace of 991,000.The slide in permits issued suggests somewhat stagnant growth ahead, as homebuilders continue a tepid pace of expansion.This followed separate figures released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders, showing that although builder confidence was recovering it remained below levels from a year ago.Shares in D.R. Horton, the largest US residential housebuilder, fell 1 per cent to $23.48, and shares in NVR construction fell 0.2 per cent to $1,119.83.In contrast, shares in Lennar and PulteGroup, other home construction companies, rose 1 per cent to $41.30 and $19.62 respectively.Shares in SolarCity increased 18 per cent to $64.53 after the solar energy company announced plans to acquire Silevo, another solar technology and manufacturing company.SolarCity will pay $200m in stock with the option of an additional $150m if certain conditions are met. Shares in the company were up 79 per cent on Tuesday from a year earlier.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 27 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 16,808.49, the S&P 500 gained 4 points to 1,941.99 and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.37 per cent to 4,337.23.
33;LEN;Lennar Corp;2014-05-28T21:05:57Z;Toll Brothers up on homebuilder hopes;;Optimism from one of the largest US homebuilders helped lift the wider housing sector, despite choppy performance over the past five months that has been capped by slowing mortgage applications and subdued home sales.Toll Brothers said revenues and profits topped Wall Street expectations in the three months to April 30, buoyed by the luxury homebuilder’s decision to raise prices.Sales rose 67 per cent from a year earlier to $860m while net income more than doubled to $65.2m, or 35 cents per share.Chief executive Douglas Yearley said he believed the housing market was still in the early stages of a recovery and demand would build.“Demand over the past year has been solid, although relatively flat, compared to the strong growth we initially experienced beginning in 2011, coming off the bottom of this housing cycle,” he said.“We note that last cycle’s recovery, in the early 1990s, began with a period of rapid acceleration, followed by levelling, before further upward momentum.”Investor enthusiasm for the sector has been lacklustre since the year’s start as harsh winter weather crimped new construction ahead of the key spring selling season.Economists with JPMorgan note that home prices have continued to increase due to “limited available inventory and a declining share of distressed sales available in the market”.Shares of Toll Brothers advanced as much as 4 per cent before closing 1.96 per cent up at $36.34, while KB Home rose 0.30 per cent to $16.63, and Meritage Homes rose 0.88 per cent to $40.10.PulteGroup nudged down to $19.76 while Lennar also slipped slightly to $40.37.Twitter shares jumped 10.69 per cent to $33.77 following an upgrade from Nomura as the investment bank warmed to the social network’s prospects.Nomura increased its rating to buy from neutral. Shares in Twitter have vastly underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, falling more than 50 per cent before Wednesday’s upgrade.Allergan led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Valeant Pharmaceuticals raised its bid on the Botox maker in its attempt to win investor backing.The Canadian drugs group said it would increase the cash component of its bid for Allergan to $58.30.Overall, Wednesday’s increased proposal valued Allergan at $166.16 a share, or $49.4bn, compared with an original offer of $152.89.“The Allergan board of directors will carefully review and consider the revised proposal and pursue the course of action that the board believes is in the best interests of the company and all of its stockholders,” Allergan said.Shares of Allergan closed down 5.39 per cent to $156.12 while Valeant declined 2.31 per cent to $126.95.GlaxoSmithKline shares trading in New York dipped on Wednesday as investors digested news that the UK’s Serious Fraud Office had launched a criminal inquiry into the drugs group.GSK revealed late on Tuesday that it had been notified that the SFO had “opened a formal criminal investigation into the group’s commercial practices”. Its shares declined 3.41 per cent to $26.90.Dollar General fell after analysts at Deutsche Bank dimmed their view on concerns it will be unable to lift same-store sales between 3 and 4 per cent while maintaining gross margins.The investment bank lowered its rating to hold from buy, sending its shares 3 per cent lower to $54.60.Overall, markets drifted ahead of key economic reports on Thursday, which include a second reading of first-quarter GDP as well as pending home sales and initial jobless claims.The S&P 500 nudged down slightly to 1,909.78, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25 per cent to 16,633.18.

34;LEN;Lennar Corp;2014-04-24T22:25:03Z;DR Horton lifts housebuilding sector;;Declining inventory of new homes and rising prices have lifted profits at the largest US housebuilder, even as investors debate the resilience of a sector that has shown two consecutive months of sales decline.Shares in DR Horton jumped 8.3 per cent to $23.13, lifting the wider sector, as executives said rising house prices and “solid” demand had buoyed its quarterly results.The company reported an 18 per cent rise in profits from a year earlier to $131m, or 38 cents per share, ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Sales climbed 22 per cent to $1.7bn while the average home selling price rose 10 per cent to $278,900.With the spring-selling season, which runs from mid-March to June, now under way, executives said they expected to finish in a strong position.New house sales and housebuilder confidence have remained subdued, with builders expressing concern that snow as late as March curtailed construction and subsequently curbed saleable supply.DR Horton chairman Donald Horton said the market nonetheless remained “favourable” even as house prices pressure buyers.“Housing market conditions remain favourable and, as expected, the pace and strength of the improvement varies significantly across our local operating markets,” Mr Horton said.PulteGroup, the third-largest US housebuilder, also reported improving demand over the course of the period, along with its first-quarter results.Executives at the company on a call with analysts noted that margins reached their highest level since 2005.“Commentary in the release was positive about spring selling and with absorptions up year over year in the quarter, this is the first good sign for housebuilders in some time,” Goldman Sachs analyst Eli Hackel said.PulteGroup shares advanced 2.3 per cent to $18.99 while rival Lennar rose 3.5 per cent to $39.51 and NVR increased 3.3 per cent to $1,068.21.Investors rewarded Apple chief executive Tim Cook on Thursday with the second-largest one-day gain in the company’s shares since he took the helm more than two years ago.Shares in the Silicon Valley company jumped 8.2 per cent to $567.77 after resilient demand for the iPhone drove Apple’s first-quarter profits beyond Wall Street’s forecasts.While the results offered a reminder of the selling power of the iPhone, sentiment towards Apple was also improved after the company expanded a share buyback programme by a third to $90bn.More than 15 investment banks raised their price target on Apple shares after iPhone sales in the first quarter swept past expectations. And analysts at CLSA raised their rating to “buy” from “outperform”.Caterpillar, the Illinois company hit hard by the collapse of the mining boom, surprised investors after it lifted its profit forecast thanks to buoyant demand from the construction industry.Including restructuring costs, Caterpillar expects to earn $5.55 a share this year, up from its previous forecast of $5.30 a share, the company said alongside its first-quarter results.Excluding one-off costs, the company said full-year profits will be $6.10, ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Caterpillar shares rose to their highest level in more than a year, easing back slightly to close up 1.8 per cent to $105.28.Continued deal activity lifted shares of several device makers following Zimmer Holdings’ purchase of rival Biomet for $13.4bn.The boards of both companies agreed to the terms and expect the deal to close in the first quarter of 2015.Zimmer said Biomet, which makes artificial joints, would increase earnings by a double-digit per cent in the first year as a combined company and lift operating cash flows by 1.5 times the company’s standalone estimates.Shares in Zimmer rose 11.5 per cent to $101.97 while peer Smith & Nephew gained 3.4 per cent to $76.37.Overall, US equity markets rose following better than expected durable goods orders as well as earnings from a handful of S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average-listed companies.The S&P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent to 1,878.61 while the Dow was flat at 16,501.65.

35;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

A reading below 50 indicates more homebuilders view the market as poor than good.Wall Street economists expected a reading of 56, unchanged from sentiment readings in JanuaryThe figures dented investor appetite in several homebuilders. Shares in DR Horton dipped as much as 4 per cent before closing 1.31 per cent lower at $23.31, while Lennar declined 2 per cent before paring its losses and ending 0.82 per cent off at $41.14.“This report is yet another indication of the profound impact that the cold and wintry weather is having on a broad swath of the economy, and while we expect this hiccup to growth to prove temporary, it will be sometime before the data begin to show a meaningful rebound in activity,” TD Securities strategist Millan Mulraine said.Kansas City Southern led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 index, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase downgraded the firm to neutral from buy on concerns new Mexican legislation could force rail operators to share their lines with competitors.While the bill still must clear the Senate, it would require concession-holders, including Kansas City Southern and Grupo Mexico’s Ferromex and Ferrosur railroads, to open their systems and publish prices charged to third-party operators. It would allow the government to revoke a concession under certain conditions.Shares in Kansas City fell 4.5 per cent to $91.64.Coca-Cola was also pressured on Tuesday, after the drinks behemoth said it would find another $1bn in cost savings by 2016 to put into “increased media investments”.A further squeeze on costs came as Coke’s profits dropped to $1.7bn in the final quarter of last year from $1.9bn in the same period a year earlier. Revenues edged 4 per cent lower to $11bn.Global shipments of its beverages climbed 1 per cent in the final three months of the year, though a 1 per cent drop in volumes in North America dragged on the company’s overall performance. Coca-Cola faces a headache in its own backyard as Americans increasingly favour alternatives to the fizzy drinks that the company built its fortune on.The company’s stock declined 3.78 per cent to end at $37.46.Waste Management shares weakened after the company’s profit forecasts for the coming year came in shy of analyst expectations.The garbage and recycling collector said earnings per share in 2014 would range between $2.30 and $2.35, more than a nickel below Wall Street forecasts.The figures came as Waste Management swung to a loss of $605m, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to a $224m profit a year earlier. The quarter included impairments and writedowns of $865m as the company cut the goodwill it attached to its waste-to-energy business, among other charges. Sales in the fourth quarter rose 2 per cent from a year earlier to $3.5bn.Shares fell 4.44 per cent to $41.73.Overall, US equity markets were little changed to start the week, as an index of manufacturing in the New York region showed slowing growth in February.The S&P 500 rose 0.12 per cent to 1,840.76 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.15 per cent lower at 16,130.40.

37;LEN;Lennar Corp;2014-02-06T22:01:37Z;US housebuilders boosted by Goldman call;Sector recovery seen continuing as mortgage rates stabilise;US homebuilders were lifted on Thursday as analysts at investment bank Goldman Sachs grew increasingly confident the sector would continue to recover over the year as mortgage rates stabilise and economic growth picks up.Analyst Eli Hackel said current developments of new dwellings remained below market demand, probably leading to an acceleration in building and new home sales in the coming months.“While we expect a slow start to the year with 5 per cent growth in Q1 we believe that growth could accelerate close to 30 per cent by Q3 before settling down to closer to 20 per cent growth by the end of the year,” he said.Mr Hackel added credit standards remained relatively tight, but said concerns of rising interest rates following the Federal Reserve’s decision to taper its monetary stimulus measures was less important to the sector than underlying demand.As part of the review of the industry, Goldman upgraded Lennar to buy from neutral, and increased the company’s price target from $38 to $48.Shares in Lennar advanced 5.4 per cent to $41.71 while those of DR Horton gained 3.8 per cent to $23.57.The investment bank maintained its overall neutral view of the sector.Walt Disney, the owner of the Disney film studio and ABC broadcast network, led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher in afternoon trading, rising 5.3 per cent to $75.56 following its better than expected results after market close on Wednesday.The entertainment group benefited from box office hits Frozen and Thor: The Dark World, lifting its overall net income 33 per cent to $1.84bn in the quarter.Sales advanced 9 per cent to $12.3bn in the three months to December, outpacing Wall Street estimates.Retailers shined on the benchmark S&P 500, as L Brands and Costco reported a jump in same-store sales in January.The Victoria’s Secret owner said comparable sales improved 9 per cent in the month, ahead of analyst expectations for a 0.5 per cent gain.Costco also edged out expectations, reporting a 4 per cent rise in same-store sales. The warehouse club operator said traffic rose during the period, and customers bought more food, auto and office supplies, offset somewhat by declines in consumer electronics.L Brands shares gained 4.2 per cent to $53.98 while Costco rose 3.4 per cent to $114.26.Investors in Twitter braced for their steepest fall since the company began trading publicly, as the company lost a fifth of its value.Twitter reported a loss of $511m in the final three months of the year compared with a loss of $8.7m in the same quarter a year earlier as costs surged. Revenues more than doubled to $242.7m.The social network said that the quarterly loss included a stock-based compensation expense of $521m.Investors worried that slowing user growth would hamper its profits going forward. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan downgraded the company from neutral to sell on concerns costs would rise as the group cultivates its user base.“Given the likely forward effort . . . to improve user growth and engagement (including product development costs), we see little potential for upside in estimates over coming quarters,” Mr Sheridan said. Even after the stock correction, “Twitter remains one of the most expensive stocks in our universe”.Shares declined 24 per cent to $50.03 by the close in New York.Overall, equity markets broadly rallied on Thursday, as the Department of Labor reported a sharp decline in initial jobless claims and a report on productivity in the country increased ahead of economist forecasts.The S&P 500 advanced 1.2 per cent to 1,773.43 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 per cent to 15,628.53.

They closed down 4.5 per cent at $18.74.Skyworks Solutions, the maker of radio components used in the iPhone and iPad, fell as much as 4.5 per cent on opening, and closed down about 1 per cent at $30.05. Peregrine Semiconductor shares were 3.3 per cent weaker.Apple shares tumbled almost 8 per cent to $506.50 after it sold fewer iPhones than forecast in the last quarter, raising fears that demand for the best-selling product might be slowly ebbing. The company sold 51m iPhones in the last three months of 2013, trailing the almost 55m sales Wall Street had expected.Pharmaceutical company Pfizer led the charge on the Dow Jones industrial index, climbing 2.5 per cent to $30.42. Despite reporting a drop in profits and sales last quarter, Pfizer shares were buoyed by an improving outlook for this year. The company forecast sales of between $49.2bn and $51.2bn, better than the $49.5bn expected by analysts.There was encouragement for investors in the US homebuilding sector. Shares of D.R. Horton surged 10 per cent to $23 after the builder almost doubled profits last quarter to $123.3m and it issued a bullish outlook for the market. Shares of rival builders, including PulteGroup and Lennar, were also buoyed, up 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent respectively.Asset manager T Rowe Price was also in demand. Its shares climbed 5.5 per cent to $80.70, as its latest quarterly results provided further evidence of how 2013’s equity rally helped companies in the asset management industry. T Rowe Price said assets under management hit a record $692.4bn.Comcast shares rose 1.6 per cent to $53.35 after the largest US cable provider posted higher fourth-quarter revenue, as it added quarterly cable video subscribers for the first time in more than six years.Royal Caribbean Cruise shares enjoyed a sector rebound, following on from Carnival, with at least two brokerages raising their price targets on the cruise operator’s stock a day after it forecast a stronger-than-expected profit for 2014 as more people signed up for cruises at higher prices in Europe and Asia.The cruise operator’s shares rose 3.4 per cent to $49.66.

39;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-11-26T21:14:44Z;US homebuilders boosted by housing data;;A sharp increase in earnings from Tiffany cheered investors on Tuesday, as shares in homebuilders stood out on a day of mixed trading amid positive US housing data.The jewellery retailer reported earnings per share that easily beat analyst expectations and raised its full-year guidance. Tiffany has been recently boosted by growth from China, as well as improving margins.As a result, the company known for its little blue boxes gained 8.7 per cent to $88.05 on Tuesday, putting shares 53.5 per cent higher in 2013.Tiffany’s gains also helped boost other jewellery retailers such as Zale, which gained 3.9 per cent to $14.83.Tiffany helped keep the S&P 500 in positive territory, with the index up fractionally to 1,802.83.US homebuilders were among the strongest areas on news that a rise in US house prices beat expectations and residential construction was at its highest level since 2008. That sent investors broadly to buy US housing stocks that have endured a difficult 2013 due to doubts that the real estate recovery was sustainable.PulteGroup gained 4.4 per cent to $18.95, DR Horton rose 4.6 per cent to $19.93, Lennar added 5.1 per cent to $36.07, and Taylor Morrison moved 6.6 per cent higher to $21.86.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also inched barely higher to 16,072.80, and the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 per cent to 4,017.75.The Nasdaq closed above the 4,000 level for the first time in 13 years. The tech index was boosted by some of its most heavily weighted stocks. Apple was up 1.8 per cent to $533.40, Google rose 1.2 per cent to $1,058.41, and Facebook ticked up 2.4 per cent to $45.90.Deal news drove shares in Men’s Wearhouse 7.4 per cent higher to $50.57 after the clothing retailer made a bid to buy competitor Jos A Bank. The offer would pay $55 a share for Jos A Bank, which previously launched its own takeover attempt for Men’s Wearhouse.Jos A Bank shares traded 11.3 per cent higher to $56.30.However, it was not all good news for retailers. Shoe retailer DSW fell sharply after the company issued earnings per share and revenue guidance that disappointed investors.DSW dropped 4.8 per cent to $44.97, but remains up 32 per cent in the past 12 months.The books business did not look much better than the shoe business. Barnes & Noble reported that the company swung to an unexpected profit in the second quarter. But shares in the book retailer fell 6 per cent to $15.45 after revenue fell below estimates.Human resources software provider Workday was among the strongest stocks on the day, up 12.8 per cent to $82.59 after reporting earnings that beat expectations.Packaged food producer Hormel also beat earnings estimates, leading to a 5.9 per cent rise to $44.95.Shares in internet media company Mediabistro nearly doubled on news that the company had invested in a 3D printing media company. Mediabistro was up 87.2 per cent to $4.10.While the S&P and the Dow both sit just off record territory, the Nasdaq is still well off the heights of the 5,000 level touched in 2000 at the height of the internet bubble.But despite not touching all-time highs, the tech index has enjoyed stronger long-term gains than the Dow or S&P.Since 1991, the Nasdaq has gained 982 per cent, while the S&P and Dow are up 448 per cent and 511 per cent respectively in that same time period.
40;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-10-14T22:19:03Z;Washington optimism puts S&P above 1,700;;Optimism on Wall Street over negotiations in Washington drove stocks higher for a fourth consecutive day as consumer discretionary stocks overcame a morning swoon to help the S&P close back above the 1,700 level.The consumer discretionary sector added 0.3 per cent, led by streaming entertainment service Netflix, which gained 7.8 per cent to $324.36.Reports emerged on Monday that the company was in discussions to offer its service as an app in cable television set-top boxes, potentially opening it to a new customer base.After stocks opened lower on little news of progress from Washington over the weekend, indices rose steadily from late morning until the end of the day’s trading. Eight of the 10 major sectors of the S&P500 closed in positive territory, with the benchmark index 0.4 per cent higher to 1,710.15.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.4 per cent to 15,301.26, and the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.6 per cent to 3,815.28.A strong rally to end the previous week was spurred by news that politicians in Washington had initiated substantive talks to avoid an forthcoming default on US debt and reopen the government.However, it was not all smooth sailing for consumer stocks, as appliance manufacturer Whirlpool fell 6.5 per cent to $131.29. That fall helped make consumer durables and clothing stocks one of the worst industry areas on the S&P500, off 0.2 per cent.Weakness in housebuilder stocks also hit the group, with DR Horton off 2.1 per cent to $18.05, PulteGroup down 0.7 per cent to $15.99 and Lennar 1.5 per cent lower at $34.31.Expedia lost 6.2 per cent to $48.51 after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the company’s stock to “hold” from “buy”.Utilities stocks were also among the hardest hit with the sector off 0.6 per cent.Duke Energy fell 0.4 per cent to $68.58, Exelon dropped 1.1 per cent to $30.02, and PPL Corporation lost 1.1 per cent to $30.16.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology recovered from a drop on Friday after a poor earnings report to add 1.4 per cent to $17.07.The company is now down 7.4 per cent since the open of trading last Friday but remains up 169 per cent on the year to date.Also boosting the semiconductor industry was Advanced Micro Devices, which gained 3.7 per cent to $3.97 on an upgrade from Wedbush to “outperform” from “neutral”.Drugmaker Merck was sent lower by a pair of downgrades on its shares.Bernstein slashed Merck’s shares to “market perform” from “outperform” and Barclays went to “equalweight” from “overweight”. Merck shares were down 1.1 per cent to $46.75.The CBOE Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the Vix, continued its recent wavering, rising as high as 17.8 before closing at 16.1. The Vix broke through the 21 level last week but has fallen steadily as shares have recovered and chances of a deal in Washington continues to increase.Despite the recent uptick in volatility, indices are trading at about the slightly higher since the beginning of the previous week. Since Monday, the S&P500 is up 1.2 per cent while the Nasdaq is 0.2 per cent higher.But as the earnings season is just ramping up for US companies, investors will be weighing the risks of a continued impasse in Washington with crucial reports about the ability for companies to justify share prices that remain near record highs.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said in a note that poor earnings combined with political risk could create an environment in which investors rapidly abandon equities.“As we saw the last time we had debt-ceiling issues in August 2011, bad news can turn into about a 20 per cent drop in three weeks,” he said. “One big concern is margin debt, which is near all-time highs. This isn’t bearish by itself but a big move lower in the SPX could lead to margin calls and a cascade of selling.”
41;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-09-16T16:19:48Z;S&P 500 breaks back above 1,700;;The S&P 500 broke back above the 1,700 level in intraday trading on Monday as US equities rallied and bond yields fell following news that Lawrence Summers withdrew his name for consideration as the next Federal Reserve chairman.Real estate stocks were the primary beneficiaries of the rally as the US 10-year Treasury yield fell sharply early but rebounded to finish only 2 basis points lower. The moves encouraged investors about the prospects of a continued US housing recovery.DR Horton added 3.7 per cent to $19.85, PulteGroup gained 3.8 per cent to $17.14, and home building product supplier Masco added 2.4 per cent to $21.30.Homebuilders have endured a tumultuous two-year stretch, which included a steep rise through 2012 as the US housing market stabilised and began to grow, followed by a recent drop off as the anticipated end of quantitative easing and the rise of interest rates drove share prices down.DR Horton is up more than 107 per cent in the past two years, but has fallen 26 per cent since its highs of earlier this year in May. Pulte and homebuilder Lennar have followed a similar trend.Real estate was part of a broad rally, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.6 per cent to 1,697.60 and trading above the 1,700 level for much of the day. Nine of 10 major sectors finished higher, led by industrials, up 1.3 per cent, followed closely by financials and materials, both better by 1.1 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average paced the major indices with a 0.8 per cent rise to 15,494.78.Apple was one of the few blemishes on the day’s broad rally, off 3.2 per cent to $450.12.The sell off continued last week’s decline that followed the company’s release of a new slate of iPhones, as well as the absence of a rumoured deal with China Mobile. Apple shares are now off 8.5 per cent since the start of last week.Apple’s fall made the Nasdaq Composite Index the laggard among US indices, down 0.1 per cent to 3,717.85.Boeing led the Dow after an upgrade from private brokerage firm Sterne Agee, which raise its price target for the stock to $164 from $120.Investors have also been cheered by the news that the company could receive a $7.6bn fighter jet contract, for which Boeing has the only eligible bid.That sent the aeroplane builder 3.9 per cent higher to $115.67. Boeing is now 53.5 per cent higher on the year to date.Drug producer Bristol-Myers Squibb was also among the day’s best performers with the help of analyst optimism. The company’s shares rose 3.6 per cent to $45.14 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”.JPMorgan noted that Bristol-Meyers had a strong series of drugs in development that would boost future earnings.Delta Air Lines continued its recent uptick following news of its inclusion on the S&P 500. Shares in the company rose 3 per cent to $23.15, and are 16 per cent higher since news on its addition to the benchmark index.The day’s gains put the S&P 0.7 per cent off its all-time highs hit in early August. The benchmark index is 4 per cent higher so far in September, having closed higher in nine out of the month’s 10 sessions so far.Investors will also be keeping an eye on Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee, which analysts have speculated will include the announcement of a start to the tapering of the quantitative easing programme.Although tapering is expected, a dramatic market movement is not a given, according to Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist of Mizuho Securities USA in a note.“Any tapering-related announcements coming out of this week’s policy-setting Fed meeting are, in our judgment, unlikely to have a sustained negative impact on the stock market,” he said. “Simply, the financial markets seem to have factored in the inevitable program termination, and details about timing and contour of the taper will not have enough impact on prospective capital flows to alter the course of the markets.”
42;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-06-27T18:16:42Z;US homebuilders: Fed taketh away;Rising rates is usually a bad thing for homebuilding shares;American homebuilders were some of the earliest and biggest beneficiaries of the country’s housing recovery – and federal stimulus. The rally in their shares began in the fourth quarter of 2011, and as home prices and affordability have risen and inventories fallen since, the S&P 500 homebuilders index jumped 200 per cent, four times the broader S&P 500 index. PulteGroup and Lennar were among the top 10 performers in the whole market last year.The housing recovery has come on the back of tremendous federal support, which drove mortgage rates to historic lows and homebuyers back into the market. Now the Federal Reserve has signalled that – barring economic hiccups – it would begin slowing bond purchases later this year, sending rates on 10-year Treasuries and mortgages higher. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are 4.46 per cent, the highest level in about two years and a percentage point more than in early May, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.The question now is whether rising rates will slow the housing recovery. While rates have risen, they remain nearly half the historic average – 8.6 per cent – using Freddie’s data going back to 1971. The initial move could be an incentive: prospective homeowners might buy now to avoid even higher rates later. But home prices could also adjust to offset higher mortgage costs.Homebuilders are down about 10 per cent in the quarter to date, trailing the S&P 500. The average earnings multiple is 9.5 times, above the average of 8 times from 1998 to 2006, says RBC Capital Markets. For investors convinced of a strong, long housing recovery, that premium is justified with perhaps more to come. But homebuilders stocks typically struggle when long-term Treasury rates rise. Higher rates may not scare homebuyers out of the market, but they could still scare investors from the shares.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
43;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-06-25T16:04:10Z;Homebuilders lead US stocks higher;;US stocks were on the move after days of backpedalling, with home builders leading the way on strong earnings from Lennar and data that showed continued growth in the US housing market.Earnings that beat expectations helped Lennar rise 0.7 per cent to $35.23 on Tuesday, while data showed new US home sales were at the highest level in almost five years and US house prices continued to rise.That helped the Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Home Builders index to rise 1.1 per cent. The index had recently been nearing bear market territory.Lennar has more than doubled its share price in the past two years as the US housing market has improved, but it tumbled recently along with the broader market.Rising US Treasury rates have caused concern about higher mortgage costs limiting the resurgent US housing market.Other homebuilders also benefited. PulteGroup advanced 3.9 per cent to $19.02, Taylor Morrison Home rose 2 per cent to $24.53 and Standard Pacific added 1.6 per cent to $8.10.The S&P 500 rose 1 per cent to 1,588.03 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7 per cent to 14,760.31, with both indices helped by strong performances from some of the largest US banks.Citigroup added 3.4 per cent to $47.00, JPMorgan ticked up 2.3 per cent to $52.08 and Bank of America rose 3 per cent to $12.67.Telecoms also performed well, with AT&T rising 1.7 per cent to $35.03, Verizon Communications adding 2.7 per cent to $50.44 and Sprint Nextel advancing 0.3 per cent to $6.88.The Nasdaq gained 0.8 per cent to 3,347.89.The morning rally provided a breather after three days of aggressive selling that began after the US Federal Reserve and its chairman Ben Bernanke said the quantitative easing programme would be scaled back if economic indicators stayed on track.However, recent guidance issued by numerous companies has pointed to a difficult road ahead. That has led to a sell-off which has been particularly hard on cyclical sectors and companies with exposure to commodities and China.“There’s some serious doubts about whether or not the economy is strong enough to produce a meaningful expansion in [corporate] profits,” said Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities USA.“If anything, the signs that you’re seeing in the equity market today are pointing not to stronger growth, but weaker growth. The weakness that you’re seeing in some of the sectors of the stock market are indicative of weaker economic growth that we’re seeing overseas, particularly in China,” he added.Those sentiments were echoed by disappointing earnings from Walgreens and Barnes & Noble.Walgreens dropped 5.9 per cent to $45.22 after reporting revenue and earnings per share that missed expectations.Barnes & Noble announced that it was ending the production of colour tablets and looking for a partner to take over manufacturing, as sales in its Nook ereader fell 34 per cent. Shares in the company fell 17.1 per cent to $15.61.Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 5 per cent stake in the Nook division.
44;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-06-25T14:12:29Z;Lennar looks to calm interest rate worries;;Lennar sought to calm investor anxieties that a rise in mortgage interest rates would hamper the housing recovery, as the US homebuilder reported better than expected second-quarter revenues amid stronger orders and higher prices.After a month of market volatility that has taken its toll on the homebuilding sector, the Miami-based company’s shares rose 1.8 per cent to $36.15 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. Lennar has suffered losses of almost 20 per cent since May 22, when Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke first indicated that the central bank might pull back on its bond-buying programme.“Against the backdrop of recent investor concerns over mortgage rate increases, we believe that our second-quarter results . . . continue to point towards a solid housing recovery,” said Stuart Miller, chief executive. “Affordability remains high and despite recent interest rate increases, we have seen very little impact on sales or pricing.”Lennar reported a 53 per cent jump in revenues to $1.43bn for the three months ended May 31.However, earnings slumped 70 per cent to $137.4m, or 61 cents a share, compared with $452.7m, or $2.06 a share, a year earlier. The homebuilder was buoyed by a much larger tax gain in the year-ago period than the current quarter. Excluding the tax-related gain, profit was 43 cents a share.The company beat forecasts that had called for adjusted earnings of 33 cents on revenue of $1.33bn.Even so, some industry watchers remained cautious. Robert Wetenhall, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “Lennar delivered another strong quarter, which is a testament to the strength of the housing recovery, but our biggest concern is that homebuilder equities are facing strong headwinds in the form of higher interest rates, which are having a negative impact on valuations. The sector is very sensitive.”Although homebuilder stocks will struggle in the short term as “higher interest rates will reduce affordability, which in turn will moderate the slope of the recovery”, Mr Wetenhall added, in the long term, better pricing practices and strong volume growth will provide gains.Low mortgage interest rates, an improving jobs market and rising consumer confidence have prompted more Americans to buy houses. Sales of new US homes climbed more than forecast in May to the highest level in almost five years. Purchases rose 2.1 per cent to an annualised pace of 476,000.The depletion of the existing stock of homes has driven new home construction which has boosted homebuilders. Lennar’s home deliveries increased 39 per cent to 4,464 homes, while the cancellation rate was 14 per cent compared with 16 per cent a year ago.Orders jumped 27 per cent to 5,705 homes. The company’s backlog – houses ordered but not yet finished and an indication of future business – grew 55 per cent to 6,163 homes.Lennar has been able to consistently charge more for its houses because of a shortage of single-family homes. The average selling price climbed 13 per cent to $283,000.Gross margin on home sales widened to 24.1 per cent from 22.5 per cent.Lennar’s shares have gained almost 170 per cent since the housing market started to recover in October 2011. The company has diversified into becoming a financial services provider, a land and apartment developer and an investor in distressed property.

Excluding items, FedEx earned $1.23 per share, while analysts had expected earnings of $1.39 per share.The company said results were hit by customers switching to cheaper modes of shipping from air express, but that they were focused on strategic cost reductions.“International airfreight trends remain weak,” said analysts at Baird Equity Research, who added that the company’s “multiyear profit improvement initiative remains on track, an important catalyst for the stock”.While shares in FedEx remain higher by 8 per cent this year, the pressure on the stock on Wednesday weighed on the Dow Transportation Average after it touched a record intraday peak on Tuesday. Transports slipped 0.4 per cent, trimming their 2013 gain to slightly more than 17 per cent. So far this year, transports are handily beating the major US indices.In New York, the S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent at 1,558.71, less than seven points from its all-time closing peak of 1,565.15 set in 2007.Among the main sectors, consumer discretionary, staples and healthcare shares led gains. While the S&P loiters just below its all-time peak, defensive sectors remain standout performers this year, led by healthcare and consumer staples stocks.Equity volatility as measured by the CBOE’s Vix index was subdued, settling at a reading of 12.7, down sharply from its recent spike to a peak of 15.4 on Tuesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 0.4 per cent higher at 14,511.73, after touching a new intra-day record high of 14,546.82.The price-weighted blue-chip barometer slightly lagged its rival benchmarks in part because of a 1.5 per cent fall in shares of Caterpillar, which settled at $86.94. The heavy machinery maker reported its rolling three-month sales fell 14 per cent in February, after a drop of 4 per cent in January.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent firmer at 3,254.19.After the closing bell, Oracle reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that just missed estimates. The stock slumped 6.8 per cent to $33.31 in after-hours trading.Shares in JC Penney rose 1.2 per cent in extended trading hours as the retailer said that bondholders, who last month claimed the company had breached a covenant on a bond indenture withdrew and rescinded their note of default, according to a regulatory filing.In other earnings news, shares in Lennar rose 4.8 per cent to $43.40 after the homebuilder posted better-than-forecast earnings of 26 cents a share versus a forecast of 15 cents. Shares in Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder rose 5.9 per cent to $36.53.A strong fiscal fourth-quarter and higher dividend for Williams-Sonoma boosted its shares by 10.3 per cent to $49.85. The upmarket kitchen appliance retailer earned $133.7m, or $1.34 per share, surpassing analyst forecasts of $1.29 per share.Adobe jumped 4.2 per cent to $42.46 after its first-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share exceeded a forecast of 20 cents.Shares in General Mills rose 2.6 per cent to $47.61 after its fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share beat a forecast of 57 cents.Amgen gained 1.8 per cent to $94.05 after the company reported positive data from a study of a treatment for melanoma. S&P Capital IQ affirmed its “buy” rating on the drugmaker with a price target of $104. “We see early results as promising but think they will need to show survival benefit in order to become a viable regimen for melanoma, given the approval of several new drugs in recent years,” said Steven Silver, analyst at S&P Capital IQ.Additional reporting by Vivianne Rodrigues
46;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-03-04T14:03:33Z;US housing recovery to spur consolidation;;When Boeing decided to expand its aircraft manufacturing hub in South Carolina last year, housebuilders such as Steven Mungo were elated. The move boosted the population of Charleston, the state’s second-biggest city, and in turn its housing market, still recovering after six years of nationwide stagnation.“Homebuilders have demand in excess of their ability to produce homes,” says Mr Mungo, chief executive of Mungo Homes, a medium-sized private company that expects to build about 1,000 houses this year. “They went into 2012 with a lot of supply . . . but they did not expect lots to run out as quickly as they did.”Builders such as Mungo are scrambling for land and accelerating construction to meet renewed demand for homes against a backdrop of record low mortgage interest rates, slow and steady jobs gains and the bottoming out of home prices since the middle of last year. New home sales rose to their highest level since July 2008 in January, government data showed last week.New residential construction activity is expected to rise more than 20 per cent in 2013 from last year, after six years that saw the number of homeowners in negative equity skyrocket, the pool of unsold homes deepen, wary Americans tighten their purse strings and housebuilders close operations.But while the uptick in demand has been welcomed, industry watchers say it will be the larger companies that benefit at the expense of their credit-constrained smaller rivals.“US housing is incredibly fragmented. You can have private players in any given market that are doing very well, but . . . smaller private companies are definitely having issues with access to capital,” says Stephen Kim, analyst at Barclays. “Banks are still pretty cautious with lending not just to buyers, but builders too.”Public housebuilders such as DR Horton, Lennar and PulteGroup, which have the balance sheets and access to capital to expand aggressively, have dramatically increased their market share over smaller private groups.Robert Wetenhall, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says publicly listed housebuilders – one of the best performing sub-industry groups on the S&P 500 in the past year – will probably outperform the broader market by posting a 25-30 per cent rise in residential housing starts in 2013.Consolidation happened before the market collapsed, and it may well happen again nowWith much if not all of this positive sentiment already priced into homebuilder stocks and expectations set high, analysts say shares in many of the homebuilders are now overvalued.Some industry observers say the public-versus-private fight over land – which even large operators such as Lennar have recognised is the industry’s “biggest constraining factor” – could result in a second round of consolidation in a sector that comprises up to 30,000 participants.“There are about 14 public companies. The top 100 build around a third of all the homes in the US,” says Tim Costello, chief executive of Builder Homesite, a consortium of US housebuilders. “Consolidation happened before the market collapsed, and it may well happen again now.”Alex Barron, analyst at the Housing Research Center in Texas, says acquisition activity has risen in the past six months, with DR Horton buying Alabama-based Breland Homes, and Ryland purchasing Trend Homes in Arizona and Timberstone Homes in North Carolina.“If you are looking to enter new markets or grow your market share, it makes sense to do it this way, as these companies have strong local relationships and land positions,” he says.Michael Widner, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, says housebuilders have underestimated the speed of the recovery and the effect that the entry of private equity groups such as Blackstone and other investors has had on the housing market by reducing inventories– which now stand at record lows – and pushing up house prices.“Here’s what we didn’t see coming: investors, individual and institutional, sopping up distressed inventory by the millions. We thought household formation was on the hook for that, the journey would be slow, and by the time it was done private builders would have ample access to capital again,” he says.In an effort to acquire land at a faster pace and ramp up construction, some private companies have hastened their entry into the public market, taking advantage of the positive sentiment towards housing.California-based Tri Pointe Homes raised $233m from an initial public offering in January to become the first homebuilder to go public in nearly a decade. Last month Arizona-based Taylor Morrison, another homebuilder, announced it would double the size of its planned offering to $500m.Aside from land, access to labour and building materials at reasonable prices is also taking a toll on homebuilders’ margins.“Over the downturn, workers left in search for alternative jobs . . . There are bottlenecks in some areas,” says Timothy Gehan, chief executive of Texas-based private homebuilder Gehan Homes.“There are only so many licensed plumbers, electricians and other skilled labourers. The framer who [usually] gets paid $9 an hour, now gets paid $15 an hour.”The scarcity in some regions of construction workers, as well as plumbers, electricians and carpenters among others, that are the backbone of the residential construction industry, has resulted in projects facing delays.Meanwhile, lumber prices reached an eight-year high in recent months, while prices of concrete, plasterboard and shingle have also jumped, adding pressure to the market. Lennar said in its latest quarterly earnings higher prices for construction materials had increased the average cost of building a new home by $1,600.While analysts say they expect prices nationally to stabilise eventually, the near-term effects of higher prices could damp the recovery of the new-home market in some regions.
47;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-02-26T21:33:00Z;Wall St rises on positive housing data;;US stocks rose on Tuesday with investors bidding up shares in Home Depot and other companies tied to the country’s recovering housing sector.Overall, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6 per cent to 1,496.94 in New York, finishing near a session high after a steady rally that began just after midday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 13,900.13 as the blue chip measure outperformed the other major US benchmarks and was led higher by a jump in Home Depot shares.The home improvement company reported that growth in the US housing market had helped boost fourth-quarter sales.Home Depot, which raised its estimates for net income and sales for this year as it cited a pick-up in the sector, also increased its quarterly dividend by 34 per cent to 39 cents. Shares in the Home Depot were 5.7 per cent higher to $67.56 and were among the best performing on the broader market.Rival Lowe’s, which reported its results earlier in the week, joined in the gains and rose 2 per cent to $36.59.Encouraging housing market data also bolstered investors in the sector, sending the nation’s largest public homebuilders higher on the day.Separate reports showed that home prices in 20 large metropolitan regions of the country rose in December while new home sales reached their highest level since 2008 in January.Homebuilder Lennar Corp gained 3.7 per cent to $38.01 and DR Horton climbed 4.1 per cent to $22.25.The gains from across the sector helped the overall market pare some of its losses from Monday when nervousness over the outcome of the Italian parliamentary elections sparked the worst single-day sell-off for stocks since November.All 10 main industry measures on the benchmark were higher with defensive telecommunications performing strongly among the sector groups. AT&T shares were 0.9 per cent higher at $35.49.Financial sector stocks, which suffered the biggest losses on Monday, gained 0.5 per cent.Shares in JPMorgan Chase, the Wall Street bank that said on Tuesday it would cut 17,000 jobs over two years, dropped 0.2 per cent to $47.60. Meanwhile, Bank of America rose 0.9 per cent to $11.13.Wall Street’s fear gauge, as measured by the CBOE Vix index, also calmed after rocketing higher on Monday during the selling. The index, which tracks implied volatility on the S&P 500, fell 11.7 per cent to 16.8.Fears among some equity investors that the Federal Reserve may imminently slow its asset purchases also eased as Ben Bernanke testified in support of continued central bank’s stimulus measures at a congressional hearing.The Nasdaq Composite index finished 0.4 per cent to 3,129.65. Shares in Apple, which have lost 15.7 per cent since the start of the year, rose 1.4 per cent to $448.90 after earlier touching its lowest intraday level in 12 months.Consumer discretionary stocks were also among the best performing industry groups on the day and rose 1 per cent behind optimistic earnings’ forecasts by companies in the sector.Macy’s, the department store chain, jumped 2.8 per cent to $39.59 after it said net profits for the holiday quarter beat expectations and raised its outlook for 2013 earnings.Saks, the high-end department store group, gained 1.6 per cent to $11.22 after it also increased net income estimates for the year.Other economic data showed that US consumer confidence ticked higher in February, further bolstering the related S&P sector.But electronics retailer Best Buy fell 3.2 per cent to $16.46 as it said 400 jobs at the company’s headquarters had been cut.
48;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-02-20T22:09:05Z;US equities sell off after FOMC minutes;;Disappointing US housing data and weaker-than-expected results fromthe largest luxury homebuilder drove down stocks in the sector while broader markets sold off after the release of the FOMC minutes.Main indices fell sharply giving up some of the recent gains after reaching fresh multiyear highs during the previous session.The minutes from the FOMC meeting revealed that “many” officials were concerned about the costs and risks of further asset purchases, as the Fed buys securities at a pace of $85bn a month.Markets which started the day lower, sold off after the release of the minutes with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing down 1.2 per cent at 1,511.95.Energy and materials stocks were the worst hit while all main sectors finished in negative territory.January housing starts in the US fell sharply to below the consensus forecast, damping the mood among investors betting on the housing recovery.But the sharp drop was not as bad as the headline number suggested, said Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors.“Starts were hugely elevated in December – likely because of the much warmer than usual early winter weather,” added Mr Shepherdson. “A correction in January was always on the cards.”The S&P 500 homebuilder index lost 6.5 per cent as Toll Brothers shares fell 9 per cent to $33.56 after the company’s fourth-quarter results missed Wall Street’s expectations – even though it swung back to profit on the back of an improving housing market.New orders jumped 49 per cent to 973 homes but the average selling price for those properties fell 7.5 per cent to $631,000 from the same quarter a year ago, depressing margins and profits.Elsewhere in the sector, DR Horton fell 5.9 per cent to $21.92, PulteGroup lost 6.8 per cent to $18.60 and Lennar Corporation dropped 6.8 per cent to $37.18.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 13,927.54.“The seven-week rally, while rare in the history of stock markets, has been one of the weakest,” said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial.“Markets have been driven higher by bulls buying defensive stocks, such as consumer staples, rather than riskier cyclicals, while the S&P 500 has been trading in a narrow range for the past few weeks,” he added. “At this point, markets are overheated and we are due for a healthy correction.”Among materials, Newmont Mining shares fell 5.4 per cent to $40.56 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper shed 5.9 per cent to $32.22.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.5 per cent to 3,164.41.Apple shares fell 2.4 per cent to $452.83 after Foxconn, which manufactures its products such as the iPhone and iPad, imposed a hiring freeze across most of its factories in China as it slows production of these devices.Apple shares are down more than 15 per cent since the start of the year.Shares in Tesla Motors, manufacturer of electric cars, fell sharply in after-hours trading as fourth-quarter losses were worse than expected. The company expects to be profitable in the first quarter of 2013. Shares dropped 8 per cent to $35.86 in extended hours trading.In earnings news, Garmin shares plunged after the GPS manufacturer’s fourth-quarter results fell short of expectations.The company’s fiscal 2013 earnings forecast also disappointed investors. Its shares fell 9.4 per cent to $35.54.Life Technologies shares were hit after Reuters reported that the $11bn sale of the biotechnology company looked less likely as the recent run-up in the share price made it less attractive to potential buyer Thermo Fisher Scientific and buyout firms.Its shares fell 8.4 per cent to $58.05 but remain 18.4 per cent higher since the start of the year when it announced that it had hired investment banks to advise it on its annual strategic review, buoying investor hopes of a sale.
49;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-02-18T09:04:13Z;China’s lead property developer enters US;;China’s biggest property developer has made its first foray into the US with a deal for a high-end residential complex.China Vanke, the leading Chinese developer by sales, will invest in a project launched by Tishman Speyer Properties in San Francisco.The size of the investment was not disclosed but it was small enough that Vanke announced it only on its chairman’s microblog rather than via a stock exchange filing because it deemed the amount involved to be immaterial.But the significance of the deal is potentially greater as one of the first steps by a major Chinese commercial developer to build homes in the US. With Beijing placing caps on home purchases in major cities and many smaller cities suffering from overbuilding, Chinese developers have started to cast their sights further afield for business opportunities.“There is no point telling Chinese companies to mind their own domestic business. A good enterprise in the 21st century must be armed with a global vision,” Wang Shi, Vanke chairman, wrote on Weibo, a popular Chinese microblog site.Mr Wang had previously said that Vanke, which has a market value of nearly Rmb130bn ($21bn), wanted to break into foreign countries, especially those with large communities of overseas Chinese residents who are familiar with its reputation.Vanke’s entry into the US follows that of Xinyuan Real Estate, which paid $54m last year for a plot in New York that is zoned for 200 housing units. China Development Bank, a government-controlled lender, is also looking at the US housing market and is in negotiations to provide a $1.7bn loan to Lennar Corp, one of the biggest homebuilders in the US, for two developments in San Francisco.Vanke will take a 70 per cent stake in the San Francisco project, which is known as 201 Folsom Street, with Tishman Speyer retaining the rest, according to a note to clients by Du Jinsong, a Credit Suisse analyst.Vanke confirmed the deal was for 201 Folsom – a 669-unit residential development – but declined to disclose any details. Tishman Speyer, an unlisted company, did not make an announcement.The agreement was signed last week. Vanke still requires Chinese government approval to move its money abroad for the deal.“It is still too early to gauge the ultimate impact of Vanke’s international expansion,” Mr Du said. “Nevertheless, given the structural issues of China property sector, we view this as a useful experiment by Vanke to find potential long-term growth drivers.”Vanke announced plans last month to shift part of its stock listing to Hong Kong from mainland China. Along with bringing it a higher valuation, the presence in Hong Kong will make it easier for Vanke to raise financing for foreign acquisitions.Additional reporting by Emma DongThis story has been amended since original publication
50;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-01-30T23:45:56Z;Tri Pointe opens the door to investors;;Tri Pointe Homes is to become the first US homebuilder to go public in nearly a decade, as investor appetite for housing-related stocks rises amid a recovery in the sector.The California-based company, which is controlled by real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, raised $233m from an initial public offering as it priced 13.7m shares at $17 on Wednesday, a dollar above its expected range, a person familiar with the matter said.The proceeds from the IPO will be used to acquire land and build single family homes in California – one of the hardest-hit states during the US housing crisis – and in Colorado.Starwood Capital Group, Mr Sternlicht’s private equity fund, invested $150m in the company in 2010 and will realise part of its investment following the offering. Mr Sternlicht, chairman of Tri Pointe, will retain a 45 per cent ownership stake.Publicly listed homebuilders have been the best performing sub-industry group on the S&P 500 in the past year, with the sector rising more than 100 per cent. Demand for new homes has increased against a backdrop of rising employment, record low mortgage rates and rising house prices.DR Horton, one of the largest US homebuilders, said on Tuesday that first-quarter profits had more than doubled. New orders were up 39 per cent, while order backlog, an indicator of future earnings, jumped 62 per cent.Lennar Corp and KB Home, two other US homebuilders, have also reported big jumps in order backlog in quarterly earnings.Tri Pointe, which is due to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker symbol “TPH”, would be the first offering by a US homebuilder since December 2004, according to Dealogic.Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and FBR are lead underwriters.The move comes a month after Arizona-based Taylor Morrison, another homebuilder, filed plans to raise $250m from an initial public offering.Smaller, privately held homebuilders were hit by the housing market collapse six years ago, depleting funds needed to buy land and build new homes.“Banks have been less willing to issue construction loans over the past couple of years to finance homebuilders for fear of a repeat collapse in housing,” said Andrew Reading, analyst at Bloomberg Industries. “A lack of financing may hasten private builders’ entry into public markets to more easily raise debt and equity.“We’re in the early innings of the housing recovery and we are likely to see more homebuilder IPOs as the market improves.”Industry watchers have said there is strong demand to own stock in other companies that could benefit from the housing turnround. Plywood maker Boise Cascade is expected to bring a $212m IPO to the NYSE early next month.Shares in Silver Bay Realty Trust have risen 10.5 per cent since it launched its IPO late last year. The company aims to purchase, renovate and rent out homes to Americans including those still unable to qualify for a mortgage. The company, which has acquired homes at steep discounts since 2009, is betting on a rise in home values.
51;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-01-29T23:26:47Z;Horton and upbeat data lift housebuilders;;Upbeat housing data as well as better than expected quarterly results from DR Horton sent homebuilder stocks sharply higher.The S&P 500 homebuilder index rose 4.4 per cent on Tuesday.DR Horton shares jumped 11.8 per cent to $23.82 after reporting quarterly profits more than doubled, thanks to improving house prices.For the three-month period ending December 31, the company earned $66.3m on $1.23bn revenues, easily beating Wall Street’s estimates.Rivals KB Home rose 2.9 per cent to $18.62 and Lennar added 1.8 per cent to $42.68.The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index, which tracks house prices in 20 metropolitan regions across the US, showed record-low inventories that sent house values higher in November.Overall, US equities markets shrugged off disappointing consumer confidence data and continued their recent upward march, bolstered by positive earnings from energy companies.The January consumer confidence index dropped sharply to the lowest level since November 2011, indicating the first hit from the rise in payroll taxes.“US equity markets seem to be very resilient, even after disappointing consumer confidence data,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “While this trend looks like it may continue, it’s important to recognise that this is a rally based on relative valuations rather than improving fundamentals,” he added.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.5 per cent at 1,507.86, hitting a fresh five-year high. Most major sectors were trading in positive territory with energy and telecoms leading gains.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.5 per cent higher at 13,954.57.Ford shares fell in early activity even though the second-largest carmaker in the US reported quarterly results that beat analyst estimates.The company said operating losses in Europe dragged on full-year net income, despite it gaining share in the North American market.The company reported that net income declined 72 per cent to $5.66bn in 2012. Its shares dropped 4.6 per cent to $13.14.Amazon shares were hit ahead of its quarterly earnings and closed 5.7 per cent lower at $260.35. Fourth-quarter earnings, released after the closing bell, were below analysts’ expectations, however, shares rose 9 per cent to $284.20 in after-hours trading, as investors welcomed the increase in the online retailer’s operating margins in North America.Energy stocks rallied after positive earnings reports from the likes of Valero and Peabody.Valero shares jumped 12.8 per cent to $43.77 after the world’s largest independent refiner by processing capacity reported a 20-fold profit rise in the fourth quarter. The company said it had net income of $1bn, well above analysts’ estimates.Peabody shares also rallied, up 5.6 per cent to $26.56, as the coal miner’s quarterly profit beat consensus estimate.Shares in Chesapeake Energy rose 9.4 per cent to $20.75 in after-hours trading, after the company announced that its current chief executive, Aubrey McClendon will retire on April 1, 2013.Meanwhile, JC Penney attracted buyers, with the stock rising 9.3 per cent to $21.01, after the struggling department store retailer announced that it was restoring its discount programme to lure back shoppers.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished marginally lower at 3,153.66 despite gains in its biggest component Apple.Shares in the iPad and iPhone maker rose 1.9 per cent to $458.27, recovering some of the steep losses following disappointing results last week.Yahoo shares climbed initially as the internet group’s quarterly profits, reported after the close on Monday, beat Wall Street expectations. The company reported revenues climbed 14 per cent to $427m, driven by growth in search advertising. However, shares reversed course and fell 3 per cent lower to $19.70.Analysts at Nomura maintained their “neutral” rating on the stock. “While Yahoo’s shares have appreciated from the potential around the company’s capital returns and equity investments, we remain wary of the fundamentals and share losses, in particular in the display market.”Shares in Seagate, data storage company, sold off, falling 9.3 per cent to $33.92 after quarterly earnings fell 13 per cent and margins deteriorated.
52;LEN;Lennar Corp;2013-01-15T17:57:57Z;Labour shortage holds back builder Lennar;;Lennar Corporation said labour shortages and higher construction material and land costs were challenges for the US homebuilder even as it reported a surge in fourth-quarter earnings thanks to the country’s recovering housing market.As homebuilders try to meet increased demand for new homes against a backdrop of record-low interest rates, improved consumer confidence and a shrinking supply of existing homes for sale, they face a crunch in the number of workers.“Labour remains under pressure as housing starts accelerate . . . Many traders remain cautious about hiring as they wait to see that the housing recovery is fully established,” said Jonathan Jaffe, chief operating officer, on an earnings call on Tuesday.The scarcity of construction labourers, as well as plumbers, electricians and carpenters among others that are the backbone of the residential construction industry, has resulted in projects facing delays.Lennar said the average home takes 10 days more to complete compared to last year, while more labour-constrained markets such as Phoenix in Arizona and pockets of Texas and Florida have seen this rise to 25 days.The company said additional labour charges and higher prices for construction materials such as lumber, drywall and concrete had increased the average cost of building a new home by $1,600.Stuart Miller, chief executive, said acquiring land at a good price was also one of the “biggest constraining factors for builders”.“Driving community count and finding new locations is very difficult,” said Mr Miller. “It’s a risk out there as you look beyond 2013 and to 2014 and 2015 as the market recovers.”Shares in the company, which have surged 85 per cent in the past 12 months, fell 2.1 per cent by midday in New York even as the company reported better than expected results.The Miami-based homebuilder said net income in the three months to November 30 rose to $124.3m, or 56 cents per diluted share, compared with $30.3m, or 16 cents, in the same period last year. This beat analysts’ expectations for 44 cents per share. The quarter included an $18.6m tax benefit that boosted profits.Sales rose 42 per cent compared to the same quarter last year to $1.35bn, beating forecasts of $1.31bn.Michael Widner, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus Equity Research, said before the earnings call that a slowdown in new orders was also driving the company’s shares lower.While new orders at Lennar climbed 32 per cent to 3,983 homes – representing its seventh consecutive quarterly increase – this came on the heels of rises of 44 per cent, 40 per cent and 33 per cent in the previous three quarters.Even so, the company remained upbeat on the outlook for the US housing sector. “Recent years’ low housing starts and household formations have created pent-up demand from homebuyers who started re-entering the housing market in 2012 and are likely to continue to do so into 2013 and beyond,” said Mr Miller.The homebuilder had a backlog of 4,053 homes at the end of the quarter, up 87 per cent compared with a year ago.Gross margins, meanwhile, expanded to 23.5 per cent from 19.4 per cent.The average selling price of homes delivered by Lennar climbed to $261,000 from $243,000 a year earlier.Full-year 2012 net income stood at $679.1m, or $3.11 per diluted share, compared with $92.2m, or 48 cents, in 2011.Lennar said it planned to expand its apartment rental business to take advantage of a shift towards renting among large chunks of the US population still unable to purchase homes due to tough mortgage and credit conditions and an uncertain labour market.The company plans to begin building about 3,000 units this year, which it hopes will start adding to profits in 2014 or 2015.

But he warned that a shift in customers away from its lucrative express shipping services was expected to continue.Fedex shares have risen 11.6 per cent so far this year, slightly underperforming US equities over the same period.The S&P 500 was largely muted for much of the day before decliing sharply in the session’s final minutes. The benchmark fell 0.8 per cent to 1,435.81 as politicians wrangled over details on a deal to avert the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax hikes. The losses marked the end of a two-day rally for stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.7 per cent to 13,251.97 while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.3 per cent to 3,044.36.All 10 industry groups on the S&P 500 closed in negative territory, with the utility and telecoms sector indices experiencing the biggest declines on the day.Shares in homebuilders, some of the top performing stocks this year amid a modest US housing recovery, declined as fresh housing data showed new home starts for November came in below consensus forecasts.Lennar Corp was 1.1 per cent lower to $39.27, KB Home fell 2 per cent to $16.66 and DR Horton declined 0.7 per cent to $19.95.Shares in Herbalife, the nutritional supplement direct seller, dropped 12.1 per cent to $37.34 as reports said Bill Ackman, the activist investor, is expected to deliver his thesis behind a short position in the company at an event in New York on Thursday.US-listed shares of UBS, the Swiss bank, lost 1.2 per cent to $16.56 as it agreed to pay $1.5bn to regulators in the US and Europe to settle allegations related to manipulations of Libor interest rates.Oracle rose 3.7 per cent to $34.09 as the company that sells software, hardware and services beat analysts’ expectations for sales growth in its latest quarter.“Oracle is unusual in that it has had four prior quarters of modest to no growth on an organic cost and currency basis, so with very easy comparisons, the bar has been set pretty low,” said Rick Sherlund, analyst at Nomura.Knight Capital, the electronic trading and market-making company, gained 5.4 per cent to $3.51 as its board approved a takeover by Getco, a high-frequency trading firm.The deal, which will create one of the biggest trading companies in the US, values Knight at $1.8bn and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013.Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, said: “We view this as a positive for Knight’s shareholders based on the deterioration in Knight’s business and share price following a catastrophic trading glitch.”JC Penney, the troubled US retailer, rose 3.5 per cent to $20.88 as it hired a former executive from Abercrombie & Fitch, another US retailer geared at teenage customers, as it attempts to transform the layout of its stores.The company’s shares have lost 40.6 per cent from the start of the year.

Economists were not expecting this, so it was an upside surprise, even though the rest of the report was mostly in line with expectations.”Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financials, said that the late afternoon sell-off was mostly due to profit-taking and a steep decline in the shares of Apple, which is the biggest component in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed virtually flat at 1,460.93 but gained 1.4 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 to 13,610.15, gaining 1.3 per cent over the week.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 3,136.19 but added modest 0.6 per cent over the week.Apple, which represents 20 per cent of the Nasdaq Composite, fell 2.1 per cent to $652.59, shedding 2.2 per cent over the week in spite of the endorsement of its iPhone 5 from Consumer Reports, an influential consumer products reviewer.Banking stocks, which got a boost from upbeat economic data in early trading, gave up the gains. Bank of America fell 1 per cent to $9.32 but gained 5.5 per cent over the week.JPMorgan fell 0.3 per cent at $41.71 and gained 3 per cent over the week. The S&P 500 financial index has outperformed the main index, gaining 3.5 per cent over the past week.Homebuilders also benefited from the positive economic data this week including Friday’s jobs report. The S&P Homebuilder index, which has more than doubled since the start of the year, edged 0.4 per cent higher on Friday and clocked in a 7.4 per cent gain over the week.PulteGroup added 0.4 per cent to $16.63 and registered a 7.3 per cent weekly gain. Lennar was up 1.1 per cent to $37.92 and gained 9 per cent over the week. DR Horton, however gave up earlier gains and was 1.6 per cent lower at $21.65 but still gained 5 per cent over the week.Among the biggest gainers, Avon Products shares jumped 7.2 per cent to $17.39, accounting for most of a 7.6 per cent weekly gain, after the door-to-door cosmetics seller announced that Andrea Jung, executive chairman and former chief executive, would step down at the end of the year. Fred Hassan, lead independent director, will succeed Ms Jung as non-executive chairman.Owens-Illinois, the glass packaging manufacturer, was another high riser, up 4.4 per cent on Friday to $20.21, a 7.6 per cent gain over the week, after an analyst at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, citing more positive capital allocation ushered in by the new chief financial officer and valuations.Constellation Brands shares also rallied, up 3.3 per cent to $36.20 after reporting earnings that beat estimates.

The company has lost almost half its market share in the past 12 months and had been popular with short sellers.Overall, US equity markets edged higher on Wednesday as investors welcomed better than expected economic data.Data from ADP, the payroll processor, showed the US economy added 162,000 jobs, above consensus estimates of 140,000, while the Institute for Supply Management showed new orders in the non-manufacturing sector accelerated.However, caution prevailed among investors as weak economic data out of Europe, China and Australia continued to dim prospects for global growth.“We continue to believe that there is further upside potential in the stock market looking into next year,” wrote Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“However, the stock market could fluctuate around current levels during the next few months as investors await the outcome of the election and the upcoming potential fiscal cliff.”As the third-quarter earnings season approaches and investors begin to focus on fundamentals, US equities have retreated from multiyear highs reached in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s monetary stimulus.The benchmark S&P 500 index wobbled at the open but, after a brief dip, regained its footing and closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,450.99.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was mostly flat at 13,494.61 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq added 0.5 per cent to 3,135.23 by the close.MSCI shares recovered somewhat, gaining 7.9 per cent to $28.27, after the company tumbled 27 per cent during the previous session following the announcement by Vanguard that it would drop the index in favour of FTSE indices for benchmarking its ETFs from January.MSCI is expected to lose $24m in annualised revenues and operating income from January.In deal news, Best Buy founder Richard Schulze and at least four private equity firms have taken first steps in an effort to buy out the world’s largest consumer electronics chain.

Shares in the company rallied 17 per cent during the previous session.Analysts at Nomura said the potential combination looks attractive, but cautioned investors on the likely integration risks: “Running separate networks with separate technologies makes achieving network synergies a longer-term proposition.”Kraft Foods gave up all of the gains and closed 1.2 per cent lower at $44.87. Earlier, Nasdaq said it was cancelling some trades after the stock price spiked as high as 28 per cent shortly after the market open due to a trading glitch.The erroneous trades come two days after Kraft spun off its North American grocery business, Mondelez International, which began trading on Nasdaq on Tuesday.The high-profile embarrassment is the second in six months for Nasdaq OMX.

56;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-09-26T21:58:48Z;US tax policies delay $2bn Chinese loan;;A loan worth nearly $2bn from China Development Bank to help fund an ambitious San Francisco housing project is being delayed as a result of Chinese concerns about the effect of tax policies in the US, a person familiar with the situation said.The measures include the controversial Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which comes into effect in 2014 and could force foreign banks to pay a 30 per cent withholding tax on the interest income on any loans made to US entities or persons.“They need to clarify the implications of these regulations before they approve the loan,” said the person.The Chinese bank had been in talks for months with Lennar, one of the largest homebuilders in the US, to help finance a massive housing development on Hunters Point and Treasure Island, two former naval bases in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a total value of as much as $13bn. Lennar declined to comment.CDB and Chinese construction and railway companies have long sought a role in helping the US revive its ageing infrastructure.“To date, City officials have received only encouraging reports from the China Development Bank,” the San Francisco mayor’s office said.The bank and its partners among Chinese construction, transportation and power companies have become an increasingly powerful force in infrastructure projects in the rest of the world, especially in south-east Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America in a particularly intense form of vendor financing.For example, the Chinese have financed and constructed power projects in Vietnam, telecoms projects in India, railways in Saudi Arabia and rebuilt much of Sri Lanka after its civil war.Such partnerships underscore the fact that one of China’s competitive advantages is its low cost capital. As a state-owned, unlisted policy bank CDB has particularly attractive funding and an almost unlimited ability to make loans, since it has access to the government’s balance sheet as well as its own.The recent tax and regulatory measures in the US are widely seen as regulatory over-reach, according to tax lawyers. “FATCA is being used as a club,” says a New York based lawyer for Weil Gotshal & Manges in New York.“If you are not compliant with all the rules, you are subject to the tax and nobody wants to comply and in many cases aren’t allowed to comply by their own national regulators,” another US lawyer adds.Foreign governments are generally exempt from the requirements of FATCA but lawyers say government-owned banks would not escape from the new rules.CDB’s most recent annual report makes no reference to any loans in the US.
57;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-09-25T21:12:45Z;Barnes & Noble falls amid outlook doubts;;Barnes & Noble shares fell sharply on Tuesday despite jumping to strong gains early in the day’s trading session after the bookseller said it would enhance its popular tablet device to compete with those designed by rivals Amazon and Apple.The company’s shares added as much as 6.9 per cent in morning trading after it said it would add video streaming capabilities to its Nook tablets this autumn.The move comes amid stiff competition from other consumer gadget offerings such as Amazon’s Kindle and Apple’s iPad.Barnes & Noble shares have dropped more than 15 per cent since the start of the year as investors weigh whether the company can compete.Last month, the bookseller said it would launch the Nook in the UK, marking the first time it has expanded overseas in its history.Despite the early gains, shares in the company turned negative along with the broader markets throughout the day. Shares in Barnes & Noble fell 3.7 per cent to $12.26.Meanwhile, Amazon shares lost 1 per cent to $252.54, which unveiled the latest iterations of its Kindle a few weeks ago.Earlier in the morning, Amazon made its boldest move into the financial services sector as the ecommerce conglomerate said it was in partnership with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, to offer Wall Street brokers a chance to store key regulator data on its “cloud computers”.Nasdaq OMX shares fell 2.3 per cent to $23.17.Apple lost 2.5 per cent to $673.54 as reports said a key factory in China where its gadgets, such as the new iPhone 5, are assembled was set to reopen after mass riots took place earlier in the week.Overall, US stocks accelerated losses throughout the afternoon even as fresh housing data showed that home prices grew at their fastest year-on-year rate in more than two years in July.The benchmark S&P 500 dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,441.59 as fears of instability within the eurozone, which faces an ongoing debt crisis, crept back into the market. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.4 per cent to 3,165.71.Homebuilders saw no gains despite the housing data. Lennar fell 1.9 per cent to $36.26 and DR Horton lost 1.4 per cent to $21.74.On Monday, Lennar posted estimate-beating net profits for the third quarter and said Americans were becoming more confident about home purchases.All sectors on the S&P 500 recorded losses, with healthcare stocks seeing the most limited declines.Wall Street investors continued to debate whether a run in US equities – that has put the S&P 500 up more than 14 per cent since the start of the year – would continue.Analysts at Barclays said recent action by the Federal Reserve, which earlier this month said it would extend its monetary operations to stimulate the flagging US economy, has supported equity prices.“But to push equities significantly higher, the economic or public policy outlook needs to improve,” they said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.8 per cent to 13,457.55. Shares in Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, fell 4.3 per cent to $87.01 as it cut its long-term profit forecasts due to reduced capital spending by large commodity producers.But Michael Jaffe, analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said the company’s business would benefit from a $160m infrastructure stimulus plan announced in China earlier in the month and retained his “buy” rating on its shares.“We think Caterpillar will be a particular beneficiary as the plan to build highways, ports and other transportation structures [in China] should boost demand for its construction and mining equipment,” he said.Caterpillar shares have fallen 4 per cent since the start of the year, underperforming the Dow, which has risen 10.2 per cent.Other cyclical materials and industrials companies also came under pressure as fears of global growth weighed on investors.Joy Global, which also makes mining equipment, lost 5.5 per cent to $56.88 as the warning from its rival reverberated across the sector.Nabors Industries fell 5.4 per cent to $14.26 as the land drilling contractor also saw investors dump its shares.Shares in the New York Times Company, the US publisher, rose 0.1 per cent to $9.76 after it said it would see a gain of $100m in its fourth-quarter results after the sale of Indeed.com, a job search website.The company’s shares touched their best mark for the year on Tuesday and are up 24.2 per cent since the start of the year.
58;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-09-24T22:26:27Z;Apple shares fall after launch weekend;;Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the S&P 500 index, retreated from their record high after reports that riots broke out at one of its main manufacturing plants in China.Apple sold 5m units of its newest iPhone model in the opening weekend following last week’s launch.This fell short of some analysts’ estimates, however, and Apple said in a statement that it has been struggling to supply the devices as demand has been high.The world’s largest company by market capitalisation, Apple is waiting to hear whether it will be added to the oldest stock indicator in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as the owners consider changes to the way the index is calculated.Apple’s shares fell 1.3 per cent to $690.79 after breaching the $700 price level last week for the first time.By contrast, Google shares rose 2.1 per cent to an all-time high of $749.38, beating the previous record set five years ago.Citi Research analyst Mark Mahaney raised the price target for Google to $850 from $740, saying the search group was extremely well situated against most of the major trends in consumer internet including mobile, video, local and cloud computing.“The one big miss is social [networking] but even there Google has a play with Google +,” wrote Mr Mahaney in a note.The broader markets closed lower on Monday after briefly venturing into positive territory in late afternoon trading. Wall Street opened lower as investors in US equities were worried about weak and slowing economic growth across the world amid gloomy data from Germany and China.German business sentiment fell in September for the fifth consecutive month, raising fears that Europe’s largest and strongest economy is in downturn while China’s Beige Book found the effects of the monetary easing over the summer were limited.Stocks most vulnerable to economic growth sold off with losses led by information technology and energy sectors.“Markets are not trading on fundamentals but on Ben Bernanke’s ‘open cheque book’ policy or on more stimulus,” said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at ICAP Corps NYSE.“Volumes today have been low, as investors are sitting on the sidelines and given the various problems facing the global economy, markets should have corrected by now.”Nicolas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group, agrees that markets have priced in actions by central banks: “The combined actions of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan over the past few weeks are already in stock prices.”“Making money in US equities from this point means starting to look for the next catalysts, the next feature of the investment landscape that will grab the market’s attention,” wrote Mr Colas.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.2 per cent to 1,456.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 13,558.92 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to 3,160.78.Intel shares fell 1.4 per cent to $22.79 as the company declared quarterly cash dividends.Intel stock has trailed other technology stocks as the chipmaker has been slow to adapt to the surge of tablet devices.Facebook shares also sold off, falling 9 per cent to $20.79. The social network shares have gained more than 20 per cent during the past two weeks, touching the highest level last Wednesday since flotation.Microsoft shares also fell, down 1.3 per cent to $30.78. Citrix Systems was the biggest faller on the S&P 500, down 5.2 per cent to $77.00 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “equalweight” from “overweight”.PC makers HP and Dell both lost 2.2 per cent to $17.21 and 1.9 per cent to $10.16, respectively.Energy stocks were also in focus as the oil price continued its decline after dropping more than 6 per cent last week.Peabody Energy fell 4.5 per cent to $22.94 and Cabot Oil & Gas dropped 2.5 per cent to $43.92. Alternative energy company First Solar also slid 0.8 per cent to $21.03.Caterpillar shares closed 0.9 per cent lower at $90.87 but fell more than 2 per cent in after-hours trading. The world’s biggest mining equipment maker cut its outlook for 2015 earnings, citing reduced capital expenditure by commodity producers.Lennar Corp futures rallied in pre-market trade after reporting significant rises in revenues and earnings in the third quarter, with the net order jumping 44 per cent.However, the shares dropped 1.5 per cent to $36.95.Still, homebuilders have been benefiting from improving housing markets with the S&P 500 Homebuilder index nearly doubling since the beginning of the year.KB Home fell 4.2 per cent to $14.62 after having gained more than 11 per cent last week on the back of estimate-beating quarterly results. DR Horton also dropped 1.5 per cent to $22.04.Defensive stocks found some support on Monday with healthcare and telecommunications leading the gains.Health insurance provider Aetna rose 1.7 per cent to $40.29 and Tenet Healthcare, the operator of hospitals, added 2.1 per cent to $6.31.Among telecoms, Time Warner Cable rose 1.4 per cent to $95.79.
59;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-09-24T18:37:31Z;Homebuyer confidence helps Lennar’s sales;;Net profits at housebuilder Lennar quadrupled in the third quarter, as Americans became more confident about making purchases while prices remain stable and mortgage rates low.Net income in the third quarter, which ended August 31, rose to $87.1m, or 40 cents a share, from $20.7m, or 11 cents, in the same period last year. Earnings came in well above analysts’ expectations of 28 cents a share.Stuart Miller, chief executive of the Miami-based company, said: “Low mortgage rates, affordable home prices, increased buyer confidence and an extremely favourable rent-to-own comparison are driving growth in each of our markets.”The glut of foreclosed and distressed properties is also decreasing, prompting further improvement in the housing market, he added.While tight credit conditions and tougher mortgage requirements mean many homebuyers are still unable to make purchases, others view the record low mortgage rates and the stabilisation of home prices as an opportunity to buy.Recent data showed existing home sales rose in August to a more than two-year high while new single family home construction was at its strongest pace since April 2010.Lennar’s quarterly revenue rose to $1.1bn from $820.2m a year ago, while new orders rose 44 per cent to 4,198 homes. Backlogs, an indication of future sales, increased 79 per cent to 4,513 homes. The average sale price of homes delivered jumped to $258,000 from $247,000 a year earlier.Robert Wetenhall, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Lennar’s earnings were an indication of the strength of the recovery.“Much better pricing trends helped to promote strong margin performance and the outlook is encouraging due to exceptionally strong new order growth.“Housing is a bright spot in an otherwise sluggish US economic recovery. As long as the broader market keeps going up, housebuilders as a group are likely to outperform,” he said.Other housebuilders have also reported better than expected earnings in recent months and confidence rests at a six-year high.KB Home’s net income in the three months to August was $3.3m, or 4 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.6m, or 13 cents, a year ago. The Los Angeles-based company, which reported earnings on Friday, said it benefited from tax and insurance-related gains, as well as higher sales. Orders rose 3 per cent to 1,900.However, shares in Lennar, which have risen almost 90 per cent this year, fell 1.7 per cent to $36.88 in afternoon on Monday, while the S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index of 11 companies edged 1.1 per cent lower on renewed concerns about slowing economic growth.Even as housebuilders are reporting positive earnings, industry watchers remain cautious as many potential housebuyers remain on the sidelines because of uncertain job and salary prospects, homes stuck in negative equity as well as tougher borrowing requirements. New home sales will need to double to get to a pace seen before the crisis and this could take at least three more years, analysts said.Structural shifts, including record levels of student debt and a lower level of household formation as more young Americans choose to rent for longer, will also weigh heavily on the sector for the indefinite future.
60;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-07-30T21:13:29Z;US housing market lays new foundations;;Barry Rutenberg, a homebuilder from Gainesville, Florida, feels the US housing market has at long last turned a corner.“It’s not a straight line, there will be some bumps, but the market is slowly recovering,” said Mr Rutenberg, who is also the chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.Although banks continue to grapple under the weight of bad mortgages and a glut of foreclosed properties remain unsold, the broader housing market appears to be on an improving trend, as home prices and new home sales rise and inventories fall.This improvement is feeding through to US housing stocks and analysts say many publicly listed homebuilders are set to have their best year on record.Standard & Poor’s Supercomposite Home Builders index is up almost 50 per cent so far this year, nearly five times the gain of the S&P 500 index. So far in 2012, Lennar is up 49 per cent, DR Horton has risen 41 per cent and Toll Brothers is up 46 per cent.The US housing market was at the root of the financial crisis in 2008 and struggled to make a comeback amid low prices and high foreclosure rates.But recently, more Americans have been willing to move ahead with purchases partly as a result of record low mortgage rates, which have also favoured US housing stocks. The average rate on a 30-year-fixed rate mortgage fell below 3.5 per cent for the first time since the 1950s.Michael Widner, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus Equity Research, said new home sales for the first half of this year are up about 20 per cent compared with the same period in 2011.“New home sales have been higher than expected, and orders and pricing too have been strong, pointing to a year-on-year improvement in the housing market. This is what is driving the stocks,” he said.Publicly listed homebuilders make up about a quarter of total new home sales in the US and their market share compared with private companies has increased, Mr Widner added.Last week, DR Horton reported a jump in quarterly profit and said new home orders – which analysts view as an indicator of the housing market’s momentum – rose for the fourth straight quarter. DR Horton’s net income rose to $788m, or $2.22 a share, for the third quarter, from $29m, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.Pulte, whose shares have risen almost 85 per cent so far this year, said new orders jumped 32 per cent to 5,578 units in the second quarter.“Investors are confident that the housing market has reached a bottom. They believe the new orders growth rate is sustainable and that it may even accelerate,” said Megan Mcgrath, analyst at MKM partners.Meritage Homes and Beazer Homes have both reported stronger order numbers, with Meritage registering unit order growth of 49 per cent year over year and Beazer witnessing a 25 per cent year-over-year increase.Goldman Sachs recently upgraded its view of the homebuilder sector from “neutral” to “attractive” and boosted its ratings of KB Home and Ryland Group.But while banks and homebuilders are more confident – the NAHB sentiment index rose in July to its highest level in five years as they saw more traffic from prospective customers – US housebuilders face a string of challenges.“We are still selling a preposterously low number of homes relative to historical trends,” Richard Dugas, Pulte’s chief executive, said on an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. He added that in order to secure longer term sector security greater job growth was needed.Analysts believe new home sales need to double to get to a pace seen before the crisis and this could take at least three more years.Many potential homebuyers remain on the sidelines on the back of uncertainty surrounding employment and salary prospects, homes stuck in negative equity as well as tight credit and mortgage conditions.Industry watchers also point to structural shifts that will weigh heavily on the market for the indefinite future, including record levels of student debt and fewer household formations as more young Americans choose to rent for longer.

But the jobs report indicated that the uncertainty in the US economy – with adverse effects on equities – would likely prevail for the coming weeks.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, said: “The market is responding to credit issues stemming from deterioration in the eurozone as well as US economic data that suggests we are going through a soft patch.”She added: “Correlations are now rising, which tends to happen when anything associated with risk is treated as a ‘sell and ask questions later’ asset. This is obviously a market waiting for some sort of intervention from central banks around the world.”Through to current trading, the S&P 500 is now up just 1.6 per cent since the start of the year and has relinquished more than three-quarters of its gains from its 2012 peak at the start of April.Volatility, as measured by the Vix index, rose to its highest level since mid-December to trade above 26. The index is informally known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge” and is considered a measure of investor uncertainty.Shares in Facebook declined 13.1 per cent to $27.72 during the shortened four-day trading week, which saw options contracts on the company’s stock begin trading with heavy volumes.Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter in charge of bringing Facebook’s shares to market, has faced criticism since the offering for expanding the size of the deal. Shares in Morgan Stanley fell 3.9 per cent to $12.73.Facebook’s losses since its shares began trading on May 18 have also hit a handful of recently debuted tech groups. Zynga, a games developer that makes most of its revenues from operating on the Facebook platform, fell 9.1 per cent for the week to $6.01. Yelp, the online reviews website, lost 13.7 per cent to $15.69. Both companies saw short interest, or bets that their shares would fall, increase to record levels this week, according to Data Explorers.Groupon, the daily deals site, dropped 19.6 per cent to $9.69 to hit an all-time low since it debuted last November at $20 a share. The professional networking site LinkedIn fell 7.1 per cent to $91.51, its lowest level since March.Overall, the S&P 500 information technology sector was down 2.4 per cent in a week dominated by “risk-off” trading, but still did better than the industrial, consumer discretionary and financial indices.The Nasdaq Composite was off 3.2 per cent to 2,747.48.Apple, the largest weighted stock on the tech heavy index, edged 0.2 lower per cent to $560.99. The iPad and iPhone maker was among the least affected equities as tech stocks sold off.Shares in the Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, lost 6.2 per cent to $10.68 as it warned earlier in the week that it would report an unexpected quarterly loss in its upcoming earnings statement. RIM shares have fallen 28 per cent since the start of the year as the company struggles to compete with technology companies such as Apple and Google.Defensive stocks such as utilities and consumer staples were among the best performing, suffering limited losses as investors fled to safer assets. Shares in Walmart, the world’s largest company by sales, rose to a 52-week high – edging up 0.4 per cent to $65.55 for the week – as its annual meeting in Arkansas kicked off on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.7 per cent to 12,118.57. The losses put the blue-chip heavy index in negative territory from the start of the year.Caterpillar shed 4.9 per cent to $85.52 as its shares were knocked back by global growth concerns.

The company said it would suspend its quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share.Shares in the group fell 19.7 per cent to $26.75.Ron Johnson, JC Penney’s chief executive and a former head of retail at Apple, has tried to shake up the company’s pricing policy and store designs but analysts said that strategy has failed to attract increasingly thrifty customers.Michelle Clark, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the results support her “sell” rating on the company’s shares as it shows the importance of discounting to drive customer traffic to its stores. “JC Penney is increasingly becoming an expense cut story,” she said.Meanwhile, Robert Drbul at Barclays said he was impressed with the management team that Mr Johnson had assembled and that there was “significant opportunity” for the company to regain ground on sales, which peaked in 2006.Slowing sales in Europe, which had wiped 40 per cent off the market capitalisation of watchmaker and clothing designer Fossil last week, claimed another victim.Abercrombie & Fitch shares fell 13 per cent to $39.50 for the second worst performance in the S&P 500 after JC Penney, after the company missed analysts’ forecasts for first-quarter sales.Fossil shares were flat at $71.91.Overall, the S&P 500 rose as much as 0.8 in the morning session as investors appeared to be soothed by a call by French and German leaders to Greece to reaffirm its commitment to European Unionmembership.But the market reversed course on a report that said that the European Central Bank had halted monetary operations to some Greek banks, and ended the day off 0.4 per cent at 1,324.80.The S&P 500 has lost more than 5 per cent so far in May and has given back more than half of its gains on the year since the start of the second quarter in April, leaving it up just 5.3 per cent for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 12,598.55 while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,874.04.Bank stocks were hit hard by the news out of Europe.JPMorgan Chase, the bank that last week announced an unexpected $2bn trading loss, climbed as much as 2 per cent in the morning session, but ended the day down 2.2 per cent at $35.46.Credit default swaps on big US banks, including JPMorgan, also touched their highest points for the year as fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone intensified.Legg Mason, the asset manager, climbed 7.5 per cent to $24.05 as it said it would repurchase more than $1bn of its debt. The company also said its board had authorised up to $1bn in share repurchases over the next three fiscal years, after its shares significantly underperformed the market this year, lagging the S&P 500 by more than 10 percentage points before Wednesday’s intervention.Mark Fetting, chairman and chief executive, said: “We are pleased to announce this plan as part of our broader efforts to enhance financial flexibility and position Legg Mason for sustained growth.”He added: “Specifically, we will improve our capital structure by reducing gross debt by $350m immediately.”Economic data released on Wednesday showed US home construction rebounded in April, with housing starts rising 2.6 per cent over the month.But the positive news was tempered by another release that said permits, a leading indicator of future construction, declined 7 per cent.The data helped some of the country’s largest homebuilders make gains on Wednesday. Lennar Corp rose 0.4 per cent to $29.27 but PulteGroup fell 2.5 per cent to $9.49.PepsiCo gained 1.3 per cent to $68.75 as it was revealed late on Tuesday that Ralph Whitworth, an activist investor, had taken a $600m stake in the US snacks and beverage company. The investment gives Mr Whitworth a 0.6 per cent stake in the company, which some say he believes has underperformed and should consider a spin-off of its beverage business.Shares in Apple, the iPhone and iPad maker, fell 1.3 per cent lower to $546.08. Apple shares have fallen more than 13 per cent since its high on April 6.
63;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-03-29T20:59:43Z;US equities fall as jobless claims miss estimates;;Shares in Best Buy sank by as much as 10 per cent Thursday as the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer led US equities lower on the back of disappointing labour market figures.Best Buy said falling sales would force it to close 50 big box stores this year and cut 400 jobs in order to save $800m over the next three years.The US electronics retailer reported like-for-like revenues up 3 per cent from a year ago to $16.6bn but came below market consensus of $17.2bn for the period.The company’s shares dropped 7 per cent to $24.77 and have lost nearly 15 per cent over the past year.Kate McShane, analyst at Citigroup, said of her “sell” rating and price target of $21 for shares: “We continue to see downside risk from current levels: likely further market share losses, continued [gross margin] pressure driven by a commoditising product channel [and] competitive pressures, and long-term concerns …on international prospects.”Overall, the S&P 500 finished down 0.2 per cent to 1,403.28, edging back above the 1,400 threshold after retreating from it earlier in the day as the main US market limps to the end of an otherwise strong first quarter.Fresh economic data released Thursday by the US Department of Labor suggested to investors that the labour market is not improving as fast as previously thought.New jobless claims for the week ending March 24 were 9,000 higher than analyst estimates of 350,000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 13,145.82 while the Nasdaq Composite index was worst among the three major US indices. The tech-heavy index declined more than 0.3 per cent to 3,095.36.Volatility, measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, increased by as much as 10 per cent before finishing the day down marginally to 15.42.Natural and organic food companies were also among the day’s most active stocks.Supermarket group Whole Foods Markets was hit by a downgrade of its shares by Goldman Sachs, who said the company lacked upside, having gained 35 per cent in the year.Shares in the upmarket food retailer fell 3.5 per cent to $82.61 as analysts reduced their rating from “buy” to “hold”. “Whole Foods Markets is a secular winner with significant opportunity to grow its store base, expand margins and improve its return on capital,” said Stephen Grambling, analyst at Goldman Sachs.“However, with only 2.8 per cent upside to our upwardly revised price target, after increasing our estimates, we see better opportunities elsewhere in our coverage, prompting a ‘hold’ rating,” he added.Annie’s, a natural and organic foods company, climbed another 5.6 per cent to reach $37.92.Shares in the company, which opened to the public on Wednesday, have nearly doubled from its initial offering price of $19.Nike, the world’s biggest sporting goods maker by sales, gained 0.6 per cent to $107.85 as the company said it had sued rival Reebok for the use of quarterback Tim Tebow’s name on the back of New York Jets jerseys.Nike will launch its new uniforms for the National Football League under a new sponsorship deal.JetBlue, a US passenger airline, lost 4.2 per cent to $5 as the carrier tried to deal with the fallout from an emergency landing of one its aircraft on Tuesday after the captain of the plane was forcibly subdued.News Corp, the international media company, lost 1.5 per cent to $19.44 as the company run by Rupert Murdoch hit back at claims that a technology company it once controlled was used to facilitate piracy of private documents.The S&P 500 financial index was the biggest faller among the major sectors on the benchmark US index, which were all down on the day, and fell 1.1 per cent.Insurance companies were among the hardest hit financial stocks with Genworth Financial down 2.3 per cent to $8.45 and Lincoln National Corporation off 3.2 per cent to $25.75.Morgan Stanley fell by 2.5 per cent, the worst among the big banks, to $19.74. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were all down over 2 per cent on the day.Homebuilders, which have outperformed US equities by nearly three times in the year to date, also declined on Thursday.PulteGroup was down 2.3 per cent to $9.26 and rival DR Horton dropped 3.3 per cent to $15.39.The S&P 500 homebuilders sub index, which is comprised of two companies and a third Lennar Corp, is still up 32.5 per cent since the start of 2012 while the main US index has risen just under 11 per cent in the same period.
64;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-03-27T21:04:48Z;Lennar lays foundations for homebuilders rally;;"Shares in homebuilders reached their highest levels since September 2008 on Tuesday, as investor confidence in a housing market recovery was boosted by new economic data and strong earnings results from one of the US’s largest homebuilders.The S&P 500 homebuilders sub-index rallied as much as 6 per cent before finishing the day up 3.3 per cent, taking its gains to more than 35 per cent on the year. In the year to date, the sub-index has gained nearly 3 times more than the benchmark US index, which after the day’s close was up 12.3 per cent in the period.Lennar Corp, the third-largest US homebuilder by revenues, fuelled the day’s rally as it said its first-quarter earnings came in at 8 cents a share, well above analyst consensus of between 4 and 5 cents.The company also said that sales increased 30 per cent to $724.9m and new orders were up 33 per cent to 3,022 homes in the period.“We have seen the market stabilise, driven by a combination of low home prices and low interest rates, making the decision to purchase a new home more attractive compared to the heated rental market,” Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, said in the trading update.Shares in Lennar climbed 4.7 per cent to $27.63. The company’s competitors in the housing sector, PulteGroup and DR Horton, joined in the gains and rose 3.1 per cent and 2.2 per cent to $9.06 and $15.77, respectively.Meanwhile, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index of 20 metropolitan areas showed prices in January held steady versus seasonally adjusted declines of 0.5 per cent in December, another indication that the housing market may be stabilising.“We have been calling for 2012 to be the beginning for the housing recovery and every week that goes by we seem to be seeing greater confirmation of this. Lennar’s results today certainly adds more evidence,” said Stephen Kim, analyst at Barclays.“It has been surprising enough that volumes have come back relatively strongly, but virtually nobody has modelled in an assumption that builders would be able to build in price increases.”The S&P 500 climbed to another cyclical high but could not keep pace with homebuilders and finished the day down 0.3 per cent to 1,412.52.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 per cent to 13,197.73, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.1 per cent to 3,120.35.Safeway revealed on Tuesday the level of its pension plan underfunding, which was the source of a downgrade from “buy” to “hold” on the company’s shares, as analysts at Credit Suisse estimated the figure was about $7bn. The supermarket group said that the underfunding was significantly less than estimates at $1.88bn.“This underfunding amount has declined steadily since the steep drop in asset values in late 2008, due to improved market returns, contribution increases and benefit reductions. The underfunded liability is expected to be further reduced over time through collective bargaining, increased market returns or other actions taken by plan trustees,” the company said.Shares in Safeway, which fell 3.4 per cent on Monday, recovered 0.7 per cent to $20.41.Apollo Group, the owner of the University of Phoenix, the largest US for-profit college, was among the worst-performing stocks on the main market, falling
8.5 per cent to $39.54.The education provider said its revenues in the first half of its 2012 fiscal year were hurt by a 15.6 per cent year-on-year drop in enrolments at its flagship school, while reports said the company’s chief executive predicted future enrolment rates would be “volatile”.Walgreen Co, the drugstore chain, rose 1.3 per cent to $34.80 even as it said second-quarter earnings fell 7.7 per cent to 78 cents a share. The company reported profits down almost 7 per cent to $683m, which it partially attributed to a mild cold and flu season.Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, gained 1.3 per cent to $205.44 as the company said the seven book Harry Potter collection would now be available on its popular Kindle tablet.Bank of America dropped further away from the $10 threshold that it has been flirting with in the past few days. The bank was downgraded from “buy” to “hold” by analysts at Baird, who attributed the recent resurgence in the company’s shares – up 75 per cent in the year to date – to an unjustified fall in its price last year. Its shares fell 3.3 per cent to $9.60.“While BAC shares likely should have never been at $5 three months ago, at current prices we do not believe the intermediate-term earnings outlook justifies putting new money to work in the stock,” said David George, analyst at Baird.Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, rose 1.5 per cent to $22.50 after a note from analysts at Goldman Sachs said that the company was willing to consider “separations beyond Animal Health and Nutrition if the conditions make sense”.Nabors, the land drilling contractor, was down 5.3 per cent to $17.79 as the company said it would sell $800m in non-core assets to raise funds."
65;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-03-27T14:54:35Z;US home prices end monthly declines;;US home prices ended a long run of monthly declines in January, but the average cost of a home has fallen to the level of nearly a decade ago, an indication of how deeply the market has contracted since the financial crisis.The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index showed prices in January held flat on a seasonally adjusted basis after declining 0.5 per cent in December. Unadjusted, prices fell 0.8 per cent over the month.Year-on-year, prices extended their slump, dropping to a new post-crisis low. The January index fell 3.8 per cent against the same month in 2011, as analysts had forecast, compared with a 4.1 per cent fall in December. Prices have fallen 34.4 per cent from their bubble-era peak in 2006, and average home prices are back at 2003 levels.While some analysts pointed to signs of stabilisation in the property market, others were more cautious about the health of the housing market as indicated by a mixed run of data over the last week.“Despite some positive economic signs, home prices continued to drop …Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Las Vegas, New York, Portland, Seattle and Tampa [all] made new lows,” said David Blitzer, chairman of S&P’s index committee.But he noted that “Detroit and Phoenix, two cities that have suffered massive price declines, plus Denver, saw increasing prices versus January 2011”.The index tracks monthly changes in the value of residential real estate in 20 metropolitan regions across the US. Due to delays in data reporting, the January 2012 index values for Charlotte, North Carolina were not included.Sixteen of the 19 cities included in January’s index showed a year-on-year decline. Only Miami, Phoenix and Washington home prices went up versus December 2011.Prices have been under downward pressure as a result of a glut of foreclosed properties and homes being sold at steep discounts, which have boosted the sales of existing homes. House prices lag home sales data by about nine to 12 months, according to analysts.David Stiff, chief economist at Fiserv, the financial services technology solutions company, said: “We are being presented with a confusing picture and we are likely to be bouncing along the bottom until early next year. It is going to be a bumpy ride and no one is going to have a clear idea that there is a sustained trend in one direction or another.”Mixed results for homebuilders illustrate the mixed outlook for the housing market. Lennar Corp reported its sharpest rise in orders in three quarters on Tuesday and said it was seeing strong signs of improvement in sales activity. But last week, rival KB Home reported a surprising slowdown in orders that contributed to a worse-than-expected first-quarter loss.“These homebuilders will see varying performances depending on the market. If they are competing in a market with high numbers of foreclosed properties for sale, it is going to be difficult,” Mr Stiff added.Tuesday’s data followed pending home sales numbers released on Monday that showed the number of previously owned homes under contract for sale was 0.5 per cent lower at 96.5, worse than expected.Separately on Tuesday, consumer confidence pulled back slightly in March to 70.2, according to the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index. Analysts had forecast a level of 70.9.The March fall comes after the index jumped 9.3 points in February to 70.8, which was the highest reading since the 72 level reached in February 2011 and well above the recession low of 25.3 in February 2009.The Conference Board index is based on consumers’ perceptions of current business and employment conditions, as well as their expectations for the next six months, The index is measured on a scale of 100 pegged to the level of confidence in 1985.The monthly survey of 3,000 households is watched keenly as consumer confidence is associated with consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the US economy.Lynn Franco, director of The Conference Board’s consumer research centre, said: “The moderate decline was due solely to a less favourable short-term outlook, while consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, continued to improve. The present situation index now stands at its highest level in three and a half years, suggesting that despite this month’s dip in confidence, consumers feel the economy is not losing momentum.”The proportion of consumers expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months increased to 19.2 per cent from 18.9 per cent. However, those anticipating business conditions will worsen also rose, to 13.5 per cent from 11.8 per cent.Consumers’ assessment of the job market was mixed. Those saying jobs were “plentiful” increased to 9.4 per cent from 7 per cent, while those stating jobs were “hard to get” also rose, to 41 per cent from 38.6 per cent.The report came after a warning from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, about the health of the US economy, saying that the rapid recent falls in US unemployment may prove to be a one-off unless economic growth picks up.US stocks ticked higher as investors digested the figures.

PulteGroup, another homebuilder, dropped 2.6 per cent to $8.88 while rival Lennar fell 1 per cent to $25.86.The S&P 500 homebuilders index, which had risen 80 per cent since last October, has lost more than 3.5 per cent this week.Key housing data released throughout the week showed signs that, while the housing market was stabilising, the pace of recovery was slowing.“After the run-up we have had this year, you want to see the markets take a pause and consolidate,” said Rebecca Patterson, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “They were not any new, fresh drivers to take us higher this week with the data being mixed.”“For the week overall, I’d probably give the US housing data a grade of B- or C+. There are some details to suggest we are bumping along the bottom rather than falling off the wagon. The story for the US is not great but it’s still improving and nothing this week changed our view.”Shares in Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, were halted after they plunged to $542 a share.A single mistaken trade on one of BATS’s exchanges was identified as the cause and corrected, according to a statement by BATS. Trading in Apple shares, which had retreated from highs earlier in the week, resumed soon after and fell 0.6 per cent to $596.05.But the troubles continued for BATS as the exchange was forced to withdraw its initial public offering on Friday, citing “technical issues” that caused its share price to plunge in the first moments of trading on its own exchange.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,397.11 on Friday, edging back towards the 1,400 mark after retreating from it earlier in the week.But the US benchmark has had its worst week since mid-December, falling 0.5 per cent and retreating from the post-financial crisis highs reached on Monday. However, the S&P 500 is still up 11 per cent on the year to date.Nike, the world’s largest sporting goods company, reported that revenues rose 15 per cent like-for-like to $5.8bn, driven by strong demand in North America, but its shares fell 3.2 per cent to $107.42 in trading on Friday as analysts considered the pressure on the company’s forward profit margins and valuation.Camilo Lyon, analyst at Canaccord, said of his “hold” rating: “Taking it altogether …we believe the stock should trade down, especially considering the peak 21 times price to earnings multiple at which it currently trades.“Given the strength in North America futures, we would rather play the strength of the footwear cycle via the retailers, in particular buy-rated Foot Locker and Dick’s Sporting Goods.”Citi analysts removed Nike from their top-picks list but reiterated their buy rating on confidence that sales growth would be driven by momentum in North America and China.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.1 per cent to to 3,067.92. The technology-heavy index fared the best among the three major US indices, up 0.4 per cent for the week.Netflix, the home DVD delivery and internet movie streaming provider, was among the week’s top gainers. Shares in the company rose by more than 9 per cent on the week and were trading at $120.19.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.2 per cent over the five trading days at 13,080.73 as equities on the blue-chip index were rattled by weak manufacturing data out of Europe and China released on Thursday.Earthmoving equipment manufacturer Caterpillar rose 1.3 per cent to $107.83 on Friday but remained one of the weakest stocks among blue-chips for the week.Shares in the company, which have risen by 19 per cent in the year to date, fell by more than 5 per cent this week.Sears Holdings, parent company of the Sears and Kmart department store chains, fell by more than 12 per cent over the five days to make it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500.Last week, the company reported that it would shut down as many as 62 stores in the first half of the year to reduce its expenses but the move was little comfort to investors as the stock fell another 1.8 per cent to $72.36 on Friday.

On Tuesday, the benchmark index had suffered its worst day in nearly three months but had recouped all its losses and was up 0.3 per cent for the week.“We had seen a little weakness in the surveys leading up to Friday’s report and there was a bit of growing concern that we would miss the consensus number. But it came in line with expectations and the story continues to be that the economy is improving,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market research at Charles Schwab.“We are starting to see a bit of a move away from the risk on, risk off mentality that dominated last year. We still have a way to go, but the starting signs are there,” he added.Homebuilders were among the best performers, with Lennar leading the pack, adding another 3.1 per cent to its gains for the week to close at $25.45. The company was up 12.2 per cent since Monday’s open. Close behind were DR Horton, up 6.3 per cent to $15.47, and PulteGroup, up 3.7 per cent to $9.02. The homebuilders added 11.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively on the week.Financials were slightly positive for the week after reports that there would be a payout for holders of credit default swaps. Markets were settled by late Thursday’s announcement that at least 85 per cent of Greek bondholders had agreed to participate in the €206bn debt exchange. JPMorgan gained 1.8 per cent to $41.03 and Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $34.20 on the week.The oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum gained 2 per cent to $85.25 on Friday as the Texas company said it had resolved a tax dispute with an Algerian producer. That could net Anadarko up to $4.4bn over the next few years, according to a report.Overall, the benchmark US index has climbed 9.2 per cent in the year to date. US equities have now doubled from lows sustained this time three years ago, according to Tobias Levkovich, an equity strategist at Citigroup.“Panicked investors feared the onset of a new economic depression at the time, and it did not materialise. Nonetheless, the memory of that experience still has a post-traumatic-like impact on investor psyche that may take years to heal fully, as the S&P 500 had plunged almost 52 per cent in the two years leading up to that March 9 [2009] price point,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 12,922.02, down 0.2 per cent for the week. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, climbed 0.5 per cent to $60.04 on the blue-chip heavy index on Friday.Cyclical material stocks were among the worst hit this week as fears of a slowdown in China were stoked by the country’s adjustment of its target growth rate on Monday.Aluminium maker Alcoa dropped more than 4.5 per cent for the week to finish at $9.81. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan fell over 9.6 per cent dropping to $38.78.

Shares in Starbucks gained 2.9 per cent to $51.84 on the day.“We would use any overreaction to the obvious move by Starbucks to enter automated espresso as a buying opportunity in [Green Mountain] during a period when [the company] just enjoyed incredible momentum during the holiday selling season,” said Scott Van Winkle, retail analyst at Canaccord, who reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on Green Mountain shares.Shares in Apple climbed 0.6 per cent to $545.17, up just 0.1 per cent on the week. The consumer technology company unveiled the latest iterations of its products on Wednesday, including a third generation of its popular iPad tablet.Groupon, the e-coupon company, gained 0.5 per cent to $17.06 but was off 10.2 per cent for the week. Renren, the Chinese social networking site, rose 0.9 per cent to $5.40 on Friday after it said it had swung to a profit in its fourth quarter.First Solar, the renewable energy company, rose 5.1 per cent to $27.49 on Friday, but lost 8.4 per cent for the week.

68;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-02-29T22:13:55Z;Nasdaq hits 3,000 but closes down;;The Nasdaq Composite index briefly topped 3,000 for the first time in more than 11 years, taking it to a benchmark not seen since the aftermath of the dotcom bubble.The Nasdaq closed off 0.7 per cent to 2,966.89, but hit a high of 3,000.11 in early trading. The tech-heavy index is up almost 15 per cent this year, easily beating the 8.6 per cent gain in the S&P 500, driven by a rally in Apple shares that shows no signs of slowing.A day after Apple’s market capitalisation reached the $500bn mark, its shares climbed as high as $547.61, before closing up 1.3 per cent to $542.44. That represents a gain of 35 per cent this year, or more than $140.Although Apple accounts for more than a tenth of the Nasdaq, semiconductor and hard disc drive manufacturers have also rallied strongly this year.“It’s becoming a bit of a fashion for some analysts to strip Apple gains from the index. But despite Apple’s very strong performance, it is not an isolated case. The tech sector as a whole has been benefiting from increased consumer spending and business investment in technology,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector research at Charles Schwab.Elsewhere, the three homebuilder stocks in the S&P 500 were all among the top four gainers in the index, as PulteGroup climbed 6.3 per cent to $8.82, Lennar Corp jumped 3.9 per cent to $23.38 and DR Horton was up 3.2 per cent to $14.34.The move in homebuilders, which are considered highly cyclical, came even as Ben Bernanke’s testimony before Congress knocked shares, as he failed to signal additional monetary easing moves.The sudden rally in the three stocks appeared to be a reaction to share price falls on Monday, when the Case-Shiller price index had shown US house prices fell to new multiyear lows during 2011, and also because of data showing mortgage applications were up 8 per cent week on week.The 3 large US homebuilders have seen share price gains of between 60 and 120 per cent since the market last bottomed on October 3, easily outpacing the S&P 500, but that has left some analysts doubtful.“We’re looking for housing starts to climb 20 per cent this year, which is well ahead of most expectations, but we still don’t have a single buy on the homebuilder space, and we are in fact telling people to short the space.” said Michael Widner at Stifel Nicolaus.“The shares are trading at a multiple of eight times what we expect earnings to be in 2015 or 2016, but for now these companies are still loss making. Its as if a full blown housing recovery has already taken place,” he added.The S&P 500 snapped a four day rally, as Mr Bernanke’s comments disappointed some analysts.The S&P 500 fell 0.5 per cent to 1,365.68, although it had touched a new post-financial crisis high of 1,378.04 in early trading.The benchmark index fell as much as 0.5 per cent during Mr Bernanke’s testimony, but recovered as some analysts said more quantitative easing remained on the table, should the recent signs of recovery falter.“Bernanke …reiterated the Fed’s easing bias in policy,” said Michael Hanson, an economist at Bank of America Merril Lynch, “We continue to anticipate that the Fed will adopt additional easing, including QE3, later this year, if growth disappoints in line with our forecast.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed above 13,000 for the first time since 2008 on Tuesday, retreated 0.4 per cent to 12,952.07.JPMorgan bucked the trend to climb 0.1 per cent to $39.24 after its chief executive forecast record-breaking profits at an analyst day on Tuesday.Genworth Financial, an insurer which sells a consumer debt product in the eurozone, climbed 1.5 per cent to $9.09, as the European Central Bank’s three-year loans programme saw solid take-up by eurozone lenders.First Solar shares slumped 11.3 per cent to $32.30 as the solar panel manufacturer reported a heavy loss in the fourth quarter, compared with expectations of a small profit. Growing supply from China and falling subsidies in the eurozone for panels hurt the company.Staples fell 8.4 per cent to $14.66 as the office supplies retailer warned of weak US demand in its 2012 forecast. However, the stock is only down 4 per cent for the week, as investors had bid up shares in anticipation of strong earnings.MetroPCS shares fell 6.5 per cent to $10.30. A proposed bid for the wireless network provider by larger rival Sprint Nextel collapsed this week, removing a factor that had driven up shares.
69;LEN;Lennar Corp;2012-02-14T22:34:49Z;Masco losses pull US homebuilders lower;;hares in Masco Corp plunged 12.1 per cent to $11.63 after the home improvement retailer reported a larger fourth-quarter loss than expected.Masco shares have rallied strongly in recent months amid increasing optimism about the construction sector, which tends to drive traffic to Masco stores, and the stock remains up 10 per cent for the year.But analysts were concerned by weak plumbing sales and the sell-off spread to homebuilders, whose share prices have been tightly correlated with Masco in 2012.Lennar Corp fell 0.7 per cent to $23.80 and DR Horton was off 1.2 per cent to $14.56.“Certain … projections suggest that [Masco] is not expecting a material US demand recovery in 2012,” Peter Lisnic at RW Baird told clients.Elsewhere, stocks retreated in stages as the trading day was punctuated by soft January retail sales data and the postponement of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers.The S&P 500 fell more than 10 points, or almost 1 per cent, over the course of the day, but rebounded strongly in the final 30 minutes of trading to end off just 0.1 per cent at 1,350.5.“Any and all sell-offs continue to find aggressive buying late in the day, which is a positive sign for US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research. “US investors do not seem to be reacting as strongly to eurozone news as before.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite index both reversed losses fully, to end the day fractionally in positive territory at 12,878.28 and 2,931.93 respectively.Apple shares hit record highs after breaching $500 for the first time on Monday. Shares climbed 1.4 per cent to $509.46 yesterday as investors brushed off attempts by a Taiwanese company to prevent the export of iPads from China as a trademark tussle rumbled on.The financial sector of the S&P 500 was hit hard as investors absorbed banks’ submissions on the proposed Volcker rule on proprietary trading.Bank of America fell 3.3 per cent to $7.98 after Citigroup analysts removed their “buy” recommendation on the stock, arguing that “earnings headwinds” would check a rally, which has seen BofA shares climb more than 40 per cent this year.Morgan Stanley fell 2.5 per cent to $19.05 and Citigroup was off 2.4 per cent to $32.08.However, not all analysts expect Volcker concerns to weigh on bank stocks.Insurer Fidelity National bucked the trend of falling financials, climbing 7 per cent to $31.04, for the best performance in the S&P 500.The company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings but also raised its quarterly dividend by 17 per cent to $0.14 per share.First Solar fell 6 per cent to $39.21 on reports that solar panel installations in Germany, a big global market, will be far lower than previously expected in the first four months of the year.Goodyear Tire fell 5.2 per cent to $13.25 after fourth-quarter revenues missed analyst expectations.Shares in Hospira climbed 6.1 per cent to $36.30 with investors apparently relieved that fourth-quarter profit only fell 15 per cent year-on-year.Shares in Gap rose 2.9 per cent to $22.34 as Citigroup analysts recommended clients buy the stock, pointing out the company had substantial cash on hand for stock buy-backs if it wanted to support its share price.Netflix shares climbed 4 per cent to $123.07 as filings showed that Jana Partners, a hedge fund, took a $45m stake in the video streaming and DVD delivery company in the final quarter of 2011.Shares in Zynga, the developer of online games such as FarmVille, climbed 7 per cent to $14.35, a new high, ahead of its first quarterly earnings report, which came after the close of trading.The company reported more than $300m in fourth-quarter revenue, a jump of almost 60 per cent from the previous year, although stock distributions to employee meant the company was lossmaking.Shares retreated by a few cents after hours, but are still up around 50 per cent so far this year.Shares in Michael Kors jumped 27.5 per cent to $42.85 after the luxury-goods maker reported same store sales in North American and European stores climbed by more than a third in its fiscal third quarter. Shares have now more than doubled in price since an initial public offering just two months ago.

Technicians enthused about a so-called “golden cross”, as the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average broke above its 200-day moving average.According to Schaeffers Investment Research, the S&P 500 has delivered positive returns in the calendar year following all but one of the 17 golden crosses since 1975, with a median gain of 13 per cent.“Although it is usually well-hyped when it happens, you do have to respect the fact that a golden cross really is a strong intermediate-term signal,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers.At 10am stocks reversed course as data showing an unexpected decline in consumer confidence added to earlier gloom around a further fall in US house prices.Homebuilders suffered with PulteGroup off 2.4 per cent at $7.45, Lennar down 2.9 per cent to $21.49 and DR Horton falling 1.1 per cent to $13.92. All three stocks remain up at least 9 per cent for the year and have rallied more than 50 per cent from October lows.Some analysts pointed out that weak housing data may encourage continued Federal Reserve stimulus. “Recent housing data has once again disappointed to the downside,” said Gina Martin Adams, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.Stocks pared losses through the rest of the session, but the S&P 500 ended off 0.1 per cent at 1,312.4, up 4.4 per cent for the month for its best January since 1997.Earnings were responsible for most of the big movers. Shares in RadioShack plunged 29.8 per cent to $7.18 after the company suspended share repurchases and warned that fourth-quarter earnings would come in below expectations. Heavy discounting over the holiday sales period took its toll on margins at the electronics retailer, and the company’s market capitalisation has now fallen by more than 60 per cent since the start of 2011.RadioShack rival Best Buy fell 5.6 per cent to $23.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.2 per cent at 12,632.91, as ExxonMobil, one of the most influential stocks in the price-weighted index, fell 2.1 per cent to $83.74.Exxon’s fourth-quarter earnings rose 2 per cent, but margins at its US refining business slumped. Profit at its US “downstream” business, which includes marketing as well as refining, slid from $226m to just $30m.Exxon’s fall left Apple once again as the largest US company by market capitalisation, after its shares hit a new high of $458.24, before finishing the day at $456.48, a gain of 0.8 per cent.That helped the Nasdaq to a gain of 0.1 per cent for the day, the only one of the three big US indices to record gains on Tuesday, as it closed at 2,813.84.However shares in Amazon, one of the other heavily weighted stocks in the Nasdaq, fell almost 10 per cent in after-hours trading as fourth-quarter earnings data missed expectations.Eli Lilly climbed 1.3 per cent to $39.74 despite seeing fourth-quarter profit fall by about 25 per cent, as sales of its Zyprexa antipsychotic drug were hit by new generic competition. The company also said clinical trials of its experimental Alzheimer’s treatment were not yet complete.US Steel climbed 5.1 per cent to $30.19, more than rebounding from Monday’s sell-off, which had followed the announcement of a lossmaking sale of its Serbian unit.Although US Steel declared a fourth-quarter loss, it was smaller than in 2010, and it forecast “significantly improved” results for the current quarter on firmer steel prices.Netflix fell 4.2 per cent to $120.20, as the rally, which has seen shares in the video streaming website climb 80 per cent this year, paused for breath.Sears Holdings was once again hit by reports that CIT, a key provider of finance in the retail sector, would stop extending credit to Sears suppliers to fund deliveries to the department store chain. Its shares fell 4.3 per cent to $42.15.Banks bucked the falling market, helped by improving eurozone sentiment. Bank of America climbed 0.9 per cent to $7.13 and Morgan Stanley was up 2.5 per cent to $18.65.

It had climbed as high as 1,333.47, a gain of more than 21 per cent from the close on October 3, as equity analysts said the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep interest rates low until the end of 2014 was bullish for equities.“The Fed intervention should turn savers into investors, bringing money back into the market,” said Douglas Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “For the next three years at least, bank deposits will make no money, and even the most conservative savers can’t be happy with zero returns.”Utility and material stocks appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the Fed’s move, with both sectors gaining in a falling market. Analysts said material stocks offer a hedge against the inflationary effect of low interest rates – as commodity prices rise with inflation – while low interest rates would make it easier for utility companies to fund infrastructure investments.Apple, meanwhile, briefly become the largest US company by market capitalisation, as its shares surged 6.4 per cent to $447.28 following blockbuster results on Tuesday. That helped the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index to a handy 1.1 per cent gain over the week, closing at 2,816.55.It also triggered a wider rally among companies that supply Apple with parts for its iPads, iPhones and Mac computers, which all saw record sales in the company’s fiscal first quarter.For example, Advanced Micro Devices, which supplies Mac components, ended the week 6.2 per cent higher at $6.82, even though the company cuts its forecast for full-year earnings.But the news was less good for companies supplying other smartphone manufacturers. SanDisk shares tumbled 11 per cent to $46.70 over the week, as the semiconductor manufacturer said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt 2012 revenue, and announced it had put a new production facility on hold.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not include Apple, fell 0.5 per cent to 12,660.46, lagging other indices, as poor fourth-quarter results weighed on several companies.Mobile phone network Verizon fell 4.5 per cent to $37.21 and rival AT&T was off 4.4 per cent to $29.16, as both reported unexpectedly large payments to their pension funds. Pension contributions also sapped margins at 3M, although shares in the technology supplier still climbed 2.1 per cent to $87.46 on strong earnings.Caterpillar was another bright spot in the Dow, climbing 5.3 per cent to $111.28 as the earth-moving company gave a bullish forecast for spending on construction in the US.But that was not enough to sustain a rally in homebuilders, which sold off on Thursday as December new home sales came in lower than expected. Lennar ended the week up just 1 per cent at $22.28, although the stock remains up 13.4 per cent for the year.With the quarterly earnings of 196 S&P 500 constituents reported, companies have beaten analysts’ forecasts at the lowest rate in a decade, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Revenue growth is also set to outpace earnings growth, suggesting US corporate margins are being squeezed.The financial sector of the S&P 500 slipped 0.2 per cent over the week, although data from Lipper showed funds investing in US banks had attracted inflows for eight successive weeks, the longest such run since March 2000.Brokers Charles Schwab and E Trade Financial fell 9 per cent to $11.67 and 15.2 per cent to $8.19 respectively, as fourth-quarter earnings were hit by low trading volumes.Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell 10.4 per cent to $16.89, as mark-to-market losses on collateralised debt obligation securities hit earnings by $12.1m, or four cents a share. Brian Zabora at Stifel Nicolaus said Zions was the only regional bank he covers that still had exposure to CDOs, instruments which issue securities backed by the debt of low-rated companies.Netflix jumped 23.5 per cent to $123.79 over the week as the video-streaming and DVD delivery business said it had added 600,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter to reach 24.4m paying customers.Shares are now trading at their highest levels since late October, when investors deserted the company after price hikes led to 1m subscriber defections.Analysts were impressed by the company’s update on international operations after a recent launch in the UK. “One can buy Netflix at less than 20 times [domestic earnings] and get a ‘free’ call option on its international segment,” Mark Mahaney told Citigroup clients as he reinstated his “buy” recommendation.Netflix is now up almost 80 per cent for the year, although part appears to be a result of short-sellers closing out positions as the share price has climbed – Netflix was the fifth most shorted stock in the S&P 500 as of January 13, according to the most recent data from Factset."

Our calls have been highly volatile,” conceded Mr Mahaney.The S&P 500 started higher, up 0.6 per cent to 1,333.47, almost 15 points into bull market territory. But data on December new home sales, which came in below the November number and expectations, sparked a reversal. The benchmark index closed at 1,318.145, outside bull territory, with a loss of 0.6 per cent for the day.Homebuilder PulteGroup fell 2.4 per cent to $7.80 on the home sales data, with DR Horton off 2.6 per cent to $14.12 and Lennar down 2.9 per cent to $22.13.Caterpillar provided some cheer for the sector, predicting real terms spending on US construction will increase in 2012 for the first time since 2004, but analysts warned against excessive optimism.“Sellers of new single-family homes face a similar challenge as one might have selling ice to Eskimos. The market is awash with plenty of existing homes and the supply is likely to increase as banks proceed with more foreclosures,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which does not have any homebuilders constituents, dropped just 0.2 per cent to 12,734.63, as Caterpillar shares climbed 2.1 per cent to $111.31 on the earthmover’s strong results.AT&T fell 2.5 per cent to $29.45, as the mobile phone network posted a fourth-quarter loss despite surging smartphone sales, as a hefty charge relating to its failed bid for T-Mobile weighed heavily.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,805.28, as poor results from SanDisk weighed on semiconductor stocks.SanDisk shares closed 11.4 per cent lower at $46.39, as the afterglow from Apple’s blockbuster results earlier in the week faded for smartphone suppliers. SanDisk said weak demand from mobile device manufacturers would hurt revenue in the first half of the year, and put a new production facility on hold.Electronic broker E Trade Financial slumped 14.6 per cent to $7.99, as it reported weak fourth-quarter results on low trading volumes.Keith Murray at Nomura retained his buy recommendation, arguing “several noisy items related to credit and expenses” contributed 10 cents a share of the miss.JC Penney shares surged 18.8 per cent to $40.72 as the company forecast strong 2012 earnings, and said it would stop relying on heavy discounting and promotions to attract customers.Time Warner climbed 7.8 per cent to $74.51 after the company used a strong earnings report to announce a $4bn share buy-back scheme and raise its dividend.Investor choices continued to be guided by the Federal Open Market Committee’s forecast of low interest rates until the end of 2014. As was the case on Wednesday, utility and material stocks were among the best performers in the S&P 500.Utilities, which are considered a carry-trade by some investors, because low interest rates reduce the cost of infrastructure investments, were up 0.5 per cent.Materials climbed 0.6 per cent, suggesting some investors are nervous of the inflationary impact of a prolonged low-interest rate environment: commodity prices tend to rise with inflation, offering some protection to materials stocks.Financials sold off led by insurers and regional banks, with lower long-term interest rates expected to put pressure on lending margins, and investment returns.Insurer Lincoln National fell 5.7 per cent to $20.69, while SunTrust Banks was off 5.2 per cent to $20.50.Greenhill & Co bucked the trend as shares surged 12.3 per cent to $49.36. The boutique investment firm posted better than expected revenue. It also followed the lead of large investment banks by cutting compensation – only 50 per cent of revenues were paid out in salaries, down from 73 per cent a year ago.“We are at a juncture where there is opportunity for advisory boutique firms like Greenhill to take away business from big companies,” Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities is reported to have said.

ExxonMobil shares slipped 0.3 per cent to $84.88 over the week.The Nasdaq Composite index fared better, climbing 1.4 per cent to 2,710.67, as China’s plans to double solar energy capacity in 2012 boosted stocks. SunPower Corp ended the week up 13.2 per cent to $7.55.Tiffany fell 10.1 per cent to $59.10 over the week as the luxury department store cut earnings guidance after reporting anaemic holiday same-store sales growth in the US and a decline in sales at its flagship New York store.Asia-Pacific same-store sales rose 12 per cent year on year, but investor reaction suggested emerging market growth may not inoculate luxury brands like Tiffany and Coach against developed market worries.“No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high-end consumer spending.”Coach shares slipped 1 per cent to $62.02 over the week.Urban Outfitters ended the week off 9.2 per cent to $25.13, after investors responded to the unexpected resignation of Glen Senk as chief executive, by sending shares down 19 per cent in just one day.Erika Maschmeyer at RW Baird downgraded the stock to a “hold” equivalent from a “buy” equivalent, while Paul Lejuez at Nomura worried for the retailer’s turnround prospects, telling clients: “If Glen can’t do it, we wonder who can.”Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies suffered as the US natural gas price hit multiyear lows, falling more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.Cabot Oil & Gas retreated 16.7 per cent to $67.13 and Range Resources was off

That was a big swing from mark-to-market gains of $4.7m on Rialto investments in the fourth quarter of 2010. That means, if the company were to sell its distressed assets now, it would incur a substantial loss.But other homebuilders rallied on the result with PulteGroup up 4.9 per cent to $7.70 and DR Horton up 4.8 per cent to $14.13, while home improvement retailer Masco Corp climbed 4.6 per cent to $11.99.Aircraft maker and defence contractor Textron advanced 5.7 per cent to $21.32 on reports that the company was considering a strategic review that could see it dispose of assets.Large bank stocks continued to rally ahead of financials’ quarterly results season, which JPMorgan kicks off tomorrow.

75;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-12-30T21:41:34Z;US stocks escape worst of eurozone crisis;;The S&P 500 ended the year exactly 0.04 points lower than it started, although analysts found cause for comfort.“Given all the negatives that the market has had thrown at it, even to end the year flat is a victory for the US market,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It shows the attraction of US companies in turbulent times.”Despite a gut-wrenching August, when 4 per cent daily moves in the S&P 500 briefly became the norm, Wall Street escaped the worst of the eurozone crisis which wreaked havoc elsewhere, as the FTSE All World Index ended the year down 9.7 per cent.At 1,257.60, the S&P 500 had recovered 14 per cent from October lows, but was 8 per cent short of April highs.Once dividends are factored in, financials and materials aside, every broad sector of the S&P 500 has delivered gains this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the year up 5.5 per cent to 12,217.56, although a few big stocks skew the price-weighted index. Only the Nasdaq Composite index fell over the year, 1.8 per cent to 2,605.15.The worst performing stocks tell the macro stories that preoccupied investors this year.First Solar, down 74 per cent for the year to $33.76, has seen a lucrative market for solar panels disrupted first by a glut of supply from China and second by a threatened collapse in demand from the eurozone, as governments cut back on subsidies.Computer Sciences Corp, the IT services company that fell 52.2 per cent to $23.70, has been hit by reduced government spending on outsourcing, most recently the cancellation of a contract by the UK’s National Health Service.Alpha Natural Resources, down 66 per cent to to $20.43, and US Steel Corp, off 54.7 per cent to $26.46, have been two of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500, moving 2 per cent for every percentage point move in the benchmark index.Their share prices have waxed and waned with sentiment about Chinese growth and demand for steel, which US Steel Corp makes and Alpha’s metallurgical coal is needed to manufacture, from the country’s construction industry.Homebuilder stocks rallied on resilient US economic data. Lennar Corp and DR Horton, which had seen their market capitalisations more than halve by October, ended the year up 4.9 per cent to $19.66 and 5.7 per cent to $12.61 respectively, as US construction starts and pending home sales data turned positive in November.Among the big fallers only Netflix, down 60.5 per cent to $69.29 from a peak above $200, seemed little affected by macro events. The web-streaming company, the darling of internet investors in 2010, was undone by a decision to raise prices for users who wanted to continue using its physical DVD delivery service, and an aborted attempt to spin off the DVD business altogether.Moving from individual stocks to sectors, one theme dominated the year: the collapse of financials. Down 18.4 per cent for the year, 7 percentage points more than any other sector, their weighting in the S&P 500 has slipped to just 13 per cent, barely above consumer staples, energy or healthcare stocks.The four companies which have weighed most heavily on the index – Bank of America, down 58.3 per cent to $5.56, Citigroup, 44.4 per cent to $26.31, Goldman Sachs, 46.2 per cent to $90.43 and JPMorgan Chase, 21.6 per cent to $33.25 – were all banks. Between them they wiped more than 23 points off the S&P 500, equivalent to 2 per cent of the index at the start of the year.“Looking ahead banks are not necessarily key to a rally in US equities,” said Ryan Detrick, chief technical strategist at Schaeffers investment research, “but they could certainly be the cause of a bear market, if they were to fall fast again.”At the other end of the spectrum investors cheered the boom in shale oil, and the prospects it offers for US energy independence.Cabot Oil & Gas saw its market capitalisation double as its share closed the year at $75.90, as the company increased revenues from oil by 50 per cent in the quarter ended September 30, compared with the same period in 2010.But it was solid performances by mega-caps which had the most market impact. Apple drove the S&P 500 significantly more than any other stock, giving the index an eight point boost, as its share price climbed 25.6 per cent over the year to $405.00. ExxonMobil’s 15.9 per cent move to $84.76 gave the S&P 500 another six points, while IBM boosted the index five points, as it rose 25.3 per cent to $183.88.
76;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-12-29T22:14:37Z;US homebuilders surge as pending home sales rise;;Shares in homebuilders surged on Thursday as a measure of pending home sales reached its highest level in 19 months.PulteGroup climbed 6.1 per cent to $6.31, DR Horton close up 4.4 per cent to $12.74 and Lennar Corporation rose 4.6 per cent to $19.86,Building supplier Masco Corp also rose 8.4 per cent to $10.70 for the best performance in the S&P 500.The rise in the National Association of Realtors pending home sales index, which is based on contract signings was the second data boost for homebuilders this month, after construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November. Lennar, DR Horton and PulteGroup are all now up more than 40 per cent in the quarter to date.Elsewhere Wall Street brushed off a rise in US jobless claims to record solid gains on as financial stocks bounced off a difficult previous session.The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 per cent to 1,263.02, moving back into positive territory for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 per cent to 12,287.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.9 per cent to 2,613.74.Although new jobless claims ticked up 15,000 in the week ending December 24, but Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said that should not hold back US markets:“[The rise] is marginally more than was predicted but at 381,000 [claims] remain comfortably below that 400,000 line in the sand that points to steady job creation,” he wrote to clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 per cent, outperforming all other sectors.Bank of America climbed 3.3 per cent to $5.46 and JPMorgan Chase was up 2.4 per cent to $33.42, although bank stocks were recovering from a poor day on Wednesday, when they had significantly underperformed the market.Yahoo climbed 2.2 per cent to $16.13 on reports that Alibaba, a potential suitor for the internet portal company, had hired lobbyists, raising speculation of more bidding activity.Shares in Mosaic, a fertiliser maker, fell fractionally to $50.28, after the company said it will cut output by as much as 250,000 metric tonnes through the first quarter of 2012 because of low prices for phosphate products.Shares in Amazon were also down a few cents to $173.86, even though the company reported it sold a record number of Kindle devices, running into the “millions”, over the holiday period.Investors seemed focused on a negative research note from Goldman Sachs which reported that Christmas shopping data released by comScore, a digital research company, implied that Amazon’s 2011 sales will come in at $17.87bn. That would be slightly below analyst expectations of $18.19bn.“For [Amazon] to materially appreciate in the near term would require the company to beat and raise on the bottom line over the next few quarters,” Heather Bellini wrote to Goldman clients. “Given our lower operating forecasts for 2012, we see this scenario as unlikely.”Amazon is set to end the year off 4 per cent, with investors showing signs of nerves over the strategy of Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, to drive sales by heavy investment in new products.With one day of trading left in 2011, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 is set to end the year up 5 per cent, the best performance apart from defensive utility and consumer staple stocks. That has been driven by robust US consumer spending, even as worries about global growth have resurfaced, but analysts are questioning whether the outperformance can continue.The holiday season has been characterised by heavy discounting and high volumes of internet purchases by price-conscious shoppers. The latest quarterly results season saw several star retail stocks report falling or stalling margins.Consumer electronics chain Best Buy fell 15.5 per cent on December 13, after profits fell, despite an increase in revenue, because of lower margins. And on December 22 Bed, Bath and Beyond, tumbled 6.3 per cent in a rising market, as it broke a long run of margin growth.“This lower gross margin, we believe, will be a trend across retail as the cost of sales increases, and the internet, a lower margin sales channel, continues to hurt margins,” said David Strasser, retail analyst at Janney.Analysts also question whether retail spending can continue to outpace economic growth. The personal savings rate fell steadily over the year to 3.3 per cent in September, the lowest level since 2007, suggesting consumers may be cutting back on savings to fund spending.The holiday season has also seen signs of cracks in the emerging market-driven growth story that has seen luxury retailers trade at a premium this year. Tiffany was heavily penalised by investors at the end of November when it forecast “weakness” in sales in western European and north-eastern US.“No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high end consumer spending.”
77;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-12-27T21:44:35Z;Sears slump weighs on Wall Street;;The market capitalisation of Sears Holdings fell by more than a quarter yesterday after the company said it would close as many as 120 Kmart and Sears stores after sales of consumer electronics declined in the holiday shopping period.Sears’ shares tumbled 27.2 per cent to $33.38, their lowest level since early 2009.The decision to close stores came after comparable same-store sales for the eight weeks to December 25 fell 5.2 per cent across the group compared with the same period in 2010.The closures will generate $140m to $170m of cash from sales of inventory and the leasing or sales of the locations, the company said in a statement.But that was a drop in the ocean compared to non-cash charges of $1.6bn to $1.8bn that the company said it will book as a result of the poor sales performance.Wall Street opened lowered on the Sears’ announcement and an unexpectedly large fall in the S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities. But stocks rallied after a survey of consumer confidence report jumped almost ten points from its November level to 64.5.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day almost back where they started. The S&P was up just 0.01 per cent to 1,265.43 and the Dow edged down 0.02 per cent to 12,291.35Homebuilder stocks are among the best performers in the S&P 500 in the quarter to date, and share prices were little affected by the Case-Schiller data.Lennar was off just 0.4 per cent to $19.30, DR Horton fell 0.8 per cent to $12.35 and PulteGroup close 0.5 per cent lower at $6.05.The Nasdaq Composite index closed up 0.3 per cent to 2,625.2, helped by strong performances by Apple and Google, the two most heavily weighted stocks in the index.Apple was up 0.8 per cent $406.53 and Google climbed 1.1 per cent to $640.25 on reports that 6.8m Apple iPhone and Google Android smartphones were activated on Christmas day, more than double the previous daily record of 2.8m on 25 December 2010.Mead Johnson Nutrition climbed 5.8 per cent to $69.08, recovering some ground from a 10 per cent sell-off in the week before Christmas.The company said it had conducted tests on samples of its Enfamil powdered baby food formula, tied to a Food and Drug Administration investigation into the death of a newborn baby in Missouri, and found no presence of bacteria.Computer Sciences Corp fell 9 per cent to $24.10 after the company withdrew its 2012 financial guidance and said it stood to lose up to $1.5bn after the UK government scrapped the company’s contract to build an electronic patient records database.Stocks with exposure to internet gambling continued to benefit from reports at the end of last week that the Obama administration intended to make it easier for US states to legalise internet poker and certain other online betting.International Game Technology, which sells computerised gaming equipment, climbed 5 per cent to $17.37 and casino chain Wynn Resorts was up 3.2 per cent to $113.53.Shares in dishwasher manufacturer Whirlpool fell 8.9 per cent to $46.62. The share price hit a 52-week low last week, and that appears to have triggered more selling, which had an exaggerated impact amid light trading volumes, traders said.Banks underperformed the wider market with the financial sector of the S&P 500 falling 0.7 per cent, far more than any other broad S&P 500 sector.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $15.29 and Bank of America was off 2.1 per cent to $5.48.MetLife climbed 0.3 per cent to $31.20 as the life insurer said its retail deposit business would be acquired by General Electric financial services division.The business has $7.5bn in customer funds and an online banking platform. General Electric shares were off 1.2 per cent to $18.01.The deal should mean MetLife avoids some regulations faced by banks under the Dodd-Frank financial reform passed last year.Bank stocks have weighed on the S&P 500 throughout the year, and the financial sector is set to end 2011 17.7 per cent lower than it started – easily the worst performing sector in the benchmark US index.Once dividends are included, only financials and materials have failed to deliver a positive return in 2011, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.The CBOE Vix index of volatility edged up for the first time in a week, climbing 5.3 per cent to 21.83, although Wall Street’s “fear gauge” remained well below the elevated levels of the summer, during which it touched a high of 48.00.
78;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-12-20T22:25:22Z;US data boost homebuilding stocks;;Homebuilders led a strong rally in US stocks as the S&P 500 enjoyed its best day so far in December.PulteGroup rose 10.4 per cent to $6.17, DR Horton was gaining 5.7 per cent to $12.43 and Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $19.68, as construction starts hit their highest level in a year in November.Home improvement retailers were boosted, with Masco rising 8.9 per cent to $9.82 and Home Depot adding 4.3 per cent to $41.93.Some analysts were cautious, however, noting that much of the rise was due to building works starting on apartment blocks, which hit a three-year high.“The report doesn’t signal any turn in fortunes for the lion’s share of the market – single family homes,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Activity there rose by just 10,000 units to a 447,000 annualised pace and the highest in only five months.”Other analysts warned that Tuesday’s gains could be reversed by a change in sentiment, noting the high volatility of homebuilder stocks. All three large US homebuilders had fallen on Monday, in spite of a confidence survey rising to its highest level of the year.Broader markets bounced with the S&P 500 adding 3 per cent to 1,241.30 after its best day of the month. However, the benchmark US index remains in negative territory for December, traditionally one of its strongest months.The financial sector of the S&P 500 recovered ground after Monday’s sell-off. Bank of America climbed back above $5, a level that it had breached on Monday for the first time since 2009. BofA shares closed up 3.7 per cent to $5.17.Morgan Stanley climbed 4.5 per cent to $14.80 and Citigroup was up 4.6 per cent at $25.95.Jefferies surged 22.9 per cent to $14.50, its highest close since October, as the investment bank revealed quarterly earnings that were not as bad as expected.Profit fell to $63m, 23 per cent lower than last year, but many analysts had expected worse. The bank faced intense scrutiny of its exposure to eurozone sovereign bonds in November, but fees from investment advisory services rose year on year.“The results are better than expected but the share price reaction is overdone,” said Douglas Sipkin at Ticonderoga Securities.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 2.9 per cent to 12,103.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.2 per cent to 2,603.73.AT&T lagged behind the market, but was still up 1.3 per cent to $29.01, despite calling time on its attempt to acquire T Mobile USA.That was a fillip for its equipment suppliers. Juniper Networks climbed 8.9 per cent to $19.74 and F5 Networks was up 6.7 per cent to $109.39.“We believe this development is a short-term positive for equipment vendors,” said George Notter at Jefferies. “We believe that AT&T in recent months had significantly dialled back fourth-quarter spending in order to apply leverage in its fight with regulators.”Rival network Sprint Nextel also took cheer, closing up 9.3 per cent to $2.36.BlackBerry handset manufacturer Research In Motion suffered another day of heavy selling.Shares fell 2.9 per cent to $12.52, the latest losses apparently triggered by reports that as many as 5,000 of its PlayBook tablets had been stolen from a freight truck.CVS Caremark rose 8.9 per cent to $39.80. The pharmacy chain boosted its quarterly dividend to 16.25 cents a share from 12.5 cents a share.Eastman Chemical jumped 8.1 per cent to $38.70 after announcing it had broken ground on a new facility to produce acetate in China.Red Hat fell 8.9 per cent to $41.95 for the worst performance in the S&P 500. The open-source software company reported fiscal third-quarter billings that missed analysts’ estimates.Billings, a predictor of revenue, increased 23 per cent from a year earlier in the three months to the end of November.Cruise ship operator Carnival Corporation was one of the other five S&P 500 stocks to fall. Shares close down 0.2 per cent to $31.93 after Carnival lowered guidance for 2012 earnings.Zynga, the online social game developer, enjoyed its first day of gains since a $10bn IPO last week.Its shares were up 2.1 per cent to $9.24, still 76 cents below their debut price.In after-hours trading Oracle shares tumbled 10 per cent to $26.26, after the software reported quarterly earnings that missed analyst expectations. That knocked the S&P 500 futures by 5 points suggesting the benchmark index may open lower on Wednesday.

The US insurer sells a consumer debt insurance product in the eurozone.Coal miners Peabody, Cliffs Natural Resources and Alpha Natural Resources were all among the top 10 fallers in the S&P 500, down between 5 and 7.5 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent to 11,766.41 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off
1.3 per cent to 2,523.14.Homebuilder stocks were barely given a boost by a rise in the National Association of Home Builders confidence index to 21, its highest level since May 2010, from a revised 19 in November. PulteGroup fell 3 per cent to $5.59. DR Horton fell 2 per cent to $11.76.Even Lennar, considered by many analysts the most attractive US homebuilding stock because of the company’s low level of debt, fell 1.4 per cent to $18.51.Zynga fell 4.7 per cent to $9.05. The social game developer is trading 95 cents below its $10 initial public offering price after falling 5 per cent on its market debut on Friday.Groupon shipped 4.5 per cent to $22.00, just $2 above its own IPO price, as Stifel Nicolaus became the latest underwriter of its IPO not to recommend the stock to clients, as it initiated coverage. Stifel analysts called the discount offers website, “the internet’s overgrown toddler”, on account of its “get big fast” strategy.Cablevision Systems climbed 2 per cent to $13.00, recovering some ground after falling 8.5 per cent on Friday when Tom Rutledge, chief operating officer, unexpectedly said he would quit the cable company without offering a reason.Citigroup analysts said the market reaction was “a touch extreme” and urged clients to buy the stock at a compelling valuation.Las Vegas Sands fell 2.6 per cent to $40.46 even after the casino company’s China unit said an investigation by Hong Kong stock market regulators for alleged breaches of regulations had ended.Rival Wynn Resorts fell 3.3 per cent to $102.20.AT&T fell 0.4 per cent to $28.74 amid reports that the mobile phone network was stepping back from talks on asset sales intended to help gain approval for its acquisition of T-Mobile USA.That would suggest the company may be giving up on the T-Mobile purchase in the face of regulatory hurdles.Yahoo slipped 2.2 per cent to $14.63 despite reports after the market closed on Friday that private equity groups interested in taking a minority stake in the internet portal might raise their per share price from the $16.60 reportedly offered previously."

Taleo Corporation, which sells human resources software to businesses, was up 7.9 per cent to $31.61. SuccessFactors, which markets business education courses, rose 9.3 per cent to $26.24.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.4 per cent to 2,699.44 at the close.The S&P 500 advanced 1.3 per cent to 1,254.20, its highest close since the start of August, and decisively above the 1,220 to 1,230 range where two previous rallies stalled in recent months.The Vix index of implied volatility in the S&P 500 closed below 30 for only the second time since early August. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” had been above 30 for most of August and September.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent to 11,900.03.“EU debt negotiations didn’t go off the rails over the weekend, and it appears that some progress may have even been made toward an agreement,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.The rally was broadly cyclical with material and industrial stocks in the S&P 500 up 2.3 and 1.7 per cent respectively. Both sectors were helped by a better than expected “flash” purchasing managers’ index survey in China.Alpha Natural Resources, which supplies China with metallurgical coal for use in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.5 per cent to $23.79. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan was 8 per cent higher at $23.79.The defensive utility, telecom and consumer staples sectors were the only S&P 500 components to fall.Caterpillar surged 5 per cent to $91.77, after the company reported record revenues and delivered earnings per share of $1.71, a full 15 cents higher than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.The company raised its 2012 earnings outlook by a fifth, and said global economic uncertainty had not fed through to demand for its earthmoving equipment.Shares in health insurer HealthSpring surged 33.7 per cent to $53.71, after rival insurer Cigna announced it would purchase the company for $3.8bn.The deal values HealthSpring at $55 a share, and would give Cigna access to HealthSpring’s customer base. HealthSpring sells premium insurance to customers eligible for Medicaid, the federal health insurance programme for retirees. Cigna shares were down 0.6 per cent to $45.34.The deal helped Humana, another health insurer focused on Medicare-eligible clients, gain 4.8 per cent to $79.93.In the property sector, Citigroup analyst Josh Levin released a note arguing that “the structural excess supply of homes is exhausting itself.“The inventory of existing homes for sale [3.48m in September] has been declining on a year on year basis for the past eight months and now stands at a multiyear low,” Mr Levin told clients.Although he warned the “shadow inventory” of homes in foreclosure could yet add to the housing stock, homebuilder shares continued their strong October rally.The SPDR Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which tracks the return on homebuilders listed in the S&P 500 was up 2.9 per cent to $16.49. The ETF has risen 30 per cent in three weeks, after hitting a low of $12.30 at the start of October.Lennar Corp, considered one of the healthiest of US homebuilders because of its low debt levels, was up 1.7 per cent to $17.02, a gain of 33.6 per cent since October 4. PulteGroup, a more volatile stock carrying high debt, was up 6.3 per cent to $5.21, a gain of 47.2 per cent since October 4.Commercial property service provider CB Richard Ellis Group surged 9.5 per cent to $16.74.Lorillard, the maker of Newport cigarettes, fell 0.6 per cent to $114.97 after earnings per share of $1.94 came in below average analyst expectations. Gross profit of $563m was $3m lower than the same quarter last year, as higher costs offset increased sales of cigarettes and higher pack pricing.Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Kleenex and other household brands, fell 4.6 per cent to $69.65. Earnings per share of $1.26 were in line with expectations, but net income fell to $432 million compared with $469 million in the same quarter last year.Sprint Nextel was down 2.9 per cent to $2.69, as a judge weighed whether to dismiss the third-largest US mobile network’s opposition to the takeover of T Mobile by its AT&T.

Investment banking net revenues fell 33 per cent year-on-year to $781m as underwriting revenues seized up with the initial public offering market stalling over the summer.Bank of America surged 10.1 per cent to $6.64 after posting earnings per share of 56 cents on net profit of $6.2bn, its first profit since the first quarter of 2011.But stripping out $3.6bn from the sale of a stake in China Construction Bank and a $4.5bn boost from an accounting adjustment widely used by banks this earnings season to bolster the value of their own debt, BofA was lossmaking.“It’s a relief just to get through most of the major bank announcements and not hear anything too terrible,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service.Mr Warren initiated a position in BofA in August when the stock sunk to $7 and he was impressed by the bank’s work to boost its capital position.BofA’s tier 1 common equity ratio reached 8.65 per cent, well on course to meet Basel III requirements by 2019.Trust bank State Street jumped 10.7 per cent to $37.49 after posting earnings per share of 96 cents, handily beating the average forecast in a Bloomberg poll of analysts of 88 cents.That gave a boost to its rivals Bank of New York Mellon, up 7.6 per cent to $19.77, and Northern Trust, up 4.4 per cent to $38.78, but analysts warned State Street’s performance might not be mirrored at other trust institutions.“State Street is less banklike than the other two, which means it faces less regulatory risk and is less vulnerable to losses on outstanding loans,” said Jeff Hopson at Stifel Nicolaus.Financials in the S&P 500 were up 5 per cent, significantly outperforming every other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 per cent to 11,577.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent to 2,657.43, into positive territory for the year.In a frantic last hour of trading the S&P 500 had jumped as high as 1,233 on reports Germany and France have agreed the outlines of a $2trn European bail-out package, but sellers forced the market back down towards 1,220, where all previous rallies this summer have ended.Homebuilders, which had been sold heavily on Monday as bank earnings figures suggested mortgage delinquencies may be on the rise again, rebounded strongly.Lennar was up 9.3 per cent to $15.92, DR Horton jumped 11 per cent to $10.59 and PulteGroup was up 11.2 per cent to $4.46 after a better than expected sentiment report from the National Association of Homebuilders.Pharmaceutical company Hospira plunged 21 per cent to $29.51, after it cut its earnings per share guidance for the year to between $2.95 and $3.05, less than the analyst consensus estimate of $3.91, because of production problems at its largest manufacturing plant.IBM fell 4.1 per cent to $178.90 after the computer giant’s quarterly earnings, out after the close of markets on Monday, showed flat performance in major European markets.Coca-Cola was down 0.4 per cent to $66.74 despite reporting increased profit of $2.22bn, as margins shrank.Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson fell 7.8 per cent to $34.31. Quarterly results appeared strong with retail sales up 5.4 per cent year-on-year, much better than expected. But margin was hit by the strong dollar and restructuring costs at its main manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania.
82;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-09-20T18:47:01Z;Netflix hit by investor confidence;;Netflix shares slumped 9.5 per cent to $130.03 on Tuesday, as the combined impact of a corporate restructuring and an unexpected fall in subscribers continued to weigh on the movie-streaming company.The stock is down 13 per cent this week, after Netflix announced on Monday that it will hive off its physical DVD delivery business into a separate company called Qwikster. Last week shares fell 24 per cent after the company revealed a pricing change introduced in July had cost it 1m new subscribers.“In the long run, it makes sense to separate into two companies because the growth profiles and future prospects of the DVD and streaming businesses are dramatically different,” said Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets. “But the brand has been tarnished because they didn’t communicate the pricing change to customers well. We don’t know how much subscriber churn there is going to be as a result.”George Askew, the Netflix analyst at Sitfel Nicolaus, said the company’s decision to set up Qwikster is a first step to selling the DVD delivery business altogether.Netflix’s market capitalisation has now fallen by more than half in just over two months, from a share price peak of $304.79 in mid-July.The wider market had a see-saw day. The S&P 500 was up as much as 1.5 per cent in mid-afternoon, but ended the day in negative territory after a late sell off.The benchmark index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,202.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,590.24. But the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 11,408.66.“The S&P 500 has always pared gains on reaching 1,220 during the past month,” said Colin Cieszynski, a market strategist at CMC Markets. “There are a lot of resting sell orders which kick in at that point, so this is a normal technical correction.”Other analysts pointed to investors paring risk ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy announcement tomorrow.Barry Knapp at Barclays Capital suggested financial stocks might sell off in anticipation of “Operation Twist”, an expected move by the Fed to lower long-term interest rates, which would in turn impact on the margins banks can charge on lending.Citigroup fell 2.8 per cent to $26.93 after RBC Capital Markets reduced earnings expectations, citing “lower than expected capital markets revenues and a lower net interest margin [on lending]”.But the worst performing sectors in the S&P 500 were industrials and materials, which fell 1 and 0.7 pe cent respectively, although companies in those sectors would stand to benefit from cheaper long-term loans.CF Industries fell 6.5 per cent to $163.67 and Cliffs Natural Resources 6.4 per cent to $70.60.Defensive stocks, including utilities and healthcare companies, were the best performers.Pharmaceutical company Celgene Corporation rose 7.1 per cent to $65.56 on expected resolution of an ongoing European review of its Revlimid product.Watson Pharmaceuticals gained 3.8 per cent to close at $72.01 on the unexpected approval of its generic Lovenox drug by US regulators.Newmont Mining jumped 5.5 per cent to $69.90 after the gold miner promised to pay out higher dividends with the price of gold at historically high levels.Newmont said it would increase its gold price- linked dividend by 7.5 cents a share for gold prices above $1,700 an ounce and 2.5 cents a share for gold prices above $2,000 an ounce.Advertising group Interpublic was the best performing stock in the S&P 500, up 8.3 per cent to $8.13, in what appeared to be a reaction by statistical traders to a sell-off in the stock on Monday.The stock had fallen more than 5 per cent on Monday and it remains well below its 50-day moving average of $9.45.Apple shares hit an all-time high of $422.86 before slipping back to $413.45, a gain of 0.5 per cent.Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse said emerging markets penetration could result in extra $68bn in sales and $18 in EPS,” for Apple by 2015.“Apple is only at the cusp of unleashing its vast EM potential”, Mr Garcha said in a note to clients.Goodrich Corp, which jumped by 15.8 per cent on Monday on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation was preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer, rose another 4 per cent to $111.82 on conflicting reports of a possible sale price.In US data news, new home construction fell 5 per cent in August to 571,000, according to numbers released on Tuesday.“The further fall in housing starts in August adds to other evidence, such as the recent drop in consumer confidence and fall in mortgage approvals, suggesting that demand for new homes remains close to rock bottom,” said analysts at Capital Economics.“This goes some way to explaining why equity prices of homebuilders have recently fallen by more than the wider market.”But homebuilder stocks took the news in their stride. PulteGroup was up 2.9 per cent to $2.85. Lennar fell 1.1 per cent to $14.31, although it remains in positive territory for the week after it revealed an increase in orders in quarterly results on Monday.
83;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-09-19T21:04:56Z;Defence stocks diverge on M&A talk;;Goodrich Corp jumped 15.8 per cent to $107.60 on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation is preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer.Indications last week that Connecticut-based UTC was raising an acquisitions war chest had sent several shares in potential targets in the defence industry soaring.On Monday shares in Rockwell Collins, down 4.2 per cent to $53.87, and Textron, off 5.7 per cent at $17.57, dropped back, as UTC appeared to focus on Goodrich.Some analysts warned that those stocks could continue to see large swings, until UTC confirms an acquisition of Goodrich, but there seemed little prospect of HTC bidding for more than one company at once.“Buying Goodrich would take UTC’s net debt from 20 per cent to almost 50 per cent of market capitalisation. If it happens I don’t see them buying anyone else for a while,” Cai von Rumohr at Cowen and Company.UTC shares were up 0.1 per cent at $75.55.While defence stocks diverged, the rest of Wall Street suffered an almost uniformly dreary day. Every sector of the S&P 500 fell, as the benchmark index ended a five-day rally, and dipped back beneath 1,200 for large parts of the day.The index eventually ended the day down only 1 per cent to 1,204.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent to 11,401.01 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,612.83.“Bears have taken charge again for the moment,” said Colin Cieszynski, market strategist at CMC Markets, as investor concern about a possible Greek default mounted once again. Cieszynski said traders was now looking to a specially extended two-day Federal Reserve meeting to reverse sentiment.“The street may look to more creative responses when the decision and comments come out on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.Big banks again saw heavy selling, with Morgan Stanley, down 7.9 per cent to $15.15 and bellwether regional bank Regions Financial off 4.8 per cent to $3.81.Online job search company Monster Worldwide fell 7 per cent per cent to $8.35, as recession fears hurt recruiters.Life insurers fell after rallying strongly last week. MetLife Inc fell 4.6 per cent to $31.51 and Genworth Financial fell 4.4 per cent to $5.89, in the process giving up almost all of its gains from last week.Investors continue to fear that record low Treasury interest rates and soft equity markets will hamper life insurers’ attempts to generate returns on premiums.In another sign of faltering sentiment, Barclays Capital, an investment bank that has maintained a bullish stance on the S&P 500 throughout recent volatility, advised clients to take a more defensive approach towards the index.“Following the early August 2011 sell-off, we positioned our sector recommendations to take advantage of what worked in the August 2010 rally. [Then] early to mid-cycle cyclicals outperformed …defensives underperformed,” US equities strategist Barry Knapp wrote to clients.But Mr Knapp conceded that “the leadership in the latest rally has had a decidedly defensive tone with utilities and healthcare leading the charge”.He told clients to remain “tactically tilted to cyclicals to take advantage of our expectation for a continued rally off the lows”, but to buy defensive dividend-yielding telecom stocks, which may be less correlated to the market in a further sell-off.Netflix fell 7.4 per cent to $143.75, after announcing it will hive off its DVD mail delivery service into a separate business called Qwikster.The stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since announcing on Thursday that it expected 1m customers to cancel subscriptions because of a price rise for combined DVD and streaming services.Among the bright spots, shares in Tyco International advanced 2.4 per cent to $44.75, after the industrial conglomerate said that it would split into three separate companies to maximise value.Shares in homebuilder Lennar advanced 4.9 per cent to $14.47 after the company reported quarterly results, which showed a quarter-on-quarter increase in new orders and a growing backlog of contracts to be complete.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, saying the medical wholesalers were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.National Retail Properties, a real estate investment trust, or Reit, which invests in retail property, fell 0.5 per cent to $26.66, after FBR Capital Markets advised clients to buy the stock, citing the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy.Reits have significantly outperformed the broad market this year, as the dividends they are required to pay are attractive to yield-seeking investors.Citigroup upgraded Cardinal and McKesson Corporation shares to “Buy”, arguing saying the medical wholesalers are were well placed to benefit from the transition from branded to generic drugs over the next five years.“We estimate that the branded to generic conversion wave will lead to outsized profits and sustainable higher margins for wholesalers,” George Hill wrote in a note to clients.McKesson shares fell 0.3 per cent to $76.41, and Cardinal shares rose 0.3 per cent to $43.23.
84;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-08-31T21:20:40Z;Wall Street mixed on homebuilder strength;;Homebuilder stocks diverged after analysts made different calls on the housing market and which business models are likely to prosper.UBS analyst David Goldberg upgraded several companies and said the market for new homes had certainly bottomed.“Several valuations in the sector suggest the new homes market will get a lot worse [but] we believe fundamentals are at – or near – a trough.” Mr Goldberg said,Mr Goldberg upgraded Lennar from hold to buy, arguing the homebuilder’s financial arm, Rialto, which invests in distressed property assets, will benefit if the housing market recovers. Lennar shares were up 0.3 per cent at $14.70.Mr Goldberg also upgraded DR Horton to buy from hold as the management’s “focus on driving volumes, including emphasising [speculative] construction” gives it inventory to sell.He reduced his target price for KB Home from $11 to $7, because “management’s commitment to a build-to-order model …will probably lead to slower growth in a stable housing market”.DR Horton stocks fell 0.8 per cent to $10.52 while KB Home was down 2.2 per cent to $6.59.But other analysts did not agree that builders with aggressive strategies will outperform.“I wouldn’t be recommending their shares,” said Michael Widner, of Stifel Nicolaus. “The new homes market has been in a trough for 18 months now and we don’t know when it will turn.“Companies are adjusting to what could be a new normal of low demand for two to three years and it is prudent to do so.”Mr Widner recommended buying homebuilders with relatively little debt. “If demand stays weak, at least their balance sheets won’t be continually eroded by payments to service debt.”Mr Widner said DR Horton had one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.He also said companies like NVR, which buy options to develop land, rather than buying land outright, are less dependent on rising demand.“NVR isn’t taking a bet on whether land prices will go up or down“NVR outperformed the sector, off just 0.04 per cent on the day at $636.50. Meritage Homes, another builder that prefers options to buying land, only fell 0.1 per cent to $18.99.Mr Goldberg upgraded Meritage from sell to hold, arguing that its “land light model, which focuses on optioning lots” should protect it from “further downside”.The broad S&P index rose 0.5 per cent to 1,218.87, as the ADP Employer Services survey suggested private companies added 91,000 workers to payrolls in August. The index has now made gains for four consecutive days, the longest rally since late June.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.5 per cent to 11,613.76, putting it in positive territory for the year, for the first time since the start of August.The Nasdaq Composite index of technology stocks rose 0.1 per cent to 2,579.46.AT&T shares fell 3.9 per cent to $28.48 after the Department of Justice moved to block the company’s proposed $39bn takeover of T-Mobile USA.Shares in Verizon, the largest US mobile phone network, fell 0.4 per cent to $36.17.But Sprint, the third-largest network, which would be dwarfed by both AT&T and Verizon if the deal went through, spiked 5.9 per cent to $3.76.Industrial stocks outperformed the index by rising 0.7 per cent after mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global reported quarterly earnings per share of $1.54, 4 cents higher than expected. Its shares was up 1.3 per cent to $83.45.Materials stocks in the S&P 500 underperformed, up only 0.3 per cent, after Goldman Sachs analyst Sal Tharani cutting price targets by an average 24 per cent across the sector because of weak demand from developed economies.Mr Tharani recommended buying Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold stock on expected high demand for copper.Mr Tharani also recommended buying aluminium producer Alcoa.Alcoa shares were up 3.6 per cent to $12.80 and Freeport rose 1.1 per cent to $47.11.The biggest riser on Wednesday was electronic broker E Trade Financial, after Rich Repetto, a Sandler O’Neill analyst, told clients that daily average revenue trades, or DARTs, in the electronic retail investor market rose 40 per cent month on month in August.
85;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
86;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-06-23T20:50:49Z;Energy and financials lead losses on Wall St;;"Energy and financial stocks led the losses in a volatile session on Wall Street as traders continued to digest the downbeat assessment of the US economy given by the Federal Reserve late in the previous session and also worried about a disappointing rise in unemployment claims.The markets tumbled in early trading on these worries, but then managed to rally somewhat towards the end of the session on news reports that European leaders had reached a breakthrough on a Greek austerity plan.Still, the financial sector still saw the sharpest losses in the session, falling 1 per cent as Fifth Third Bancorp fell 2.5 per cent to $12.09 and Bank of New York Mellondeclined 2.3 per cent to $25.44. The KBW banking index was down 1 per cent.Industrial stocks also suffered from a “risk off” trade. Boeing was down 1.2 per cent to $71.25 as the S&P industrial index fell 0.3 per cent.But the worst losses came from the energy sector as oil prices fell hard after an unexpected intervention in the oil markets by the International Energy Agency.The S&P energy index was down 1.1 per cent as Schlumberger fell 0.6 per cent to $83.10 and Chevron lost 1.7 per cent to $99.36.The sell-off in risk assets began late on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered its growth forecast for the US economy and lifted its inflation expectations.The downbeat mood persisted into Thursday’s session, and the S&P 500 was down 1.5 per cent by mid-session.But the markets reversed some of their losses in late trading following a Reuters report that Greece had forged a deal with the EU and IMF on a five-year austerity plan.The S&P 500 then closed only 0.3 per cent lower at 1,283.50.Helping keep the index in negative territory, however, was data from the labour department showing that the number of unemployed Americans filing for jobless benefits rose 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 429,000 last week, which was more than had been expected by economists.Separate data from the commerce department showed that new home sales fell 2.1 per cent in May, though the news was not all bad as the median home sale price rose 2.6 per cent from April.Still, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.5 per cent to 12,053.93. The Nasdaq Composite ended the session up 0.7 per cent to 2,686.82.The Vix volatility index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, rose 7.5 per cent to 29.77.Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, argued that the losses in the session were due to a downturn in sentiment rather than any change in the fundamentals, as the economic data were mixed and the Federal Reserve did not say anything that had not been anticipated.The financial sector actually saw some strong gains in the session, led by Western Digitalwhich jumped 7.1 per cent to $37.01 after a favourable analyst report. Elsewhere, Red Hat gained 3.6 per cent to $45.27 after the software company reported better-than-
expected first-quarter earnings and raised its forecast for the year.Micron Technology was up 3.1 per cent to $8.43 while Nvidiaadded 3 per cent to $16.21. The S&P technology sector was up 0.9 per cent.The healthcare sector saw almost no losses in the session, helped by gains from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer after the companies said their blood thinner Apixaban (Eliquis) had seen some positive trial results. Bristol-Myers was up 5.7 per cent to $29.33 while Pfizer added 1.8 per cent to $20.65.In other news, Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, was up 5.5 per cent to $1.16 after reporting a smaller-than-
expected first-quarter loss driven by a decline in expenses and stronger same-store sales growth.Lennar, the homebuilder, also reported a loss that was better than analysts had expected. Its stock was up 2.3 per cent to $18.51, but it was still 1.8 per cent lower over the year.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, rose 5.3 per cent to $56.93 after its first-quarter earnings beat earnings targets and the company raised its outlook for profit growth this yearConAgra, the maker of Healthy Choice frozen meals, was down 0.2 per cent to $25.37 after its earnings fell short of expectations and investors worried about the effect of higher commodity costs."

HP reported a day earlier than planned after a leaked memo from Léo Apotheker, its new chief executive, in which he warned that the company was facing “another tough quarter”.The disappointing results affected related technology stocks. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was down 1.5 per cent to $52.28 while SanDisk lost 3.4 per cent to $46.34.The S&P technology index was down 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 closed down fractionally lower to 1,328.98 as sentiment was weighed down by data showing a sharp drop in US house construction.The number of houses built in April fell 10.6 per cent from the previous month, according to the US Department of Commerce, as oversupply sapped demand for new buildings.New building permits, a gauge of future construction, dropped 4 per cent in an indication that the sector will remain a drag on the economic recovery.This news weighed on homebuilding stocks. DR Horton, one of the largest US housebuilders, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.47 while Lennar lost 0.5 per cent to $17.50. The S&P homebuilding index declined 0.8 per cent.Data from the Federal Reserve showed an unexpected drop in manufacturing output last month. The 0.4 per cent fall was the first in 10 months and was led by an 8.9 per cent drop in autos.Industrial output remained static in the month, which was worse than the slight increase economists had been expecting. The news weakened stocks across the industrial sector. Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, was down 3.1 per cent to $102.81 while Joy Global fell 2.5 per cent to $86.19. The S&P industrial index was down 1.3 per cent, the worst performing sector on Wall Street.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6 per cent to 12,479.58 and the Nasdaq Composite flat at 2,783.21.The broader markets have been in decline since the start of May as sentiment has been weighed down by sharp commodity price swings, European sovereign debt woes and worries about the end of quantitative easing.“The path of least resistance may be to the downside near term,” said analysts at Citigroup. “With traditional summer seasonality and some significant uncertainties … it does not appear likely that equity markets can bounce higher this summer.”The retail sector was in focus after mixed results from Walmart and Home Depot.Walmart was down 0.9 per cent to $55.54 after the world’s biggest retailer reported that sales in US stores that had been open more than a year had dropped for the eighth consecutive quarter. Net income rose 3.1 per cent to $3.6bn in the quarter, which served to limit the losses on the stock.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, was up 1.1 per cent to $37.40 after it raised its earnings outlook for the year and reported a strong gain in first-quarter income.Energy and material stocks lost ground as commodity prices softened.Materials was one of the worst performing sectors.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, fell 2.8 per cent to $16.45 and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, lost 1.1 per cent to $46.83. The S&P materials index was 1.1 per cent lower.In the energy sector, Schlumberger, the oilfield services company, declined 0.2 per cent to $82.06. Cameron lost 2.3 per cent to $47.77. The S&P energy index was down 0.2 per cent.The financial sector was one of the few to gain in the session, led by Wells Fargo, which put on 3.2 per cent to $28.75.The S&P financial index added 0.7 per cent.
88;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-05-09T21:50:25Z;Wall St gains muted by eurozone debt fears;;Dollar Thrifty Automotive surged after Hertz Global offered to buy the car rental company, while the wider markets advanced after deal activity and a rise in commodities outweighed concerns over the financial health of the eurozone.Dollar Thrifty bounced 13.8 per cent to $79.27 after Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for its smaller rival.The offer is a 24 per cent premium over a rival offer made by Avis Budget last September, and is 17 per cent higher than the 60-day average share price.The move comes eight months after Hertz supposedly bowed out of a battle to buy Dollar Thrifty, saying it would not seek to match a higher offer by Avis. Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent. The sector is 80 per cent lower than its pre-crisis peak.In other news, McDonald’s advanced 0.8 per cent to $79.31 after reporting that its same-store sales had risen 6 per cent in April, the biggest monthly increase since October.Tyson Foods was down 5.9 per cent to $17.77 after the world’s largest meat producer reported flat second-quarter earnings, as higher feed costs offset improving demand and higher meat prices.
89;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-03-29T21:24:28Z;US stocks shrug off poor economic data;;Homebuilders lost ground following weak US housing data but the wider markets were resilient as traders were reluctant to take money off the table ahead of non-farm payroll numbers on Friday.DR Horton, the second-largest US housebuilder, was down 1.7 per cent to $11.95 after data showed that US house prices were continuing to spiral downwards.The Case-Shiller composite index showed prices had fallen 3.3 per cent in January on a year-to-year basis, which was worse than expected and followed on from a 2.4 per cent decline in December.Shares in Lennar, another homebuilder, were down 3.5 per cent to $19.05, also weighed on by news that the company’s new home orders had fallen 12 per cent in the first quarter. The S&P homebuilding index was down 1.8 per cent.But the wider markets ticked higher as traders remained optimistic about crucial economic numbers to be released later this week.“Traders are wondering if they really want to be out of this market when the non-farm payroll number comes out on Friday,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.The S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,319.44, also shrugging off separate data from the Conference Board showing that consumer confidence had fallen in March. The index was down from 72.4 in February to 63.4.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7 per cent to 12,278.79, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1 per cent to 2,756.89.Retail stocks saw some of the biggest gains in the session led by Home Depot after the home improvement retailer announced plans to issue $2bn of debt and buy back $1bn of stock. Shares in the company were up 2.9 per cent to $37.70.Elsewhere in the sector, Amazon.com was up 3.1 per cent to $174.62 after unveiling a “cloud” service that would allows users to store their digital music online and play it on any computer or Android device.Google, which developed and operates the Android platform, was up 1.1 per cent to $581.73.Phillips-Van Heusen, the fashion group that owns Calvin Klein, saw gains after reporting that its fourth-quarter profits had nearly doubled to $52.2m and that adjusted earnings had also beaten market expectations. The stock was up 8.4 per cent to $65.22. The S&P retail sector was up 1.1 per cent.Other winners in the session were oilfield service stocks, which continued to gain on hopes that increased production in Saudi Arabia would lead to more business.Schlumberger was up 4.4 per cent to $94.37, adding to the 4.1 per cent gains in the previous session, while Halliburton put on 2.3 per cent to $49 following 4 per cent gains on Monday.Advances in Halliburton were limited by a warning from the group that its earnings would be “severely” affected by the disruptions in north Africa and the Middle East and would shave an estimated 3-4 cents per share from profits. The oilfield services company also said that a further 5-8 cents per share in earnings would be lost because of weather related issues.Elsewhere in the energy sector, General Electric agreed to buy Converteam, a privately owned maker of electrification equipment, for about $3.2bn. Shares in GE were up 0.6 per cent to $19.86.The industrial group has now spent $11bn in the last six months on a string of energy companies including Dresser, Wellstream Holdings and the well support unit of John Wood Group.For-profit education companies were dragged down after Apollo Group, the company that owns the University of Phoenix, reported a second-quarter loss and announced that new enrolment had fallen by 45 per cent.Shares in Apollo were down 4.3 per cent to $40.55 as the company also forecast that fiscal 2012 revenue would be no more than $4.25bn, missing the average analyst estimate of $4.55bn.Elsewhere in the sector Corinthian Colleges fell 3.5 per cent to $4.40 while Strayer Education lost 5 per cent to $127.06. DeVry declined 1 per cent to $54.41.Hertz Global lost ground after announcing that its three largest shareholders were selling 50m shares in the car rental group. Hertz also forecast that its first-quarter revenue would rise, but that it would be hurt by the storms in January and February. The stock was down 5.4 per cent to $15.40.
90;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-03-23T14:26:03Z;Financials weigh on Wall Street;;Bank of America lost ground after announcing that the Federal Reserve had “objected” to its planned dividend increase, while the wider markets edged lower for another day as oil prices tipped over $105 a barrel.The bank said it had submitted a plan to the Fed for a “modest increase” in its dividend for the second half of 2011 but that they had “objected to the proposed increase in capital distributions”. Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.
91;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-03-16T21:34:12Z;Wall Street hit by overseas tensions;;Concern over the burgeoning nuclear crisis in Japan and heightened tensions in Bahrain led Wall Street lower for its third consecutive session, with technology and industrial stocks suffering from the sharpest losses.The markets began the day without much direction, but news that Günther Oettinger, the European Union energy chief, had said that the nuclear situation in Japan was “effectively out of control” and that there could be “catastrophic events within hours” led the S&P 500 to tumble over 1.6 per cent within minutes before lunch on Wall Street.These fears left the S&P index down 2 per cent to 1,256.88 at the close, adding to the 1.1 per cent fall on Tuesday and bringing the total losses for the week so far to 3.6 per cent. The index is on track for the heaviest weekly decline in seven months.The S&P 500 index has fallen 6.4 per cent since its mid-February highs, with the feared effects of the Japanese disaster adding to concerns over oil supplies from the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The benchmark index is down 0.1 per cent this year, the first time it has strayed into negative territory.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, jumped up 19.4 per cent to an eight-month high on the comments by the EU energy chief.The Vix index is now up 77.1 per cent from its mid-February lows before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East.IBM and Apple saw some of the sharpest losses in the session due to supply worries following the earthquake in Japan and analysts downgrades on both stocks.Analysts at Citigroup said that one of the biggest risks to hardware companies such as IBM and Apple was supply constraints following the disaster in Japan. These constraints, it said, “could be meaningfully disruptive during the next couple of quarters”.“Apple could be the most challenged out of all the companies in our hardware universe,” said the note. “Apple derives roughly 8 per cent of the total operating income from Japan, but more importantly, the already tight supply of iPhones and iPads could get much worse.”Apple was down 4.5 per cent to $330.01, also weighed down by news that JMP Securities had lowered its rating on the stock to “market perform” from “outperform”. IBM fell 3.8 per cent to $153, also suffering from a downgrade.Elsewhere in the sector Qualcomm, a leading mobile phone chipmaker, was down 4.7 per cent to $50.50 while SanDisk, which makes flash memory cards, lost 3.7 per cent to $42.09.The S&P information technology sector fell 2.7 per cent.Many strategists were still saying that the recent losses could present a buying opportunity. Robert Sluymer at RBC Capital Markets said the current pullback will continue to “present timely long-side entry points on a wide range of names over the coming days and weeks.”Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said that this was a good time to buy depressed stocks, but also to hedge against risk due to the upturn in volatility.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2 per cent to 11,613.30 with all 30 components losing ground, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.9 per cent lower to 2,616.82.Looking at industrial stocks, General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the earthquake-stricken nuclear plant in Japan, was down 3.4 per cent to $18.95 adding to the 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.Elsewhere 3M was 2.2 per cent lower to $87.55 while Honeywell declined 2.2 per cent to $54.33. The S&P industrial sector dropped by 2 per cent.Housing stocks lost ground after data showing that home construction had tumbled in February to its lowest level in nearly two years.The number of housing starts fell 22.5 per cent from the previous month to 479,000 in a further indication of weakness in the US housing market.Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, was down 2.2 per cent to $20.41 while Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilder, fell 2.9 per cent to $19.12.“While February’s result may overstate the case somewhat, the underlying trend of single-family housing starts shows no signs of improving in a significant manner anytime soon,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Coal mining stocks were some of the few to see gains in the session on hopes that a backlash against nuclear energy would spur on demand for coal.Peabody Energy was up 3.9 per cent to $67.67 while Consol Energy added 1.7 per cent to $52.38.
92;LEN;Lennar Corp;2011-01-11T21:51:20Z;US stocks up on strong earnings;;US equities rose for the first time in four sessions, lifted by strong corporate results as the earnings season kicked off with a forecast-beating performance from Alcoa, the world’s largest aluminium producer.Healthy figures from the housebuilding, education and retail sectors also served to lift sentiment.Alcoa, the first of the Dow components to report this year, posted its strongest quarterly results in two years. The figures showed that underlying earnings, excluding one-off items, were 21 cents per share, beating the consensus forecast of 19 cents per share.Its shares, up 25.7 per cent since the start of December, fell 1.2 per cent to $16.30 on the news, as some traders used the news to book profits.The beginning of the results season also saw Apollo Group, the US education company that owns the University of Phoenix, gain 13.5 per cent to $40.74 after also posting forecast-beating first-quarter earnings. These gains in the stock followed a sharp 5.5 per cent loss in the previous session after it reported that new student enrolment had fallen by 42.4 per cent at the University of Phoenix.“Major operational and regulatory challenges remain, but we continue to rate the stock overweight as we see the risk/reward as favourable,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a note following the results.The news from Apollo, a bellwether for the education sector, helped lift related stocks. Career Education was up 7.5 per cent to $20.01 while Corinthian Colleges gained 1.5 per cent to $4.65.In the retail sector, Sears Holdings, the department store chain, jumped 6.4 per cent to $75.03 after forecasting that its fourth-quarter profit would be well ahead of analysts’ expectations.It said profit, excluding store closures, restructuring and other items, will be between $3.39 and $4.12 per share compared with the $3.05 forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The news helped Walmart rise 1 per cent to $54.29 and Costco 0.8 per cent to $71.07.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher to 1,274.48, also lifted by news that Japan had committed to buy eurozone bonds to help reduce borrowing costs for vulnerable nations. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,716.83, a three-year high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 to 11,671.88.The Dow was helped particularly by gains from Hewlett-Packard, up 1.3 per cent to $45.43 after UBS raised its rating on the stock.Limiting gains on the US indices were losses from technology stocks AT&T and Verizon Wireless. AT&T fell 1.5 per cent to $27.91 after rival Verizon Wireless said that it would begin selling a version of Apple’s iPhone smartphone next month.AT&T had previously been the only network in the US on which the iPhone was available. The stock had lost 6.9 per cent in the past four sessions in expectation of the news. Verizon fell after the announcement, losing 1.6 per cent to $35.36. Overall, the S&P telecommunications index was down 1.5 per cent to 126.50 – one of the few indices to lose ground.Also in the technology sector, Advanced Micro Devices, which makes microchips and microprocessors, was down 9 per cent to $8.36 after announcing late on Monday that Dirk Meyer, chief executive, had resigned. Thomas Seifert, chief financial officer, was named as interim chief executive officer.In other results news, Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilder, posted earnings of 17 cents per share compared with the 6 cents predicted by analysts polled by FactSet Research. The results sent shares in the company up 7.1 per cent to $20.24.Energy stocks rose in the session as the US Energy Information Administration forecasted that crude oil would average at $93 a barrel this year.Halliburton, the second biggest oilfield services company in the world, was up 3.2 per cent to $39.38 while the S&P energy index rose 1.6 per cent to 515.12.Most of the stocks that were embroiled in deal activity in the previous session lost ground.Shares in IGate continued to fall back after the IT outsourcer announced that it was buying India’s Patni Computer Systems. The stock fell 9.9 per cent to $15.44.This year has seen the busiest start for mergers and acquisitions activity for a decade with deals worth $34bn announced globally on Sunday and Monday and deal volumes so far in 2011 at $83bn, up from $67bn in the same period last year.
93;LEN;Lennar Corp;2010-12-28T22:37:23Z;US stocks suffer on low volumes;;Positive analyst ratings pushed up shares in General Motors, while the rest of the market was almost flat despite weaker-than-expected economic data.General Motors gained 2.1 per cent to $35.32 after several analysts initiated coverage of the recently relisted carmaker. Analysts said the company should continue to improve its balance sheet and holds a leading emerging markets presence in Brazil and China that is not fully valued.“We believe the stock offers considerable medium-term product opportunity, a sound balance sheet that will delever[age] significantly further by 2013, and high exposure to the fastest-growing auto regions,” said Himanshu Patel, an analyst at JPMorgan.“[But this is] balanced by still evident product/brand weaknesses in North America and Europe, an untested management, and only a few quarters of clean financials.”JPMorgan, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley rated the stock “overweight” and Citigroup and Bank of America analysts called the shares a “buy”.Morgan Stanley analysts gave the company a $50 price target, while Barclays estimated its shares could reach $42 and JPMorgan analysts were in the middle with a $44 price target.Shares in General Motors have risen 3.3 per cent since it listed in the middle of November. The initial public offering, which allowed the US government to reduce its stake in the bailed-out carmaker, was priced above the original range.Rival carmaker Ford fell 0.8 per cent to $16.73. Christopher Ceraso, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said General Motors traded at a “deep discount” to Ford.Analysts at Credit Suisse also expect stocks in car retailers to do well next year in part because there are fewer dealers, tight inventories and lower costs.The analysts started coverage on AutoNation and Lithia Motors with an “outperform” rating. Shares in AutoNation nudged down 0.2 per cent to $28.02 but Lithia Motors fell 0.3 per cent to $14.12.The wider indices suffered from low volumes because of the holiday season.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,258.55 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average was higher by 0.2 per cent to close at 11,575.99 while the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,662.88.“The S&P 500 has risen about 9 per cent since the end of the first quarter, while our bottom-up fair value for the index has only risen about 2 per cent to 1,340,” said Pat Dorsey, director of equity research at Morningstar.“So, while we still think the broad market is modestly undervalued, we’re certainly finding fewer truly cheap stocks.”Consumer confidence in the US fell unexpectedly in December as shoppers were shaken by fears about unemployment.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index fell 0.2 per cent, the most in the wider index.The report from the Conference Board contradicts an earlier release by the University of Michigan, and figures showing a rise in retail sales during the holiday shopping season.“Actions speak louder than words,” said Matthew Kaufler, portfolio manager at Federated Investors.“I think the confidence and strength we are seeing are being tempered by a still very soft housing market and the impact on consumers’ psychology of unemployment.”A separate report released before the opening bell showed house prices fell more than expected in October. The S&P/Case-Shiller index said property values fell 0.8 per cent year-on-year when analysts had forecast a drop of 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 homebuilders’ index lost 1.9 per cent, with Lennar down 1 per cent to $18.40 and DR Horton declining by 3 per cent to $11.80.“From a longer-term perspective, it is important to keep in mind that in the seven years leading up to the peak in July 2006, the non-seasonally adjusted national 20-city home price index jumped by 155 per cent [126 index points],” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.“So far, this index has dropped by 30 per cent [61 index points] in the 52 months since the peak.”
94;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Economic data fail to move US markets;;A slew of economic data and positive news from the retail sector failed to lift markets as traders stuck to positions ahead of the Christmas holiday.Among the positive data, the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week fell slightly to 420,000 and continuing claims were also lower.Orders for durable goods excluding the volatile transportation sector rose by more than expected in November and recorded a gain of 2.8 per cent – the largest in eight months.But total orders disappointed, dragged down by fewer requests for civilian aircraft and motor vehicles.The S&P 500 industrials index edged lower by 0.2 per cent with earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar losing 0.1 per cent to $94.45 and Deere & Company, which manufactures farm tools, down 0.4 per cent to $83.58.But Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, nudged 0.7 per cent higher to $65.06.“The biggest ‘takeaway’ from today’s report comes from the core capital goods category, which was quite healthy,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.“Along with an upward revision to the prior month, this suggests a stronger pace of business spending in the fourth-quarter GDP report. This, in turn, bolsters the case for fourth-quarter GDP to break 3 per cent with a possibility of approaching 3.5 per cent.”The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was down 0.4 per cent, even though another report showed that the US consumer spent more in November as their income rose by slightly more than expected. “The biggest surprise was the upward revision to October consumer spending,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global. “That’s the opposite of what we saw [on Wednesday] with the third-quarter GDP report and means it looks like consumer spending this quarter could rise by more than 4 per cent.”A separate report on consumer sentiment showed that shoppers were at their most positive since June.Clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch added 0.7 per cent to $57.34 while Big Lots climbed 1.2 per cent to $30.27 and GameStop gained 2.4 per cent to $22.22.Elsewhere in retail, Jo-Ann Stores soared 31.9 per cent to $60.19 after the fabric store operator agreed to be acquired by an affiliate of Leonard Green & Partners. The deal, worth $1.6bn, or $61 a share, is at a 34 per cent premium to its closing price on Wednesday.Leonard Green, a private equity firm, bought the J Crew clothing chain with TPG Capital for about $3bn just last month.Also in the sector, home furnishings retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond gained 5.1 per cent to $50.10 after it forecast full-year earnings above average analyst estimates and beat expectations in its third quarter. The chain also announced a $2bn share buy-back plan.The company said many US consumers unable to move because of problems in the housing and credit markets were happy to spend on renovations. Last week, rival Pier 1 also reported strong earnings. The wider indices were mixed in low volumes.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,256.77, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,573.49 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,665.60.Thomas Lee, equity strategist at JPMorgan, said the market could hit 1,300 by the end of 2010. “Into year-end . . . the dominant driver, in our view, will be the window dressing effect, the tendency of markets to drift higher in the final two weeks of the year [and there’s an] even greater effect when quarter-to-date performance was positive,” he said.Other economic data included new home sales and prices, which edged up in November, but the S&P 500 homebuilders index lost 3.5 per cent with Lennar down by 4.2 per cent to $18.17.In other deal news, Sonic Solutions shot up 28.7 per cent to $14.42 after the operator of an online video service agreed to be bought by Rovi Corp. The deal, worth $720m, or $14.17 a share, is at a premium of 26 per cent to the last closing price. Shares in Rovi lost 1.9 per cent to $57.26, even though it said the deal would add 5 to earnings in 2011.

Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline
for resolving a dispute
over the assets.The biggest truckload carrier in North America, Swift Transportation, edged up 0.9 per cent to $11.10 in its first day of trading.

Sales volume rose but the company cut prices
to attract cash-conscious
shoppers.Starbucks added 2.3 per cent to $32.59 after analysts at Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of the coffee chain by placing it on their “conviction buy” list, saying it has not yet saturated the US market.They gave the stock a $44 price target, 38 per cent higher than the stock’s previous closing price.Meanwhile, Transocean, which fell on Wednesday after it was among the companies that the US government sued over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, dropped further and was down 3.6 per cent to $69.31 after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut the oil rig owner from “overweight” to “equal weight”."

The shares rose 2.2 per cent to $18.87.Investors shrugged off a larger-than-expected rise in initial jobless claims. The data came after a strong report last week and the less volatile four-week moving average fell to its lowest level since August 2008.“What matters is that the jump in claims this week still leaves them below the bottom of this year’s range, 445,000 to 475,000,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at HFE Economics.He added: “If [this] continues, we should expect
to see better payroll numbers over the next few months”.After a run-up in retail stocks before Black Friday kicked off the holiday shopping season, investors finally got a peek at till receipts as retailers reported same-store sales for November.The first reports showed that shoppers bought more for themselves and promotions were less aggressive.

Supervalu, the grocery store operator, added 2.7 per cent to $9.04, department store owner Macy’s gained 1 per cent to $25.68 and clothing retailer Gap advanced 3.1 per cent to $21.36.But the housing market remained grim. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of house prices in 20 cities showed US house prices fell for the third month running in September.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said 19 of the 20 cities showed a decline in prices for the month and he expected further declines before the end of the year.However the S&P 500 homebuilders index was up 1.2 per cent with Lennar gaining 1.3 per cent to $15.19 and DR Horton jumping 1.7 per cent to $10.04.In financials, Bank of America fell 3.2 per cent to $10.95 just before the close as investors speculated the bank could be at the centre of a future Wikileaks document release.Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, said in an interview with Forbes that his group plans to release tens of thousands of documents from a major US bank but would not identify the bank. In an interview last year with Computerworld, Mr Assange said he had obtained data from Bank of America.Bank of America said it is aware of WikiLeak’s claims but has not been contacted by the group or seen proof that it possesses any of the bank’s information.Shares in Goldman Sachswere down 1.8 per cent to $156.14 and Morgan Stanleylost 1.9 per cent to $24.46.The technology sector fell the most in the wider indices, down 1.4 per cent.Google dropped 4.5 per cent to $555.71 as the European Union said it had opened a full investigation after allegations from smaller online search providers that the US company had abused its dominant market position. There was also continued speculation that Google would bid for the Groupon discount website and it was reported that a possible offer could be between $5bn and $6bn.Comcast lost 0.9 per cent to $20.04 after it found itself at the centre of a dispute about how it handles video traffic on the internet as US regulators work to prepare “net neutrality” rules.The cable company was accused late on Monday of asking for fees for the first time in return for carrying internet movies and other traffic for Level 3, which provides streaming services.

It was reported this month that the warehouse operator had hired Morgan Stanley to run an auction for the company and explore strategic alternatives. It shares, which have risen 45 per cent so far this year, rose 3 per cent to $47.54.Strong retail earnings and upbeat outlooks were overshadowed on Tuesday by concerns about eurozone sovereign debt and potential inflation risk in China.But investors paused for thought after Tuesday’s sell-off and the S&P 500 closed up a fraction at 1,178.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent lower at 11,007.88 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,476.01.The gains were limited by two weak reports on the US economy.Core consumer prices – excluding food and energy prices – rose less than expected in October and the year-on-year increase was the smallest on record. The price of recreation, education and apparel dropped during the month.“While we’ve been on the sceptical side on the Fed’s new asset plan [quantitative easing mark two] these sorts of numbers only help their defence,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.But he added that low inflation that helped retailers issue positive outlooks.“Inflation is pretty tame which is helping real spending power as wage income has been accelerating as the labour market is gradually improving,” he said.Construction began on fewer houses than forecast in October, a separate report showed, pushing the S&P 500 homebuilder index down by 2.4 per cent.Lennar lost 1.7 per cent to $15.50 and DR Horton dropped 3.1 per cent to $10.68.Elsewhere, NetApp declined sharply in the late afternoon when its results were released before the closing bell.The maker of storage equipment sunk 6.5 per cent to $49.25, and was followed lower by other data storage companies, when it said that there had been a slowdown in computer spending by corporations.Financials led the fallers as the Federal Reserve issued guidelines on how it will decide in banks can increase dividends and buybacks.

Financials and consumer discretionary stocks led the risers.The benchmark index has been stuck in a trading range of 1,040 to 1,130 since mid-May and despite hovering near the top of the range all last week, it only finally broke out on Monday.Investors speculated that the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee could take action to spur the economic recovery at its meeting on Tuesday afternoon.But Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, said: “The makers of domestic monetary policy are unlikely to undertake a second round of quantitative easing at the conclusion of their upcoming deliberations.“A slightly firmer tone in the latest ISM [manufacturing data], payroll employment and retail sales reports are likely to ease concerns among policymakers, allowing them to maintain their wait-and-see approach.”He added that the chance of expansion is also limited because some hawks on the committee are concerned about the risk of inflation.Investors shrugged off a worse than expected reading on the monthly housing market index.Confidence among US homebuilders remained steady at 13, a one-year low. Economists had forecast a rise to 14 in September.Instead, markets focused on Lennar, the housebuilder, which beat analysts’ expectations when it announced third-quarter results before the opening bell.Wider margins on house sales and increasing revenue at its distressed investing unit lifted earnings per share to 16 cents, above
the average estimate of 6 cents.However, the results included a rise in orders just before the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit and the company said orders fell 15 per cent after the credit was removed. Lennar jumped 8.2 per cent to $15.14.Rival DR Horton also advanced, up 4.2 per cent to $11.05 and the broader S&P 500 homebuilders index gained 5.6 per cent.Elsewhere, deals dominated the market with Netezza jumping 14.9 per cent to $28.27 after IBM agreed to buy the maker of analytics technology and data storage appliances.The deal, worth about $1.7bn or $27 a share in cash, is at a 9.8 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price.Shares in IBM, which has said it plans to spend about $20bn on acquisitions in the next five years, gained 1.2 per cent to $131.79.Teradata, a company that provides similar services to Netezza, advanced 7.5 per cent to $37.04.

100;LEN;Lennar Corp;2010-09-20T14:00:18Z;US homebuilder outlook remains gloomy;;The struggling US housing market continued to damp the confidence of homebuilders, as high rates of foreclosure and unemployment have weakened demand for new homes.The National Association of Homebuilders said on Monday that its index of homebuilder sentiment remained stuck at 13 in September. That was unchanged from the month before when it dipped to the lowest level since March 2009.“Builders haven’t seen any reason for improved optimism in market conditions over the past month,” said Bob Jones, NAHB chairman. “If anything, consumer uncertainty has increased, and builders feel their hands are tied until potential home buyers feel more secure about the job market and economy.”Sales conditions and expectations for the next six months were stuck at a low level in September and buyer traffic slowed.The troubles facing homebuilders were underlined on Monday by the results of Lennar, one of the biggest US builders. Although Lennar swung to a profit in its third quarter, new orders for homes fell 15 per cent, as appetite for new housing stalled after the expiration of the government’s first-time homebuyer tax credit.“The biggest problems restraining the housing outlook are a wall of supply from foreclosed homes that will at best prevent home prices from rising and will quite possibly lead them to decline further, and a weak employment picture which is keeping housing demand subdued,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, of BNP Paribas. “Excess supply will continue to rob demand from the new home market weighing on residential investment.”Last week RealtyTrac said that foreclosure activity in August rose 4 per cent, adding to pressure on the market. With unemployment hovering near a 26-year high, foreclosures are expected to mount in the coming months.Homebuilder confidence fell in the north-east and Midwest, was flat in the west and ticked up in the south.On Tuesday, government figures are expected to show that housing starts rose modestly in August.

In September, the reading was minus 0.7, showing industrial activity in the region contracted.The markets were unnerved in August when the index fell to minus 7.7. Shares fell after the September release, but quickly rebounded.“I would have thought there would be a little bit more of a negative reaction … with the negative Philly Fed plus FedEx which lowered its fiscal second-quarter outlook,” said Barbara Marcin, portfolio manager at GAMCO Investors.“But there’s now a lot of negativity baked in so in a way it doesn’t surprise even if something is more negative than consensus.”In separate releases, producer prices rose slightly more than expected and the current account deficit, a measure of international trade, was slightly less than economists had forecast.Investors looking for indicators of the pace of economic growth were disappointed by FedEx earnings, even though its quarterly profit doubled because of increased demand for package delivery services.Shares in FedEx sank 3.8 per cent to $82.72 after the first-quarter profit of $1.20 per share just missed the average estimate of $1.21 per share, and the group, often seen as a bellwether for global trade, said that it would cut 1,700 jobs.It forecast a second-quarter profit below analyst projections, but raised its forecast for 2011 for the second time. Excluding the cost of merging some ground operations, full-year earnings should be between $4.80 and $5.25 per share.Both Research in Motion and Oracle rose in after hours trading after releasing their results.Research in Motion, the maker of BlackBerry, was in focus because the stock has suffered in the past couple of months, after countries from Abu Dhabi to India said they were considering restricting use of the handset because of security concerns.

But he said there were some indications that the job situations could be improving.“Both the ISM manufacturing and services figures went up in August, we also had the employment component of the small business index, which went up, and even this morning the Empire [State] employment component went up.”Metal producers, which fell last week on the back of weak economic data from China, rebounded as metal prices rose again.Iron ore producer Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 3.4 per cent to $60.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold rose 0.8 per cent to $70.63 and AK Steelwas up 1.1 per cent to $13.21.The S&P 500 information technology index rebounded after being dragged down last week by Cisco’s cautious outlook.

That comes after an amendment to the financial reform package, introduced late last week, to allow the Federal Reserve to more closely regulate debit card fees. A top Discover Card executive described the changes as “volcanic”.Visa dipped 4.4 per cent, to $71.44. MasterCard fell 4.3 per cent to $201.85. Both were among the highest-volume traded in the session.American Express and Discover, both lenders to consumers through credit cards, were also lower. Amex dipped 1 per cent to $40.85, and Discover fell 2.5 per cen to $13.86.The worst individual performer of the day was also in financial technology, Fidelity National Information Services.

Citigroup and Bank of America were barely changed, at $3.86 and $16.32, respectivelyRegional lenders BB&T and US Bancorp were downgraded by analysts at Deutsche Bank from “buy” to “hold”. BB&T shares fell 3 per cent to $32.73, and US Bancorp fell 3.8 per cent to $24.65.Meanwhile, the US producer price index fell 0.1 per cent in April from March, thanks in large part to a 2.7 per cent decline in petrol prices.However, passenger car prices gained 0.6 per cent, and household appliances rose 1.9 per cent, suggesting an uptick in demand due to stronger economic activity.After the report, shares in industrial bellwethers Alcoa and Caterpillar reversed losses from Monday, with the global metals group adding 0.2 per cent to $12.12, while the supplier of construction and farming equipment rose to $64.37, a jump of 1 per cent. 3M, a diversified industrial, also added 1 per cent to $85.50.Walmart led risers in the Dow, adding 2.7 per cent to $54.15 after net sales rose 1.1 per cent over the first quarter a year ago, topping analysts’ expectations. However, it cited “soft customer traffic” and said comparable store sales fell 1.4 per cent on a year-over-year basis.Following that, discount retailers generally were weaker. Target slipped 2.3 per cent to $54.59, and TJX, the apparel chain, dropped 3.2 per cent to $43.80. Luxury goods did not fare much better.Retail chain Saks dipped 1.1 per cent to $9.24 in spite of quarterly earnings jumping to $19m from a loss in the first quarter last year.

It did not want to excite the markets and it didn’t. Investors have had enough excitement this week with what’s going on in Greece and Spain, and the Goldman hearings.”The main indices moved slightly higher in reaction to the announcement.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 1,191.36, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 11,045.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 2,471.73.Dow Chemical was up 5.9 per cent to $31.83 as the largest US chemicals producer said its first-quarter profit was better than expected.Net profit, excluding non-recurring items, was 43 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 30 cent per share.JetBlue slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.77 as the domestic airline posted a $1m first-quarter loss while analysts expected a profit, as higher fuel costs hit margins.Net losses were 1 cent per share. The average analyst estimate was for a 3 cent profit. It breaks a run of four straight profitable quarters for the airline.Dell, the maker of personal computers, fell 0.1 per cent to $16.51 as the stock was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral” at UBS with a target price of $17.50 per share.US-listed shares in Barrick Gold, a Canada-based bullion producer, rose 3.7 per cent to $42.17 as the company reported a first-quarter profit that more than doubled from a year ago, boosted by rising bullion prices and high demand.Net profit excluding non-recurring items was 75 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 63 cent per share. Revenues rose 44 per cent to $2.6bn.Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co lost 1.6 per cent to $13.82 even after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter results with rising revenues across all regions.Excluding non-recurring items, the tyre maker paid 18 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 2 cents per share. The company warned, however, that raw materials costs would be a challenge this year.AOL retreated 14.5 per cent to $23.96 as the company posted weak first-quarter results, hurt by falling advertising revenues. Net profit was 32 cents per share, down from 78 cents a year earlier.The company also said it had agreed to sell ICQ, an instant messaging service operating in Russia, Germany, the Czech Republic and Israel, to Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian internet company, for $188m.As the markets reflected on Tuesday’s testimony by Goldman Sachs’ executives in front of Congress, the bank’s stock rose 2.6 per cent to $157.01.Banks were higher across the board.Citigroup gained 2.5 per cent to $4.45, Bank of America rose 1.8 per cent to $17.78 and JPMorgan rallied 2.5 per cent to $43.46.Masco, which distributes and installs home improvement products, was one of the session’s best performers as the stock climbed 5.3 per cent to $16.45 on an upgrade from “outperform” to “strong buy” at Raymond James Financial.Homebuilders were also higher as Pulte gained 1.8 per cent to $12.86, DR Horton added 1.6 per cent to $13.62 and Lennar rose 2.2 per cent to $19.35.The Russell 2000, an index of small caps, was 0.2 per cent higher to 722.39.It is up 15.8 per cent since the start of the year, easily outperforming the S&P 500 index that has risen 6.8 per cent in the same period.Wyndham Worldwide, which owns franchise rights to Days Inn and other hotels, declined 1.5 per cent to $26.22 in spite of raising its revenue and earnings forecasts for the full year, citing a strengthening domestic lodging industry.The company has earned 35 cents per share in the first quarter, beating average estimates of 30 cents.

A lot of these mortgages are going delinquent. It’s one area I find troubling, which is why we have a low exposure to financial stocks.”However, Mr Ward regards the broader economic recovery as “very resilient”.At the close, the S&P 500 was down .06 per cent to 1,167.72, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.5 per cent to 10,836.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,398.76.One bright sport for the US housing market was Lennar Corp, the third-
largest US housebuilder by revenue, which rallied 3.7 per cent to $17.69 after reporting better quarterly earnings than were expected. Its loss was significantly lower than expected at 4 cents a share versus consensus analyst expectations of a 30 cents a share loss and better than its 98 cents a share loss last year.Gross margins surged to 19.2 per cent from 6.5 per cent a year earlier as the company cut incentives for potential buyers.“Virtually every metric outperformed our expectation,” wrote Stephen East, analyst at Ticonderoga in a client note. “No matter how one cuts it, this was a strong report.”Adobe Systems was one of the session’s biggest risers, advancing 3.7 per cent to $36.51 as the world’s leading graphic design maker forecast significantly stronger second-quarter sales than analysts were expecting.The company said it would launch a new version of its most profitable software – Creative Suite, which comprises design software such as Photoshop – on April 12.Market analysts expect Adobe profit from pent-up demand for the product as many customers avoided upgrading to the current version during the recession.Two tech stocks staged successful debuts, raising hopes for the still struggling initial public offerings market. MaxLinear, a maker of broadband chips, rallied 33.6 per cent above its initial listing price to $18.70 while Calix Networks, a telecoms equipment company, surged 16.2 per cent to $15.10.The oil and gas sector was broadly lower as the price of crude oil fell. Chevron lost 1.1 per cent to $73.93 while ExxonMobil retreated 0.7 per cent to $66.50.ConocoPhillips, the third- largest US oil company by market share, bucked the trend to close flat at $52.53 as the company announced plans to sell half of its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, in the next two years.Coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy added 1.9 per cent to $45.70 as the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” by John Bridges, an analyst at JPMorgan, with a nine-month target price of $53 a share.AK Steel gained 0.7 per cent to $23.33 after the steelmaker said it would record a non-cash charge of about $31m resulting from the US healthcare reform legislation. It is one of the first companies to take such a step following the passage of the bill on Sunday.MF Global rose 10.4 per cent to $8.08 as Jon Corzine, former New Jersey governor who ran Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, was appointed chief executive of the New York-based futures and options broker.General Mills slipped 1.9 per cent to $72.18 despite the food conglomerate posting solid quarterly earnings, aided by new product sales, a focus on cost-cutting and lower input costs.Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee shop chain, fell 0.5 per cent to $25.29 after announcing a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, its first since going public in 1992."
113;LEN;Lennar Corp;2010-02-24T21:31:26Z;Wall St comforted by rate outlook;;US equities moved higher on Wednesday as the markets were comforted by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s comments to Congress that the US economy is in a “nascent” recovery that requires interest rates to be kept low to encourage demand by consumers and companies.“The markets are breathing a sigh of relief that the recent rise in the discount rate will not lead to significant tightening in the near future,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research.He said Mr Bernanke is keen to give the jittery markets plenty of visibility on policy decisions. “He wants any move the Fed makes to be a non-event.”The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up to 1,105.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 10,374.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent higher at 2,235.90.Shares in homebuilders fell as figures showed that sales of new homes in the US fell unexpectedly in January to the lowest levels on record.Only 309,000 new homes were sold in January, while inventories remain high.DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $12.34, Pulte Homes declined 1.5 per cent to $10.81 and Lennar Corp lost 0.1 per cent to $16.27.Shares in Citigroup were up 3 per cent to $3.45.

The stock’s target price was cut by S&P Equity from $23 to $19 and rated “hold”.Rival Jackson Hewitt Tax Service was also down 3.7 per cent to $2.36.Shares in BGC Partners, a broker focused on over-the-counter trading, gained 17.8 per cent to $5.03 after forecasting higher first-quarter earnings than analysts had expected.Tobacco group Altria gained 1.5 per cent to $20.26 on news that it had raised its regular quarterly dividend by 2.9 per cent.In the food and restaurant sector, Papa John‘s, a leading pizza maker, rose 7.2 per cent to $24.88, the most in two months, as the company posted fourth-quarter earnings that comfortably beat average analyst estimates.Rival Domino’s Pizza was also up by 2.4 per cent to $12.43, continuing its steady rise since the start of the year.Restaurant chain operator Darden Restaurants gained 0.9 per cent to $40.99 as the stock’s target price was raised by analysts at Credit Suisse from $37 to $44..

The Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,252.67.US commerce department reported a 2.2 per cent rise in third quarter GDP, versus an expected 2.8 per cent increase, shares were buoyed by positive housing data.Existing home sales rose 7.4 per cent in November, beating analysts’ 2.9 per cent forecast.“Home sales took a big leap and that’s obviously adding to the buying momentum,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.While the GDP data was a “negative surprise . . . it still doesn’t subtract from the fact the fourth-quarter GDP is probably going to come in much higher than expected,” he added.Home builders surged on the positive data. KB Home added 6.9 per cent to $13.80, Pulte Homes gained 4.7 per cent to $9.86 and Lennar rose 3.2 per cent to $13.27.Jabil Circuit was another big mover after the electronics manufacturer forecast higher earnings per share for the second fiscal quarter.The company predicted earnings would reach a minimum of $0.20 a share, beating analysts’ expectations.

benefit from a higher interest rate environment,” KBW said.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceuticals group reported that it would increase its quarterly dividend by 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of next year.

115;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-11-12T20:22:11Z;US housebuilders;;Like limpets grasping a rock, the US homebuilders have endured three years of thumping foreclosure waves. Yet RealtyTrac figures on Thursday showed October foreclosure filings – default notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions – declining from the previous month for the third time in a row. Can the industry start to move beyond thoughts of mere survival?There are other encouraging signs. On Tuesday, Toll Brothers reported a two-fifths surge in order activity for its fiscal fourth quarter and a big fall in cancellations. As the group builds mostly up-market homes typically selling for around $550,000, the pick-up in activity is unrelated to the government’s first-time buyer tax credit. Fellow builder Lennar has even talked tentatively of making profits at some point next year (although not for the full year).Even so, a conservative approach to valuation suggests homebuilding stocks already factor in recovery. Still loss-making, the sector trades in line with historic valuations at around 1.6 times book value, estimates Barclays Capital. To be more positive, investors must include items such as deferred tax assets and some off balance-sheet items. Do so and the housebuilders trade just below book value, but to realise those tax assets will require a return to normal profitability.Unfortunately, it is too early to say when such normality will return. Toll chief executive Robert Toll likened current conditions to 1991, when the market began to improve, but demand remained highly volatile into 1993. Indeed, applications for mortgages to buy houses fell to a nine-year low last week. Any optimism must rest on the view that the impact of the next million foreclosures, as the fall-out moves from past speculative hotspots to less exuberant states, will be gentler than that of the first few. Not a great hope to cling to.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentiallyThe Lex column is on Twitter

The index has given up 5 per cent from a 2009 high reached on October 19.The S&P 500, which bottomed in early March, remains per 15.4 cent higher for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday fell 1.2 per cent to 9,762.69. The Nasdaq Composite closed 2.7 per cent lower at 2059.61.Investors have lately been leery of buying into signs of a stronger economy, said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.“Early on it was a reluctance to believe in the recovery,” he said. “As people become more convinced about the recovery, they really remain concerned about how far the markets have moved.”Third-quarter corporate earnings announcements on Wednesday sent mixed messages on the economic recovery.Among the stocks most punished was Goodyear, the tyremaker, whose revenues declined 15 per cent in the quarter. It dropped 19.6 per cent to $13.46 as the group indicated that its North American business faced struggles.International Paper declined 3.5 per cent to $21.83 after telling investors that seasonally weak demand would render “significantly lower” results in the final quarter of the year from the past quarter.A report that sales of new houses in the US fell a surprise 3.6 per cent in September also damped market sentiment. Shares of Lennar, a builder, fell 7.5 per cent to $12.63.Energy stocks felt pressure. US coal miner Massey Energy sank 8.5 per cent to $28.66 as weak demand from power plants triggered a profit drop. Rival Peabody Energy was 6 per cent lower at $39.64.ConocoPhillips, the first big US oil producer to report results this week, was down 2.8 per cent at $49.49 after announcing a 71 per cent drop in profit to $1.5bn, or $1 a share.A steep decline in crude futures on Wednesday also dented its shares.Financial stocks sputtered. Insurer Genworth Financial fell 7.6 per cent to $8.69 while insurer MBIA fell 8.2 per cent to $4.02.Meanwhile, card payment processor Visa rose 3.6 per cent to $76.57 after beating profit forecasts and indicating that consumer spending could be firming up.The Commerce Department reported orders for long-lived goods from US manufacturers rose 1 per cent last month, marking a reversal from a decline in August.“Through the month-to-month volatility, the improvement in manufacturing activity is evident across a large number of reports, and this is another one that fits into that picture,” analysts at RDQ Economics wrote in a note.Yet industrial stocks did not reflect optimism. US Steel fell 5 per cent to $35.53 after its quarterly loss announced this week was followed by disappointing results at ArcelorMittal, the largest steelmaker. Aluminium group Alcoa fell 6.9 per cent to $11.93.Norfolk Southern, the fourth-largest US rail transporter, rose 0.4 per cent to $46.25 after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings late on Tuesday.

117;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-09-22T21:50:06Z;Lowe’s warns of reductions in assets value;;Lowe’s, the US home improvement chain, warned on Tuesday that it could face up to $100m in charges arising from from reductions in the asset value of underperforming stores, as it continues to face a “challenging” economic environment.In a presentation to Wall Street analysts, Robert Niblock, chief executive, said he remained “conservative” about the prospects for Lowe’s sales, given the continued uncertainty over consumer sentiment and the wider economy.He noted that in spite of the falls in house prices, customers continued to regard their home as their largest asset, but were increasingly opting to carry out improvement projects themselves to save money.“Consumers are shifting to more do-it-yourself projects as they balance convenience with the cost of outsourcing,” he said.Brian Sozzi, analyst at Wall Street Strategies, noted that providing fully installed projects such as kitchen refits had accounted for 6 per cent of the retailer’s sales in 2008.“With consumers cutting out the tradesman to tackle small home upgrades themselves, Lowe’s has been negatively impacted,” he said in a note to clients.Lowe’s has in the past been prematurely optimistic in predicting a betterment in the home improvement market. But in August, it trimmed its store opening plans for next year to between 35 and 45, from 62 to 66, after reporting lower-than-expected second- quarter sales. In 2008, it opened 115 new stores.On Tuesday, the retailer announced the closure of one store, but said it also planned to review “the future viability” of a handful of stores once the US housing market stabilised, which could lead to the possible impairment charges.Excluding the possible impairment charges, the company maintained its earnings guidance for the year of $1.13 to $1.21, on total sales of about $47bn. It said it expected the home improvement market to grow by about 1 per cent in 2010, with same-store sales decreasing by about 1 per cent, and overall sales up by 3 to 4 per cent.Lowe’s announced its first venture outside North America in August, with a joint-venture with Woolworth’s in Australia to develop up to 150 home improvement stores in the next five years. It is also opening its first stores in Mexico, where its larger rival, Home Depot, is already established.US home prices rose 0.3 per cent in July from the previous month, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, while its house price index fell 4.2 per cent for the 12 months ended in July, the smallest decline this year.Lennar, the US home builder, said on Monday it had increased its number of housing construction start-ups in its most recent quarter, as demand improved.
118;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-09-21T20:53:37Z;Energy sector a drag on US stocks;;A $3.9bn deal by Dell was not enough to lift US stocks out of the red on Monday, as investors grew wary of a pull-back.Last week, Wall Street rallied to 11-month highs on encouraging economic data and higher commodity prices.But after metals retreated and oil sunk below $70 a barrel, materials and energy stocks on Monday dragged the market lower from the opening bell.US Steel fell 2.1 per cent to $48.02, while ExxonMobil lost 0.6 per cent to $69.57.Investor confidence had initially been buoyed by Dell’s announcement that it had struck a deal to acquire Perot Systems, a computer services company, in a cash transaction valued at about $3.9bn.Dell said the acquisition, which represented a premium of about 67.5 per cent on Perot’s closing price on Friday, would help the group offer a broader range of services and add to its earnings in 2012.Dell fell 4.1 per cent to $16.01 while shares in Perot soared 65.1 per cent to $29.56.Rival computer manufacturer Apple fell 0.5 per cent to $184.02 while Hewlett-Packard gained 0.4 per cent to $46.35.The S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,064.66 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 9,778.86 points. But after breaking into positive territory in late morning trading, the Nasdaq closed 0.2 per cent higher at 2,138.04.Amgen, said its experimental bone-strengthening drug helped patients with a mix of advanced cancer types, lifting its shares 2.5 per cent to $62.31.Nektar Therapeutics also rose 13.1 per cent to $9.57 after the company entered into a licensing deal with AstraZeneca to develop two of its drugs.“With limited economic news ahead of Wednesday’s Fed decision, markets appear to be treading water for the most part,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.At least eight initial public offerings raising $3.5bn are also set to price in the US this week, in what will be the most active week for equity listings since December 2007. So far this year there have been 22 IPOs.In the technology sector on Monday, EU regulators released details of the alleged anti-trust abuses which led to the €1.1bn ($1.6bn) fine imposed on Intel in May.Intel, the world’s biggest chipmaker, was fined after a long-running probe concluded that the company had abused its dominant market position and used illegal sales practices to encourage computer manufacturers to carry its products. The shares lost 0.1 per cent to $19.54.In spite of commodity weakness, Petrohawk Energy, the Texas oil and gas company, gained 2.7 per cent to $24.26 after the company announced it had agreed to sell its Permian basin properties for $376m to a private company.But Delta Petroleum added to the sector’s woes after it said an exploration well in the Columbia River Basin had brought up only water at the six lowest zones tested and that gas volumes were minimal. The shares fell 44.9 per cent to $2.21.Morgan Stanley raised its price target on General Electric to $19 from $17, saying that the company had been largely ignored by investors over the past two years due to high-profile mistakes and embarrassments at its subsidiary NBC Universal.Rising commodity prices and momentum from recent upgrades helped General Electric gain 12 per cent last week – its biggest weekly gain since May.The shares rose a further 1.6 per cent to $16.76 after early losses due to speculation that Vivendi, the French media company, could sell its 20 per cent stake in NBC Universal this year.Homebuilders fell back after last week’s gains. Data last week showed that US residential building had reached a nine-month high in August.KB Home, the Los Angeles housebuilder, lost 2.2 per cent to $19.77, while Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, fell 1.9 per cent to $21.78.Lennar added to the sector’s declines after the Florida homebuilder reported a larger-than-expected loss for its third quarter.The shares dropped 3.1 per cent to $16.02.
119;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-08-27T21:04:12Z;Financial stocks fuel Wall Street rally;;US stocks rallied strongly during the day on Thursday, reversing early losses, as some of the more beaten up financial stocks gathered momentum and squeezed short sellers out.AIG and Citigroup, which were both bailed out by the government at the height of the financial crisis, jumped as recent momentum was further fuelled by fresh news on the companies. This forced short sellers to buy the stocks to protect themselves from heavier losses.Citigroup jumped 9.1 per cent to $5.05, helped by reports that Paulson & Co, the fund controlled by billionaire investor John Paulson, had taken a 2 per cent stake in the company.AIG was the best stock in the entire benchmark S&P 500, with more than the entire free float of the company changing hands.Analysts said recent conversations between former chief executive Hank Greenberg and current management could help the company, and the stock soared 26.9 per cent to $47.84.“It appears that the bears have been squeezed out, although there is not a lot of new money coming in yet,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab.This helped make up for falls in the energy sector, which struggled to make it into positive territory even though the price of oil reversed its early slide.Chevron closed down 0.1 per cent at $71 while ExxonMobil was 0.7 per cent lower at $70.86.The S&P finished up 0.3 per cent up at 1,030.98, while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.2 per cent higher at 2,027.73.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 9,580.63, completing eight straight winning sessions for the first time since 2007.It was supported by Boeing, whose shares jumped after it announced it would have its 787 Dreamliner ready to fly by the end of this year. Delays to the aircraft have weighed on the stock and after the release of the new schedule, shares gained 8.4 per cent to $51.82.The news also lifted Boeing’s suppliers. Rockwell Collins rose 3.4 per cent to $46.53, Precision Castparts gained 9.5 per cent to $94.97 and Goodrich was 2.5 per cent higher at $56.64.The financial sector started the morning in negative territory after figures showed the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week did not fall as far as hoped.This proved a more decisive factor than revised figures showing the US economy contracted 1 per cent in the second quarter.“Right now there is still room for improvement in cyclical data, such as inventories, which should keep the rally going in the near term,” said Don Rissmiller, chief economist at Strategas Partners.Andrew Neale, chief investment officer at Fogel Neale Partners, said: “People are taking an interest in financial stocks as they realise the crisis is over, but they are still very nervous about the recovery story.”But financial stocks swung during the day as the momentum behind the bailed-out former giants pulled the sector higher.Dell gave the technology sector a late jolt as it announced its quarterly results just before the close.The company had been expected to report after the bell, but an early release of figures showing the company made stronger profits than expected saw the shares jump in late trade.Revenues were boosted by strong sales of low-cost notebook and netbook mini-laptops and the shares gained 6.7 per cent to $15.65.Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers gave an insight into the housing market after it reported a wider loss than expected.The company sparked a rally in the sector this month after it said cancellations were falling while new orders rose.Since then its shares have risen 13 per cent, but they ended 1.2 lower at $22.87 on Thursday.This knocked mainstream homebuilders also, which have enjoyed an impressive run recently.Lennar declined 1.5 per cent to $15.34, while DR Hortonshed 1.9 per cent to $13.53.Nyfix, the electronic brokerage, surged 89.5 per cent to $1.63 after NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, said that it would acquire the company for $1.68 per share. Shares in NYSE dipped 0.9 per cent to $28.52.
120;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-08-26T20:23:16Z;Wall Street shrugs off mixed data;;"US stocks closed a whisker higher after a choppy day of trade on Wednesday as investors digested a mixed set of economic data.A disappointing reading on durable goods orders for July weighed on industrial stocks, which were the day’s weakest sector.Although the headline figure was encouraging, analysts focused on the number that excluded transportation, discounting the temporary effect of the government’s cash-for-clunkers programme.That data was worse than expected, which triggered widespread selling in the industrial sector.Caterpillar, the machinery maker, dropped 1.2 per cent to $47.25, while
Honeywell, the manufacturing conglomerate, lost 1.1 per cent to $37.12.General Electric was also caught up in the selling, in spite a new $2.7bn contract to build a power plant in Kuwait and reports of a possible $2bn sale of its security unit. The shares fell 1.3 per cent to $14.11.The early falls were mitigated by a sharp rise in monthly sales of new homes , which boosted the homebuilding sector.Lennar gained 4.1 per cent to $15.58 and DR Horton climbed 5.7 per cent to $13.79.The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all closed a fraction higher at 1,028.12, 9,543.52 and 2,024.43, respectively.That constituted the seventh successive positive session for the Dow.“Until it becomes clear that there is a sustainable economic trend you are going to see this kind of mixed data,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential.“More worrying is the fact that the markets have sold off towards the close recently.”Metals producers came off their recent highs as commodity prices dipped. Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, lost 1.5 per cent to $63.13, while Nucor, which makes steel, fell 2.4 per cent to $45.28.“Commodity shares could find a headwind with Chinese stocks soft and crude oil finding resistance at $75,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.Financial stocks were also lower in spite of the housing data as well as figures showing that mortgage applications rose last week, defying a rise in mortgage rates.Signs of stabilisation in the housing market have lifted banks to the forefront of the recent rally, but they slipped on Wednesday as investors took an opportunity to take profits off the table.Citigroup declined 2.5 per cent to $4.63 and JPMorgan lost 0.6 per cent to $43.30.Morgan Stanley drifted 2.2 per cent to $29.53, even as rumours intensified
surrounding the sale of its Van Kampen investment unit, with Bloomberg reporting that the bank has approached at least three other asset managers with offers of a possible partnership or sale.Retailers were higher during the day, building on the gains made during Tuesday on the back of an unexpectedly sharp rise in consumer confidence.Budget retailers were especially strong, carried by the momentum from the previous session, when Big Lots reported better earnings than expected.The company was one of Tuesday’s strongest performers and rose again on Wednesday morning, picking up 3 per cent to $26.37.Rival Family Dollar climbed 3.5 per cent to $30.82.Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, jumped after it reported a surprise profit and said that tight inventory control would see it earn more over the year than previously forecast.The sharp cost cuts mitigated slumping sales at the company, which also owns the Pottery Barn furnishings chain, and the shares rose 11.3 per cent to $17.21.Health insurers suffered however, as analysts predicted that the death of Senator Edward Kennedy could provide further impetus to government plans to reform healthcare.They said the Democrats may want to honour the memory of one of the strongest advocates for such reform.With the current plan proposing cuts in government subsidies to large health insurers, Humana lost 2.7 per cent to $36.15, while UnitedHealth fell 3.3 per cent to $28.93."
121;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-08-25T14:42:30Z;US home prices notch quarterly increase;;US house prices rose in the second quarter of this year, notching their first quarterly increase in three years, and climbed for the second month running in June, offering hope that stricken real estate market is on an upswing.Home prices rose by 2.9 per cent in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter of 2009 and were up by 1.4 per cent from May to June, according to the closely watched Case-Shiller index, released on Tuesday. The result was better than economists expected and added to mounting evidence that the market has stabilised.“That the gains are this broad-based is without question the big surprise, and tells a story of near country-wide bottoming out,” said Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “Clearly, the post Lehman fire sale activity has helped the market find a base.”Compared with a year ago, US home prices are still off sharply, having fallen by 15.4 per cent across the 20 tracked metropolitan areas and are down by 14.9 per cent in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2008. But the pace of the annual decline has slowed and in June, 18 of the 20 cities tracked showed monthly price increases.David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at Standard and Poor’s, which publishes the Case-Shiller results, said that the figures hint at an “upward turn from a bottom”.“For the second month in a row, we’re seeing some positive signs,” Mr Blitzer said.The data lifted share prices of homebuilders in mid morning trading on Tuesday. Lennar gained 3.6 per cent to $15.10, while DR Horton advanced 3.4 per cent to $13.10 and KB Home rose 3.2 per cent to $18.06.Cities showing the biggest monthly increases were Cleveland, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Only Detroit and Las Vegas saw prices slide in June. In Las Vegas, home prices have plunged by 54.3 per cent since peaking in 2006.Economists have warned that in spite of recent signs of life, the US housing market remains under pressure from record rates of home foreclosure and high unemployment. Since peaking in the second quarter of 2006, home prices are down by 30.2 per cent.Mike Englund, an economist at Action Economics, predicts that year-on-year prices will continue to level off this year and will be flat by next March.“The housing sector has recovered,” Mr Englund said. “The main transmission mechanism from housing to the rest of the economy is prices.”Meanwhile, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday that single-family home prices rose by 0.5 per cent in June after climbing by 0.6 per cent in May. Although prices were off by 6.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with a year ago, the pace of decline slowed from the first three months of the year when they were down by 7.1 per cent.The monthly increases in home prices along with easing unemployment are starting to make consumers feel more optimistic. Separately on Tuesday, the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence, rose to 54.1 in August from 47.4 in July.“Consumer confidence, which had posted back-to-back monthly declines, appears to be back on the mend,” said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board’s consumer research centre.Much of the increase was due to Americans feeling better about labour market prospects and rising expectations for the next months have climbed to the highest level since December 2007. Consumers are also expecting overall business conditions to improve in the next six months and a greater percentage of workers now expect their salaries to increase.
122;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-08-21T20:27:50Z;Wall Street surges to record highs for year;;US stocks rallied to new highs for the year on Friday after early optimism from Europe was boosted by signs of a US recovery.An unexpected jump in the sales of existing homes fuelled the market’s best day since late July, which was initially sparked by figures showing the German manufacturing and service sectors expanded.This gave investors further confidence that the recession is ending, after figures earlier in the week showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region and manufacturing in the New York area both rose impressively last month.Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, gave those hopes further credence when he told a conference: “The prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good,” although he admitted such growth may be sluggish.“We have had good signs this week on manufacturing and housing, as well as in key export markets such as the eurozone,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. “But of course, we are still missing the consumer, and that is the big problem.”The European data helped oil rise to a price not seen since last October.This fed into energy stocks, with Chevron rising 1.6 per cent to $69.73 and ExxonMobil picking up 1.9 per cent to $69.92.Metals stocks also showed strength as they extended recent gains made on the back of firmer commodity prices. Freeport McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, advanced 4.6 per cent to $65.06. US Steel picked up 2.6 per cent to $44.86.Homebuilders then joined those sectors at the forefront of the buying after the housing data, with Lennarrising 3.2 per cent to $14.52 and DR Horton climbing 3.4 per cent to $12.66.Financial stocks continued their recent winning run, with Citigroup building further on the 66 per cent rise in its share price since late July with a gain of 4.9 per cent to $4.70.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $17.46 and Wells Fargo climbed 1.7 per cent to $27.94.The rally took the benchmark S&P 500 to new closing highs for the year, up 1.9 per cent up at 1,026.13.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.7 per cent to 9,505.96 and the Nasdaq rose 1.6 per cent to 2,020.90.This put the gloss on what turned out to be a positive week for the stock market, which took the S&P 2.2 per cent higher, the Dow up 2 per cent and the Nasdaq 1.8 per cent better off.Friday marked the fourth straight positive session, following a sell-off on Monday after a big drop in Chinese equities.Wall Street soon gained its composure, however, with investors focusing on the positive economic news rather than more worrying data showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits unexpectedly rising.`“There has been a recent acceleration in the economic recovery, said Stanley Nabi, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management. “The question is, is this a temporary turnaround and will there be a relapse, or is this for real?”Companies also continued to report encouraging earnings, and clothing retailer Gap rose 3.3 per cent on Friday to $19.48 after investors shook off disappointing sales and focused on rising profits .JM Smucker, which produces jam and peanut butter, also beat estimates, helped by stronger sales and improving profit margins. Its shares rose 4.3 per cent to $54.10.Salesforce.com, which makes software for managing customer data, jumped after reporting stronger quarterly revenues than expected.Its shares rose 16.2 per cent to $53.67.But businesses are apparently less willing to buy tax preparation software, with Intuit, which produces such software, saying continuing economic weakness would mean lower full-year profits than previously forecast. The shares fell 7.2 per cent to $28.62.
123;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-08-18T20:33:56Z;Wall Street stages modest rebound;;"US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after the steepest decline in more than a month during the previous session.Financial stocks, retailers and materials companies, which led the market lower on Monday, all did well as buyers were tempted back into the market.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 989.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 9,217.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.3 per cent to 1,955.92.“A lot of people missed the rally in March and again in July,” said Chris Verrone, investment strategist at Strategas Partners. “Therefore any pull-back will be viewed as a buying opportunity.”Investors continued to focus on retailers as earnings season for the sector kicked up a gear with results from Home Depot, Target and Saks. For all three the pattern during the quarter was similar, with strict cost controls mitigating ongoing sales weakness.Home Depot recovered all of Monday’s losses, which were triggered by disappointing results from rival Lowe’s, after lower costs than expected helped it raise its full-year outlook. Its shares picked up 3.1 per cent to $26.93.Budget retailer Target also beat analysts’ estimates with revenues in line with expectations but profit margins improving. The stock climbed 7.6 per cent to $44.32.Upmarket chain Saks reported a similar story as carefully managed expenses kept costs low and helped it beat earnings estimates. Its shares gained 6.9 per cent to $5.72.“Only 43 per cent of companies that have reported their earnings have beat expectations on both the top and the bottom line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential. “We need to see revenue growth in the next quarter,”Financial stocks led the way, however, helped in part by improving credit card losses. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $4.14 and Bank of America gained 2.1 per cent to $16.90.Goldman Sachs was upgraded to “buy” at Pali Research, which predicted continued strength in its fixed-income business, and the stock rose 2.1 per cent to $160.48.American Express, meanwhile, was upgraded by KBW after credit losses improved last month. Its shares picked up 4.3 per cent to $31.69.CIT was one of the strongest financial companies, up 2.9 per cent to $1.40 after the commercial lender announced a narrower loss than in the same quarter last year.On Monday the group announced that it had bought more time to fight off bankruptcy by completing a $1bn debt tender.But the rally in financial stocks was not replicated everywhere and economic data limited the bullish mood. Figures showed that deflation continued to
hamper producer prices.There was weakness among health insurers, which bucked Monday’s
losing trend on signs that the Obama administration could abandon the public insurer element of its healthcare reforms.Such a plan has been
criticised as undermining the private sector and, after campaigners hit back at suggestions that it might
be dropped, insurers gave back much of the previous session’s gains.Humana lost 1.5 per cent to $35 and Coventry Health Care fell 2.6 per cent to $22.98.Homebuilders recovered from early losses, which were triggered by data showing that builders started work on fewer homes last month than expected. But economists said the rise in the number of new single-family homes was good for the sector. Lennar and DR Horton both finished the day 2.8 per cent higher, at $13.19 and $12.22, respectively.Technology stocks also showed strength after a bruising previous session. Smartphone makers were particularly strong after RBC described the market as “the next wave of
computing” and raised its price targets on the three leaders in the sector.Apple, which makes the iPhone, climbed 2.8 per cent to $164. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, picked up 4.6 per cent to $73.99. Palm, which recently launched the Pre, gained 4.9 per cent to $13.88."

BNY Mellon’s shares picked up 2.3 per cent to $28.71.Insurer Allstate was one of the steepest climbers in the financial sector, rising 6.3 per cent to $28.42 after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, saying the company’s fundamentals remained strong and that the shares were undervalued following recent falls.Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity “levelling out” saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close.“The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, said: “I think ‘levelling out’ confused the market a little bit, and it points to a divided Fed.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,005.81 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,361.61 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,998.72.“We may be in for some bouncing around as investors decide whether to trust in the recovery and take the plunge into equities,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.Homebuilders were especially strong after Toll Brothers, which builds luxury houses, said cancellations fell and orders rose during the previous quarter, although it added that its units were selling for cheaper prices.Toll Brothers’ shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $23.42 and gave a boost to others in the sector.DR Horton gained 2.6 per cent to $13.45, while Lennar rose 4 per cent to $13.52.There was some optimism on consumer activity after department store Macy’s kicked off the retailers’ earnings season by beating earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast.The shares were volatile, however, with some concern over the company’s warning of a “very difficult” trading environment as well as the fact its forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations.After a brief fall during the pre-market session, the shares rose 6 per cent to $16.40 during the day.Shares inSara Lee also bounced around after the company made a narrower loss than expected after one-off charges. There was strength in North American sales, which helped boost the shares before the bell, but they subsequently fell and finished 10 per cent down at $9.72.Meanwhile, Applied Materials, which produces equipment to make microchips, reported a narrower loss than predicted on relatively strong sales. Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $13.66.The IPO market has shown signs of life in the past few days, culminating on Wednesday with what is likely to become the biggest US offering this year from Starwood Property Trust. The trust, which will invest in real estate, offered its shares at $20 and held on to that to close the day unchanged.But Emdeon,a healthcare services company, jumped on its first day of trade and the shares, which were priced at $15.50, climbed

Bristol-Myers rose 2.8 per cent to $20.86 and Medarex soared 89.2 per cent to $15.89.Amazon announced its expansion into the clothing sector with a $928m deal for privately-held Zappos.com, the online shoe retailer.
The shares rose 5.7 per cent to $93.87.Amazon’s rival Ebay further boosted market sentiment after sales and profits topped estimates. The shares climbed 10.6 per cent to $21.52.Two smaller healthcare companies added to Bristol-Myers’ gains, helping the sector outperform the broader market.Rival drugmaker Celgene jumped 18.6 per cent to $55.97 after it beat estimates for its profits and said a test showed that a blood cancer drug could be used earlier in a patients’ treatment than thought.Intuitive Surgical surged 26.8 per cent to $215.37 after profits that were 26 per cent better than analysts’ forecasts as sales of its robotic system for surgery easily beat expectations.Ford showed signs of strength from the US consumer as it reported a smaller operating loss and cash-burn rate than exppected.

Some see signs of stabilisation in spending, but with the exception of tech stocks most companies have not seen revenue growth.”Economic data gave further fuel to the rally. The number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits unexpectedly fell and sales of existing homes rose more than expected.This helped homebuilders rally strongly as DR Horton climbed 7.6 per cent to $11.17 and Lennar gained 6 per cent to $11.26.But the session was dominated by earnings news, with two companies in particular boosting the Dow.Strong sales at 3M helped the maker of Post-It Notes easily beat revenue and profit expectations. The shares picked up 7.4 per cent to $69.43.AT&T, the telecoms company, also beat expectations, helped by strong sales of Apple’s iPhone, which in the US operates only on the AT&T network. The stock advanced 2.6 per cent to $25.48.But McDonald’s injected an element of caution as the restaurant group’s revenues missed Wall Street expectations and analysts warned that its results were a sign of continued weakness from the US consumer. McDonald’s shares fell

Investors remain concerned over future write-offs from bad loans. Huntington more than tripling the reserves set aside for such losses and Fifth Third saw an 82 per cent rise in net charge-offs.Huntington fell 4.9 per cent to $3.73 but Fifth Third, which made a smaller operating loss than expected, jumped 14.3 per cent to $8.01."
126;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-07-22T20:32:50Z;Wall Street fluctuates on mixed signals;;US stocks fluctuated on Wednesday as investors reacted to signs of strength in the housing and consumer sectors and mixed messages on banks’ future bad debts.Banks opened lower as Wall street reacted to warnings by several companies of loan losses to come.But they turned around after Andrew Cecere, chief financial officer of US Bancorp said he saw credit write-offs stabilising.US Bancorp rose 3.8 per cent to $18.96, while Morgan Stanley, which made a wider loss than expected after making a $700m writedown on its commercial real estate portfolio, rebounded after heavy early losses to end 0.1 per cent lower at $27.54.Mr Cecere’s words also helped other regional banks enjoy a strong afternoon in spite of mixed earnings.SunTrust, which made a narrower loss than expected, ended 6.7 per cent up at $16.19 while KeyCorp, which missed analysts’ estimates, was 7.1 per cent higher at $5.16.“Right now the market feels good about itself, and is focusing on signs of stabilisation rather than the negatives,” said Paul Miller, a managing director at FBR Capital Markets.Wells Fargo remained resolutely lower however as the prospect of further credit losses negated the impact of encouraging revenues, with analysts warning much of the income from mortgage refinancing would not be repeated. Its shares ended down 3.6 per cent at $24.45.Bank of New York Mellon also lost ground after reporting earnings slightly below expectations, falling 6.2 per cent to $27.32.The markets followed several banks and bounced back during the day.“Even if you have a few people hitting the “sell” button on results, there are others underneath willing to buy the dips,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The markets were also helped by optimism on housing after figures showed an unexpected rise in home prices in May.Mr Bernanke told the Senate he saw a “levelling-off” in house prices, although he added that foreclosures could yet pressure them again.KB Home gained 6.1 per cent to $15.03 while Lennarrose 7.7 per cent to $10.62 and DR Horton climbed 5.6 per cent to $10.38.Starbucks led the consumer sector higher after cost cuts helped it swing to a profit and beat analysts’ forecasts. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $17.39.Resilience in consumer spending helped Applereport much better earnings than expected, with sales and profit margins both beating expectations. The stock picked up 3.5 per cent to $156.74.“The consumer is responding to Apple’s product introductions as well as price cuts, which is a good sign for the rest of the market,” said Bill Shope, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 954.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 8,881.26. But the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 1,926.38.Newspaper stocks performed well after Media General reported a quarterly profit and said declines in advertising revenue were beginning to ease. The company’s shares rose 84.3 per cent to $4.33.Of the blue-chip newspaper publishers, the New York Times Company, which reports results today, rose 3.1 per cent to $6.62.PepsiCo slipped as its quarterly revenues disappointed. Even though the company topped earnings expectations, the shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $55.89.In the technology sector, the shine from Apple’s results was dulled by disappointment over results from AMD, the microchip maker.Sliding sales saw the company miss estimates, and the shares gave up 13 per cent to $3.55.But Yahoo was able to overcome weak advertising revenues and beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings. Its shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $17.37.Boeing was the latest Dow component to beat its earnings estimates as it saw growth in its defence programs, but the shares fell 2.4 per cent to $42.Eli Lilly and Pfizersaw mixed fortunes even after both drugmakers reported better earnings than expected and raised their full-year forecasts.Eli Lilly fell 1.9 per cent to $33.79 while Pfizer picked up 1.1 per cent to $15.87.
127;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-07-22T16:50:08Z;Signs of life in US housing market;;A monthly rise in US home prices lifted hopes that the stricken residential real estate market could be starting to stabilise after three years of spiralling downward.The Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Wednesday that single-family home prices rose by 0.9 per cent from April to May, marking the biggest jump this year. Compared with a year ago, US home prices were off by 5.6 per cent, the smallest annual decline in 10 months.The FHFA tracks homes that back mortgages sold by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed US mortgage buyers. Home prices appreciated most in the west and south, offering welcome relief to areas that were hardest hit by the collapse of the real estate bubble.“It’s surprising to see some firmness in these numbers,” said Mike Englund, an economist at Action Economics. “We’re assuming prices will bottom later this year or early next year.”Signs of life in the housing market lifted shares of homebuilders such as Lennar, DR Horton and KB Home as much as 6 per cent by midday on *Wednesday. A healthy pick-up in home construction has buoyed homebuilder sentiment, signalling that consumer demand remains in spite of a glut of housing inventory.In the first five months of this year, home prices across the US have climbed at an annual rate of 0.7 per cent. On Tuesday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that “the decline in housing activity appears to have moderated” and mortgage applications have swelled for three weeks running.But economists warned that the real estate market remains fragile and cautioned taking too much hope from the monthly increase. According to the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index, home prices have dropped by a third since peaking in 2006, and the latest figures from RealtyTrac show that rates of foreclosure have reached record highs this year.“Revisions and volatility of the monthly index make it hard to draw any conclusions,” said James Lockhart, FHFA director.Michelle Meyer, an economist at Barclays Capital, noted that most other measures of US home prices show declines of nearly 20 per cent year-on-year and that the FHFA fails to capture homes with subprime mortgages.“What we are seeing is a slowdown in the pace of decline of home prices,” Ms Meyer said. “I don’t think we are seeing an outright gain on a national basis.”
128;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-07-16T20:40:46Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;"US stocks rose close to their highs for the year on Thursday after a late rally pulled the markets out of a range following a choppy morning.The afternoon’s gains were fuelled in part by words from prominently bearish economist Nouriel Roubini that the recession would end this year.That helped overcome early nervousness about the ramifications of a possible bankruptcy by CIT Group, the commercial lender.CIT, which is struggling to fund itself, said there was no “appreciable likelihood” of a government bail-out, leaving the company facing a bankruptcy filing.The shares collapsed 75 per cent to 41 cents, and the effects were felt on the rest of the market.“We might not see the effect of a CIT bankruptcy straight away but, if somebody doesn’t step in to fill the gap they will leave in the market, it will have an effect on medium-sized businesses and so on unemployment,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.This was enough to keep markets subdued during the morning, in spite of a record drop in the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits.Even impressive profits from JPMorgan were not enough to spark an early rally.The bank reported revenues and profits easily above what analysts expected on record income from its investment banking side.The shares fell 0.4 per cent to $36.13 after a weekly gain of over 12 per cent.But stocks pulled out of their range after Mr Roubini’s comments and data showed sentiment among homebuilders rose in June.Homebuilders jumped on the data, with Lennar gaining 4.4 per cent to $9.55 and Pulte Homes picking up 3.9 per cent to $9.02.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.9 per cent at 940.74, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,711.82 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.2 per cent to 1,885.03.There was support for the markets from the technology sector, with IBM rising 3.2 per cent to $110.64 as investors bet correctly the company would beat profit estimates when its results were released after the bell.Biogen Idec rose 0.9 per cent to $47.10 after the company managed to increase revenues by 10 per cent from the previous year, boosted by strong sales of its multiple sclerosis drugs.Rival Baxter also beat expectations with its earnings. The company raised its earnings forecast for the year and the shares rose
3.1 per cent to $54.74.The healthcare sector also showed strength, triggered by positive earnings from two biotech companies.But microchip maker Xilinx knocked confidence in the sector after its results disappointed after Tuesday’s strong showing from market leader Intel.Shares in Xilinx fell 1.9 per cent to $20.26 after it warned that profit margins could be squeezed this year even though it beat its estimates for the past quarter.Marriott International also disappointed investors even as it reported net income above what analysts had forecast. The hotel operator’s shares were down 6.2 per cent to $20.44 as the company refused to provide guidance for the next quarter, saying the “current global economic and financial climate continues to make predictions very difficult”.This also knocked shares in rival Starwood Hotels, which dropped 2.8 per cent to $21.13.Mobile handset maker Motorola was a heavy faller, losing 4.2 per cent to $6.33 after European rival Nokia warned of shrinking profit margins amid continued declines in global sales.Harley-Davidson shares were volatile in the morning after the release of its quarterly earnings, dropping to $16.65 before climbing 8.4 per cent to $18.96 as it beat bearish estimates and said it would cut 1,000 more jobs.The gain came even as profits fell 90 per cent and the company warned of “continued weak” consumer spending for discretionary purchases.Meanwhile shares in Mosaic, the fertiliser company, leapt 12.2 per cent to $49.98 after a Brazilian newspaper reported that Vale, the Brazilian iron ore miner, may bid for the company at $56 per share."
129;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-06-29T20:45:40Z;Wall Street rally boosted by upgrades;;US equities rallied on Monday as upgrades in the consumer sector and improving energy stocks helped lift stocks after an early droop.Homebuilders were especially strong after Credit Suisse upgraded shares in KB Home, citing a rebound in orders, KB’s shares climbed 5.1 per cent to $14.11 and its rivals also saw some upside. Lennar gained 5.8 per cent to $9.71 and Pulte Homes rose 2.4 per cent to $8.97.Meanwhile retailers also did well, with JC Penney standing out after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company’s shares, saying it is the most likely department store to outperform margin expectations with its second-quarter results.Shares in the retailer rose 1.8 per cent to $28.89.Consumer stocks were joined by the energy sector in providing support as the price of oil rose back above $71 per barrel. Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.88 and ExxonMobil rose 2.2 per cent to $70.58.Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Teppco rose 5 per cent to $30.12 after Enterprise Partners said it would buy the pipeline company for $3.3bn, equivalent to $31.36 per share.The S&P finished 0.9 per cent up at 927.23, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 per cent to 8,529.38 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,844.06.Volumes were low, however, and the markets were more sensitive to the relatively few trades.“Volumes are light ahead of the extended weekend, and many investors are watching out for the unemployment numbers out later this week” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.The reversal came after early weakness from healthcare stocks, led by Biogen Idec, which ended lower after it said a 10th patient had developed a potentially deadly brain disease after taking its multiple sclerosis drug. The shares lost 5.5 per cent to $47.23.There were some positive signs for banks, which reports suggest have made strong profits this quarter on the back of booming equity and debt issuance.Morgan Stanley rose 1.7 per cent to $29.10 and Goldman Sachs picked up 1.8 per cent to $149.36, with just one more session until the end of the quarter.Sentiment was also boosted by words from Christina Romer, chairman of the president’s council of economic advisers.She told the Financial Times the US economy would feel a substantial boost from the Obama administration’s emergency spending package over the next few months.These rises came in spite of negative economic data from two regional Federal Reserve Banks. The Chicago Fed said US economic activity remained at very low levels in May, while the Dallas Fed said manufacturing activity in that area has fallen more than expected during June.“Many of the data points recently have been mixed,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. “But after the S&P hit 890, investors started to put in some of the cash they’ve been sitting on.”Alcoa, the aluminium maker, underperformed other materials stocks after analysts at FBR said the aluminium market was over-supplied, and downgraded the company’s shares. The stock lost 3 per cent to $10.44.Technology stocks made gains, with Microsoft picking up 2.2 per cent to $23.86 on news that the company is looking for a buyer for Razorfish, its digital agency, which one analyst valued at up to $700m.Investors also seemed reassured about the status of Oracle‘s deal to buy Sun Microsystems, even though the US Justice Department has asked Sun for more details about its flagship Java software before approving the takeover.A lawyer for Oracle said last week he does not expect the deal to be delayed, and shares in Sun rose 1.9 per cent to $9.18 on Monday, while Oracle gained 1.2 per cent to $21.50.Meanwhile the annual rebalancing of the Russell indices created some turbulence, with companies that moved up from the small- to mid-sized 2000 index to the large-cap 1000 index faring particularly well.Netflix, the online dvd rental company, gained 2.1 per cent to $41.20 while Interactive Brokers rose 1.6 per cent to $15.49.
130;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-06-25T20:43:58Z;Retail sector leads Wall Street rally;;"US stocks staged an impressive broad-based rally on Thursday with retail stocks leading the way.Home furnishings retailers fared especially well after Bed Bath & Beyond reported an unexpected rise in profits with cost cuts and new store openings making up for a fall in same-store sales. Its shares climbed 9.5 per cent to $31.08.That lifted rival retailers, with Home Depot rising 3.9 per cent to $23.57 and
Target gaining 4.2 per cent to $40.31. Lowe’spicked up 3.8 per cent to $18.87.Office Depot, meanwhile, jumped 7.8 per cent to $4.42 after Goldman Sachs said the $350m cash injection from BC Partners earlier this week could enable the retailer to merge with another company.An apparent stabilisation in sales of homewares also encouraged JPMorgan to upgrade shares in JC Penney, which gained 6 per cent to $28.20, lifting rival department stores with it.Kohl’s picked up 2.3 per cent to $44.43 and Macyâ€™s climbed 3.9 per cent to $11.83.But there was bad news elsewhere in the consumer sector as Nike reported quarterly earnings that missed consensus estimates once restructuring costs had been factored in.Investors were also disappointed by the news that forward orders had fallen 12 per cent and Nike shares lost 3.3 per cent to $51.28.Economic data showed that the US economy contracted 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, slightly less than had previously been estimated.But investors focused on the fact that more people claimed jobless benefits last week than expected.The data saw the markets open in negative territory but they then rose as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on last year’s takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America.Mr Bernanke was accused on Wednesday by a senior Republican of being part of a “cover-up” concerning what disclosures should be made about the deal.That knocked the market’s faith in the Fed on the day it decided to keep interest rates low, but some of that confidence returned on Thursday as Mr Bernanke defended his position.Mr Bernanke was also supported by President Barack Obama, who said he had confidence in the job he had done.“Mr Bernanke’s comments seemed fairly justifiable, and that probably held up the market a little bit,” said Nick Kalivas.“People seemed pretty nervous about the testimony but I am not sure there was anything there that constituted the smoking gun that might quicken his demise.”The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all rose 2.1 per cent to 920.26, 8,472.40 and 1,829.54, respectively.“It has been very difficult to push this market down,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There has been a continual flow of investor money as the awareness grows that recovery is coming.”Bank of America fell during the morning, with many on Wall Street saying the investigation into the Merrill purchase could make Ken Lewis, chief executive, more vulnerable than Mr Bernanke.It was also hit by analysis from Citi, which warned that BofA could have a
difficult quarter as it builds capital in case of further loan losses.But the shares picked up ground during the day as nervousness about Mr Bernanke’s testimony abated. They closed flat at $12.35.There was a glimmer of hope on US housing as Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, the homebuilder, said he sensed some pent-up demand from potential home buyers. This helped the company’s shares climb 17.5 per cent to $9.19, even though it reported a bigger loss than expected as falling house prices continued to take their toll.Other homebuilders were also lifted. Centex advanced 5.8 per cent to $8.58 while KB Homeclimbed 8.3 per cent to $14.77.There were encouraging signs on investor appetite as Medidata, a clinical technology company, made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, jumping 21.4 per cent to $17 on the day of its initial public offering. The shares had initially been priced at $14."
131;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-06-17T03:10:17Z;Economic data strengthen mood on Wall St;;US stocks made a modest rebound on Tuesday morning following the previous session’s sell-off.Commodities stocks remained volatile as the price of oil and metals snapped their two-day losing streak to head towards the highs set during last week. Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the last few sessions, picked up ground once more. AK Steel rose 6.3 per cent to $19.47 while US Steel, which is re-hiring workers in Illinois and Ontario to cope with higher demand, advanced 3.9 per cent to $38.54.Oil also rose, peaking back above the $72 mark after climbing $1.48 to $72.10 per barerel of US crude. That lifted energy producers, including ConocoPhillips, which was 1.9 per cent up at $43.90 and Schlumberger, which rose 1.3 per cent to $59.32.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April. But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.Economists said inflation remained a distant threat. “The continued moderation in the growth of broad money suggests there is little reason to fear that the Fed’s quantitative easing will lead to sharply higher inflation and interest rates,” wrote Capital Economics.Equities were also boosted by figures showing that builders started work on 532,000 homes in May compared with expectations of just 508,000. This lifted homebuilders before the bell after they were some of the previous session’s heaviest fallers, following an unexpected dip in confidence in the sector. Lennar picked up 6.6 per cent to $8.12 and DR Horton gained 3.1 per cent to $9.68.The positive economic data saw futures extend their early gains, but they fell again shortly before the open after industrial production in May was shown to have fallen more than expected. The markets then opened just about in positive territory.After half an hour of trade the benchmark S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent up at 927.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 8,634.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,830.06.Best Buy, the biggest US electronics retailer, slipped after reporting earnings roughly in line with analysts’ expectations. The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, and even though it maintained its full year guidance, the shares fell 4 per cent to $37.11.Meanwhile shares in Adobe rose ahead of its earnings, which were due out after the bell. The company said it would start charging for the online version of its Acrobat reader program after moving the product out of public testing stage. The shares advanced 0.4 per cent to $28.93.Citigroup slipped 0.6 per cent to $3.35 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, told the Detroit Economic Club’s National Summit that companies were going to have to look away from American consumption for growth drivers as the US faces slower growth and less credit. The fall came in spite of reports that five companies were in the bidding for its Japanese asset management arm, a deal which could earn the bank $1bn.The telecoms sector suffered a difficult morning after Barclays Capital said investors were likely to move out of the sector, with continuing high unemployment making growth difficult to achieve. Barcap downgraded AT&T, which fell 1.1 per cent to $24.38 but retained its overweight rating on rival Verizon, despite cutting its price target to $34. Verizon’s shares were a fraction lower at $29.72.Research in Motion, meanwhile, maker of the Blackberry mobile device, unveiled a new model which aims to compete globally with Apple’s iPhone. Its shares gained 3.1 per cent to $82.86.Amgen, the Nasdaq-listed biotechnology company, climbed 2.5 per cent to $50.69 after its shares were upgraded by the broker Sanford Bernstein, which said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the next year.European stocks were higher early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was up 0.2 per cent at 865.01. Asian equity markets slid for a second consecutive session, with the Hang Seng index losing 3.1 per cent to 17,946.48.Bond yields were up, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note rising 2 basis points to 1.24 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note gaining 3bp to 3.74 per cent.The dollar was weaker against major currencies early in New York, losing 0.6 per cent against sterling to $1.64.Gold was trading $0.67 higher at $934.48 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York. US crude prices were $1.48 higher at $72.10 a barrel.
132;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-05-18T20:33:29Z;US stocks rally on retail hopes;;"US stocks rebounded on Monday following their first bruising week since the rally began in March as encouraging results from Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, raised hopes the economy would soon reach a bottom.Lowe’s, which is particularly sensitive to the housing market, easily beat analysts’ profit expectations, in spite of falling sales.The company also raised its outlook for the year as Robert Niblock, chief executive, boosted sentiment, saying: “We have seen consumer confidence improve [and] housing turnover show signs of a bottom.” Its shares rose 8.1 per cent to $19.94.Shares in rival, Home Depot, due to report on Tuesday, also performed well, rising 6.6 per cent to $26.02.Wal-Mart also picked up after Barron’s investment magazine said the stock was cheap, pointing out the company bought 19m of its own shares in the last quarter.Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal said the supermarket chain would revamp its electronics lines to attract customers who used to shop at the now- bankrupt Circuit City. Wal-Mart’s shares gained 3.7 per cent to $49.92.The optimism came after the market sold off last week following data showing retail sales fell in April.It helped the benchmark S&P 500 index advance back above 900 and into positove territory for the year, climbing 3 per cent to 909.71 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.9 per cent to 8,504.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained
3.1 per cent to 1,732.36.Meanwhile, Mr Niblock’s words on housing were supported by a survey showing confidence among US homebuilders increased to its highest in eight months.The growing optimism helped Lennar, the homebuilder, outpeform most of the S&P, up 13.7 per cent to $10.02.The company was further boosted by an upgrade from Citigroup, which cited improved liquidity following a recent debt sale.Barry Knapp, head of US equity portfolio strategy at Barclays Capital, said: “Housing demand is beginning to respond to lower rates and off-the-chart affordability. But it is not clear whether this will mitigate what might happen later this year as people default on their loans.”Banking stocks also fared well amid the economic optimism after Goldman Sachs named Bank of America as a “conviction buy”. Goldman said BofA had made good progress on raising capital and had enjoyed a “solid” quarter in its mortgage and capital markets businesses.Meanwhile, Citigroup raised its full-year earnings outlook for the company to include what it made by selling its stake in China Construction Bank.Although Citi said BofA’s recent share issue meant 2010 earnings would be lower than previously thought, its analysts also commented that the bank may have already raised $4bn of the $17bn hoped for, suggesting the market is responding well to the increased supply.BofA’s shares rose 9.9 per cent to $11.73.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which are almost certain to be among the first banks to be allowed to repay government loans, rose 6.5 per cent to $143.15 6.7 per cent to $37.26, respectively.Even State Street, the fund manager, rose, in spite of announcing that it would issue $1.5bn of new stock as it looked to repay government bail-out money. The company also said its full-year operating profit would be below analysts’ predictions as it took a $3.7bn write­down after moving items on to its balance sheet.But the stock gained amid the wider buying, picking up 8.5 per cent to $41.79.State Street was the latest company to have recently issued shares, a trend that Nick Kalivas, analyst at MF Global, said was not encouraging. He said: “Capital-raising hints that profit growth may not be strong enough to facilitate business needs.”But Ben Warwick, chief investment officer at Sovereign Wealth Management, said: “The market seems to be absorbing the extra equity well. It looks like there is enough demand to soak up the additional supply.”Investors continued to bet on the immediate survival of MGM Mirage, the casino operator.They sent the shares 14 per cent up to $8.74 after JPMorgan upgraded the stock, saying bankruptcy was “off the table for two years, if not longer”."
133;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-04-20T20:46:03Z;Wall Street falls despite strong earnings;;Banks gave US stocks their worst day since the recent rally began in spite of better than expected results from Bank of America.The bank made strong earnings but the shares plunged 24.3 per cent to $8.02 as the company warned about “extremely difficult challenges”, especially from deteriorating credit quality.Other banks also struggled after The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was considering converting loans made to big banks into common stock, thereby putting money into them without having to ask Congress.Investors were nervous about the idea, which some called “back-door nationalisation”, and Citigroup fell 19.5 per cent to $2.94 while Wells Fargo dropped 16.1 per cent to $17. Citigroup was also hampered by bearish analysis from Goldman Sachs, which said credit losses at the banking giant were growing at a “rapid rate”. Capital One, the credit card company, was one of the sector’s biggest fallers after Goldman Sachs cut the company from “buy” to “neutral”. Its shares lost 25 per cent to $13.38.A report in the FT that banks would be able to return bail-out money only if it was in the economic interest also hurt the sector.“Investors were disappointed that paying back Tarp (troubled asset relief programme) money looked further away, and then the news on deteriorating credit from BofA tipped them over the edge,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 4.3 per cent lower at 832.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6 per cent to 7,841.73 points and the Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3.9 per cent to 1,608.21 points.But on the busiest day yet of the earnings season, a piece of acquisition news was the biggest surprise.Oracle, the software company, said it had offered $9.50 a share to buy its rival Sun Microsystems, which had been involved in take­over talks with IBM.Sun’s shares jumped 36.8 per cent to $9.15, while Oracle lost 1.3 per cent to $18.82.Shares of IBM fell as investors moved to anticipate the company’s results, due out after the close.The stock, which has risen more than 20 per cent since the market hit a low in March, dropped 0.8 per cent to $100.43.The takeover offer failed to spark a rally, even as several companies reported better first-quarter results than expected.Drug company Eli Lilly reported earnings that were better than both the same period last year and estimates for this period, but its shares lost 2.3 per cent to $32.99 as investors worried about weaker sales of its brand-name drugs.Halliburton, the energy conglomerate, also beat expectations, although with falling revenues and profits, and its stock gained 0.1 per cent to $18.79 after falling during the morning’s trade.PepsiCo was another company to fall in spite of reporting better results than anticipated. The company announced it was to offer about $6bn to buy the shares it does not already own in its two largest bottlers. This outweighed rising earnings, and its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $49.86. Shares in Pepsi Bottling Group rose 21.9 per cent to $30.73.Hasbro, the toymaker, was one of the few companies whose results did not beat expectations on Monday morning, with low consumer spending during the Christmas season hurting sales. The shares gave up 2.7 per cent to $27.16 after rallying on Friday following better profit margins than expected from its rival Mattel.Steel makers suffered after Bloomberg quoted a company official at Arcelor Mittal, the world’s biggest steel company, as saying it may halve the size of a planned plant in India and indefinitely defer a second facility amid low demand for cars and homes. As metals prices declined during the day, US Steel lost 11.3 per cent to $26.58 and AK Steel dropped 14.2 per cent to $10.25.Lennar, the homebuilder, was one of the heaviest fallers on the S&P after the company said it planned to sell up to $275m in common stock for possible use as working capital and to repay debt. Its shares lost 18.6 per cent to $7.60.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said: “The majority of the bad news is behind us, but we had a nice run up and a lot of people are now covering their positions.”
134;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-04-15T20:52:46Z;US stocks rise in choppy trade;;"US stocks rose on Wednesday as a dividend increase by Procter&Gamble and rising confidence in the homebuilding sector outweighed fears about demand in the technology sector.Procter & Gamble gave consumer companies a much needed boost amid falling retail sales numbers after the company raised its dividend for the 52nd straight year. It lifted its quarterly shareholder payout 10 per cent to 44 cents, and its shares gained 3.2 per cent to $48.75.Homebuilders also outperformed after data showed confidence among professionals in the sector in April rose to its highest since October, although remaining negative. Lennar gained 11.7 per cent to $8.69, while KB Home picked up 10.5 per cent to $15.75 and DR Horton rose 8.2 per cent to $11.16.The hope for the housing sector also boosted financial stocks, which were given further impetus when American Express said the growth in the number of customers defaulting on payments slowed during March. AmEx gained 11.9 per cent to $20.62. This helped offset earlier negativity on bad debts from Capital One, its rival credit card company.But Intelfuelled concerns about consumer demand in the technology sector after it refused to give formal guidance for its second-quarter earnings despite reporting better results than expected. The shares lost 2.4 per cent to $15.62 on the uncertainty.Rival chipmaker National Semiconductor also fell, dropping 2 per cent to $12.01, while Microsoft gave up 2.7 per cent to $18.83.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned the market could have priced in better earnings than analysts had predicted, which could mean equity falls even after strong results.“Intel provided good results compared to printed expectations, but the market reacted poorly to margin guidance. The after-market selling may hint that the trade is too long into earnings,” he wrote.Concern over future revenues for technology companies limited gains on the Nasdaq, which lifted 0.1 per cent to 1,626.80 points. The S&P rose 1.3 per cent meanwhile to 852.06 points, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4 per cent to 8,029.62 points.The Dow was helped by industrial stocks, which joined consumer staples in positive territory. They were led higher by railway operator CSX, which reported
better-than-expected earnings. Its shares closed 7.8 per cent higher at $30.59, helped also by figures showing manufacturing in New York contracted much less severely than expected.CPI numbers indicated inflation was lower than expected, and the Federal Reserve said five of its 12 districts saw contraction slow during March, both of which helped support stocks.As earnings season began to hit full speed, there was mixed news from companies reporting quarterly results.Peabody Energy disappointed investors in spite of reporting increased sales and revenue by less earnings than expected. The company also deferred providing full-year targets, with future demand unclear. Its shares fell 11.5 per cent to $25.96.Abbott Laboratories also fell, despite reporting increased profits. Wth global sales declining, including those of its top-selling drug Humira, shares in the group lost 4.6 per cent to $42.66.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, jumped 25 per cent in 20 minutes after it reported narrower losses than expected. Its shares closed 18.7 per cent up at $5.01.“Confidence has started to return,” said Vaughn Affonso, a dealer at of CMC Markets. “But we need to see what earnings, and more importantly, forecasts will be like over the next few weeks before the recent rally becomes longer lasting.”Allegheny Energy rose after Barclays raised the utility company to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying it may benefit from an auction for Pennsylvania power prices. The company’s shares gained 8.7 per cent to $26.49.International Paper was the S&P’s biggest riser after Deutsche Bank raised the company from “hold” to “buy”, saying there were signs the business cycle was reaching a bottom. Its shares gained 21.9 per cent to $8.80.“The news from CSX and International Paper is enocouraging because these are the types of stocks that will lead us out of the recovery,” said Walter Gerasimowicz, chief executive of Meditron Asset Management."
135;LEN;Lennar Corp;2009-04-14T20:59:38Z;US stocks fall despite Goldman results;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as much better than expected results from Goldman Sachs were offset by negative economic data.Financials were the biggest fallers even though Goldman helped return some confidence to the sector by far outstripping analysts’ estimates with its first-quarter earnings.Goldman announced it had made $3.39 a share against expectations of just $1.49 a share on the back of strong trading figures.But the bank’s shares fell as it also announced it was to raise $5bn of capital by issuing new shares in order to repay money from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (Tarp).This would dilute existing shareholdings, and its shares dropped 11.6 per cent to $115.11. Rival Morgan Stanley, which is forecast to make a loss when it reports, fell 12 per cent to $23.67.“It’s no surprise that Goldman was profitable, when they can borrow at zero per cent from the Federal Reserve. The real question is whether it has to make
writedowns later in the year,” said Andrew Mulligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments.However, the positive underlying results did help boost Citigroup, the most beaten-up of all the major banking stocks. Citi leapt 25 per cent during Monday’s session and added 5.5 per cent on Tuesday to $4.01.Financial shares in general were badly hit by figures which showed retail sales unexpectedly fell during March, losing 0.9 per cent, excluding sales of automobiles.Meanwhile, the falling oil price helped drive down ­producer prices in March, contrary to analysts’ ­expectations, following two successive months of gains.Discover dropped after it said that it would cut more than 4 per cent of its workforce as it strives to cut costs. The credit card lender also suffered from a downgrade to “hold” by Stifel Nicolaus, and its shares had lost 10.4 per cent to $7.57.MetLife, the life insurer, also fell, despite saying it would not take federal bail-out funds, even though it is entitled to by the fact that it purchased a bank in 2001.Robert Henrikson, its chief executive, said MetLife was “well positioned, with approximately $5bn in excess capital”. But its shares became caught in the broad sell-off, falling 8.2 per cent to $26.44.Retailers also suffered. after the data. Home Depot lost 2.4 per cent to $25.34, while Macy’s dropped 7.3 per cent to $11.99 and Best Buy fell 6.9 per cent to $38.10.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 2 per cent down at 841.51 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 7,920.18 points and the Nasdaq Composite index had dropped 1.7 per cent to 1,625.72 points.“Analysts are being too optimistic with their predictions on what really matters, such as how much people are spending in stores,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers. “This is a really big disappointment, and one that is going to challenge the rally going forward.”The falls came despite positive comments on the economy from President Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr Obama said he saw “signs of economic progress”. But stocks extended their slide after he finished speaking, with investors apparently having hoped for more from what was billed as a “major speech on the economy”.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare group, followed Goldman Sachs in topping analysts’ expectations with its first-quarter earnings. The company said revenues were down, but it managed to keep costs low and reported earnings of $1.26 per share, against consensus estimates of $1.22. Its shares gained 0.4 per cent to $51.37.Lennar, the homebuilder, dropped after Moody’s downgraded its debt, citing concerns about the company’s liquidity position. Its shares lost 5.4 per cent to $7.78.MGM Mirage saw some rare positive news after it won a waiver from lenders to pay about $70m of obligations owed by both itself and its building partner Dubai World, which would allow it to continue to build its CityCenter development in Las Vegas. Its shares gained 5.6 per cent to $6.60.General Motors was another riser after reports that the ­government was considering swapping $13.4bn debt for equity in a new, stripped-down version of the ­carmaker. Its shares gained 4.1 per cent to $1.78."
136;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

The deal, which would be paid for using Pulte stocks, valued Centex's shares at $10.50, a significant premium to Tuesday’s closing price. Centex jumped 27.6 per cent to $9.72, while Pulte fell 4.3 per cent to $10.31.This gave further confidence to the sector after the number of mortgage applications was shown to have risen 4.7 per cent during the week ending April 3 as low interest rates begin to take effect. Lennar benefitted from that strength, gaining 10.9 per cent to $7.91.The benchmark S&P 500 index managed to find moderate gains after two loss-making sessions, rising 0.7 per cent to 821.26 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.6 per cent to 7,832.97 points and the Nasdaq Composite index lifted 1.5 per cent to $1,584.31.Alcoa was the first major company to report its first quarter earnings, and the aluminium maker made a loss of $0.59 per share from continuing operations as a lack of demand for the metal, especially from the ailing car industry, drove down prices. This was slightly worse than analysts had predicted and the company fell in post-market trade on Tuesday. But it recovered during Wednesday morning’s trade, with many analysts saying the results could have been even worse. Its shares rose 0.9 per cent to $7.86.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said that the disappointing results from Alcoa were unlikely to spook investors. “The company tends to disappoint and is unlikely to move the market,” he wrote.Alcoa was followed by Constellation Brands, the owner of several big alcoholic brands including Robert Mondavi wines, which also reported mildly disappointing results. The company made a loss of $1.88 a share, hurt by disappointing demand in Europe and Australia over the winter festivities. Its shares lost 3.4 per cent to $11.24.Family Dollar Stores was able to increase its profits in line with expectations as cash-strapped consumers shopped in its budget stores. The company made $0.60 per share, as forecast, but the shares rose after the company said it would make better profits than previously predicted for the fiscal year. They gained 5.8 per cent to $34.55.Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings retailer, made a profit of $0.55 per share, which was lower than its previous quarter, but far outstripped consensus expectations of $0.44 per share. Its shares picked up 19.2 per cent to $30.41.“It’s not earth shaking, and there is still a lot of uncertainty out there,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets. “But if we see several companies report in line with expectations, we may see support come into the market.”Mr Cook also said the results for consumer companies were encouraging, even though ABC figures showed that consumer confidence declined during the week ending April 5. “We are seeing consumer spending increase even if incomes are falling. People are still buying,” said Mr Cook.The agricultural company Mosaic reported particularly disappointing results however, although it did not prove a major drag on the equities market as it is not listed on any of the best known market measures. The company made $0.18 per share compared to analysts’ estimates of $0.22 after prices tumbled last year. Its shares lost 1.2 per cent to $42.42.Many analysts are scrambling to lower their estimates on companies before the earnings season gathers pace next week. Wednesday saw Morgan Stanley fall after Oppenheimer slashed its forecast for the company’s first quarter earnings from $0.37 in profits per share to $0.59 in losses. Morgan Stanley’s shares fell 2.5 per cent to $22.73.Energy stocks were the major drag on the index however, as the price of oil continued to fall.

The S&P gained 8.5 per cent during March, the best monthly gain in over six years. But it finished the quarter more than 11 per cent lower.“In a bear market, the rallies are the most violent but in a bull market the falls are the most violent. The fact that we saw a fierce drop on Monday, but have risen again today shows we are in a bull move,” said John Brady, chief investment strategist at MF Global.The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed the other market measures after Davenport upgraded Microsoft to “buy” from “neutral”, saying there was increased PC demand in China and the US.Microsoft gained 5.1 per cent to $18.37 and the Nasdaq as a whole rose 1.8 per cent to 1,528.59 points.“There has been some strengthening in consumer orders across the technology sector, and we’ve also noticed a bit of a pick-up in the supply chain,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at

The company announced yesterday it would cover 12 months’ worth of payments from customers who lost their jobs “for economic reasons”.GM also continued to slump, losing 28.2 per cent to $1.94 after Fritz Henderson, the company’s new chief executive, talked openly about bankruptcy.Another of Monday’s heavy fallers, Alcoa rose after Deutsche Bank upgraded its shares, saying fears had receded that the company would need to refinance after it generated about $2bn in asset and equities sales in March. Alcoa’s shares rose 9.7 per cent to $7.34. But Deutsche Bank was less positive about

Its shares rose 1.9 per cent to $12.91.“Delinquency rates will rise with unemployment, but I don’t think losses from the credit card sector is the next big surprise for the market,” said Bruce Harting, at Barclays Capital.The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 3.2 per cent to 778.12 points.The Nasdaq Composite index performed better, gaining 4.1 per cent to 1,462.11 points as technology stocks rose, having been heavily sold during the previous
session.Cisco, which on Monday announced it was to make servers for data systems, was named a “conviction buy” by Goldman Sachs.Its shares rose 4.5 per cent to $16.14.Dell also gained after saying it would launch an ultra-thin notebook computer this month to compete with Apple and Hewlett-Packard. Dell’s shares picked up 4.9 per cent to $9.34.Apple rose 4.4 per cent to $99.66 after it announced the third version of its iPhone.The rise came in spite of research group NPD saying that the company had sold 16 per cent fewer Apple Mac computers in February than in January.The news on the iPhone helped AT&T, the only network available with that model, rise 4.2 per cent to $25.37. Verizon also gained, picking up 4.5 per cent to $29.83.The Dow Jones Industrial index made smaller gains, weighed down by two of the country’s biggest metal producers as falling demand continued to take its toll. The index closed 2.5 per cent up at 7,395.70 points.Alcoa’s shares dropped after the aluminium producer said it would cut its dividend from $0.17 to $0.03, issue stock and convertible notes and trim its 2010 spending in an effort to weather weak demand.The shares fell on Monday night and continued to lose ground on Tuesday, dropping 8.7 per cent to $5.59.There was similar bad news from the steel sector, as Nucor, the country’s largest steel manufacturer, forecast a first quarter loss that was worse than expected. Dan DiMicco, chief executive, said there was “no visibility as to the timing of the [economic] recovery”. The shares fell 9.2 per cent to $33.55.Nucor was joined by other big names in steel making, including AK Steel, which fell 1.8 per cent to $6.04, and US Steel, losing 3.2 per cent to $17.81. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, also fell, dropping 0.9 per cent to $36.93.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, said: “The move by Alcoa to issue shares and cut its dividend is a sign that commodity demand is weak despite excitement over Chinese buying and hopes for an economic recovery in Asia.”Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil picked up. Chevron gained 3.8 per cent to $65.31 and Exxon Mobil rose 3.2 per cent to $69.09.Pfizer launched a $13.5bn debt sale to fund its purchase of fellow drugmaker Wyeth.

Regions Financial leapt 10.5 per cent to $4.64 while regional banks rallied 4 per cent overall.Some insurers also enjoyed strong gains and the sector added 1.8 per cent overall.The wider market struggled for momentum after it emerged that Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, would not disclose the bank rescue proposals until Tuesday.The market drifted between positive and negative territory during the narrowest trading range for the benchmark S&P 500 so far this year.Alan Ruskin, senior analyst at RBS’s global banking and markets division, wrote in a note to clients: “Because the devil will be in the detail of the newest measures, notably the purchase of toxic assets, I would expect that the rally in risk appetite we are seeing ahead of the plan will lack immediate serious follow-through.”The S&P 500 finished 0.2 per cent higher at 869.89 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.1 per cent lower at 8,270.87 and the Nasdaq Composite Index flat at 1,591.56.“Traders left their desks on Friday all bulled up over Monday’s line-up,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers. “The postponement of Mr Geithner’s plans until Tuesday doesn’t instill confidence that whatever his team’s plan delivers will be much more than a compromise.”Meanwhile, another round of downbeat earnings illustrated the toll that the recession was taking on US corporations.“The known uncertainties of earnings are now mixing with the unknowns of both the Treasury Department’s plan for the banking sector and the government’s stimulus package,” wrote Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.In financials, Nasdaq OMXwas hit in the fallout from poorly received fourth-quarter results from NYSE Euronext. Shares in the exchanges lost 6.3 per cent to $23.34 and 5.2 per cent to $21.71, respectively.Among the results elsewhere, Whirlpool added 2 per cent to $37.13 in choppy trade despite the appliance-maker unveiling a worse-than-expected 76 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profitThe energy sector, up 0.2 per cent overall, provided the market with some support early in the session but later tracked the oil price lower.Meanwhile in materials, Dow Chemical shed 2.1 per cent to $10.65 after HSBC said the group was likely to cut its dividend, downgraded its view of the stock to “underweight” and warned a debt-financed deal to buy Rohm & Haas could prompt a credit rating downgrade. For its part, Rohm & Haas – locked in a merger dispute with Dow – edged 0.1 per cent lower to $55.47 on glum fourth-quarter results.Coca-Cola was among the losers in soft drink stocks, down 2.9 per cent to $42.31 after Citigroup cut its price target from $53 to $51.“While headline risks remain for the US soft drink industry,” wrote Celso Sánchez, Citi analyst, several factors could “increasingly garner investor attention and support sector valuations”.Homebuilders came under pressure after Citigroup downgraded its view of Lennar, off 6.3 per cent to $8.71, to “hold”. The sector lost 4.9 per cent overall.Motorola bucked a downward trend in the telecoms sector, helped by news that its co-chief executives had snapped up battered shares in the group last week. Its shares climbed 7 per cent to $4.15.Also on the upside, General Electric was a key winner, bolstered by hopes that GE Capital would benefit from bank bail-out plans.GE shares rallied 13.9 per cent to $12.64, helping the industrial advance 2.6 per cent overall.

It’s leading to a festering of rumours,” she said, adding that this was contributing to the selling pressure.Citigroup lost a further 15.5 per cent to $3.83, just above a nadir ahead of its rescue in November. JPMorgan, which had dropped 17.8 per cent since the turn of the year, fell a further 6.1 per cent to $24.34 even though the 76 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profit to 7 cents a share was not as bad as feared.The losses came after Moody’s Investors Service cut the debt ratings on the bank by one level to Aa3 following the results. The bank posted a profit only as a result of special items.“We’re not through the worst of it yet,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.Among the regional lenders to sustain heavy losses, Marshall & Ilsley sank 26 per cent to $7.93 after the bank cut its dividend from 32 cents to 1 cent a share following an unexpected fourth-quarter loss.Bank stocks slid to a 13-year low in the previous session as the wider market suffered from the latest in a series of sharp sell-offs.The wider market recovered some ground in late trade as lower oil prices gave a boost to retailers, which rallied 3.9 per cent.The S&P 500 finished 0.1 per cent higher at 843.73, having earlier slid as much as 3 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 8,212.49 while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 1.5 per cent stronger at 1,511.84.The Vix, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was up 3.4 per cent, above 50 for the first time in a month.Solar stocks rallied on a deal for First Solar to supply panels for Masdar City,
the so-called green city planned in Abu Dhabi, which pushed its shares up 6.9 per cent to $142.58.In technology, Inteladded 1.6 per cent to $13.29 and added a further 1.7 per cent after the market closed following its fourth-quarter results. The bellwether chipmarket disclosed a 90 per cent drop in profit that was broadly in line with expectations that had been lowered last week.

Richard Staite, analyst, downgraded his view to “underweight”.RBC analysts said: “At Wells, and across the industry in general, it is our view that the influx of [Troubled Assets Relief Program] funds has not been deployed ­efficiently due to a lack of loan demand, low securities yields, and the desire for excess capital.”Bank of America shed 4.2 per cent to $10.20 after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth- quarter loss, while JPMorgan Chaselost 1.7 per cent to $25.91 ahead of results on Thursday.A profit warning from Deutsche Bank and a Morgan Stanley analyst forecast that HSBC would have to raise fresh capital and halve its dividend added to US investor concerns over the state of the sector.Among the hard-hit regionals, Huntington Bancshares sank 16.2 per cent to $4.95 following a management shake-up.The S&P 500 closed down 3.4 per cent at 842.62, its lowest closing level since December 1.

Investors fear bleak figures from aluminium group Alcoa this week are merely the precursor to a glut of heavy losses during earnings season.Technology also did poorly, off 3.5 per cent ahead of results due on Thursday from Intel, which was down 4.3 per cent at $13.08.The selling pressure came even though the average rate for US mortgages fell to its lowest level since records began in 1990, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Homebuilders were 7.5 per cent lower overall.Among them, Lennar dropped 8.8 per cent to $7.89 after the company said it would pursue legal action against Barry Minkow and his company, Fraud Discovery.Energy stocks also did poorly, down 4.3 per cent overall as oil prices retreated back beneath the $38 a barrel level.

Wells Fargo fell 1.7 per cent to $34.56. Citigroup, which was poised to acquire Wachovia’s banking business earlier in the week, said it would oppose the new deal. Citigroup’s shares tumbled 18.4 per cent to $18.35.Housing-related stocks were among the worst hit as fears grew over the health of the economy. CB Richard Ellis fell 11.7 per cent on Friday to $9.45. Lennar and DR Horton fell 13 per cent at $12.08 and 8.4 per cent $11.07.Regional banks were one of the few sectors to hang onto gains. Regions Financial and Sovereign Bancorp rallied 14.1 per cent to $13.52 and 11.2 per cent to $5.84, respectively.That left the regional banking sector 3.3 per cent lower for the week.

A slide in oil prices and positive sentiment in the technology sector helped early on in the day to offset concerns over the likely success of the authorities’ proposed $700bn bail-out.Henry Paulson, Treasury secretary, received a cold reception when he appeared before the Senate committee, amid heightened investor anxiety that political wrangling could hamper the workings of the plan.Since the crisis worsened at the start of the month, the wider market has closely tracked the financial sector. Regional banks, among the hardest hit in the previous session, continued to weigh on Tuesday.Regions Financial fell 12,1 per cent to $13.72. Citigroup said: “While the proposed plan may put a floor on the ultimate risk facing the group, thereby lowering ‘systemic risk’, we do not believe the plan will relieve the near-term credit pressures facing RF and other banks. We expect the stock to come under selling pressure as investors refocus on operating fundamentals.”Citigroup also downgraded its recommendation on Zions Bancorporation from “buy” to “hold”. The shares in Zions fell 14.2 per cent to $40.54.General Electric fell 4.6 per cent to $24.95 after Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, citing “growing fundamental pressures” at its GE Capital division.The broader markets, which opened just as the hearing began, initially rallied sharply higher.But by the close that upbeat tone had abated, with the S&P 500 down 1.6 per cent at 1,188.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 10,854.17, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2 per cent at 2,153.34.A report from Oppenheimer served as a reminder that the Wall Street crisis is likely to have a knock-on effect on Main Street.Analysts led by Meredith Whitney wrote in a note to clients: “Credit market disruption has had underappreciated consequences on the economy, in our view.“A virtual suction of liquidity has occurred in the credit and lending markets, and consumer and corporate credit is already showing the effects. What started last summer has accelerated and intensified so much so that we believe any government bail-out plan has little hope of improving core fundamentals over the near and medium term.”Meanwhile, seasonally adjusted data showed house purchase prices dropped 0.6 per cent in July from June.Among home builders, Lennar sank 7.5 per cent to $12.71 as it reported its sixth straight quarterly loss.The materials sector led the market declines, down 3.2 per cent. Air Products and Chemicals fell 8.8 per cent to $73.22 after the hydrogen producer cut its fourth-quarter earnings estimate. Early gains were led by the technology sector, which initially rose almost 2 per cent before falling back to stand down 0.8 per cent. A loss this month of 11.4 per cent has pushed its prospective price to earnings ratio below 20.Microsoft, which has raised its quarterly dividend and on Monday unveiled plans to buy back as much as $40bn of its stock, rose 0.2 per cent to $25.44.Google, which unveiled the first smartphone powered by its Android software, fell 0.2 per cent to $429.27.Elsewhere in the sector, 3Com rallied 3.4 per cent to $2.16 on the back of positive results, helped in part by a litigation settlement. Bed Bath & Beyond fell 1.2 per cent to $30.40 ahead of quarterly earnings from the home goods retailer due after the closing bell.The fall in oil prices helped airlines and automotive stocks. Bucking that trend, General Motors reversed an early gain of 4 per cent and was down 7.4 per cent at $10.72.In mergers and acquisitions news, Bristol-Myers Squibb raised from $60 to $62 a share its offer for the part of the biotechnology group ImClone Systems that it does not already own.

Wachovia jumped 13.4 per cent to $18.99, Bank of America climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.73 and Citigroup gained 6.6 per cent $20.32 respectively.However, institutions with large stakes in Fannie and Freddie suffered as the market capitalisation of the pair collapsed. Gateway Financial lost 24.7 per cent at $5.35, Sovereign Bancorp slid 6.6 per cent to $9.02 and Midwest Banc slipped 24.6 per cent to $4.48.Still, the sector – and the wider market – pared some of its early gains, as more bearish investors noted the government intervention was no panacea to underlying ills.As if to underscore the point, Oppenheimer issued a bearish outlook on investment banks before their third-quarter earnings.As well as Lehman, it lowered its third-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman and Merrill Lynch, which said on Monday it expected a pre-tax loss of between $300m and $350m from a plan to buy back auction-rate securities. Still, their shares edged up 4 per cent to $169.73 and gained 3.2 per cent to $27.59 respectively.Meanwhile, Regions Financial climbed 10.4 per cent to $12.24 after Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co upgraded the Alabama bank from “``underperform” to “market perform’’.It said: “We anticipate that recent credit performance will take a back seat with investors until the euphoria passes.”Meanwhile, Washington Mutual fell 3.5 per cent to $4.12 after the bank was put under special regulatory supervision and named Alan Fishman as its new chief executive. He will succeed Kerry Killinger, who will retire after 18 years.In the broader market, the S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent at 1,267.79 points by the close, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood 2.6 per cent higher at 11,510.74 points.David Buik, analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Had Freddie and Fannie defaulted without the assistance of the Treasury and the Fed, the US economy would have fallen into the vortex of recession for at least five years…This action is a confidence booster.”Last week, the S&P 500 suffered its worst weekly loss since February as mounting concerns about the health of the global economy battered sentiment.Homebuilding stocks took particular comfort from the intervention on Monday and were one of the few sectors to hold on to their gains consistently throughout the session. KB Homes, Pulte Homes and Lennar climbed 14.2 per cent to $23.54, 11.3 per cent to $16.22 and 10.3 per cent to $14.95.Earlier in the day, all 10 sector groups boasted gains although by the close energy and materials had edged into negative territory.Technology also struggled to enjoy large gains. Semiconductors suffered amid concerns they were among the most vulnerable stocks to a global slowdown.UBS downgraded its recommendation on NVidia from “neutral” to “sell” and cut its price target from $12 to $11. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $11.19.UBS also cut its earnings estimate on SanDisk, pushing the shares down 5.9 per cent to $16.60. It said an oversupply of flash memory made it unlikely that prices would recover until the second half of next year.Elsewhere, UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled 11.2 per cent to $10.92 after denying a report in the Chicago Tribune newspaper about a possible bankruptcy filing.Altria edged up 0.1 per cent to $20.97 after agreeing to buy UST, a move that will create the largest US producer of smokeless tobacco.

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the biggest bank in Japan, boosted its bid for the part of UnionBanCal it does not yet own by 17 per cent to $3.5bn. The offer values the entire company at about $10.1bn.

Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, posted better- than-expected results and \edged up 0.4 per cent $24.59.Consumer staples were hit by some disappointing news from Hershey. The confectioner said higher prices due to rising commodity costs would probably curtail demand for its chocolates and sales growth could slow 2-3 per cent next year.Hershey fell 9.4 per cent to $37.71 while Kroger and SuperValu lost 5.1 per cent to $28.51 and 2.8 per cent to $27.12 respectively.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 11,479.39 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.5 per cent to 2,416.98.Wall Street stocks made modest gains for a third week in a row last week after oil prices eased.The benchmark S&P 500 index has rallied about 6 per cent from its July lows as oil and other key commodity prices have eased back from their highs.Ian Scott, a global equities strategist at Lehman Brothers, said: “This latest market recovery has been a very muted one . . . Cash levels remain high and largely unmoved, so the rally, such as it is, appears to have been driven by short covering.”In other corporate news, Broadcom, the chipmaker, made ground after Barrons’ said that the shares could gain as much as 40 per cent on demand for its iPhone components.Shares in Broadcom rose 1.6 per cent to $27.90 but those gains barely dented a 1.6 per cent loss for the sector.Consumer facing tech stocks were among the leading fallers with Google dipping 2.3 per cent to $498.30, Hewlett-Packard losing 2.2 per cent to $44.60 and IBM giving up 1.4 per cent to $124.59.Telecom stocks dropped back 1 per cent on Monday in spite of some positive analyst comments.The sector has struggled so far this year. However, Brian Belski, US sector strategist at Merrill Lynch, said: “Personal consumption and pricing trends are beginning to provide a positive backdrop for the sector . . . and are likely to add support in the coming months.”AT&T fell 0.8 per cent to $31.40 while Qwest Communications International lost 2.3 per cent to $3.83.
149;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-07-25T20:44:54Z;Data help US blue chips stay positive;;Wall Street stocks bounced back modestly on Friday as data on housing and manufacturing and consumer sentiment came in stronger than expected and investors focused on the positive in another mixed bag of earnings reports.According to the Commerce Department, new orders for durable goods rose unexpectedly in June and the data boosted industrial stocks.Terex and Northrop Grumman climbed 5.2 per cent to $49.17 and 2.7 per cent to $68.63, respectively, and the sector added 0.3 per cent. Still, gains were trimmed slightly by results from Burlington Northern Santa Fe. The railway company said second-quarter profit had fallen 19 per cent to $350m due to higher fuel costs and flooding in the Midwest, and the shares fell 0.7 per cent to $98.05.The housing market also offered a pleasant surprise, as sales of newly-constructed single-family homes fell only 0.6 per cent to a 530,000 annual pace – a smaller decline than expected.Homebuilders rose 2.2 per cent with a 4 per cent gain to $11.51 for Lennar helping to lead the way.Consumer-facing sectors rose as oil continued to pull back and a survey showed a surprise rebound in consumer confidence. Technology stocks were the strongest gainers, benefiting from some decent earnings news as well. Google added 3.4 per cent to $491.98, while Ebay gained 4.1 per cent to $25.40 and the sector advanced 1.6 per cent.Juniper Networks was the biggest winner in the sector after its second-quarter profits jumped 40 per cent and it lifted third-quarter forecasts. Juniper shares surged 17.7 per cent to $26.57.Energy also fared well thanks to Arch Coal which said second-quarter profit had tripled and the company raised its full-year forecast. Arch Coal rose 9.2 per cent to $55.64 while the sector added 1 per cent. Over the week, energy was the biggest loser, however, dipping 2.7 per cent as oil fell back. The benchmark S&P 500 pared early gains but was still ahead 0.4 per cent at 1,257.77 points at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent to 11,370.69 points and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,310.53 points.In recent days equity markets have been roiled by earnings news and other ructions in the financials. The sector jumped 6.6 per cent on Tuesday only to see fragile confidence crumble and suffer its biggest fall in eight years two days later.Those moves largely cancelled out each other, however, and the S&P 500 lost 0.2 per cent over the week. The index has now fallen for seven of the past eight weeks. The Dow dipped 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq added 1.2 per cent over the week. Financials edged down 0.1 per cent.Linda Duessel, an equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “Last week we rallied sharply as investors sold energy stocks to cover shorts in financials. So the question is, now what are we going to do? Trading could be sloppy as we search for new leadership.”Friday produced some more bad news from the financials. Early gains were wiped out after data showed rising foreclosures, and S&P said it might cut certain of the ratings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The pair fell 3.9 per cent to $11.55 and 6.1 per cent to $8.27, respectively. The financial sector as a whole lost 0.6 per cent.Although somewhat obscured by the travails of the financials, earnings season kicked into high gear this week. After 226 company reports, earnings for the S&P 500 are down 24.6 per cent on average. Excluding financials, though, earnings grew by 9.3 per cent.Industrial stocks were among the biggest gainers over the week, adding 1.4 per cent. The healthcare sector gained ground, climbing 1.3 per cent over the week thanks to some solid results from the likes of Coventry Health Care and Unitedhealth Group.The pair added 10.7 per cent to $33.46 and 14.7 per cent to $27.45 over the week, respectively.
150;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-06-26T20:41:33Z;Dow at lowest level since September 2006;;"Spiking crude oil prices, poor corporate earnings and more bad news from the banking sector sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling to its lowest level since September 2006 and knocked the S&P 500 below 1,300 points on Thursday.Technology stocks were hit particularly hard after Oracle and Research in Motion disappointed markets late on Wednesday with forecasts of slower growth and a profits miss, respectively.Oracle declined 5 per cent to $21.42 and RIM 13.3 per cent to $123.46 while the technology sector as a whole slumped 3.6 per cent – its biggest one-day fall since early January.Fourth-quarter results from Nike added to the gloom as the group reported a drop in US profits because of higher spending on advertising. Nike shares fell 9.8 per cent to $59.50.The broader consumer discretionary sector fell back sharply, losing 3.5 per cent as oil prices jumped above $140 a barrel.General Motors shares also suffered, falling 10.8 per cent to $11.43 – touching their lowest levels since 1955 along the way – after Goldman Sachs recommended selling shares in the carmaker. A similar downgrade for Lear, the maker of car seats, sheared 16.4 per cent from its share price taking it to $15.15.Analysts now expect second-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 9 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.Goldman struck again in the financials sector with a note that added Citigroup to its “conviction sell” list on the basis that it might take as much as $9bn in writedowns in the second quarter.Goldman also cut its recommendation on brokerages from “attractive” to “neutral”, citing deteriorating fundamentals and a delayed recovery process, and forecast $4.2bn of second-quarter writedowns at Merrill Lynch.Citigroup hit its lowest level since 1998, down 6.3 per cent to $17.67. Merrill Lynch dropped to a five-year low, falling 6.8 per cent to $33.05.The financial sector as a whole lost 4.4 per cent while an index of investment banking stocks fell 4.8 per cent.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “When you mix up the higher oil prices and the weakness in financials it continues to push this market lower …without question the S&P 500 is headed back to its March lows.”All 10 leading industry groups were in the red, dragging the S&P 500 down
2.9 per cent to 1,294.18 points, its lowest level in three months. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3 per cent to 2,321.37 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3 per cent to 11,455.86 points and has lost 9.4 per cent so far in June, its worst month since the Great Depression.Homebuilders struggled after Lennar, the second-biggest US homebuilder, reported a fifth successive quarterly loss and one that was larger than expected.Stuart Miller, chief executive, said: “The remainder of 2008 will likely see further deterioration in overall market conditions.’’That news swamped a report by the National Association of Realtors showing existing home sales rose
2 per cent to a 4.99m annual rate in May after falling for the previous two months.Lennar fell 8.4 per cent to $13.34 while DR Horton and Centex slipped 5.7 per cent to $11.80 and 7.7 per cent to $14.21, respectively.In the background, macro-economic data did little to improve the mood. A four-week average of initial jobless claims rose to its highest level since October 2005.Amid the widespread malaise, industrials tumbled 3.9 per cent, led by GE and United Technologies. GE fell 5.2 per cent to $26.53 and a five-year low, while United lost 4.9 per cent to $62.79.Even the best performing sectors lost ground. Consumer staples fell 2.1 per cent after ConAgra Foods predicted fiscal 2009 earnings that undershot some projections. ConAgra fell 5.5 per cent to $20.92.Smith and Wesson, the gunmaker, was a rare exception, rallying 6.7 per cent to $5.45 after the US Supreme Court ruled that a sweeping ban on handguns in Washington DC was unconstitutional.Searching for a note of optimism in the broad-based sell-off, Mr Detrick said: “We haven’t seen a major spike up in volatility.“People are obviously losing confidence but they are not yet ready to throw in the towel.”"
151;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-06-17T20:54:52Z;Goldman chills Wall Street with warnings;;New York stocks fell on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs both soothed and spooked markets, with second-quarter results that handily beat expectations while its analysts argued that continuing losses and writedowns may force US banks to raise $65bn of extra capital.Goldman said profits fell 11 per cent to $2.09bn, but that was well ahead of consensus estimates as gains in commodities and prime brokerage offset losses elsewhere.The results had little impact on the broader financial sector, however. It slipped 2.9 per cent after a number of analysts, including some at Goldman, wrote downbeat notes on investment banks and cut their targets for regional banks.Analysts at Strategas Research said: “We find it difficult to envision how the majors will be able to put the earnings machine back together in the near-term and therefore it is not time to wade back into the investment banks.”The latest batch of data on housing, industrial production and inflation also weighed on sentiment.Housing starts fell 3.3 per cent to a 975,000 annual rate in May, knocking the S&P 500 homebuilding index down 1.4 per cent.New figures on industrial production also made for sober reading. Large industrials such as Boeingfell back after the Federal Reserve said production slipped 0.2 per cent in May.Meanwhile, the Producer Price Index, a key inflation measure,jumped by a higher-than-expected 1.4 per cent in May due to surging energy prices, although core inflation moderated as forecast.Financial markets have suffered in recent weeks as rising inflation has stirred fears that the Fed will start raising interest rates.However, some remain optimistic on the outlook for monetary policy and equities. David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “We continue to expect that in an environment of increased uncertainty, US equities will outperform. The hawkish noises from the Fed seem to us much more an exercise in expectations management than a warning of an imminent tightening.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent to 1,350.93, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent lower at 12,160.30. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 2,457.73.Financials were in focus again on Tuesday after the Goldman results. Of the leading brokerages, Goldman has stood up best to the credit crunch. So far this year its share price has lost about 16 per cent of its value compared with a 29.3 per cent loss for the S&P 500 investment banking index.Goldman shares fell 1.5 per cent to $179.44 on Tuesday while its peers for the most part dropped back. Bank of America lost 3.6 per cent to $29.24 and Lehman dropped 7.6 per cent to $25.14.Zions Bancorp was the biggest sector faller, tumbling 8.6 per cent to $33.97,. The Salt Lake City-based lender was pummelled after it said further increases in bad loans were “likely”.In the consumer discretionary sector, data showing a small increase in weekly chain store sales initially boosted retailers. Analysts attributed the gains to demand for hot weather merchandise, Father’s Day shopping and federal tax rebates.Gap shares rose 0.3 per cent to $18, while Coach added 0.1 per cent to $33.37. But disappointing results from Best Buy and poor appliance sales data for May, which hit Whirlpool, helped drag the sector down 1.3 per cent. Best Buy fell 5.3 per cent to $43.46 and Whirlpool dropped 3.5 per cent to $66.03.Homebuilders and industrials also came under pressure. Lennar dropped 4 per cent to $15.28 and KB Home lost 3.5 per cent to $18.34, while United Technologies gave up 0.7 per cent to $68.41 and Boeing fell 0.9 per cent to $74.38.Commodity-related stocks were among the few gainers. Energy rose 1.7 per cent as refiners bounced back and bid speculation pushed shares in Marathon Oil3.1 per cent higher to $53.07. Materials added 0.2 per cent, led by Monsanto, which gained 5 per cent to $142.69.The healthcare sector initially made ground after Elan said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug helped some patients. Elan shares added 10.7 per cent to $30, while Wyeth, Elan’s US partner, rose 4.8 per cent to $45.16.But losses for healthcare providers swamped those gains. Humana dropped 3.3 per cent to $44.87.
152;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-05-16T17:59:58Z;US energy stocks race ahead;;Wall Street stocks slipped back on Friday but remained ahead for the week as resurgent oil prices boosted energy stocks but threatened to squeeze already weak consumer spending and financials lost ground.Energy stocks were in sharp focus again. Oil prices hit record highs after analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their oil price forecast for the second half of 2008 from $107 to $141 a barrel.ConocoPhillips shares rose 2.1 per cent to $91.19, Chevron added 1.4 per cent to $99.88 and an index of energy stocks advanced 1.5 per cent.As oil moved higher, consumer discretionary stocks shrank back. The sector slipped 1.5 per cent in early trading, led down by Liz Claiborne, which fell 6.7 per cent to $18.24 and Jones Apparel, which dropped 5.7 per cent to $16.68.The sector was not helped by the latest Reuters/University of Michigan index that showed consumer confidence this month slumped to the lowest level in 28 years.Financials also proved a weak spot, slumping 1.7 per cent after Merrill Lynch analysts recommended selling regional banks and Nobel Prize winner Myron Scholes said the worst of the credit crisis may not be over.KeyCorp and Regions Financial led the sector lower, dropping 5.1 per cent to $23.80 and 5.4 per cent to $20.16, respectively.By lunchtime in New York, the benchmark S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent to 1,416.66 yesterday but up 2.1 per cent over the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent lower at 12,904.32 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.8 per cent to 2,512.90.The technology sector was notably active this week. Hewlett-Packard, started the ball rolling on Tuesday when it tabled a $13.9bn deal to buy Electronic Data Systems. HP shares fell 5.2 per cent to $46.60 over the week while EDS was among the weeks leading gainers, rising 29 per cent to $24.33.Equities were surprisingly jaunty this week and markets are on course for their best performance since mid-April. Of the leading S&P 500 industrial groups, the energy and material sectors were the standouts, adding 3.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively.Earnings from retailers that were not as bad as feared and the stimulating prospects of government rebates played a part in that rally. Consumer discretionary stocks added 3.1 per cent over the week.On Wednesday, Macy’s reiterated its annual forecasts, in spite of tough trading conditions, and saw its share prices bounce. That picture of weak but better-than-expected results has been a hallmark of the first- quarter earnings season and some analysts expect the pattern to sustain equity markets.Analysts at UBS said: “We think the S&P 500 should continue rallying from here as investor’s price in resilience and sustainability in earnings.”The outlook for financials is less rosy. Meredith Whitney, at Oppenheimer, slash- ed her earnings forecasts for brokers this week, citing accounting changes, weakness in the capital markets and reduced revenues.But over the week, financial stocks rose 0.8 per cent on the back of some positive news. On Wednesday, for example, Freddie Mac posted a smaller-than-expected loss.In the background, the saga surrounding Yahoo and its decision to reject a take-over offer from software giant Microsoft trundled on.Yahoo is now fighting efforts by billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn to replace its board and force the company back into negotiations with Microsoft. Over the week, Yahoo shares rose 7.3 per cent to $27.80 and Microsoft shares added 2.2 per cent to $30.05.Homebuilders were also in focus as dismal data and earnings from the sector continued to pour out.But stocks maintained their composure, taking solace from news of efforts in Congress to address the housing slump. Lennar and Centex added 7.1 per cent to $19.71 and 7.2 per cent to $22.90, respectively, over the week.
153;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-05-07T20:46:02Z;Wall Street drop sharpest in a month;;Wall Street stocks fell the most for a month on Wednesday after record high oil prices hurt consumer and transport stocks and financials tumbled on speculation that new regulations will force them to disclose further losses.Bank and brokerage stocks slumped 3.7 per cent, their biggest one day fall since mid-March, after the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would require them to disclose capital and liquidity levels as early as this year to avoid the kind of damaging rumours that undermined Bear Stearns.The news made a bad day on the equity markets worse. Housing related stocks were already reeling after a report from the National Association of Realtors, showed that fewer Americans signed contracts to buy previously owned homes in March, put off by falling prices and tighter credit.That news stoked fears that the crisis in the housing sector has much further to run. Sales are down more than 20 per cent from a year ago and almost 35 per cent from their April 2005 peak.“The string of unimpressive housing numbers continues,” said Mike Larson, a real estate analyst for Weiss Research. “There is a risk that many of these pending sales won’t turn into closed transactions, too, given the tightening in the mortgage lending market.”Oil prices exacerbated the rout on Wednesday, dragging down equities as they stormed past $123 a barrel. Consumer discretionary stocks flipped from gains to losses on the prospect of an extended consumer spending slowdown and transport stocks took a hit.Still, data from the Labor Department showing that worker productivity unexpectedly increased in the first quarter helped moderate losses.By the close, all 10 industry groups in the benchmark S&P 500 were in the red and the index was down 1.8 per cent at 1,392.58 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 1.6 per cent to 12,814.35 points while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.8 per cent to 2,438.49.On Tuesday DR Horton, the biggest US homebuilder, posted dismal results. But housing and financial stocks, as well as broader indices, rallied after regulators said they would clear Fannie Mae to reduce its capital reserves and potentially acquire more mortgages. Financials went into reverse however. Merrill Lynch dived 5.6 per cent to $48.48. Lehman Brothers lost 5.8 per cent to $43.64 and Citigroup slid 5.4 per cent to $24.48.Countrywide and AIG were the leading sector fallers, down 7.5 per cent to $4.94 and 6.9 per cent to $45.08, after analysts cast doubt on the takeover prospects of the former and the earnings potential of the later. At the start of the day, consumer discretionary stocks were one of the few bright spots but their resilient run gave way as commodities bounced back. General Motors fell 4.3 per cent to $21.37 while Bed Bath & Beyond lost 3.6 per cent to $32.58.Better-than-expected second-quarter profit from Walt Disney helped cushion some of those losses though. The media company rose 2.9 per cent to $34.70.Oil prices knocked transport stocks. FedEx, the parcel delivery firm, fell 4 per cent to $93.75 while CSX, the railway company, lost 3.5 per cent to $62.81.In technology, industry bellwether Cisco reported strong results. But after early gains, Cisco succumbed to the broader malaise and its stock fell 2.1 per cent to $25.78.Poor forecasts from Cognizant Technology Solutions, the computer services provider, added to the sector slide. It forecast second-quarter sales and profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates and the shares tumbled 10.5 per cent to $30.21.Telecommunications stocks were in focus after Sprint Nextel said it would combine its planned high-speed wireless network with Clearwire.Intel, Time Warner Cable and Google are among a group of technology and cable companies that will invest $3.2bn in the new venture.Sprint shares, which have been buoyed by speculation that Deutsche Telekom might be considering a takeover bid, dipped 0.3 per cent to $9.16. Clearwire shares fell 2.1 per cent to $16.12.The downbeat housing data dented homebuilder stocks.DR Horton fell 6.6 per cent to $15.74 while Lennar dropped 5.3 per cent to $18.92 and Pulte Homes lost 5.8 per cent to $13.69.
154;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-29T21:04:48Z;Wall St lower ahead of Fed decision;;Wall Street stocks hung in the doldrums on Tuesday as investors digested data showing that two pillars of the US economy – house prices and consumer confidence – continue to crumble, and a sell-off in commodities hit related stocks.The day began in downbeat fashion as markets reacted poorly to the S&P/Case Shiller 20-city house price index, which plunged for a 10th consecutive month and at an accelerating rate. The three-month annualised rate of decline in US house prices is now nearly 25 per cent.That prospect continues to damp consumer confidence. The latest survey showed consumer confidence hit the lowest level since just before the US-led invasion of Iraq.Julian Jessop at Capital Economics, said: “The financial markets may have decided that the glass is half full but consumers remain stubbornly miserable . . . All things considered, the downbeat views of consumers appear much closer to reality.”The biggest drag, however, was the materials sector which dipped 3.1 per cent, its biggest fall in over a month, following commodities prices lower.A mini-rally in technology, which climbed for the first time in three sessions, and some steady performances from consumer discretionary stocks helped markets retain a measure of composure.After a light session of trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,390.96, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent lower at 12,831.94. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,426.10.Investors remain listless ahead of a likely 25 basis point rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and a host of potentially market-moving economic data to be released later in the week.With volumes on the low side, equity markets have treaded water for much of the week so far, piqued only by news that Mars, the confectioner, could purchase chewing-gum heavyweight Wrigley for $23bn, aided by Warren Buffett.Healthcare stocks lagged as poor earnings, analyst downgrades and news of drug approval setbacks hit the sector. Merck led the fallers, dropping 10.4 per cent to $37.14 after its cholesterol pill failed to win approval. It was followed by Medco Health, down 4.3 per cent to $49.12, and Tenet Healthcare, down 2.2 per cent to $6.55.Financials were in focus after Countrywide, the mortgage lender that Bank of America has agreed to buy, reported its third quarterly loss in a row. Analysts said the results may lead Bank of America to reduce or even cancel its offer to buy the company for $4bn in stock.Countrywide shares rose 0.3 per cent to $5.85, while Bank of America lost 0.8 per cent to $37.86 and the wider sector was mixed. The S&P 500 index of financial shares ended the day down 0.6 per cent.According to KBW, of the 119 banks it covers, just over half have missed consensus earnings estimates, because of rapidly deteriorating assets. More worryingly, the growth of non-performing assets has outpaced that of reserves suggesting more problems lie ahead.Despite the negative data, homebuilder stocks, which have been unpredictable in the face of the ever-deepening housing slump, were mixed on Tuesday. DR Horton dropped 2.7 per cent to $16.69 and Pulte Homes slid 2.8 per cent to $13.80 but Lennar and Centex added 3.8 per cent to $20.28 and 4 per cent to $22.27 respectively.In materials, the mood was broadly pessimistic. Titanium Metals lost 6.1 per cent to $15.95, Monsanto fell 9.1 per cent to $110.93 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 4.4 per cent to $110.72.But there were bright spots. Office Depot said first-quarter profits fell less than expected and its shares advanced 8.7 per cent to $13.Credit card companies outperformed. Visa said profit jumped 28 per cent thanks in part to strong international growth. Visa shares, which have risen more than 70 per cent since its $17.9bn initial public offering last month, added 6.9 per cent to $80.85.Meanwhile, MasterCard, Visa’s main rival, popped 12.7 per cent to $273.34 after it said first-quarter profit soared 85 per cent to $398m thanks to strong revenues, beating estimates.Technology was among the strongest sectors in the S&P 500 on the day. Corning added 3.3 per cent to $26.53 after it said first-quarter profit more than tripled, and Yahoo and Motorola climbed 3.6 per cent to $27.37 and 5.7 per cent to $10 respectively.
155;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
156;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-16T20:39:03Z;Wall St rallies on robust results;;US stocks rallied for a second session on Wednesday after JPMorgan Chase, Coca-Cola and other leading companies reported robust results, cheering investors after a lacklustre opening to the 2008 first-quarter earnings season.JPMorgan said profit halved and it took substantial writedowns but the results were roughly in line with expectations and the shares climbed after Jamie Dimon, chief executive, said the credit crisis may be nearing an end.The third-biggest US bank has proven to be one of the more resilient institutions amid recent financial markets turmoil, allowing it to profit from the distress of competitors. Over the past year, its share price has fallen by 11 per cent compared with a 30 per cent fall for the S&P 500 financials index. JPMorgan rose 6.7 per cent to $44.96.Wednesday’s results should go some way towards reassuring investors that other banks about to release their earnings could at least hit reduced analyst targets.Merrill Lynch, which reports on Thursday, rose 3.6 per cent to $44.89 and Citigroup, which reports on Friday, climbed 2.8 per cent to $23.44. The S&P 500 index of financial stocks added 2.3 per cent.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said first-quarter profit and revenues jumped, thanks to strong trading in Latin America and Russia. It also benefited from the earnings-enhancing effect of a weaker dollar. Shares in Coca-Cola, which have gained about 18 per cent in the last year as investors have looked to consumer staples for a safe haven, added 0.1 per cent to $60.99.The positive results sparked a wider market rally that gained momentum during the day. By the close the benchmark S&P 500 index was 2.3 per cent higher at 1,364.66, its biggest gain since the start of the month. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.8 per cent to 2,350.11 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.1 per cent to 12,619.27.“There is a lot of cash on the sidelines [with investors] desperate for good news so they can get to work and start making some real returns,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim.com, an online brokerage.“Fund managers cannot continue to have 2 per cent 10-year rates, so what we are seeing today is that at any hint of good news, money comes pouring into the market.”That enthusiasm was barely dented by new data showing that inflation rose in March, potentially limiting consumer spending, while housing starts and permits fell to their lowest levels since 1991.In fact, homebuilders rose on the hope that reduced supply might begin to dent the glut of housing stock depressing prices. KB Homes added 6.6 per cent to $24.41 while Lennar climbed 6.3 per cent to $18.50.A vigorous forecast from Intel, the technology sector bellwether that reported after the close on Tuesday, helped maintain positive momentum overnight.Intel shares climbed 6.1 per cent to $22.18 while an index of technology stocks, battered in recent weeks by a series of warnings from major manufacturers, recovered 3.1 per cent.IBM rose 2.8 per cent to $120.47 in after hours trade after it posted big increases in first-quarter profits.Wednesday’s results may go some way to combat the market’s disappointment at earnings misses and reduced forecasts from blue chips Alcoa, UPS and GE last week. The picture now is a mixed one, with pockets of resilience set against a bleak backdrop of a faltering US economy.Amid the broader market rally, the industrials sector was particularly strong, buoyed by sturdy results from CSX, the railroad company. CSX climbed 3.7 per cent to $59.89 while fellow railway company Burlington Northern Santa Fe rose 4.9 per cent to $99.30.The leading sector on the S&P 500, however, was materials.US Steel rose 6 per cent to $155.37 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 7.3 per cent to $113.22. Monsanto hit a record high, gaining 7.2 per cent to $131.54.Oil prices, which touched record highs, and lower-than-expected inventories of petroleum products also lifted related stocks.Tesoro jumped 7.7 per cent to $27.99 while Exxon Mobil advanced 2.3 per cent to $92.89.
157;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-09T20:49:57Z;Wall St sags after disappointing earnings;;Wall Street stocks fell the most in eleven days as the unfolding first-quarter earnings season highlighted mounting concerns about the outlook for the US economy while record oil prices also weighed on sentiment.United Parcel Service, the logistics and package-delivery group, dropped 3.7 per cent to $70.57 after it cut its first-quarter earnings estimate, saying that domestic shipments were slowing as the US economy weakens.The company is seen as a bellwether of the wider business environment and its pre-announcement will add to concerns that the US economic slowdown, long debated by experts, is starting to be felt in the corporate world.“We think UPS’s numbers are clearly saying ‘recession’,” Rick Paterson, an analyst at UBS said.“UPS is the big dog in the transport space, hence we think FedEx will also take it on the chin and this profit warning will also resonate with US trucking, railroad, and logistics equities.” FedEx shares fell 3.1 per cent to $93.11.A broad-based sell off sent the benchmark S&P 500 index down for a second succesive session. It lost 0.8 per cent to 1,354.49 points. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1 per cent to 2,322.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.4 per cent to 12,527.26.Retailers were in focus after Bed Bath & Beyond, the home furnishings group, said fourth quarter profit fell as declining home values hit consumer spending.The company also forecast first-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ estimates.Bed Bath shares fell 4.7 per cent to $29.47 in the run up to the annoucement. Earlier in the day analysts at Piper Jaffray downgraded from “neutral” to “sell”.Amazon, the online retailer, lost 3.8 per cent to $74.39 and Google fell 0.8 per cent to $464.19 after Lehman Brothers said its first-quarter profits were at risk from an economic slowdown.Circuit City, the harassed electronics retailer, swung unexpectedly into profit in the fourth quarter, thanks to a round of cost-cutting. But it said it expected to post a loss in the first quarter, reinforcing impressions that plummeting consumer confidence is begging to take its toll on the high street. Shares in the group, which have lost more than three-quarters of their value in the past year, fell 1.8 per cent to $4.45.Homebuilders dragged on the consumer discretionary sector for a second day. Lennar dropped 7.3 per cent to $18.54 while Pulte Homes lost 6.2 per cent to $14.01.The news was not all bad though. Sealy, the bedding manufacturer, and California Pizza Kitchen, the chain restaurant operator, jumped after beating analysts’ earning estimates with their reported and forecast first quarter results.Sealy jumped 9 per cent to $7.74 while California bounced 5 per cent to $15.Industrial conglomerates, which were downgraded by analysts on Tuesday, were mixed. Boeing shares rose 4.8 per cent to $78.60, after it said delays to the 787 Dreamliner would not impact on its 2008 profit forecasts. But UPS’s outlook weighed on the sector and knocked transport stocks. Ryder System fell 4.4 per cent to $61.29.On Tuesday technology stocks bore the brunt of investor irritation, after a number of companies posted disappointing first-quarter results and forecasts.That trend continued on Wednesday with poor results and forecasts from FormFactor, a maker of chip-testing equipment, and Spansion, a maker of memory chips for mobile phones. FormFactor dropped 2.9 per cent to $18.90 while Spansion lost 0.3 per cent to $2.99.Still, news that a Japanese memory maker had raised prices helped buoy US peers. Micron advanced 3.5 per cent to $6.77. SanDisk climbed 6.5 per cent to $27.21.Downtrodden financial stocks fell again on Wednesday, hitting their lowest levels this month after a number of companies reported increased holdings of hard to value securities.An index of financial stocks dipped 1.8 per cent, while the S&P 500 investment banking index dopped 3 per cent, led by Lehman Brothers, which fell 7.2 per cent to $40.54.The three largest US mortgage insurers also tumbled after Standard & Poor’s cut their ratings. MGIC Investment fell 5.1 per cent to $10.90, PMI Group slipped 8.3 per cent to $5.66 and Radian Group plunged 12.6 per cent to $5.14.Even Citigroup, initially made ground on reports that it planned to sell nearly $12bn in leveraged loans, closed down 0.8 per cent at $23.58.Energy stocks were the only ones to end the day in the black. The sector gained for its eighth session in a row after oil prices hit record highs. Chevron added 0.8 per cent to $89.95, while Exxon Mobil rose 0.1 per cent to $89.70.
158;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-08T20:42:02Z;Wall St falls as results season starts;;US stocks ended a three session winning streak on Tuesday, falling after Alcoa kicked off the first-quarter earnings season with a downbeat set of results and Washington Mutual said it had secured a $7bn capital infusion to shore up its capital base.The largest savings and loan company in the US sold shares, at a sizeable discount, to a group of investors including TPG, the private equity firm, and said it would use the proceeds to keep its capital ratios well above required levels.The company also said it expected to report far bigger first-quarter losses than had been expected, would dramatically increase its provisions for bad loans and slash its dividend and 3,000 jobs for good measure.Washington Mutual shares, which jumped almost 30 per cent on Monday on speculation about the deal, fell back sharply on the news. The shares dropped 10.2 per cent to $11.81.That, and a striking report from the International Monetary Fund arguing that financial losses from the US mortgage crisis could hit about $1,000bn, dragged financials lower.The S&P 500 Financials index fell 1.7 per cent, led by Citigroup, which fell 3.4 per cent to $23.76, and Federated Investors, which slid 6.9 per cent to $34.80, hit by a downgrade from Goldman Sachs analysts.The IMF report undercut nascent optimism about the downtrodden sector. Earlier in the day, analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded brokers and asset managers from “neutral” to “attractive”, arguing that mortgage writedowns might “significantly exceed” actual losses.Goldman reiterated its recommendation to “buy” Lehman Brothers shares and upgraded Franklin Resources, Bank of New York Mellon, MetLife, American Express, and Janus Capital.Lehman Brothers fell 2.1 per cent to $43.67 while Bank of New York dropped 0.9 per cent to $42.98 and American Express slipped 0.2 per cent to $46.47.Still, investors found enough resilience to absorb the gloomy minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee which showed some officials were concerned about “a prolonged and severe economic downturn,” as they cut interest rates last month.Analysts at Lehman Brothers said: “The quite negative view of the economic outlook…seems likely, in our view, to trump inflation as a concern and bolsters our view of a 50 basis point rate cut at the end of the month.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,365.54 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,348.76.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3 per cent to 12,576.44.After the close on Monday, Alcoa reported declines in both sales and profits for the first quarter as the company was hit by slowing demand in its home market and rising energy and raw materials costs.The stock slipped a further 0.7 per cent to $37.18, adding to Monday’s 4 per cent decline.Industrial conglomerates also came under pressure after analysts at Morgan Stanley cut their profit estimates and target prices for the sector, arguing that orderswould fall as the economy weakened.Morgan Stanley analysts cut their 2009 profit forecasts for 16 companies, including General Electric, Emerson Electric and Honeywell, reduced their industry rating to “cautious” and encouraged investors to take profits ahead of potentially disappointing earnings towards the end of 2008.GE fell 0.8 per cent to $36.95 while Emerson dropped 2.4 per cent to $52.10 and Honeywell lost 1.6 per cent to $57.19.A sales warning overnight from AMD, the second largest microprocessor maker, also weighed on the market.The company said it would cut about 10 per cent of its workforce in response but AMD shares fell 4.9 per cent to $6.03.Elsewhere in the sector, Intel dropped 3.1 per cent to $21.08 while Novellus lost 8. per cent to $21.88.Homebuilders fell back after the latest data showed pending home sales fell more than expected in February.Lennar dropped 8.3 per cent to $20 and Pulte Homes lost 5.8 per cent to $14.94.Energy stocks helped cushion falls. Coal companies, Consol Energy and Peabody Energy climbed 4.9 per cent to $78.21 and 5.1 per cent to $59.92 respectively.
159;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-08T17:26:29Z;Investors home in on US builders;;Shares in the major US homebuilders were among the biggest gainers in the benchmark S&P 500 index in the first quarter, one of the few positive stories to emerge from the housing sector.Since the start of the year, shares in Pulte Homes have leapt by more than 50 per cent, while DR Horton shares have added 32 per cent. KB Homes and Lennar have recovered less sharply, but their stock prices have still gone up an impressive 29 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.Since peaking in 2004, the sector as a whole has lost about 64 per cent of its market value and the stocks seem cheap to some investors.Investors are making a bet that stocks will revive well before a US recession ends and, not wanting to miss out on a rally, are buying homebuilders.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “If you take the view that the recession will be short and shallow and that a lot of stimulus is in the pipeline and you want to get ahead of the curve, the cyclicals would be a reasonable place to take that position.”A gear shift in government intervention since the start of the year has also buoyed stock prices.The Federal Reserve has moved to tackle both ends of the housing downturn, cutting rates to help consumers and pumping liquidity into the financial system to unfreeze the mortgage market.Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage financiers, were cleared to pump as much as $200bn of liquidity into the beleaguered US mortgage market. Tax breaks and help on mortgage insurance is also being discussed by the US government.David Goldberg, an analyst with UBS, expects those plans to provide a marginal boost, speeding the sale of a limited number of foreclosed homes through the system and helping the smaller homebuilders that are struggling with liquidity problems.However, more fundamental problems of oversupply, falling house prices, and plummeting consumer confidence remain.Analysts at Lehman Brothers estimate that about 2.5m foreclosures will take place this year and next year, causing prices to fall at least 25 per cent from their peak before bottoming.Those factors hit homebuilders at every level. In their first-quarter earnings reports, both Lennar and KB Homes said that they were selling fewer homes for less money and were seeing customers cancel their orders at elevated rates. The result? Substantial losses.“Even if affordability improves, if buyers do not believe that prices are going to stick it impacts their confidence and keeps people out of the market,” Mr Goldberg said.He does not expect that the market will trough until 2009 at the earliest.In the meantime, any bad news, from the latest home sales statistics or house builders’ first-quarter results due shortly, could turn the homebuilders’ rally into a homebuilders’ rout.“We think the markets are playing a delusional game of numerology,” said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics.“If you own [homebuilder] stocks, now would be a good time to take chips off the table. The stocks have had a good run but the underlying fundamentals don’t support current valuations,” Mr Goldberg said.
160;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-04T20:46:53Z;Wall St investors brush off weak data;;Wall Street stocks edged higher on Friday, as investors shrugged off weak employment data which reinforced fears that the economy is now in recession, adding to significant gains made earlier in the week.“The market has been able to get its feet under itself this week,” said Richard Sparks, senior equity analyst at Schaeffers Investment Research, thanks in large part to “the absence of bad news from financials, which has been the key factor driving markets down.”“We had a big sell-off with the news of the Bear Stearns rescue, which could have been a catastrophe but wasn’t and stocks were oversold. A bounce back from that is only natural.”“Whether that is the start of something bigger, or just a bear market bounce, is tough to tell right now,” Mr Sparks said, echoing the thoughts of many investors.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.8 per cent higher for the day and was 4.2 per cent ahead for the week at 1,370.40, its best finish since the start of February.Over the week the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.9 per cent to 2,370.98 while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 3.2 per cent to 12,609.42.On Tuesday Wall Street stocks soared on news of capital raising by Lehman Brothers as investors bought back into the sector in hope that it could mark a turning point for the beleaguered financial sector.Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, raised $4bn from a sale of new shares as part of efforts to dispel persistent uncorroborated speculation that it was short of capital.At the same time, Swiss bank UBS said it would take drastic measures to restore its balance sheet after it posted $19bn in writedowns, adding that its chairman would step down.That news helped an index of financial stocks to gain 6.6 per cent over the week, placing them among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, while an index of investment banking stocks added 9.3 per cent.Lehman shares led the way, rising 16.3 per cent over the week to $44.05. Merrill Lynch added 15.8 per cent to $46.25 and Citigroup jumped 15.6 per cent to $24.08.Those shares were followed up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage finance companies that are also seeking to raise capital. Over the week Freddie climbed 8.4 per cent to $27.60 while Fannie added 16.6 per cent to $30.34.Still, analysts remain wary, repeatedly downgrading banks earnings over the course of the week.On Friday Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a brokerage that specializes in financial stocks, predicted that only 19 per cent of banks will post positive operating earnings growth in the first quarter.For much of the week investors looked forward, apprehensively, to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for March, but when it arrived, showing escalating and unexpectedly severe weakness in the US labour markets, they barely paused.Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at Global Forex Trading, said: “The recessionary trend is there for all to see with worse-than-expected figures, but the market was braced for bad news and seems to be holding up well.”“This certainly ups the odds of another fifty basis point cut at the next Fed meeting so that is providing us with some support.”Those potential cuts tempted investors into the utilities sector with its high dividend yields. Over the week the sector rose 5.1 per cent led by Dynegy, which climbed 6.9 per cent to $8.33.Economists fear that job losses could topple the US economy into a more serious downturn as households cut back on spending, undercutting economic growth.That sentiment hit consumer discretionary stocks on Friday, but over the week as a whole they proved unexpectedly resilient.JC Penney, the clothing retailer that recently surprised the market by slashing its earnings forecasts for the first quarter, bounced 7.2 per cent over the week to $40.18 while Dillards, the department store chain, was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, surging 31.7 per cent to $22.03.Markets were also lifted by energy and materials stocks that regained the leadership position they showed earlier in the year as oil pushed towards $106 a barrel and other commodities also rose.Over the week, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 11.5 per cent to $107.69 and US Steel added 11.9 per cent to $140.70.The battered housebuilding sector also found momentum.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “If you take the view that the recession will be short and shallow and that a lot of stimulus is the pipeline and you want to get ahead of the curve, the cyclicals would be a reasonable place to take that position.”The sector ended the week 12.7 per cent higher, led by Pulte Homes, up 12.6 per cent to $15.81, and Lennar, up 20.5 per cent to $21.62.A raft of news, earnings forecasts and analysts recommendations kept technology stocks in focus.Shares in eBay climbed 9 per cent to $32.94 over the week as some analysts noted that positive growth trends during March boded well for the online auctioneer.Meanwhile, semiconductor and other hardware manufacturers received a boost after Asian competitors signaled early Monday that they would raise prices.SanDisk, the flash memory maker, soared 21.5 per cent to $25.84 over the week, while Micron Technology, which makes DRAM memory chips, jumped 23.8 per cent to $6.76.
161;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Builders potential big winner from housing bill;;"Homebuilders emerged as one of the biggest potential winners from an agreement by the US Senate to move forward on a housing bill that also seeks to aid struggling homeowners.One of the provisions of the proposed bill, agreed by Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday, offers tax refunds that would allow homebuilders to “carry back” recent losses to earlier years of profit.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost to the taxpayer of the clause would be $6bn (£3.02bn). However, the Laborers International Union of North America estimates that the bill would provide $4.1bn in tax refunds for builders for 2004 alone, with as much as a third going to the 15 biggest homebuilders that are in less need of cash.Lennar, a homebuilder, could receive refunds of up to $573m for that year, while DRHorton could get up to $607m back, according to Liuna.The bill has been touted as an effort to provide relief to homeowners facing foreclosure. It offers $4bn to buy and refurbish foreclosed homes as well as $100m to help provide advice to homeowners behind on their mortgages.“A lot of these corporate homebuilders are going to be the ones that get the most back,” said Jacob Hay, a spokesman for Liuna. “They are the ones that created this mess in the first place.”Ken Leon, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, said the bill would help prepare the biggest builders build up cash to capitalise on the next housing upturn, rather than survive the current slump.“This is a cash infusion needed to prevent layoffs and avoid extremely distressed prices,” said a Senate Finance Committee aide.The National Association of Homebuilders, a lobby group, cut off all political funding in February after the tax refunds clause failed to make it into the economic stimulus package passed in January.The group has given nearly $20m in political donations since 1990, 65 per cent to Republicans and 35 per cent to Democrats. The NAHB did not respond to a request for comment.● An increase in export orders helped US services companies perform slightly better than expected last month, suggesting the sector is withstanding economic headwinds more resolutely than other parts of the
economy.Elsewhere, however, the economic outlook was more downbeat as first-time claims for unemployment benefit soared to their highest level since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said: “A jobless claims reading above 400,000, if sustained, is a very strong indicator that the economy has fallen into recession.”Consumer credit delinquencies rose to their highest level in 15 years at the end of last year."
162;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-01T20:57:29Z;US stocks soar on UBS news;;Wall Street stocks started the second quarter with a bang on Tuesday as investors cheered news of capital raising by UBS and Lehman Brothers in hope that it could mark a turning point for the beleaguered financial sector.UBS said it would take drastic measures to restore its balance sheet after it posted $19bn in writedowns, adding that its chairman would step down.Its shares rose sharply, as did other European banks, and the sentiment lifted US markets from the open.JPMorgan rose 9.4 per cent to $47 while Goldman Sachs added 6.9 per cent to $176.86 and Citigroup, climbed 11.3 per cent to $23.84.An index of investment bank stocks climbed 9 per cent, but still remains down 20 per cent over the year to date.Investors also received a boost from Lehman, the investment bank, which raised $4bn from a sale of new shares as part of efforts to dispel persistent uncorroborated speculation that it was short of capital.Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said further significant capital fund raises by other financial institutions were likely going forward.Lehman shares were the biggest gainers on the S&P500 index, rising 17.8 per cent to $44.34 for the first time in seven sessions.The shares were followed up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage finance companies that are also seeking to raise capital. Freddie climbed 15.4 per cent to $29.22 while Fannie added 19.7 per cent to $31.50.Rebecca Engmann Darst, an analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Investors appeared invigorated by today’s [Tuesday’s] “kitchen sink” writedowns by UBS and news of a stock offering by rumor-dunned brokerage Lehman Brothers.”“But as to the question of whether the market is “out of the woods” a look at Tuesday’s Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, [a measure of market risk] trading in further-out months suggests traders hardly banking on a permanent pullback in volatility.”News from KKR Financial and further analyst earnings downgrades for the banking sector as a whole failed to dent the ebulliant mood.The debt investment arm of the well known buyout company said on Monday night it had taken steps to appease lenders, handing over collateral, selling a controlling interest in its real estate investment trust and announcing a plan to sell an additional 20m shares.KKR Financial shares fell 8.7 per cent to $11.56.Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman lent added drama to recent events, arguing in a report that the credit market turmoil posed the most severe crisis for investment banks in 30 years.Under their worst case scenarios total revenues could drop 45 per cent compared to 2007 while longer term return on equity could decline as banks delevered and were forced by regulators to hold more capital in reserve.The benchmark S&P500 was closed 3.6 per cent higher at 1,370.18, climbing the most on the first day of a second quarter since 1938 and shrugging off what was a dismal first quarter.The Nasdaq Composite added 3.7 per cent to 2,362.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.2 per cent to 12,654.36.A bounce in technology and consumer discretionary stocks that were heavily sold last week on poor economic data and earnings contributed to the broad-based rally.Coach, the maker of luxury leather goods, rose 6.4 per cent to $32.09, JC Penney, the department store climbed 6.4 per cent to $40.12, and SanDisk, the maker of flash memory cards, jumped 9.8 per cent to $24.77.The latest numbers from the Institute for Supply Management survey for March, helped reinforce sentiment showing US manufacturing contracted less than expected in March.But James Knightley, an economist at ING, cautioned that beneath the headlines, ”the new orders number dropped sharply - an awful outcome - and [was] the weakest number since the last recession.”General Electric climbed for a second day, adding 3.8 per cent to $38.43 as investors bought into industrials on the news.Other data out on Tuesday showed that construction expenditures fell for a fifth consecutive month in February amid the ongoing housing recession.Housing stocks shrugged off the news for the most part. Lennar rose 13.7 per cent to $21.38 while KB Homes climbed 8.9 per cent to $26.93.Centex also rallied, 2.6 per cent to $24.86, after taking steps to deleverage including the sale of properties for about $455m.Even news that sales at US automakers fell more than expected in March couldn’t dampen the enthusiasm.Shares in GM rose 5.8 per cent to $20.15 while Ford added 4.4 per cent to $5.97.Elsewhere, bid news and rumours helped buoy indices.CSK Auto rose 25.7 per cent to $11.70 after O’Reilly Automotive, an auto-parts chain, agreed to buy the company for about $1bn, including about $500m of debt. The move will create the third-largest auto-parts retailer in the US.Expedia, the online travel services company, was among the S&P 500’s biggest gainers, climbing 10.1 per cent to $24.09 on unconfirmed bid speculation..
163;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-04-01T18:46:58Z;US land sales;;Banks aren’t the only companies stashing piles of cash under the mattress. Homebuilder Centex has agreed to sell 10 per cent of its land portfolio to a group of real estate investors to boost its cash position, three months after builder Lennar sold 11,000 home sites into a joint venture led by Morgan Stanley.Centex’s 8,500 lots, mainly lower-quality properties, drew solid interest from developers, buy-out investors and hedge funds that have been prowling the sector for months.But even so, the land sold at a 69.5 per cent discount to the $528m value at which it is listed on Centex’s books. Think that’s cheap? Compared with an estimated original purchase price of about $1bn, the land sold for just 16 cents in the dollar.Land of different quality and cash-generating potential will fetch different prices, so it is tough to say the sale sets a floor. But other builders are weighing whether to sell property before the chance to use the resulting losses as a tax break goes.Centex, which will also dispose of an unrelated pest control business for $137m, says its property sale will generate a $294m cash tax refund. That tax twist incentivises time-sensitive sellers to accept lower prices and lessens buyers’ chances of suffering from short-term remorse.Centex also adopted a conservative stance in negotiating what it would retain in the venture to strengthen its case for moving the properties off its balance sheet, after Lennar failed to get such treatment. Only a few large pools of property have hit the market recently, and land deals can be incredibly complicated. But with so many economic incentives working to propel transactions, and a heavy roster of experienced, well-capitalised buyers waiting on the sidelines, this discounted land-grab is not likely to be the year’s last.Post and read comments on this Lex
164;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-03-27T20:30:43Z;US shares fall amid earnings concerns;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second day in a choppy trading on Thursday as concerns about earnings in the technology and financial sectors overcame initial enthusiasm at better-than-expected data on employment and growth.On Wednesday night Oracle posted disappointing results which knocked sentiment in the whole sector, analysts said.Third quarter sales at the software company were $5.35bn, undershooting analysts’ forecast for $5.42bn, while net income climbed 30 percent to $1.34bn.Oracle, which is often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector and of the broader business environment, said an increased threat of a recession had made customers more prudent in their technology spending.“[The results] put salt in the wound and reminded people that tech earnings are not going to be as ebullient as was hoped,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The market had a big rally last week and when you are consolidating you are vulnerable to almost anything - good news, no news or bad news.”Oracle shares dropped 7.2 per cent to $19.43. Fellow software companies Microsoft and Akamai Technologies also slipped - 1.8 per cent to $28.05 and 6.4 per cent to $30.06, respectively.Meanwhile, Google stocks dropped, 3.1 per cent to $444.08, after the internet search company said it had seen slower growth in clicks on text ads, adding to worries about an economic slowdown.The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.9 per cent at 2,280.83 points while the benchmark S&P500 index - which rose as much as 0.3 per cent before falling back - dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,325.78 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 per cent to 12,302.70 points.Banks remained in focus after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said that Merrill Lynch and UBS may post losses this quarter on write-downs of $6bn and $11.1bn, respectively, due to escalating credit problems.Merrill shares fell 5.7 per cent to $41.90 and an index of investment banking stocks slid 5.1 per cent.On Wednesday Ms Whitney slashed her earnings estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 by an average of 84 per cent for a number of related banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and Wachovia.Citigroup lost 1.2 per cent to $21.79, Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $38.64 and Wachovia lost 3.4 per cent to $27.07.Lehman stocks were worst hit by the sector sell off, slumping 8.9 per cent to $38.71.Ms Whitney noted that further downward revisions were likely and that banks’ capital ratios could come under serious strain going forward as ratings downgrades to securities forced banks to hold more capital in reserve.In February over $370bn of securities were downgraded – more than three times the amount downgraded in October which was previously the single most disruptive month for the debt market in terms of selling pressure from ratings.“As many expected the fourth quarter to be the ”kitchen sink” for the industry, we believe first quarter results, to be reported in two weeks time, will be a rude awakening,” she said.Markets initially rallied after new data showed that initial jobless claims fell unexpectedly and revised growth figures suggested that the US consumer was not quite ready to give up spending.But by mid-afternoon that enthusiasm had for the most part petered out.Results from Lennar however, provided some unexpected momentum for housebuilders. The company reported $88.2m losses in the first quarter due to write downs in asset value.Sales plummeted 62 per cent to $1.06bn compared to last year and average selling prices, deliveries of new homes and new home orders also dropped, while the cancellation rate hit 26 per cent.Still, moderately optimistic outlook statements from Lennar executives helped the stock gained 1.8 per cent to $17.90.Housebuilders proved particularly resilient given data released on Tuesday painting a bleak picture of a sector stung by declining house prices.Pulte Homes added 1.6 per cent to $14.42 and DR Horton rose 2.2 per cent to $15.53.Utility stocks were the only other bright spot as upgraded earnings forecasts helped drive shares Sempra Energy higher, and peers benefited from investors looking for a safe haven.Sempra shares added 3.9 per cent to $53, while Teco Energy rose 2.8 per cent to $15.74.
165;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-03-26T21:07:05Z;US shares fall as recession fears reinforced;;Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday, snapping a three session winning streak after new data suggested the broader US economy faces a downturn and concerns about banks’ earnings weighed on sentiment.Durable goods orders in February unexpectedly dropped 1.7 per cent - and by 2.6 per cent excluding volatile orders for transport equipment - according to the Commerce Department.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said: ”This weaker than expected report points to declining capital spending in the first quarter, falling orders, and a significant pickup in inventories in relation to sales. This is another report that has a strong recessionary feel about it.”The numbers for machinery orders were notably anaemic and the news hit shares in General Electric and United Technologies.GE fell 0.3 per cent to $37.15 while United Technologies dropped 0.8 per cent to $69.61.The series comes after another batch of economic indicators on Tuesday highlighted plummeting confidence among consumers in the US and further pain in the housing sector.Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said: “Now that we have moved past the euphoria about Bear Stearns being bought out and the steps that central banks are taking, we are back to thinking about micro-economics and about consumer confidence and the like.”The benchmark S&P 500 index - which fell as much as 1.2 per cent - closed down 0.9 per cent at 1,341.13 points, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,324.36 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 12,422.86.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in February fell less than expected but still at the slowest sales pace since February 1995.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the data, in addition to other recent reports, suggested home sales could be approaching a bottom but shares in house builders tumbled nonetheless.Centex fell 8 per cent to $23.73 while Lennar lost 6.8 per cent to $17.59.Hovnanian fell 9.4 per cent to $11.05 after Moody’s cuts its rating, citing losses, high debt and a weak macro environment for the economy and for housebuilders.Moody’s said the ratings outlook for the company was negative.The banking sector was also in sharp focus again after Germany’s Deutsche Bank warned that disruptions to revenues and writedowns relating to the global credit crisis could threaten its annual profit targets.On Tuesday a number of banking analysts cut their estimates for the sector, pushing financials into the red.That trend continued after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Ms Whitney sharply cut her estimates for Citigroup by 309 per cent to reflect possible writedowns of $13.1bn in the first quarter of 2008, on mortgage backed securities and other assets.Citigroup shares fell 5.9 per cent to $22.05 and an index of investment banking shares fell 4.1 per cent.Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank by assets, dropped for a second day, falling 2.8 per cent to $39.84, while Wachovia lost 6.7 per cent to $28.02.Fresh doubts emerged about the Clear Channel takeover. The two private equity firms leading a $19bn buyout of the largest US radio operator are at odds with banks financing the deal, increasing speculation that the deal could collapse.Clear Channel shares plunged 17.3 per cent to $26.93 in morning trading.Technology stocks too were sold off as investors worried about what third quarter results from Oracle, after the close, might contain.Oracle, often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector, was down 0.7 per cent at $20.94 at the close.Microsoft fell 2 per cent to $28.57 and Novell also dropped 0.6 per cent to $6.52.Commodity-related stocks were the exception to the bearish mood, climbing for a third straight day as oil prices rose and further dollar weakness sustained the recovery in gold, base metals and agricultural commodities after last week’s sell-off.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining added 5.4 per cent to $97.44 and 1.3 per cent to $47.44 respectively.Shares in oil companies rose after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said crude oil will average $92.30 a barrel this year, up 27 percent from last year as declining reserves increase extraction costs.The New York-based investment firm also raised its price targets for related companies including Apache, which was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, up 6 per cent to $119.75.But higher oil prices hit airline stocks. American Airlines shares slid 10.6 per cent to $8.61 and Delta shares fell 12.3 per cent to $8.74.
166;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-03-25T17:21:28Z;Vultures circle US real estate;;The vultures are circling US real estate, looking for high returns and low prices amid the fallout from the housing slump and the credit crisis.At least $30bn has been or is being raised to invest in distressed property since last August, according to Costar Group, which tracks commercial real estate transactions. “Distress right now is our biggest theme,” said a senior manager at a big Wall Street investor.Property investors are seeking opportunities in housing and commercial developments as the housing market has worsened, forcing homebuilders to liquidate land and homes at knockdown prices. House prices in the top 20 US cities have fallen by 12.6 per cent since their high in 2006, according to the S&P Case Schiller index, leaving homebuyers cautious and causing record levels of defaults on mortgages.There are already some early deals being done. Florida homebuilder Tarragon is doing due diligence on taking a stake in a near-$100m deal to buy more than 1,000 apartments in six locations across Florida at more than a 50 per cent discount to their value two years ago, according to Bill Friedman, its chief executive. “There is a lot of talk and a lot of people looking,” he said.Steve Braun of JI Kaslik, a private real estate investor, said the company had been bidding for non-performing commercial mortgages, recently offering $8.5m for $16m in mortgages covering 643 apartments in Greenville, North Carolina, and Houston. It also recently bid $4.5m for a $15m mortgage on 190,000 sq ft of office space in a mixed office and apartment development in Jacksonville owned by local developer Cameron Kuhn, he said.In November, in one of the earliest signs of the opportunities in distressed real estate, Lennar, the second biggest US homebuilder, offloaded about 11,000 home sites at a near 60 per cent discount to their $1.3bn book value to Morgan Stanley Real Estate.Morgan Stanley and Colony Capital are among those believed to be raising funds for distressed real estate. Goldman Sachs is raising a fund, part of which may be used to invest in real estate bonds and mezzanine loans. Morgan Stanley, Colony Capital and Goldman refused to comment.
167;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-03-18T19:48:43Z;US stocks rally on rate decision;;"US stocks ended sharply higher on Tuesday after investors embraced the Fed’s decision to cut rates by a less-than-expected 75 basis points in spite of initial concerns.The benchmark S&P 500 index briefly gave up some gains after the Fed announcement, but by the end of the day it had surged 4.2 per cent to 1,330.71 points, its biggest one day rally in five years.The Nasdaq composite index jumped 4.2 per cent to 2,268.26 points while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.5 per cent to 12,392.66.Analysts said that the Federal Reserve had broadly delivered on expectations that it would slash interest rates to protect America’s creaking banking system and shock the economy back into growth.But they warned that the current rally could be short lived given the underlying problems of the US economy.Leo Kamp, chief economist at financial services company TIAA-CREF, said: “The pattern we have seen in the past will repeat with an initial rally and then earnings reports showing that risks in the economy are still there starting to resonate and you won’t get even much of an uplift going forward and perhaps you will get declines.”Stocks had made substantial gains on the back of better than expected results from investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers.The results helped markets brush aside another round of weak economic data and even regain ground lost on Monday during the panic surrounding the near-collapse of Bear Stearns.On Monday Lehman stock dropped as much as 35 per cent. On Tuesday its shares came back 46.4 per cent to $46.49. Goldman shares added 16.27 per cent to $175.59.Lehman shares have been heavily sold amid persistent rumours – and company denials – that it has similar liquidity problems to those that brought down Bear Stearns.Other financial stocks followed Lehman and Goldman up and an index of investment banks rallied 17.5 per cent, while the broader index of S&P 500 financial stocks rose 8.5 per cent.Morgan Stanley shares rose 17.8 per cent to $42.86 and even Bear Stearns stock, which has collapsed since it agreed to be taken over by JPMorgan, found momentum when investors bet that litigation could create upside. Bear shares rose 22.9 per cent to $5.91.Shares in Ambac, the embattled bond insurer, rose 15.5 per cent to $6.25 after it said it had no material exposure to Bear Stearns. MBIA, another bond insurer, rose 14 per cent to $12.31.Amidst the welter of announcements, investors paid little heed to a clutch of significant data releases. The producer price index – a measure of inflation – rose at the fastest pace in more than a year.Building permits granted in February fell more than expected, hitting their lowest levels in 16 years. For the most part, housing stocks shrugged off the broadly downbeat news to focus on some positive elements.David Greenlaw, at Morgan Stanley, said: “On the bright side, the collapse in single-family starts should eventually lead to a correction in the bloated inventory of unsold new homes and this should ultimately help stabilise the housing market. The correction process will take more time to play out, as the pipeline of ongoing construction needs to be cleared.”The S&P 500 homebuilders index rose 10.8 per cent, led by Centex, up 14.6 per cent at $22.27, and Lennar, up 13.4 per cent to $16.06.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage companies, jumped the most in at least two decades after the Wall Street Journal reported that regulators could ease restrictions that have reined in growth at the companies. Fannie Mae was up 27.1 per cent at $28.22. Freddie Mac rose 26.2 per cent to $26.02.The move would enable the government-sponsored lenders to buy and guarantee more mortgages.Howard Shapiro, analyst at Fox Pitt-Kelton, said any such decision represented “another significant measure to return liquidity and stability to the capital markets, the largest of which are the mortgage market”.Yahoo said it expected roughly to double operating cash flow over the next three years and generate $8.8bn in revenue after costs in 2010. Yahoo shares rose
7 per cent to $27.66."
168;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-01-28T21:49:02Z;Wall St rallies on rate cut hopes;;Wall Street stocks rallied on Monday, after overcoming an initial wobble, as hopes for more aggressive interest rate cuts spurred gains in financial companies ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on Tuesday.US equities, although volatile, fared much better than traders had feared, after a sharp sell-off in Asia and Europe looked set to deliver another down day in the US.The outlook for investors was far from serene after new home sales plunged to a 12-year low and McDonald’s shares hit the skids after disappointing December same-store sales.The S&P 500 closed up 1.8 per cent at 1,353.97 points having fallen 0.6 per cent at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average put on 1.5 per cent to 12,383.89 while the Nasdaq Composite rallied strongly to close up 1 per cent at 2,349.91 after it briefly turned negative in afternoon trade.Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said equities were showing tentative signs of stabilising. “Three out of the last four days we have finished up near the highs of the day, that’s a real turn from the way the market has behaved.”A factor that may decide if stocks can find a footing this week will be the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate policy. Since the Fed made an emergency 75 basis point rate cut last week investors have been divided over whether the central bank will cut rates 25bp or 50bp when its meeting concludes on Wednesday.The futures market has priced in an 86 per cent chance the Fed will take the more dovish approach – to lower the Fed funds rate to 3 per cent.“Anything less than 25bp would probably risk a significant negative reaction in the financial markets,” said Maury Harris, an economist at UBS Investment Research.In spite of the rally investors were still awaiting a clear signal about whether equities have become oversold or if recent upticks were merely the product of a fleeting bear-market rally.Given fears the economy is entering a recession, this week’s data on the state of the labour and housing markets are important.New home sales fell 4.7 per cent to a 604,000 annual rate in December, the lowest reading in 12 years, compared with expectations of about 650,000.The homebuilder sector pared early losses to extend last week’s 28 per cent rally as traders bet that rate cuts would help the sector. The S&P homebuilder index climbed 6.4 per cent to 426.29, with Lennar up 9 per cent at $18.50.“The stock market apparently believes the worst is over,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “[But] we think the downside for activity and prices remains considerable. To repeat, there is no sign of a bottom in any of these data.”Confidence in the health of the US consumer took another dent on Monday after McDonald’s reported flat December same-store sales owing to a softening in consumer spending. The stock fell 5.6 per cent to $51.07 while rival Wendy’s gave up 5.3 per cent to $23.92. Also in the consumer sector, Sears Holdings rose 1.3 per cent to $100.28 after its chief executive left. Financial companies en­joyed the best of the gains, with Lehman Brothers rising 4.8 per cent to $60.63 and JPMorgan up 4.4 per cent at $45.57.After the close American Express said fourth quarter profit fell 10 per cent, in line with estimates, after it took a charge to cover bad loans. The shares closed up 4.3 per cent at $47.40 but fell 2.8 per cent after hours.The telecoms sector came under early pressure before rebounding after Verizon Communications reported weakness in its fixed line business. Quarterly earnings rose 3.9 per cent, in line with expectations and the shares closed up 0.9 per cent at $38.11. Corning, gained 3.3 per cent to $23.10 after it raised fourth-quarter profit 11 per cent amid heavy demand for glass used in flat-screen TVs and computers. Gains in the transport sector were limited after YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell to a $735.8m loss – far worse than expected. The shares fell 14.7 per cent to $16.08.Alliance Data Systems’ $6.76bn buy-out by Blackstone was put into doubt. Shares in the credit card services provider plunged 35.2 per cent to $42.48 while Blackstone slipped 1.1 per cent to $19.15.
169;LEN;Lennar Corp;2008-01-25T22:23:31Z;US housebuilders;;Another day, another round of massive land inventory writedowns by US homebuilders. If the housing slump has taught Wall Street anything, it may be to avoid relying on stated book values when judging a housebuilder’s worth.Slumping land prices, combined with charges for deferred tax assets that will not be realised, could slice almost 20 per cent off the shareholders’ equity of homebuilders for the fourth quarter, according to JPMorgan. Lennar blew past analysts’ expectations on Thursday with land-related writedowns of $1.7bn, indicating that the actual pain in the sector could be even worse.As the hits to equity keep coming, US builders are dropping close to – and in many cases, below – the minimum tangible net worth requirements specified in their bank loan covenants. At the end of the third quarter, the industry’s cushion above those requirements sat at 24 per cent. It could deflate to just 3 per cent for the end of the fourth quarter, JPMorgan predicts. Lennar, KB Home and Hovnanian recently dropped below their net worth requirements, and Centex is likely to do the same.Builders are thus heading back to their lenders again, cap in hand, to secure amendments to credit agreements that may also reduce their borrowing capacity. That should be workable, as long as they can continue selling enough cut-price homes to bring in cash. But bank lenders’ flexibility could vanish if writedowns persist quarter after quarter.December brought an encouraging reduction in the overhang of existing single-family homes for sale, to 9.2 months. But the rate at which those homes are being sold also slowed further. Still, interest rate cuts and discounts on new homes are slowly making buying more affordable. Although a spike in unemployment could undermine demand, top builders are generating enough cash to keep lenders at bay – at least for now.Post and read comments on this Lex
170;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;US housebuilder Lennar takes $1.25bn loss;;Lennar, the second biggest US housebuilder by units sold, on Thursday reported a record $1.25bn loss in the fourth quarter as the value of its land holdings plummeted.The company took a $1.86bn impairment charge for land, inventory and goodwill in the quarter ending in November, which included a $740m loss on 11,000 lots the company sold to its joint venture with Morgan Stanley. Lennar said its land portfolio was worth $4.5bn at the beginning of its first quarter, down from $7.8bn the year before.The impairment charge takes the total amount written off by the housebuilding industry to nearly $20bn since the beginning of 2006, according to calculations by Standard & Poor’s.Lennar said it lost $7.92 a share, almost four times more than analysts had predicted. The impairment charge was equivalent to $7.50 a share. Revenue fell 49 per cent to $2.18bn.Housebuilders, including DR Horton, the largest in the US, are expected to write off billions more this year as they shed inventory and generate cash to remain solvent, analysts say.Five of the top 11 US builders to report this quarter have so far written off $3.2bn on land and other assets, and UBS estimated this month that the remaining six are expected to write off at least another $1.5bn.“You’re going to see a lot more land sales,” said Stephen East, an analyst at Pali Capital. “That’s going to depress land and housing prices further.”Stuart Miller, Lennar chief executive, called his group’s results “disappointing”. He said: “It is apparent that 2007 was a very tough year. At the back end of this year I do not expect to see sales or price acceleration.”Lennar said new orders for the fourth quarter fell 50 per cent and the cancellation rate was 33 per cent.Sales incentives rose 24 per cent to $58,800 a home against the fourth quarter last year. Average sales prices dropped 4 per cent to $291,000.The company said it would record a cash benefit in the first quarter of $852m from taxes returned because of the losses it made in 2005-06.Hopes for builders are pinned on an uptick after the US Federal Reserve cut rates by 75 basis points this week and government moves to assist the housing sector after the subprime debacle.Shares in Lennar rose 8.5 per cent to close at $16.21. Its shares have risen about 25 per cent since the emergency Fed cut on Tuesday.
171;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-12-21T19:49:11Z;US housebuilders’ joint ventures;;The investments are off-balance sheet, their underlying assets have plunged in value and their risks are difficult to quantify. Sound familiar? Many structured investment vehicles would fit that bill. But so would the hundreds – perhaps thousands – of opaque joint ventures formed in the past 15 years by US housebuilders.After the last housing slump ended in the early 1990s, builders began to use joint ventures to manage land inventories. That, and the widespread use of options on land instead of outright purchases, helped boost their credit ratings. But the proliferation of complicated JVs by some builders, including KB Home, Centex and particularly Lennar, is depressing their share prices and scaring off buyers of distressed land holdings. The top 15 public builders have taken $16.5bn in writedowns since the start of 2006. Of that, $1bn stemmed from JVs, according to Standard & Poor’s.Housebuilders reveal scant information about their JVs. More worrisome is that the legal and financial structure of each is different, as is the level of recourse lenders have to the venture’s assets.Investors are not the only ones who find it hard to gauge builders’ JV liabilities. Technical Olympic USA’s own miscalculations have brought it to the edge of bankruptcy. Tousa’s overpriced venture with Transeastern turned insolvent as the Florida housing market went into free fall. Tousa felt its liability was limited. But after lenders threatened to force it into bankruptcy to trigger full recourse, Tousa took on an oppressive $500m of debt to settle the claims.Builders can provide more clarity on these ventures without giving away competitive advantages – and they should. Tousa’s joint venture was huge, over-leveraged, ambiguous and in a bubble market. That is a lesson in what not to do. But it was not the only builder to wade into the JV morass. Lightning often strikes more than once.
172;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-12-07T21:36:36Z;Wall St achieves back-to-back weekly gains;;Wall Street achieved back-to-back weekly gains on Friday. Investors are hoping that another Federal Reserve rate cut, and a White House plan to resolve some of the pain afflicting holders of subprime mortgages, can prevent the credit squeeze from freezing the broad economy.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,504.66, but was higher by 1.6 per cent this week. For the year, the S&P is up 6.1 per cent, about 4 per cent below its 2007 peak of 1,565.15, set in October.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,706.16 on Friday, a rise of 1.7 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a fraction higher to 13,625.58, up 1.9 per cent since Monday.The worst fears of investors about the economy were not met on Friday, when the November employment report recorded a gain of 94,000 jobs. The report was not strong enough to change expectations that policymakers will ease the Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent next week.“I think the Fed will still cut rates, as they would rather be safe than sorry,” said Scott Wren, senior equity analyst at AG Edwards.Analysts are worried about how the economy and earnings will fare in the coming months as banks scale back their lending and house prices are seen falling further.The US administration’s plan to help some holders of subprime mortgage modify their loans was described as being no “silver bullet“ by Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary.That came after data showed the share of mortgages more than 30-days delinquent reached 5.6 per cent in the third quarter, the highest level since 1986.“Investors are attempting to fathom the depths of the credit crunch and its subsequent impact on consumer borrowing and the housing market,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Financials rebounded 0.5 per cent this week, but remain 15.6 per cent lower for the year. The outlook for the sector’s earnings in the fourth quarter darkened and these are now seen falling 35 per cent after a 27 per cent slide in the third quarter, according to Thomson Financial.With materials companies facing a decline of 6 per cent in their fourth-quarter earnings, overall average S&P 500 earnings are now seen falling 0.8 per cent.This bleak outlook for the current quarter follows a fall of 4.5 per cent in S&P earnings for the third quarter. The last time S&P earnings fell in two consecutive quarters was in the last quarter of 2001 and the first three months of 2002.“History has shown that the equities do not fare well in the face of a recession,’’ said Mr Ablin. “The S&P 500 dropped more than 20 per cent in the 12 months leading up to the last recession in March 2001.’’This year, as financials and consumer discretionary stocks and other areas of the market – such as small companies – have been hit hard by the credit squeeze, investors have sought large companies with exposure to the global economy.The falling dollar has inflated foreign based earnings, but this week central banks in Canada and the UK cut interest rates, weakening their currencies.“The recession clock in the US ticks steadily closer to midnight,’’ said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS. “We see developing economic weakness among key US trading partners as another link in the chain that ends with a recession in the US with the vital export sector as a transmission.’’Mr Wren said consumer staples and healthcare stocks, up 13.8 per cent and 9.4 per cent in the S&P, respectively, this year, are safe places for investors.He added that financials may be a story next year. “If the Fed cuts rates to 3 per cent, financials will benefit.”Among stocks in the news this week, Lennar, the home builder, rose 15.7 per cent to $18.32 after it announced a joint venture with Morgan Stanley’s real estate unit.A sense that homebuilders are getting on top of their inventory problems powered a 16.6 per cent rally in S&P homebuilder index this week. Since making a low of 291.55 in late November, the index has risen more than 30 per cent, clipping its loss this year to 57 per cent.Mixed retail sales for November were reflected in the share prices of retailers. JC Penney gained 8.6 per cent to $47.92, while Target lost 7.4 per cent to $55.51.Financials did experience a number of downgrades this week, and on Friday American Express fell 4.3 per cent to $56.96 after Merrill Lynch cut it to a “sell”. Bond insurers were hit after Moody’s said MBIA might need additional capital and the stock fell 17.8 per cent to $30.American International Group rallied 5.7 per cent to $61.45 as the insurer soothed investors after announcing its exposure to subprime losses.Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry devices, fell 8.9 per cent to $103.65 after a brokerage downgrade.Activision, the video game publisher rose 20.9 per cent at $26.79, after Vivendi said it planned to buy a controlling stake in the company.Comcast said 2007 revenue would be lower and expenses higher than previously forecast. The cable operator fell 11 per cent to $18.28.Intel rose 6.3 per cent to $27.73, and is up 37 per cent in 2007, after the chip maker was upgraded to overweight by Thomas Weisel Partners.Macrovision, a developer of technology that prevents unauthorised copying and viewing of video, said it would buy Gemstar, the television listings provider, for $2.8bn in cash and stock on Friday. Shares in Macrovision were 21.4 per cent lower at $20.44, while Gemstar had dropped 16.6 per cent to $4.99.At the start of trading, Wall Street was set for gains after a modest rise in the number of jobs created in November left the door open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.Non-farm payrolls expanded by 94,000, down from a revised gain of 170,000 in October. Economists had expected a rise of 75,000 jobs last month, but in recent days some had raised their estimate to 125,000 after a strong private-sector reading on Wednesday. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.7 per cent.“Overall, these data should not change anyone’s mind at the Fed or otherwise regarding the health of the economy or the prospect of rate cuts,” said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers.Within the US jobs report, average hourly earnings increased 0.5 per cent and were up 3.8 per cent from a year earlier. September job creation was revised sharply lower from 96,000 to 44,000.Construction employment fell 24,000, the fifth-straight monthly decline, while financial services payrolls fell 20,000. In contrast, service-sector employment rose 127,000. Retail payrolls rose 24,200, breaking a run of three straight monthly declines.
173;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-12-05T19:07:48Z;US builders seek refunds;;Can struggling US home builders turn the tax collector into Robin Hood? After Lennar cut a deal on the last day of its fiscal year to sell illiquid land and secure a $300m tax refund, others are also looking to ditch depressed property assets and inject cash into their businesses.It makes sense for builders to consider liquidity-boosting options while they are available. There is no shortage of investors looking to snap up land when the price is right. Home builders may end up selling at excessive discounts but their losses could be even worse if they wait and the housing slump gets worse. Property values are still sinking, and builders are expected to take further impairments on land and housing stock in the fourth quarter.Some investors want to buy minority stakes in homebuilders or, for the worst hit, step in as lenders of last resort. But before they yield to vultures, builders are weighing deals among themselves that could win valuable tax refunds. By swapping plots of land this fiscal year, they could book losses on inventory to offset profits generated back in 2005, before the market turned down.Such deals would accelerate tax benefits by yielding refunds in cash, rather than as credits against future profits. Given homebuilders’ funding requirements and the time value of money, that makes a lot of sense. US savings and loan companies swapped beaten-down mortgage portfolios in the 1970s and 1980s. The method could also, arguably, be used today by financial institutions burdened with troubled mortgage portfolios.“Carry-backs” on net operating losses are valid for only two years. But during the economic downturn in 2002, President George W. Bush temporarily lengthened that window. As the government tries to limit the fallout from the housing slump, homebuilders may consider pushing for him to do it again.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.4 per cent at 13,314.57.Utility stocks were one of the few bright spots as Treasury yields fell sharply. The Dow Utilities Average closed at a record high of 537.52.The yield on the two-year note was around 2.9 per cent after news that the manufacturing sector expanded at its slowest pace in 10 months during November and the employment sub index contracted.The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index fell to 50.8, from 50.9 in October. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.The ISM’s employment index fell to 47.8 from 52 and bond traders say the November payroll report due on Friday, may be much weaker than a forecast rise of 70,000 jobs.“The manufacturing sector continues along at ‘stall speed’, torn between the uplift from the weak US dollar and strong global growth on the one side and weak domestic economy on the other,” said TJ Marta, fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.The slowing US economy and tightening credit standards leave corporate earnings looking vulnerable in 2008.Fourth-quarter earnings are forecast to grow just 1.2 per cent, down from 11.5 per cent at the start of October, according to Thomson Financial. That is after average earnings fell 4.4 per cent in the third quarter.Financials account for much of the decline as they are expected to post a 28 per cent fall in the fourth quarter. In contrast, technology earnings are expected to rise 22 per cent in the fourth quarter said Thomson.Looking at prospects in 2008, Merrill Lynch expects a 7.3 per cent fall in operating earnings a share for S&P 500 companies. This compares with a consensus view of 14 per cent EPS growth next year which “is far too optimistic”, said Merrill. “So be prepared for a tsunami of earnings downgrades in 2008, which then means that investors should retain a defensive, high-quality portfolio with a focus on stable earnings and reliable dividends.”Among the major S&P sectors, financials led declines, down 1.2 per cent, as money market rates edged higher and Moody’s placed $105bn of structured investment vehicles on rating watch negative.“The funding crisis will not be easily turned around, at least until, as we expect, the Federal Reserve cuts rates again in mid-December,” said economists at Deutsche bank.Leading financials lower were Fannie Mae, down 5.7 per cent at $36.25, and Freddie Mac off 4.4 per cent at $33.53.Citigroup closed 0.7 per cent lower at $33.06, as $64.9bn of the bank’s SIVs were effected by the Moody’s rating action.AIG was a drag on the Dow as it fell 2.1 per cent to $56.90.Technology stocks were also on the defensive. Research In Motion, the maker of Blackberry devices, fell 8 per cent to $104.75 after a brokerage downgrade.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,637.13, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 1 per cent to 2,067.45.Other stocks in the news, General Motors fell 4.1 per cent to $28.61 as its car sales fell 11 per cent last month. Ford declined 3.5 per cent to $7.25 after a small rise in monthly sales.Activision, the video game publisher was up 12.7 per cent at $24.97, after Vivendi said it planned to buy a controlling stake in the company and combine it with its game unit.Lennar, the home builder, rose 5.7 per cent to $16.74 after it announced a joint venture with Morgan Stanley’s real estate unit.In another bearish sign for the US equity market, domestic mutual funds suffered an outflow of $3.71bn in October, after a decline of $4.1bn in September, according to Citigroup.“These funds have witnessed six consecutive months of outflows, totalling $42.03bn, which is the largest six-month total since the period-ending December 2002,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citi.“The individual investor has maintained a pessimistic view of the US stock market,” he said, as domestic funds are in contention to eclipse their 2002 annual record outflow of $24.8bn.One bright spot, however has been the a rise of $43.94 in net issuance of exchange traded funds in the past six months.‘’It seems that hedge funds, who are more likely to utilize ETF’s, and mutual fund participants are at odds with each other,’’ said Mr Levkovich. ‘’We view this sceptical sentiment as a positive for US markets and any potential pick-up in fund flows would likely benefit domestic stocks.’’
175;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-12-03T20:19:34Z;Distressed US property;;Step one in a recovery? Admit you have a problem. US mortgage lenders and homebuilders have taken enormous writedowns this year on home loans and property. But no clearing price emerged at which they could agree to offload their stricken assets to cautious buyers.Two big deals in recent days, however, suggest cash-strapped sellers have started to acquiesce to distressed buyers’ terms. Capitalism’s self-correcting mechanism may be creaking into gear, just as the US government considers whether to monkey with the mortgage market.Home builder Lennar has cut a deal to sell an 80 per cent stake in 11,000 home sites to Morgan Stanley for $525m. Lennar will take a $775m book loss on the transaction. But it will be able to move volatile land exposure off its balance sheet, take significant tax write-offs on the losses and still earn management fees for running the new venture.Morgan Stanley will pick up a portfolio of land – and Lennar’s expertise – at a bargain-basement price of 40 cents on the dollar. The venture’s structure invites comparison to the shift by many top hotel companies away from property ownership and into operations. It could certainly presage similar deals by other homebuilders.Citadel’s deal to buy $3bn in asset-backed debt from E-Trade holds even greater implications. Builders’ exposure to unwanted property pales in comparison to the size of the US mortgage lending market. For a painful 27 cents on the dollar, Citadel was willing to relieve E-Trade of its risk on the debt in question.Treasury secretary Hank Paulson’s claim that the housing slump was at or near its bottom in mid-June has clearly not panned out. Prices now look even more gruesome for distressed sellers. But with swarms of investors digging through home- building and mortgage assets and a few deals now done, the foundations of a buyers’ market may be taking shape.

Blue-chip stocks posted their best weekly advance since March.The see-sawing market sentiment emphasised the dilemma facing harried investors who must decide whether credit market turmoil is set to plunge the US economy into recession or whether policymakers can help stave off a downturn.Fears of an impending slowdown spurred a bumper trade in recession-proof stocks this month, including a range of companies in the consumer staples, healthcare and utilities sectors.Retailers enjoyed a good week but fell sharply over the month amid fears of a poor holiday shopping season. Transport stocks also fared well this week after crude oil prices fell sharply but the sector, an economic bell-wether, was still lower for the month.The S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent to 1,481.14 on Friday, and ended the week 2.8 per cent higher. However, the index was down 4.4 per cent for the month, its worst monthly performance in almost five years.The Dow Jones Industrial average was up 3 per cent this week at 13,371.72, its biggest weekly advance in eight months, but was still down 4 per cent in November.The Nasdaq Composite, 6.0 per cent down at 2,660.96 this month, was particularly disappointing in light of technology’s previous market leadership this year. Confidence waned in the sector’s ability to ride out a downturn in US corporate spending.Tim Bond, global head of asset allocation at Barclays Capital, said expectations of a strong rebound in corporate earnings next year after a disappointing third quarter are “bordering on the hallucinatory . . . The facts of the matter are that the US economy is poised to experience extremely weak growth over the next few quarters.”Concerns about corporate profitability have added to pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.Stocks soared this week after first Donald Kohn, the Fed vice-chairman, and then Ben Bernanke, chairman, hinted that the Fed will ease US rates next month. The dovish case was helped by data which showed a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer spending.Mortgage-related stocks soared on Friday on reports that Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, was close to announcing a plan to help borrowers facing mortgage resets.Countrywide Financial rose by 16.3 per cent to $10.82 on Friday after Fox-Pitt, Kelton upgraded the shares predicting “significant upside through 2009 as the mortgage market begins to normalise”. However, the shares were still down 30.3 per cent for the month.Among November’s worst performers were Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage agencies. Both stocks rallied this week after Freddie sold $6bn in preferred stock to shore up capital levels, but the lenders were down 32.9 per cent at $35.07 and 32.6 per cent at $38.42 respectively for the month.The homebuilder sector of the S&P sank 21.3 per cent in November, one of its worst monthly falls on record, amid burgeoning mortgage delinquencies and high levels of unsold homes.Although the stocks rose sharply on Friday, Pulte Homes was down 31.1 per cent at $10.22 for the month while Lennar fell 30.7 per cent to $15.84.Banking stocks rose sharply this week amid early signs that financial companies are able to raise capital to shore up balance sheets punctured by credit-market losses. However, the S&P investment bank sector was down 10.9 per cent on the month.The leading banks this week closed their books for the year, amid fears of
further write-downs and trading losses. Citigroup, which announced a $7.5bn capital injection from Abu Dhabi’s investment arm, was down 20.5 per cent at $33.30 on the month, while Morgan Stanley fell 21.6 per cent to $52.72 this month.In technology Dell’s shares fell 19.8 per cent to $24.54 for the month after its quarterly results missed Wall Street expectations amid concerns about weak sales to US consumers."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.1 per cent on the week at 13515.36. But the Nasdaq Composite fared better, only 0.4 per cent lower on the week at 2791.99. However, small cap stocks continued to disappoint investors, falling 3.5 per cent on the week at 792.62.Expectations of further big swings in equity prices increased. Volatility as measured by the CBOE Vix index jumped 24.5 per cent this week at 24.36.Merrill Lynch was the worst performing of the big banks this week, down 14.7 per cent on the week at $56.45, after a report said the SEC was investigating deals it allegedly made with hedge funds to delay losses linked to complex mortgage-backed securities. Merrill said it had “no reason to believe inappropriate transactions occurred.” The furore capped a bad week for the company after Stan O’Neal, chief executive, stepped down.Citigroup was also sharply lower amid fears it may have to raise more than $30bn - possibly by cutting its dividend - because of the losses it took from risky credit market investments. Its shares were down 13.1 per cent on the week at $37.08.Credit insurers took particularly large hits amid fears they too could be nursing mortgage-related problems. Ambac Financial, and MBIA, municipal bond insurers, were among the worst performers on the S&P this week. The shares were down 42.3 per cent at $25.61 and 28.6 per cent at $35.97 respectively.Other financial stocks punished by traders this week included Washington Mutual, down 15.4 per cent at $24.18 and Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender, down 18.7 per cent at $14.07. The S&P financial index was down 7.1 per cent on the week at 419.50.Homebuilders suffered sharp losses as the chances of a swift housing recovery receded amid accelerating mortgage delinquencies. The S&P homebuilder index fell 10.4 per cent on the week at 385.44. Lennar, down 12.6 per cent at $21.21, and Pulte Homes, down 9.2 per cent at $13.91 were among the biggest fallers.Aside from the mortgage market worries there were some reasons for investors to cheer this week. A quarter point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve was well received by the market. However optimism was tempered as the neutral language of the Fed’s accompanying statement led many to believe further cuts are now unlikely.There was also some positive jobs news on Friday. Non-farm payrolls rose 166,000 last month and the unemployment rate was steady at 4.7 per cent. Economists had expected a rise of 80,000 in payrolls.Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 per cent and were up 3.8 per cent for the year, a figure that economists said suggests labour costs remain contained.“The jobs market remains strong and incomes remain robust,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.Technology was one of the few sectors to end the week in positive territory. Microsoft was the standout stock on the Dow, gaining 5.2 per cent at $36.85, continuing a rally from last week’s surprisingly strong earnings. Google soared past the $700 mark, rising 4.7 per cent on the week at $706.42.Semiconductors fared better this week. Intel rose 2.9 per cent at $26.68 on the week, while the PHLX semiconductor sector index gained 1.1 per cent at 456.91.However Ebay declined 7.1 per cent at $34.05 after Bear Stearns forecast the online auctioneer could experience weaker margins. Yahoo was down 9.4 per cent at $30.46.It was a big week for oil companies as ExxonMobil and Chevron reported results and as crude oil rose as high as $96 a barrel.Both companies disappointed investors, after posting falling profits from the production of petrol. Exxon, down 4.9 per cent at $87.66 posted a 10 per cent decline in earnings, while Chevron’s third-quarter profit fell by more than 25 per cent. Its shares were down 4.3 per cent on the week $87.72.

California had the largest number of foreclosures, with 51,259, and Florida was second, with 33,354.Nevada, which has seen explosive housing growth around Las Vegas, had the highest rate of foreclosures, with one for every 185 households. The overall foreclosure rate was one for every 557 households.The new report on foreclosures came as Countrywide Financial, the largest US mortgage lender, said delinquencies as a percentage of unpaid loans rose to 5.85 per cent from 4.04 per cent a year ago. New loans issued by Countrywide fell 44 per cent as home sales slowed. Countrywide said pending foreclosures as a percentage of unpaid balances more than doubled, from 0.51 per cent to 1.27 per cent.Issuance of adjustable rate mortgages, the cause of many of the defaults among subprime home buyers, dropped 76 per cent. Loans to buyers with poor credit histories dropped 92 per cent as Countrywide moved away from providing mortgages to risky borrowers.Overall mortgage loan funding at Countrywide totalled $21bn (€15bn, £10bn) in September, down from $38bn last year.Daily mortgage loan applications dropped 39 per cent to $1.7bn. David Sambol, Countrywide president, said the decline in production was due both to weak market conditions and to stricter underwriting standards.Countrywide, which has seen its shares plunge during the subprime crisis, appeared near failure this summer when it lost access to the short-term credit markets. The lender averted a crisis after securing a $2bn equity investment from Bank of America and $12bn in new financing from its banks.Countrywide shares closed down almost 2 per cent at $18.44. Shares in the lender traded as high as $45.03 in February.RealtyTrac said the jump in foreclosures was in part due to subprime borrowers being unable to make payments after their initially low interest rates reset to higher levels.Almost 500,000 such loans will reset through next month, indicating the foreclosure rates will continue to grow.Meanwhile, Moody’s on Thursday lowered its rating on three home-builders, Centex, Lennar and Pulte Homes, to Ba1, a non-investment grade rating. The rating agency did not foresee improvement in the housing market until 2009 at the earliest.“Because of the rapidity of the decline in unit home deliveries and thus of

It rose 1.4 per cent for the quarter but is still 1.7 per cent below its mid-July record close of 1,553.08.The preference for large-caps has favoured the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 3.5 per cent on the quarter.In contrast the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks is down 4 per cent on the quarter at 805.43 – its worst performance in a year. Equity values have been hit as private equity takeovers have dried up.Four sectors – energy, information technology, industrials and materials – have consistently delivered the best returns, riding out the turmoil wrought by credit markets in August and catalysed by the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point cut in interest rates last week.Analysts say a weaker dollar – down about 5 per cent against a basket of currencies over the quarter – and stronger economic growth outside the US, mean investors are favouring large international-orientated companies in these sectors.“In the past, the financials and consumer discretionary sectors have joined the information technology sector in outperforming the market when the Fed has trimmed rates,” Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said. “But investors now also seem to be favouring other high-beta groups, such as energy and materials, which are perceived as beneficiaries of global economic growth, especially in rapidly expanding developing economies.”He added: “It is far from clear that rate cuts are helpful to these sectors, especially if they signal pending economic weakness.”Companies in the commodities sector have enjoyed rising stock values as crude oil and gold prices have soared to records. Gold rose to $750.0 an ounce, its highest level since January 1980. Crude oil futures were down $1.22 per cent at $81.66 on Friday afternoon – around 17 per cent higher on the quarter.

For more than a year, home builders have aggressively discounted the price of new homes to reduce inventories. But existing home prices have defied gravity as owners who were unwilling to sell at reduced rates waited optimistically for the market to improve.That is changing, according to US home builder Lennar. A shift in owner sentiment could hurt builders’ results even more short term, but it could eventually help free the housing market’s logjam.Lennar racked up its worst quarterly loss of $513.9m on a 44 per cent drop in revenue. The company, whose stock price has already been chopped in half this year, slashed jobs by 35per cent and will make further cuts.Disastrous results for the entire home building sector were expected. But the change of heart by owners of existing homes put even more pressure on Lennar. The inventory of existing US single-family homes hit its highest level in 18 years in August and demand dropped to its lowest point in five years.As homeowners lower their expectations, builders, who are already cutting prices by 10 per cent to 20 per cent and accepting minimal deposits, will face even steeper competition.Lennar’s cancellation rate came in at a whopping 32 per cent thanks to the difficult mortgage market. It also took a loss of $848m to write down real estate and write off options on land it will not buy. Massive impairments will be standard for builders this earnings season.The sliding housing market has shown no signs of a bottom, with cancellation rates still rising in some areas. But many deals fall through because buyers are unable to sell their current units. A loosening of the existing home market could help.
182;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Lennar sees further new house price falls;;Lennar, the second-largest US homebuilder, on Tuesday warned that sellers of existing homes are starting to accept lower prices in a move which could force the industry to accelerate its own discounting strategy.Stuart Miller, chief executive of the Miami-based group, said existing-homeowners had “sat on the sidelines” during a downturn driven by oversupply and the difficulties in securing mortgage finance caused by the subprime crisis.Builders have responded by cutting prices and construction in an effort to clear the backlog, but Mr Miller said market conditions had continued to deteriorate as a lack of consumer confidence spread to the far larger existing-home market.“The existing-home market is now moving much more rapidly to adjust [prices] downwards,” he told analysts as the group reported a net loss of $513.9m in the three months to August 31.“August really seems to be a melting pot of all things negative.”Economists have warned that national home prices may have to fall by as much as a fifth to clear a backlog of unsold properties swelled by speculators selling out and rising delinquencies. Mr Miller said uncertainty over the level of foreclosures could still see the inventory increase before the end of the year.The recent US interest-rate cuts have done little to boost confidence among potential buyers, according to industry executives. “It will most certainly not be a panacea,” said Mr Miller. “[And] we have not yet seen stability in the mortgage market either.”Lennar, which has a national footprint focused on the ”sunbelt” states, was the first of the major builders to warn that the traditional spring selling season had failed to ignite. Its pessimism about the short-term outlook has proved accurate as builders have continued to report weaker selling conditions and taken writedowns on their land and property holdings.Revenues from home sales fell 44 per cent in the quarter, and its gross margin dipped to 14 per cent as the average selling price fell to $296,000 and incentives climbed from $35,900 to $46,000 per home.Lennar said it had cut 35 per cent of its workforce and expected further trimming in the fourth quarter, and again declined to provide any financial outlook for the full year.Most builders are focusing on securing their balance sheets by maximising cash flow and trimming expenses. While credit ratings have worsened and equity values have slumped – with Lennar’s stock down more than 55 per cent year-to-date – liquidity remains relatively strong as banks have continued to extend credit lines and relax covenants, reducing concern of a bankruptcy among the major companies.
183;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-09-25T20:43:18Z;Wall St rebounds from early lows;;Wall Street experienced a choppy session after big retailers lowered their sales forecasts and as house prices fell at their sharpest pace for 16 years.The market rebounded from early lows after existing home sales data declined at a slightly lower rate than anticipated. But athough technology stocks continued to surge, the gains failed to lift the broader market.The S&P 500 was flat at 1,517.22 after falling as low as 1,507.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed slightly higher, up 0.1 per cent at 13,778.65.The Nasdaq again outperformed the other main indices, as investors continued to favour tech-related stocks. The Nasdaq Composite index closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,683.45, as Apple and Expedia hit all-time highs.Sentiment was bruised in early trade after disappointing sales forecasts from two big retailers and as new data showed consumer confidence had fallen close to a two-year low. Some early losses were pared as investors reasoned that much of the bad news had already been built in to stock values.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “It’s not at all surprising that existing home sales were down. It’s not even all that surprising that consumer confidence was off.“If anything, the most damaging thing is the anecdotal retail evidence.”Retail stocks suffered a torrid day after Target lowered its September store sales to an expected rise of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, down from a range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent. Its shares closed 4.6 per cent lower at $61.35.The S&P retail index ended the day 2.7 per cent lower at 470.56 but is still trading 4.6 per cent above the low it hit when the credit squeeze began in August. The S&P consumer discretionary index lost 1.2 per cent to 287.36.Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, fell 6.7 per cent to $28.51, after it said slower sales would peg earnings at the low end or slightly below its prior guidance for the year. New consumer data weighed on retail stocks. The US Conference Board index of consumer confidence fell to 99.8 in August versus 105.6 in July, its lowest level since November 2005.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research, said: “Are we signalling the bottom in terms of consumer confidence? I think we are close but not quite there yet. The Fed is watching the actions of consumers like a hawk.”Other retail stocks suffered on weaker sentiment for the sector.Home Depot declined 2.4 per cent lower to $33.08, while Wal-Mart slipped 1.8 per cent to $43.16. Macy’s shed 3.2 per cent to $31.91.Housing-related stocks were also in focus after a string of new data.Existing home sales for August declined 4.3 per cent to 5.5m, their lowest level since August 2002. However, the result was slightly better than the 5.44m sales economists had predicted.The backlog of unsold homes climbed 0.4 per cent to 4.58m, the biggest backlog since records began in 1999. Existing home sales have declined in each of the past five months.Lennar posted a loss of $513.9m in the third quarter, versus a profit of $206.7m a year earlier. The loss was well beyond analyst expectations and shares in the homebuilder were down 7.7 per cent.The Case-Shiller home price index for July revealed a 4.5 per cent fall in its 10-city composite. The 20-city composite declined 3.9 per cent over the 12 months through July.Economists at Lehman Brothers said: “The housing market has indisputably taken a turn for the worse, largely due to tighter lending standards and higher borrowing costs. In an ugly feedback loop, buyer sentiment has fallen, putting even more downward pressure on sales and home prices.“We expect prices to ultimately fall more in this cycle than in the early 1990s.”The S&P homebuilders index fell 2.2 per cent to 419.58, while the SPDR homebuilders exchange-traded fund lost 2.6 per cent to $21.52.DR Horton shed 2.1 per cent to $13.28 while KB Home, which reports third- quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 2.5 per cent to $25.09.Energy stocks were also lower as oil prices fell below $80 in New York and after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said energy markets are “in turmoil”. The S&P energy index was down 0.9 per cent at 575.82 as US crude future prices shed $1.42 to $79.53 a barrel.

185;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-09-04T20:51:43Z;Wall St rally led by tech stocks;;"Wall Street stocks rallied on Tuesday, led by a surge in the technology sector, as investors returned from the Labor Day long weekend confident that the Federal Reserve would cut rates this month.Although money market rates rose to new highs on Tuesday since the credit crunch emerged a month ago, equity markets adopted an optimistic stance.“The equity market has locked in the idea of a rate cut and believes the Fed and the [Bush] administration stand behind the economy,” Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said. “There is now a feeling of security and that has relieved the fear seen in recent weeks.”The dominant sector on Tuesday was technology. Analysts said tech stocks were a safe haven from stocks that are exposed to the problems in the mortgage, credit and financial areas.“Tech has zero exposure to subprime mortgages and there are many multinational tech companies that benefit from a weaker dollar,” Mr Pado said.At the close in New York, the Nasdaq Composite was 1.3 per cent higher at 2,630.24 and led the leading benchmarks. The S&P 500 index was 1.1 per cent higher at 1,489.42 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,448,86. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1 per cent to 800.66.While equity investors were looking for rate cuts, economic data on Tuesday showed that the manufacturing sector continued to expand last month.This week’s array of economic reports could bolster market expectations that the Fed will ease policy at its meeting this month.Among economic reports likely to attract close attention from stock market investors is the Fed’s Beige book survey of regional activity, due on Wednesday.“The Fed’s Beige Book could provide insights as to any real economic stresses that might be emanating from the recent financial turmoil,” TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said. Should data not arrive on the weak side, analysts believe the Fed has little choice but to ease policy when it meets on Septem-
ber 18.“The Fed will likely cut rates in order not to upset market expectations of an ease,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners said. “It is imprudent of the Fed to cut as economic numbers show the economy is still growing and there is still some concern over inflation.”Among specific stocks on the move on Tuesday was Apple, up 4.1 per cent to $144.16, a one-month high, after analysts at Piper Jaffray said sales of Macintosh computers exceeded expectations.Ford Motor reported another large drop in sales in August as sales by the battered US car industry appeared poised to be overtaken by import brands for a second consecutive month.Ford said its total US sales fell about 14 per cent to 218,332 in the month, better than some estimates, sending its shares up 2.3 per cent at $7.96. GM sales were up 6 per cent and Chrysler sales were down 6 per cent. Shares in GM rose 3.8 per cent to $31.92.Sales at Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor, Hondaand Nissan were expected to be higher. The results could again leave domestic brands behind the import brands in US sales, as they were for the first time on record in July.Credit concerns continued to hit sentiment towards the housing sector.Countrywide Financial shares fell slightly at $19.81 and homebuilder Lennar fell 0.1 per cent to $28.24.NovaStar Financial, the mortgage investment company, fell 15.7 per cent to $7.16 after it announced further restructuring, including job cuts, tighter lending and the cancellation of a $101.2m sale of preferred stock.Home Depot shares fell 5.1 per cent to $36.36 after it said it expected to buy back $10.7bn in stock.In deal news, MetroPCS Communications offered to acquire rival Leap Wireless International for about $5.12bn in stock. Leap Wireless soared 15 per cent to $83.47. MetroPCS rose 5 per cent to $28.60.CBS shares rose 0.2 per cent to $31.57 after it said its quarterly dividend would increase 14 per cent from 22 cents a share to 25 cents. The board also approved a $1.6bn stock buy-back plan."
186;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-06-27T13:59:50Z;US durable goods orders slip;;Durable goods orders dropped in May, adding to fears about the health of the US business investment following a series of reports that showed the housing downturn is far from over.New orders for durable goods fell a larger than expected 2.8 per cent as aircraft orders went into tailspin. But even excluding the volatile orders for transportation equipment, orders surprised economists by falling 1 per cent, the first decline since January and well below a predicted 0.2 per cent gain.The weakness, concentrated in machinery, metals and electronics, raises some doubt over the anticipated upturn in business investment as well as predictions of higher second quarter US economic growth.Non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as representative of business spending fell 3 per cent, the biggest drop since January.“With recent indications that corporate profits are slowing, weaker capital spending by businesses appears to be in prospect, reinforcing softer US economic growth,” said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Bank of America Securities.In the first quarter the US economy grew by 1.3 per cent, its slowest pace in four years.This week’s data have shown that sales of existing homes and newly built homes dropped last month, and that prices for many homes are still falling. Lennar, the second largest homebuilder in the US, warned that further price drops will be necessary to clear the build up of unsold homes, and start the recovery in housing.The unsettling housing news comes as the markets have been troubled by ongoing fall-out from the crisis in subprime mortgages, contributing to increased borrowing costs.Many economists had neverheless predicted that the second quarter would show a marked improvement from the first quarter, after the rundown in manufacturing inventories and the housing slowdown have recovered from their low points earlier in the year.“Our perspective is that the May declines represent a pullback that is consistent with an ongoing recovery rather than weakness,” said John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns. Because of the volatility of the durable goods numbers, which tend to be moved by big one off orders, Mr Ryding said it was better to look at the numbers on a quarterly basis. Over the quarter, durable goods orders had risen 16.5 per cent, compared with a 9 per cent decline in the first quarter, he said.The Federal Reserve has been predicting a pick-up in growth later this year. On Thursday the Fed’s Open Markets Committee will reveal its latest decision on interest rates. It is expected to keep them on hold at 5.25 per cent.“This data point toward a modest downward adjustment to GDP relative to expectations but not one of enough significance to warrant altering our forecast for 3.7 per cent GDP growth in the second quarter,” said Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
188;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-06-27T07:30:29Z;Housebuilders downbeat ahead of merger;;Housebuilders George Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow on Wednesday said ahead of their £5bn merger next week that the US market remained gloomy and the UK was set to weaken.In trading statements ahead of the merger, set to close next week, Wimpey said its US order book was down 41 per cent year-on-year while Taylor Woodrow reported a 45 per cent decline.Taylor Woodrow said its margins in the US would be lower than those implied by the write downs already announced this year. The trading statement said: “we anticipate margins being significantly below last year, excluding the effects of the previously announced exceptional items”. In January it took a £21m write down on the US, followed by another of £25m in May. Wimpey took a US-related write down of £61m in February.On Tuesday, Lennar, the second biggest US housebuilder reported a quarterly loss and said the market could deteriorate further despite 15 per cent price cuts.The slowdown of the US housing market hit the industry unexpectedly last summer. It has deepened with increasing interest rates and high stock levels but has shown significant regional variation – for example, Texas remains relatively healthy but California is challenging.Overall, Wimpey’s sales in the US in the first half are now seen at 20 per cent lower than in 2006, with prices and margins both down. The story is the same at Taylor Woodrow.Both companies said they had reduced their US landbanks and focusing on cost cutting, with Wimpey promising $20m in savings this year.The US accounted for some 29 per cent of the combined 2006 revenues of the two companies. Analyst Chris Millington at Bridgewell Securities said in a note to clients that while the trading statements did not alter earnings forecasts for the companies, the relative weight of the US in the their portfolios had not been taken into account. He recommended a switch to solely UK-focussed builders until more visibility on the outlook for the US was possible.In the UK, both companies said the market in the first half of the year had been stable with good buyer demand and confidence with margins improving. Wimpey said it was confident of full-year operating margins of 14 per cent or more. Order books are stronger, by 5 per cent for Wimpey and 10 per cent for Taylor Woodrow. Wimpey’s short-term landbank has been increased by 10 per cent and Taylor Woodrow’s is stable but will grow in the second half.However, the second half of the year is expected to be less buoyant as interest rate increases bite, and the companies are looking to cost-cutting and margin improvement to deliver improvements in underlying profits. The merger, expected to complete on July 3, is forecast to deliver savings of some £50m.The companies said that detailed integration work had been carried out and new management teams and reporting structures would become effective as soon as the deal completes.Shares in Taylor Woodrow were down 1.8 per cent at 372p in early London trading. Wimpey was 2 per cent lower at 515p
189;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-06-26T22:38:42Z;Data add to gloom in US housing;;The head of one of the largest US housebuilders on Tuesday warned that prices have further to fall in order to restore consumer confidence in the troubled sector.The glut of existing homes has become an increasing concern for builders, who have cut construction and increased discounts in an effort to clear an inventory of single-family houses now at its highest level since 1992.“Consumer confidence is going to have to be restored so that purchasers believe again in the value of homes,” said Stuart Miller, chief executive of Miami-based Lennar, the second-largest US builder.While average prices have fallen over the past three months, he said the values of existing homes – which account for 85 per cent of the market – remained “stickier” and would have to fall to clear the inventory overhang.Mr Miller said the housing market might deteriorate through the rest of the year despite Lennar increasing average home discounts to 15 per cent in the quarter to May 31.Sales of new and existing homes dropped year-on-year in May, the end of a traditionally strong spring selling season that failed to ignite.Ian Shepherson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “The supply problem may now be stabilising but it remains huge…the inventory overhang will keep downward pressure on prices. There is no reason to think a proper recovery will start any time soon.”An index of builder confidence this month fell to its lowest level since 1991, despite a more benign economy, amid concern that potential buyers are being deterred by the uncertain pricing outlook and tougher lending conditions.The closely watched Case-Shiller index for May showed that prices for ­single-family homes fell by 2.1 per cent from the year before in 20 metropolitan areas.Lennar reported a net loss of $244.2m (€180m, £122m) in the May quarter, reversing the $324.7m profit of a year earlier.Separately, US consumer confidence in June has fallen to its lowest level since August, pointing to slower economic growth this year. Worried by the state of the job market and fears of deteriorating business conditions, consumer confidence dropped to 103.9, according to the Conference Board’s index, from a reading of 108.5 last month. Economists had predicted a rating of 105.5 for June.“Lingering high [petrol] prices, volatility in the stock market and the jump in interest rates all appeared to weigh on confidence this month,” said analysts at Action Economics in a note.However, consumer confidence remains at a historically healthy level.Additional reporting by Eoin Callan in Washington

Energy and materials stocks led losses, and financial stocks reversed early gains.The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1 per cent to 2,574.16, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 per cent to close at 13,337.66.Amid worries over the US financial sector’s exposure to the troubled mortgage market, Bear Stearns rebounded 0.2 per cent to $139.35, after a 3.2 per cent fall on Monday. Its plan to lend $3.2bn to one of its struggling hedge funds has aroused fears that further problems in the mortgage market are likely to emerge.The stock was as low as $137 earlier in the day. It was lifted by the expectations among analysts that the bank might only have to provide half of the planned loan.After the closing bell, Bear confirmed that it would provide about $1.6 billion in secured financing to its High-Grade Structured Credit Fund after.”By providing this secured financing facility we believe we have helped stabilize and reduce uncertainty in the marketplace,” James Cayne, chief executive officer at Bear said in a statement.Bear’s stock rose 0.4 per cent to $139.89 in after-hours trade.The S&P financial sector fell 0.2 per cent yesterday, and that pushed losses for the year to 1.9 per cent. Financials are the only negative major industry group within the index for 2007.The American Stock Exchange Broker/Dealer index fell 0.1 per cent to 251.45 and remained below a record high of 267.69 set at the start of June.Two of its 12 members are sharply lower since the beginning of the year – Bear Stearns, down 14.4 per cent, and Merrill Lynch, off 9.3 per cent.One bright spot on Tuesday was utility stocks as some of them continued to attract buyers as long-term bond yields consolidated above 5 per cent.Allegheny Energy rose 2.1 per cent to $51.71 and Edison International gained 1.6 per cent to close at $54.70.Early in the day, the leading benchmarks extended opening gains despite the news that new home sales fell 1.6 per cent in May while consumer confidence fell in June to its weakest level since last August. For the past year, new-home sales were 15.8 per cent lower than their level in May 2006.Earlier, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index for home prices in 10 US cities fell 2.7 per cent from a year ago. It was the steepest decline since 1991.“Things are a little calmer today, the housing data was pretty much in line with expectations and the dip in confidence reflects higher energy prices,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is in a consolidation phase which is pretty typical for June.”Both the S&P and the Dow set record closes on June 4 and have subsequently struggled to sustain bullish traction.Mr Pado said that outlook should prevail unless recent lows in the S&P and the Dow – 1,488 and 13,251 respectively – are tested. “If we break through the lows, stop-loss selling will accelerate stocks to the downside.”The gloom over housing was highlighted early on Tuesday when Lennar, the home builder, reported it had swung to a second-quarter loss and warned it would likely post a loss in the third quarter. Shares fell 3.1 per cent to $37.55. The S&P homebuilder index decline of 2.5 per cent, extended its loss for the year to 27.6 per cent.In deal news, European suitors lined up for US companies. Basell, the Dutch chemical company, said it had agreed to buy Huntsman, the US chemical concern, for $6bn. Shares in Huntsman rose 28.1 per cent to $24.21.Roche, the Swiss drug maker, launched a hostile bid for Ventana Medical Systems, a tissue-based diagnostics specialist. Shares in Ventana surged 47.7 per cent to $76.43.Another mover on Tuesday was Google, which set a new record close of $530.26, up 0.5 per cent.Tiffany & Co, rose 0.3 per cent at $52.08. The fine jewellery retailer rose 4 per cent on Monday, amid speculation it could be a takeover target.Investors awaited whether the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, will accept an editorial independence pact, agreed between the board of the company and Rupert Murdoch, that could facilitate News Corp’s $5bn bid for the company. Dow Jones rose 2.2 per cent to $58.77, while News Corp slipped 0.8 per cent to $23.31.In earnings news, Oracle said its fourth quarter earnings rose 23 per cent after the closing bell on Tuesday. The stock fell 1.6 per cent to $19.16 in regular trade. In post-market trade, Oracle rose 1 per cent at $19.36.
191;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-06-26T12:43:29Z;Lennar warns housing slump may deepen;;Lennar, the second-largest US homebuilder, on Tuesday warned the market may deteriorate through the rest of the year despite cutting prices on homes by an average of 15 per cent in a bid to clear unsold inventory.The muted reaction to the Miami-based group’s aggressive discounting policy will heighten concerns that the twin issues of oversupply and tougher financing conditions will delay an industry recovery and hit US economic growth.Lennar’s warning came as the company reported a net loss of $244.2m in the May quarter, reversing the $324.7m profit a year earlier. Revenues from home sales fell by a third to $2.7bn, and gross margins dipped from 23.7 per cent to 13.6 per cent.Lennar, which has a national footprint focused on the southern “sunbelt” states, was the first of the major builders to warn that the traditional spring selling season had failed to ignite, and industry leaders have become more pessimistic in recent weeks about the market outlook.Earlier this month a closely-watched index of builder confidence fell to its lowest level since 1991, despite a more benign economy, amid concern that potential buyers are being deterred by the uncertain pricing outlook and tougher lending conditions.“As we look to our third quarter and the remainder of 2007, we continue to see weak, and perhaps deteriorating market conditions,” said Lennar president and chief executive Stuart Miller in a statement accompanying its fiscal second-quarter earnings.Mr Miller said the supply of new and existing homes had continued to rise, forcing builders to cut prices and increase incentives such as free kitchen equipment. Lennar’s average discount was $43,700 per home in the three months to May 31, just below the level of the prior quarter but almost double the prior-year incentive.While average prices also declined slightly from the prior quarter, analysts believe a larger correction is needed to clear a backlog of unsold single-family homes stretching to almost nine months at current sales rates.Lennar and other large builders have cut construction and trimmed expenses in an effort to limit the financial fallout from the prolonged downturn. However, the lack of market visibility and rising losses from writing off land investments and options has seen its share price fall by almost a quarter since the start of the year.
192;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-04-11T20:35:41Z;Wall St slumps on inflation worries;;Wall Street slumped on Wednesday, as a major cost-cutting plan from Citigroup and the Federal Reserve’s focus on inflation left investors cold and terminated a recent winning streak for stocks.The minutes from last month’s Federal Reserve meeting sparked renewed selling on Wednesday afternoon as officials said more rate hikes “might prove necessary,” as inflation risks have grown.The S&P 500 index fell 0.65 per cent to close at 1,438.86, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.75 per cent to finish at 2,459.31.“Until uncertainty over the economy clears, stocks are not going anywhere in the next couple of months,” said Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman.Worries about the economy mainly centre upon housing and stocks were also shaken when the National Association of Realtors forecast existing home sales would fall 2.2 per cent in 2007, down from a previous estimate of a 0.9 per cent slide.Homebuilder stocks slumped, led by Lennar, down 3.1 per cent at $40.98, while financial stocks also came under pressure.The bearish mood snapped an eight day winning streak for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent to 12,484.29, and broke its best run since March 2003, weighed down in part by selling in Citigroup.The bank announced plans to cut 17,000 jobs, but investors were unimpressed and the stock fell 1.15 per cent to $51.80.For the year, Citigroup is down 7 per cent and is one of the worst performing stocks in the Dow. Other Dow laggards were General Motors, down 1.9 per cent at $31.46, and Honeywell, off 1.25 per cent at $46.39.By contrast, Alcoa continued to rise after its net profit rose 9 per cent during the first quarter and beat estimates.Alcoa gained 0.5 per cent to $35.08, and the stock leads the Dow this year with a gain of 16.9 per cent.Among stocks in the news on Wednesday was the Nasdaq Stock Market itself, after it revealed it was holding talks with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange about purchasing the regional exchange that specialises in options trading. Nasdaq stock fell 0.8 per cent to $29.40.Manor Care said it had retained JPMorgan to advise the manager of nursing homes and its shares jumped 10.5 per cent to $61.58.Earnings season picked up speed after the closing bell on Wednesday.Genentech rose 0.5 per cent to $83 in after-hours trade when its first quarter profit beat estimates. The biotech group had closed up 0.15 per cent at $82.69 in regular trade.Research in Motion missed fourth-quarter estimates and in after-hours trade its stock slid 6.4 per cent to $138.81.The stock closed 1.5 per cent lower at $146.02, after it had set a 52-week at $148.95 high earlier in the day.
193;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-04-10T13:29:15Z;US housing worries deepen;;DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder by sales, on Tuesday provided further evidence that the market has yet to hit bottom as the industry nears the end of the crucial spring selling season.The Texas-based builder has been one of the most aggressive users of discounts to shift the large stock of unsold homes, which have depressed sales prices and dented national consumer confidence.Sales dropped by 37 per cent to 9,983 homes in its fiscal second quarter to March 31, and were 41 per cent lower by dollar value, with California and the south-west region returning the largest declines. The company said its cancellation rate remained unchanged from the previous three months, despite boosting incentives.DR Horton is also viewed by analysts as one of the most exposed builders to the fallout from the crisis in subprime lending because of its focus on affordable housing which could appeal more to buyers with poorer credit histories.Management will be quizzed on the financial impact of the slide in subprime lending at its quarterly earnings’ call on April 19, but its orders for the period add weight to industry expectations that there will be no national marker recovery before the end of the year.DR Horton, which closed 53,000 homes in the year to September 30 2006, has halved new construction and ended almost all speculative building, as well as cutting overheads and boosting discounts and other incentives.The efforts helped trim its cancellation rate at the end of last year, but the rate remained stubbornly flat at 32 per cent in the three months to March 31.The company, like its smaller rival Lennar, was bearish about the spring selling season from early February to mid-April, which traditionally accounts for two-thirds of new and existing home sales in the US. Don Horton, chairman, said the season “had not gotten off to its usual strong start”.Don Tomnitz, chief executive, has maintained that there is pent-up demand among potential buyers waiting for more clarity in the market. However, some analysts remain concerned that builders may have started a new phase of construction too early, adding to the stock of unsold homes.Moreover, median prices have remained stable, and housing experts believe prices may have to fall by 10-20 per cent in some markets to start clearing a backlog of 546,000 unsold new homes at the end of February, the latest figures available.Mr Tomnitz, who has characterised the company as ”the Wal-Mart of homebuilding”, said earlier this year that a second round of cost cuts had been identified to preserve DR Horton’s industry lead in terms of operating costs.All six of its operating regions were profitable in the December quarter, despite lower average selling costs as the company boosted incentives, cutting its gross margin to 18.6 per cent, a 2.6 percentage point fall from the previous three months.Mr Tomnitz also signalled that Horton had no immediate plans to seek acquisitions, despite speculation among analysts that smaller private builders would seek buyers as their cash flows eroded.
194;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-03-30T20:59:11Z;Wall St lower as housing gloom persists;;A series of small shocks about the housing market and economy knocked Wall Street off its stride this week but investors regained some of their poise to leave stocks only moderately lower.The steepest decline came as Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, damped hopes that the central bank had adopted a softer policy stance by reiterating his concerns about inflation and saying the Fed had not abandoned its bias towards raising interest rates.Sharp falls in stocks were also caused by fresh signs of slowing demand for housing, federal probes into mortgage lending by Beazer Homes, and oil price rises spurred by increased tension between Iran and the UK.Rumours of US preparations for a conflict with Iran sparked another sharp sell-off in shares on Friday, with the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1 per cent from its earlier highs.However, after each slip the market showed a degree of resilience. “This pattern of recovering from shocks may speak to the fact that this market wants to go up,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “[Interest] rates are just too low and liquidity is too high to take this thing down.”Sentiment was boosted by an unexpected upward revision of economic growth in the final quarter last year and lower than expected jobless claims last week. In addition, consumer spending and income rose at almost double the forecast rate.The US government’s imposition of duties on paper imports from China also unnerved investors on Friday. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,420.85, putting it 1.1 per cent down on the week and 0.2 per cent higher on the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent stronger on Friday at 12,354.35, down 1 per cent this week. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.1 per cent lower on the week at 2,421.64.The steel sector made big advances after US Steel’s bid to buy Lone Star Technologies prompted speculation about further consolidation.In a sign of investor appetite for steelmaking deals, shares in US Steel rose 3 per cent on the week to $99.17 on the back of this week’s $2.1bn cash offer for Lone Star. Lone Star soared 35.6 per cent to $66.03.There was also interest in other steel groups that could be takeover targets. IPSCO jumped 13.7 per cent to $131.40 while Reliance Steel rose 4.3 per cent to $48.40.Dell was on the defensive on Friday as the group revealed that it had found evidence of as yet unspecified misconduct after an investigation into its accounting practices.The company said it was delaying the release of its annual report until the investigation was completed.The market reaction was negative but contained, with Dell shares down 0.8 per cent to $23.21 on Friday. Credit Suisse encouraged investors to buy on weakness “with the understanding that the time horizon for recovery has been extended”.Homebuilders set new lows for the year this week as weak sales of newly built homes and a profits warning from Lennar aggravated fears about a prolonged housing market slump.Lennar, which said the typical pick-up in spring sales had “yet to materialise”, fell 7.4 per cent to 42.21. KB Home slid 8.9 per cent to $42.67.Meanwhile, Beazer Homes plunged 12.5 per cent to $29.03 after it said it was co-operating with FBI inquiries into its mortgage lending. No allegations of wrong-doing have yet been made.Energy groups were lifted by rising oil prices this week, with Chevron up 0.4 per cent at $74.12.Archer Daniels Midland, surrendered early gains to stand 0.2 per cent down at $36.70 on Friday after the US government forecast a steep rise in corn planting.Shares in papermakers surged on Friday after the imposition of duties on Chinese imports. International Paper gained 1.4 per cent to $36.40.Altria rose 2.7 per cent to $87.81 over the week on speculation that the tobacco and food company might spin off its Philip Morris cigarette division.In deal news, the battle to buy Tribune intensified as California billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad sweetened their offer in an effort to trump Chicago property magnate Sam Zell’s bid.Mr Burkle and Mr Broad offered $34 a share, a bid that tops Mr Zell’s $33 offer. Tribune shares rose 1.8 per cent to $32.11 on Friday.
195;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-03-27T19:34:37Z;Lennar warns of slow start to spring sales;;Lennar, the third-largest US homebuilder, provided more evidence of the sagging confidence in the housing sector on Tuesday as it warned that the traditional spring selling season had failed to ignite.The Miami-based group also abandoned its earnings guidance for the year and took additional charges against falling land values as recent economic data suggested the recovery of the national market will take longer than many experts had predicted.While many homebuilders have cut construction and increased discounts to shift unsold inventory, there are rising concerns the problems in the subprime lending sector will spread to more traditional mortgages and delay a broad-based recovery until early next year.The uncertain outlook has also hit consumer confidence , according to a survey released on Tuesday by the Conference Board. “Apprehension about the short-term future has suddenly cast a cloud over consumers’ confidence,” said Lynn Franco, its director.“The recent turmoil in financial markets coupled with the run-up in gasoline prices may have contributed to consumers’ heightened sense of uncertainty and concern,” she added.The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index fell to a worse-than-expected level of 107.2 in March from 111.2 in February, prompting a decline in housing shares on the New York Stock Exchange.The S&P Homebuilders index slid 2.4 per cent to stand 24 per cent below its high for the year. DR Horton fell 3 per cent to $22.11 while KB Home was off 3 per cent at $44.60 in late trade.Recent data have added to fears that the housing slowdown – which trimmed three-quarters of a percentage point from US growth in the fourth quarter of 2006 – could infect the broader economy, despite assurances from members of the US Federal Reserve that such signals have yet to emerge.Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas fell by 0.2 per cent in January, their first drop in six years, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index released on Tuesday.The poor start to the spring selling season is concerning industry executives. The period from Super Bowl Sunday in February to mid-April traditionally accounts for two-thirds of US new and existing home sales.Lennar’s wide national footprint across the “sunbelt” states in the south and east coast and a product mix including starter, move-up and retirement homes is viewed as a useful barometer of the hundreds of micromarkets in the US which are showing varying degrees of continuing distress.The company’s caution follows a commerce department report showing a slowdown in national new-home sales in January and February and worrying signs that the large inventory of unsold houses has started to climb.“The housing market continues to demonstrate overall weakness,” said Stuart Miller, Lennar’s president and chief executive. “While some markets are performing better than others, the typically stronger spring selling season has not yet materialised.”Builders have been split about the signs of recovery, and expectations of some “pent-up” demand being released saw single-family starts rise 10 per cent while average selling prices also rose.
196;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-03-27T17:07:01Z;US stocks slide on housing fears;;US stocks sagged on Tuesday as signs of softer consumer confidence and a profits warning from Lennar, the third-biggest US homebuilder, aggravated worries about the economy.Shares in Lennar fell sharply in early trading after the company warned that it would miss 2007 profits forecasts and said it was uncomfortable giving any earnings guidance to investors.In a bleak assessment, Stuart Miller, chief executive, said the “typically stronger” spring selling season that bulls hoped would signal a pick-up in the housing market had “yet to materialise”.This echoed disappointing data on new homes sales and prices, prompting a sell-off in the sector for a second successive day.The homebuilders began to recoup losses in the afternoon after S&P upgraded its rating on Lennar from “sell” to “hold”, arguing that the shares had fallen too low. Lennar closed 0.1 per cent down at $44.50.The S&P Homebuilders index pared early losses to stand 1.1 per cent lower, about 23 per cent below its high for the year. DR Horton fell 1.4 per cent to $22.48 while KB Home was off 1.5 per cent at $45.31.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.6 per cent at 1,428.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.6 per cent lower at 12,397.29.

There were some bright spots as shares in the transport and retail areas benefited from expectations that consumers would raise their spending as the so-called oil tax of high prices was diluted.Overhanging the market were better than expected economic reports that lowered odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year. “The catalyst for a stronger stock market in 2007 was an easing and right now the Fed is not going to do anything,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.Technology shares dominated activity this week, and their new year surge was ended by earnings that failed to vindicate recent market gains as well as lower guidance on the outlook for the current quarter and broker downgrades.The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 5.3 per cent this week, wiping out its prior gain for the year.Late on Friday, stocks were rangebound, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was the notable laggard for the week.

Intel slid 5.9 per cent to $20.82, cutting its gain for the year to 2.5 per cent. Other chipmakers down sharply this week included Lam Research, which plunged 13.3 per cent to $47.28 after the company said shipment delays would lower future earnings. KLA Tencor lost 8 per cent to $48.01 and Novellus fell 6.5 per cent to $30.61. Both suffered broker downgrades.Other high-profile technology companies also dragged the market lower.

The stock rose above $100 a share for the first time since 2002 this week, part of a 30 per cent rally in the past six months.Citigroup reiterated its “buy” rating for IBM after its results and recommended investors buy Intel and Cisco “on recent weakness”. IBM dragged on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and late on Friday it was nearly unchanged at 12,565.53. The average was barely changed on the week, after hitting a record high on Wednesday of 12,614.Transport and retail shares were boosted by oil prices nudging down towards $50 a barrel.

199;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-01-17T14:41:59Z;Lennar to cut construction by 20%;;Lennar, the third-largest US homebuilder, on Wednesday forecast it would cut construction by 20 per cent this year in a bid to clear excess market supply and counter the collapse in margins at the end of 2006.The Miami-based group opened the sector’s reporting season with a warning that the national housing market remained depressed, but unveiled a series of measures designed to bolster earnings despite writing down the value of its land holdings and options.Lennar and its rivals among the Big Six public builders have been cutting production and boosting discounts to shift an inventory of unsold houses which had stretched to more than nine months by the end of 2006.Recent national data suggests the incentives have reversed some of the downward pressure on sales, though many of the once-overheated markets in the south and west of the country remain depressed.Lennar admitted that average sales incentives rose more than four-fold in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with the same period a year earlier. The rise, from $10,600 per home to $47,300, depressed the average sales price and pulled down margins from 27 per cent to 14.4 per cent over the same period, and 18.7 per cent is its fiscal third quarter.The company had already warned earlier this month that almost $500m in land impairment charges would lead to a fourth quarter loss. The net deficit of $195.6m for the three months to November 30 compared with a profit of $581.2m a year earlier, and sliced its full-year earnings from $1.36bn to $593.9m.Stuart Miller, president and chief executive, said Lennar would cut costs and redesign its products in an effort to rebuild margins, and forecast a recovery in the second half of the year which would allow 2007 earnings to match or exceed its performance last year.
200;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-01-16T23:19:26Z;Bricks and mortar and choppy water;;Stuart Miller, president and chief executive of Lennar, demonstrates the snappy sales patter you would expect when he explains how one of the largest US housebuilders has reacted to the cooling market.“We don’t adjust like a speedboat. We adjust like a cruise ship,” Mr Miller told investors last year.Lennar, like its peers, screwed the lid on new construction to temper an oversupply of new houses, which had lasted almost 10 months by the end of the year.Today the company will open the builders’ quarterly reporting season and give investors the first chance of 2007 to sample choppier waters. It could prove to be a transformative year for the US housebuilding sector.While residential construction accounts for just 6 per cent of America’s gross domestic product, it has a distortive effect on the broader economy – trimming growth in the third quarter and leading to cautious earnings outlooks across corporate America. The sector is being closely watched at home and abroad.Analysts said Miami-based Lennar, which ranked third in the sector after selling more than 42,000 homes in 2005, provided a snapshot of evolving sentiment among the hundreds of national micro-markets. Its business is split evenly between the once-booming south and west, and the steadier east coast segment.Lennar and its rivals among the big six public builders had enjoyed two years of record sales and profits before a rapid deterioration in market conditions last summer forced them to prune building and turn to discounts to shift the growing stock of unsold houses.Homebuilder stocks and bond yields have rallied from July’s lows, with bonds tightening since September in spite of a succession of profit warnings as discounts chewed into margins.The large builders have already written off more than $2bn against land options that they will no longer exercise. But strong balance sheets and access to ample funding allow them to absorb lower margins and target potential acquisitions among their privately owned rivals.“There’s definitely the haves and the have-nots,” said Sue Berliner at Bear Stearns. She believes Lennar and its two larger rivals, DR Horton and Pulte Homes, will be “first out of the blocks” in seeking acquisitions.National housing data in the past two months have provided conflicting signals about how close the market is to bottoming out. Discounts and incentives are helping order books to recover, while the inventory of unsold existing houses has started to abate.As Mr Miller noted last June, it is difficult for the large builders simply to turn off the tap of new construction as that would drive up costs and affect free cash.“Lennar and DR Horton are definitely focused on shifting as many houses as they can,” Ms Berliner said, pointing to trends in incentives and cancellation rates as key talking points in the reporting season.Builder sentiment will also be analysed. Signals are conflicting in a sector that remained confident about its outlook until the middle of last year before the wholesale exit of speculative buyers forced a rethink.Toll Brothers has been one of the lone voices predicting a bottom to the market. The company specialises in the luxury home segment, which was the first to deteriorateRobert Toll, one of the more colourful chairmen in the sector, has also turned on the sales patter. He declared in December that “there has never been a better time to buy a home”. In contrast, Don Tomnitz, his opposite number at DR Horton, has a bearish outlook.And as Centex, the Texas-based group, issued a fourth-quarter warning, its chief executive Tim Eller said Tuesday: “We are navigating through one of the most challenging housing environments in the past 25 years.”
201;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-01-09T15:17:49Z;US housebuilder sees drop in cancellations;;DR Horton, one of the largest homebuilders in the US, said on Tuesday that cancellations dropped in the final quarter of 2006, signalling that some confidence may be flowing back into the struggling housing market.However, the Texas-based builder said net orders fell 28 per cent in the three months to December 31 amid “challenging” sales conditions and the widespread use of discounts and other incentives.DR Horton’s report adds weight to recent data suggesting the national market has yet to reach a bottom, though a small rise in sales of new homes last month suggested that falling prices and rising incentives are tempting buyers back to the market.Analysts remain cautious about data during the traditionally slow winter selling season, but are closely monitoring sales and sentiment amid lingering concerns that the housing slowdown will “infect” the broader economy and aggravate the cooling US economy.DR Horton and rivals such as Pulte, Lennar and Centex have cut their construction programmes and boosted discounts in a bid to clear more than six months of unsold inventory, paving the way for a recovery in the broader market in 2008.They have also written off $1.5bn in charges against land options which they no longer plan to use, hurt by the withdrawal of speculative buyers who once accounted for as much as a quarter of their business.Nervousness about the market had pushed cancellation rates last year to more than 50 per cent in once-booming markets such as Florida. DR Horton, which closed more than 50,000 sales of homes in its last fiscal year, said drop-out rates had fallen from 40 per cent in the three months to September 30 to 33 per cent in its fiscal first quarter to December 30.Net sales for the first quarter fell to $2.3bn from $3.2bn a year earlier. The company will report further details alongside its earnings on January 23.Lennar, the largest US builder by orders and revenues in the third quarter, warned earlier this month that it would take up to $500m in land charges and report a fourth-quarter loss as market conditions continued to weaken.The Florida-based group is heavily exposed to the once-booming markets in the west and the south-east of the country, and has pursued aggressive discounts to move homes aimed at the lower end of the market, and renegotiated land holdings as it reduces future building plans.A similar strategy is being pursued by other members of the Big Six public builders, but Lennar’s decision to take $400m-$500m in impairment charges and write-offs is by far the largest among its peers.“Market conditions continued to weaken throughout the fourth quarter and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery,” said Stuart Miller, president and chief executive, in a statement accompanying the preliminary results.Sales of existing US homes rose slightly last month though activity in the south remains depressed, suggesting the national sector has yet to reach its nadir.According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of all existing homes rose 0.6 per cent in November - the second consecutive monthly rise - with median prices dipping. The inventory of unsold properties fell 1 per cent from recent highs.Most of the rise in the existing home business was driven by sales in the north-east, and volumes continued to fall in the south of the country, which accounted for 38 per cent of nationwide transactions in 2005.The south and west also account for three-quarters of new home sales, and analysts remain concerned about the pace of building despite signals from builders that they were cutting construction following the exit of speculative buyers.The supply of new homes still remains above six months, at current sales rates, while the existing home inventory dipped to 7.3 months in November from 7.4 months the previous month, well above the five-month level a year ago. The supply of condominiums and multi-family homes still remains above nine months.Shares in the housebuilder rose 0.8 per cent in early trade at $25.41.

buyers.Stronger-than-expected job creation in December sent stocks lower on Friday and tipped them into negative territory for the week. Equity investors began the year optimistic that a Federal Reserve rate cut before June would offset slower earnings growth.“A rate cut is looking less likely in the first half of this year,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment adviser at Deutsche Bank. “The most important factor for the equity market this year will be evidence of inflation moderating and trending lower as it will give the Fed the flexibility to cut rates should the economy slow further.”The S&P 500 settled down 0.6 per cent at 1,409.71 on Friday, a fall of 0.6 per cent this week.

The bullish mood continued after a manufacturing survey proved to be stronger than expected and price pressures fell, reducing inflation fears.The Dow Jones Industrial Average set a new intra-day record high of 12,580.35 during morning trade, while technology shares boosted the Nasdaq Composite.Stocks then pared some of their gains ahead of the Fed’s December meeting minutes being released.

204;LEN;Lennar Corp;2007-01-02T14:38:13Z;Lennar hit by $500m charge;;Lennar, one of the largest US homebuilders, warned on Tuesday that it would take up to $500m in land charges and report a fourth-quarter loss as market conditions continued to weaken.The preliminary report from the Florida-based group - the largest US builder by orders and revenues in the third quarter – counters expectations among some analysts that recent national data point to an earlier recovery in the ailing housing market.Sales of existing US homes rose slightly in November, though activity in the crucial southern market remained depressed in a sign that the nationwide market has yet to reach its nadir.Lennar is heavily exposed to the once-booming markets in the west and the south-east of the country, and has pursued aggressive discounts to move homes aimed at the lower end of the market, and renegotiated land holdings as it reduces future building plans.A similar strategy is being pursued by other members of the Big Six public builders, but Lennar’s decision to take $400m-$500m in impairment charges and write-offs is by far the largest among its peers.“Market conditions continued to weaken throughout the fourth quarter and we have not yet seen tangible evidence of a market recovery,” said Stuart Miller, president and chief executive, in a statement accompanying the preliminary results.Lennar closed almost 50,000 homes in its fiscal year to November 30, and expects the charges to cut its earnings per share in the final quarter from a profit of $0.70-$0.75 to a loss of $0.88-$1.28. It earned $4.88 a share in the previous three quarters.Analysts remain concerned about Lennar’s aggressive attempts to shift homes built on a speculative basis, and the high prices it may have paid for some of its land holdings. The company booked almost $60m in impairment charges in the prior quarter, and the jump to as much as $500m after an “asset-by-asset” review highlights the deterioration of the market. The Big Six had already booked $1bn in charges before Lennar’s latest announcement.The discounts cut Lennar’s gross margin - already among the lowest in the sector - to 18.7 per cent in its fiscal third quarter, a fall of almost 8 percentage points over the year. More than a quarter of the company’s building is in California and Nevada, two of the “hottest” property markets over the past five years, and among the first to suffer from the current downturn.Lennar also announced a boost to its financial position on Tuesday with an agreement to sell a stake in its LandSource joint venture to MW Housing Partners, a real-estate group run by MacFarlane Partners with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of the largest US pension funds.The builder and LNR, a real-estate group controlled by the Cerberus private equity group, will each receive $660m from the sale of a 62 per cent stake in LandSource to MW Housing.
205;LEN;Lennar Corp;2006-09-26T13:11:54Z;US market slowdown hits Lennar margins;;The heavy discounting by US homebuilders was highlighted on Tuesday as Lennar reported a sharp drop in margins and admitted that the slowdown in the market was faster and deeper than the company expected.Miami-based Lennar is heavily exposed to the overheated markets in Florida and California where rapid price appreciation over the past five years led to a surge in speculative construction.The slowdown in sales growth over the past year has forced most of the large housebuilders to trim construction plans and raise incentives to shift unsold stock and led to a string of downward earnings’ revisions over the past few months. However, Lennar has continued to build as part of its “Even Flow” strategy, which aims to maximise the efficiency of construction.Lennar, the third-largest US builder by sales, said its gross margins fell from 26.3 per cent to 18.7 per cent in the three months to August 31, twice the decrease expected by analysts and down from the 23.5 per cent reported in the prior quarter.The company said it had limited land purchases and “reduced standing inventory through strategic asset management”, which analysts viewed as an admission of the level of discounting in the market.Rising inventories are seen as the main problem facing the US market, though official data on existing home sales in August, released on Monday, showed a 1.7 per cent fall in average selling prices as sellers were forced to cut prices. Economists will be looking for similar signals when data for new home sales is published on Wednesday.Lennar said its average selling price rose from $306,000 to $316,000 in its fiscal third quarter to August 31, while its backlog has dropped from 17,990 homes to 16,008 over the same period.Net profits dipped from $337.3m to $206.7m in the quarter, in line with guidance revised last week. It also cut its guidance for the fourth quarter.The slowdown at Lennar comes after Lowe’s, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, on Monday warned that current sales were falling below expectations. The company said declining housing turnover and high energy costs were among the factors causing the company to take a “more cautious outlook” for the rest of the year.

Qualcomm traded 0.7 per cent higher to $49.71, JDS Uniphase climbed 0.5 per cent to $4.05 and Ciena rose 1.6 per cent to $5.23.The sector helped the Nasdaq Composite Index put on 0.1 per cent to 2,315.58, however the broader market lost ground as the mood turned cautious with the start of the Federal Reserve’s two-day interest rate-setting meeting.Maury Harris, an economist at UBS, said the fact the meeting was the first to be chaired by Ben Bernanke raised the the potential for a surprise, but the chances of one actually happening were slim.“We believe one of the chairman’s goals initially is to stress continuity with the Grreenspan era, minimising volatility in the market associated with a change in leadership,” he said.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 11,250.27, while the S&P 500 also eased 0.1 per cent to 1,301.61.Housebuilders put in a strong performance, with Toll Brothers rising 2.8 per cent to $35.30 after Wachovia upgraded the housebuilder from “market perform” to “outperform”.Wachovia said it believed the worst news for Toll the company was behind it. “A uniquely strong competitive position relative to small high-end custom builders led us to believe that Toll Brothers’ shares should outperform over the next six to 12 months,” analysts said. “Shares remain inexpensive in our view.”The move gave other large housebuilders a boost, with Ryland rising 0.9 per cent to $71.49 and Lennar climbing 0.7 per cent to $60.33.Metal stocks were in focus after Citigroup issued a bullish note on the sector, raising its forecasts substantially for copper and nickel and more modestly for aluminium and gold.Metal producers Inco, Alcan and Phelps Dodge were all upgraded. Inco added 0.8 per cent to $49.46, Alcan gained 1 per cent to $45.76 and Phelps rose 2 per cent to $76.61.Circuit City, the consumer electronics retailer, rose 1.6 per cent to $24.64 after an upgrade from broker Lehman Brothers.There were contrasting fortunes among pharmaceuticals. Santarus rose 4.8 per cent to $6.55 after the drugmaker said regulators had approved a tablet form of its Zegerid heartburn drug.Encysive Pharmaceuticals fell 49.3 per cent to $4.60 after the Food and Drug Administration requested further trials of its hypertension drug Thelin, saying it had concerns that must be satisfied prior to granting approval.
212;LEN;Lennar Corp;2005-09-27T20:29:43Z;Wall St steady despite slide in confidence;;Taser International, the stun gun maker, saw its shares lose 13.1 per cent to $6.35 after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was stepping up an investigation of the company to the point where it could subpoena documents.The decline came as Wall Street stocks proved that hope springs eternal by closing virtually unchanged in the wake of a report showing consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low.The report was the first evaluation of the impact of recent hurricanes on American consumers. It raised the prospect of slowing consumer expenditure in an economy that owed much of its recent expansion to the resilience of consumers and their willingness to borrow.David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch, noted this week that consumer discretionaries have been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year and warned investors that there was a risk of disappointment next year, given that consensus forecasts see the sector as having the best earnings prospects in 2006. On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, initial declines in those stocks with more direct exposure to consumer spending patterns mostly faded away by the close. Thus, Wal-Mart, the retailer, was less than 0.1 per cent off at $43.10, while Home Depot lost 0.1 per cent to $38.39. McDonald’s lost 0.8 per cent to $33.01.By the close, this background saw a 0.1 per cent advance in the Dow to 10,456.21, while the S&P 500 index was flat at 1,215.66. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.2 per cent to 2,116.42.The day’s other data report appeared to do nothing to help sentiment, showing that new homes sales fell in August. However, homebuilders recouped some of their earlier losses.The news sent the Dow Jones US home construction index 0.6 per cent lower, with Toll Brothers down 1.6 per cent to $43.28. KB Home gave up 1.9 per cent to $72, Centex lost 0.8 per cent to $63.40 and DR Horton gave up 0.2 per cent to $35.50.Lennar, which reported above-expectation quarterly results after the Monday close, was 0.1 per cent off at $57.Other stocks in the news included ExxonMobil, which closed unchanged at $64.62 and Chevron, off 0.1 per cent at $64.18. The two oil groups received a downgrade and an upgrade respectively from analysts at JPMorgan.Meanwhile, in deal news, the shares of WellChoice rose 7 per cent to $75.51 after reports that WellPoint, the largest US health insurer, was set to acquire the company. WellPoint was 0.1 per cent lower at $75.01.News that profits grew by 7.3 per cent at Pepsi Bottling Group pushed the company’s shares up 3.1 per cent to $28.46.Movie Gallery, a DVD-rental chain, was 13.9 per cent lower at $11.04, not far from a fresh low point after the company announced that it would suspend its quarterly dividend in order to pay down debt. The stock is down almost 42 per cent for the year.Blockbuster, a rival, was down 1.3 per cent at $4.51.Netflix, which rents DVDs via the internet, improved by 1.4 per cent to $24.30.
213;LEN;Lennar Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Pulte Homes was down 0.8 per cent at $83.48 and Lennar fell 1.3 per cent to $58.93.All of which added to the woes of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. By the close the index was 0.5 per cent down at 10,519.58. The S&P 500 was also off 0.3 at 1,217.58. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 to 2,137.25.George F. Foley, portfolio manager at Glenmede, said low trading volumes had helped to exaggerate the significance of the housing numbers. “In August, when you get a bit of negative news about a sector that has been propped up on stilts, people run for the door – there are just no buyers out there at the moment.”Among the day’s other fallers was Dow component Citigroup, which dropped 1.4 per cent to $43.56, after news broke that Marjorie Magner, head of consumer banking, Citigroup’s most profitable unit, will step down at the end of September.La-Z-Boy, the company famous for its reclining chairs, was the latest to blame flagging fortunes on high oil prices. Expensive energy is generally thought to erode consumer spending power.

The Nasdaq Composite also hit a three-and-a-half-year high, closing up 0.1 per cent at 2,162.55.Although market activity was muted, Wall Street remained in high spirits thanks to the strong rally recorded since late October on the back of the removal of election uncertainty, crude prices retreating from the mid-$50s and the weak dollar lifting the corporate earnings outlook.Since October 22, the S&P 500 has rallied 10 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 13 per cent since October 14. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had touched yearly or multi-year highs on Tuesday as investors shrugged off reports of a record trade deficit and the US Federal Reserve's widely expected decision to raise interest rates.Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup Smith Barney, said that recent upbeat reports from bellwether companies and data showing underlying strength in the economy meant that stocks were likely to continue making gains in 2005. Mr Levkovich cautioned, however, that there could be ""somewhat of an inevitable pullback"" in January as fund managers emerge from pressure to meet performance targets and secure year-end bonuses.Oil prices continued to cast a shadow over Wall Street on Wednesday as news of a slide in US crude and heating oil inventories and a cold snap across the eastern US helped push crude futures back above $44 per barrel.Financial stocks led gainers on the back of strong fourth-quarter earnings from Lehman Brothers, which reported profits up 22 per cent, driven by income from bond trading and strong investment banking revenues. Shares in Lehman, the first big US bank to report earnings this season, rose 2.6 per cent to $87.90.Anton Schutz, portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors, cautioned against viewing Lehman's performance as a bellwether for the sector, however. ""Fixed income has been stronger than expected, but you never really know if [banks] have got the trading side right,"" he said.Shares in other US investment banks were mixed. Goldman Sachs slipped 0.6 per cent to $109.25, while Morgan Stanley climbed 1.5 per cent to $55.53.An upbeat earnings report from Lennar, the number three US housebuilder, gave a boost to housing stocks. Shares in Lennar, which raised its 2005 earnings forecast as it reported profits up 34 per cent in the fourth quarter, jumped 10.9 per cent to $56.35.Shares in DR Horton, the biggest US-based housebuilder by market capitalisation, rose 4 per cent to $41.36. KB Homes, a rival housing group, rose 4.5 per cent to $105.50.Shares in Las Vegas Sands, owner of the Venetian casino and Sands convention centre in Las Vegas, rocketed to $46.56 in their market debut - more than 60 per cent above their offer price. The meteoric rise made Sands the best first-day gainer among US-based companies that have launched initial public offerings this year, according to Thomson Financial.Sands' IPO was also the best for a US company since Jet Blue gained 67 per cent in May 2002, and the best for an New York Stock Exchange-listed IPO since Martha Stewart Living gained 98% in October 1999, Thomson said.Sprint and Nextel were back in the spotlight as the telecommunications rivals revealed they had agreed to merge in a widely anticipated deal worth $35bn. The new company will be the third-largest telecoms group in the US with more than 40m customers.

220;LEN;Lennar Corp;2004-10-26T17:05:29Z;Wall St climbs as insurance stocks get boost;;Insurers staged a rally that led Wall Street higher on Tuesday morning amid relief about a wide-reaching probe by Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general.By midsession, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent at 9,853.58 while the broader S&P 500 index was up 1 per cent at 1,105.50. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite put on 0.3 per cent to 1,920.08.The shares of Marsh & McLennan gained 8.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company’s chief executive resigned and Mr Spitzer said he would not pursue criminal charges against the company as part of his wide-reaching probe into the practices of the insurance industry.The ripples of the news gave a lift to the other so-called Spitzer stocks of insurance groups targeted by or involved in the investigation. Shares in American International Group rose 6.4 per cent to $59.73 while ACE gained 6.6 per cent to $37.09. MetLife was 3.4 per cent higher at $36.24 as Aetna put on 4.7 per cent to $88.80.Rob Arancio, trader at Lehman Brothers, said: “A lot of the market action had to do with the relief rally in insurance stocks and decreased concerns about lawsuits there.”Mr Arancio added that there was evidence of a “healthy rotation” of capital into stocks “that have been decimated” recently, such as airlines and homebuilders.The American Stock Exchange Airline index added 3.9 per cent, powered by a 23 per cent rise to $4.65 in Delta Air Lines after JP Morgan upgraded the stock.

The Conference Board, the business research group which released the data, said the index was 92.8, its lowest level in seven months.Economists noted the worsening in consumer expectations component of the index and attributed to rising energy costs. While Ian Shepherdson at High Frequency Economics predicted further declines in confidence because of energy costs, Stephen Gallagher at SG Investment Banking deemed that as a “known risk” and dwelled on evidence of increased consumer spending and improving labour markets, “which are key …in the performance of financial markets”.Meanwhile the crude oil price, which had weighed on stocks, retreated after the Norwegian government acted to avoid a strike that could have disrupted production at a time when the markets are jittery about supply-demand imbalances ahead winter.As the third-quarter earnings season continued, Sara Lee, the consumer goods group, saw shares add 2.1 per cent to $22.91 after it reported higher quarterly earnings that investors appeared to dismiss owing to the effect of a fee from an asset sale. Commodity prices and other factors would have caused the company’s earnings to be flat if the fee had been excluded.In the defence sector, Lockheed Martin shares were up 1.1 per cent to $54.10 after the company reported a 41 per cent rise in third-quarter profits, raised its 2004 full-year estimate but guided analysts below their forecasts for next year.Halliburton, the oil services group, reported a quarterly loss owing to charges it took to provide for asbestos-related liabilities.
