0;TGT;Target Corp;2020-01-15T12:20:06Z;Target cuts sales outlook after weak Christmas sales;Sluggish growth for one of sector’s best recent performers sparks concern over US consumer spending;Target has slashed its quarterly sales outlook after far weaker than forecast festive sales, ringing alarm bells on Wall Street about the state of US retail as the company had been coping better than most with upheaval in the industry.Like-for-like sales rose only 1.4 per cent in November and December, the retailer said on Wednesday, an unexpectedly sharp slowdown from the 5.7 per cent expansion recorded over the same period a year earlier. Toys and electronics were especially weak.The update from Target, which sells a vast range of products from food and toiletries to furniture and kitchenware, raises new questions about US consumer spending — whose strength has underpinned global economic growth for months.Shares in the company, which had rallied 82 per cent over the past year, slid 7.6 per cent by mid-morning in New York, wiping $4.8bn from its market capitalisation.The particular weakness in electronics, where like-for-like sales fell more than 6 per cent from a year ago, sent shares in electronics retailer Best Buy down 2 per cent.Toymaker shares also came under pressure after Target said toy sales had failed to rise from last year’s levels, with Mattel down 6.4 per cent and Hasbro falling 3.4 per cent.Target now expects like-for-like sales for the quarter to be dragged down to 1.4 per cent, less than half of the 3 to 4 per cent it had previously forecast and well below the 3.8 per cent expected by analysts in a Bloomberg poll.The results were a “tough miss”, said Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive of Target. “While we knew this season was going be challenging, it was even more challenging than we expected.”The figures from Target, which has become a US retail powerhouse with more than 1,800 stores, were particularly concerning as the company is seen as one of the best-performing companies in the sector.While mall-based clothing and department stores in particular have long struggled to adapt to the age of ecommerce, and several posted declines in holiday sales last week, Target has been finding success with its mix of value and convenience. Several of the company’s own brands have also been popular, and Target has made strides online.Still, analysts noted the weak sales figures were being compared with a strong performance this time last year.Despite the lower sales outlook, the company maintained its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings per share guidance at $1.55 to $1.75 and $6.27 to $6.47 respectively. Mr Cornell said this demonstrated the “durability of our business model”.Neil Saunders, managing director of the GlobalData Retail consultancy, noted that Target’s sales had remained robust in some categories, up 5 per cent in clothing and 7 per cent in beauty.However, he said that flat electronics sales were partly the result of a “far from inspiring” line-up of tech this year that was out of Target’s control.“Target remains a good retailer on the right trajectory,” he said. “It may have stumbled and slowed over the holidays but it is still one of the most attractive runners.”Alongside the figures, Target also announced the departure of Janna Potts, its chief stores officer, after 30 years with the company. She will be replaced by Target property executive Mark Schindele.
1;TGT;Target Corp;2019-11-20T18:40:59Z;Target shares hit the mark after chain raises forecasts;US retailer forecasts tenth straight quarter of same-store sales growth;US retailer Target has raised its profit forecasts for 2019, as its third-quarter results painted a robust picture of the American consumer.Reaping the benefits of a turnround strategy spearheaded by chief executive Brian Cornell, Target on Wednesday said same-store sales rose 4.5 per cent in the three months ended November 2. That was down from a 5.1 per cent a year ago, but better than the 3.4 per cent the group achieved last quarter.The big box retailer forecast same-store sales — a closely watched industry metric — would rise for a tenth straight quarter in the final three months of its current fiscal year. Target shares surged almost 14 per cent on the news.The group’s results come as investors scrutinise the health of the US consumer, which has been sustained by a strong jobs market and proved one of the brightest spots in the economic expansion. However, a handful of disappointing results from retailers on Tuesday, and weak underlying measures in October’s retail sales data, again stirred debate about the resilience of spending ahead of the crucial holiday season.Target’s fortunes have diverged from those of other large US retail chains. Its strategy, which included offering more profitable in-house branded products, has underpinned a 20 per cent rise in annual net income between the 2015 and 2018 financial years.Michelle Gass, chief executive of department store chain Kohl’s, on Tuesday blamed an “increasingly competitive environment” as one of the reasons behind disappointing third-quarter results. On the same day, Home Depot also cut its financial forecasts for the second time this year, partly because of declining lumber prices rather than weak consumer spending.The market has rewarded winning retailers and ramped up speculative bets against losers.Minneapolis-based Target forecast same-store sales growth of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in the current quarter. That would follow year-on-year growth of 4.5 per cent in the three months ended November 2.In a conference call with analysts, Mr Cornell highlighted “the really exceptional performance in categories like apparel, where we performed extremely well, growing at a rate of over 10 per cent, picking up significant market share.”In the third quarter, Target’s revenue rose 4.7 per cent from a year ago to $18.7bn, topping Wall Street forecasts for $18.5bn. Earnings increased 18.5 per cent year-on-year to $1.39 a share, topping the median analyst forecast. Its operating margin of 5.4 per cent in the third quarter was up from 4.6 per cent a year ago.Target raised its 2019 adjusted earnings forecast for the second consecutive quarter.
2;TGT;Target Corp;2019-09-05T00:06:21Z;Target tells suppliers to bear cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs;Demand to hundreds of providers sets stage for tense talks over prices of Chinese imports;Target has set the stage for contentious talks with the US retailer’s suppliers of Chinese goods, telling them it would refuse to “accept any cost increases related to tariffs” imposed by Donald Trump in his trade war with Beijing.Hundreds of suppliers to the S&P 500 company received the warning in a memo sent last week, shortly before 15 per cent tariffs on $112bn of goods from China went into effect at the weekend.“Our expectation is that you will develop the appropriate contingency plans so that we don’t have to pass price increases along” to customers, wrote Mark Tritton, Target’s chief merchandising officer.To be so direct [with suppliers] is fairly unusualWith a network of more than 1,800 stores across the US and sales of $74.4bn last year, Target is a crucial route to market for suppliers of goods ranging from groceries and toiletries to electronics and homewares. Its shares are trading just shy of an all-time high, giving the company a $54.9bn market capitalisation.The scale of Target’s US presence and popularity among American shoppers have given it substantial clout in negotiations with providers.Even so, some analysts warned its apparent refusal to accept a share of tariff costs risked alienating suppliers.“Some will be pretty cross,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, adding that despite Target’s “cosy” public image, the memo was a sign that the company could be “quite ruthless”.“To be so direct [with suppliers] is fairly unusual,” he said.Jan Kniffen, a retail consultant, described the demand in the memo as an “opening gambit” and predicted that suppliers would not necessarily give in. “It’s going to be a negotiation,” he said.Retailers and their suppliers have also been shifting production and sourcing away from China in an effort to contain the financial fallout from the trade war.Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer of Walmart’s US business, told a conference on Wednesday that while the retailer had successfully navigated earlier rounds of tariffs, the latest tranche “gets tougher” and “covers a lot more” products.Still, he described price rises as a “last resort”. “There’s a whole bunch of different levers that a buyer can pull,” he said.Bruce Besanko, chief financial officer of Kohl’s, told another conference organised by Goldman Sachs this week: “We’re certainly partnering with our vendors and suppliers to be sure that we try to avoid having an impact to our customers.”Mr Tritton’s memo was sent to Target suppliers that are “importers of record” — those legally responsible for ensuring that goods are imported in accordance with the law — for goods from China. It said: “We have delivered on this [customer]-centric plan with your co-operation, hard work and partnership and appreciate the work we’ve done, together.”
3;TGT;Target Corp;2019-08-21T21:52:40Z;Short sellers bloodied as Target shares jump 20%;Bets against the retailer’s shares rose ahead of blowout earnings;Short sellers of shares in Target, the US retailer, suffered paper losses of almost half a billion dollars after the company’s better than expected sales and profit numbers sent the stock soaring to a record high.Short bets against the retailer’s shares rose significantly over the past week ahead of the company’s latest earnings report, repeating a pattern that has emerged in the past several quarters, according to IHS Markit data.Short selling involves borrowing shares in a company from an existing owner in order to sell the stock in anticipation it will fall.Short interest accounted for 2.8 per cent of Target’s shares, or $1.2bn. on Tuesday, compared to 2 per cent, or $870m, at the start of the previous week.The paper loss totalled $479m as Target shares closed on Wednesday up 20.6 per cent at $103.11, according to S3 Partners, an independent financial data provider.“People have been bloodied on the bell,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics for S3. “They may hope the price weakens in coming days to see if their short positions improve, instead of dropping their positions today.”S3 also calculated that short sellers had lost $971m so far in 2019 on bets against Target shares. That ranks among the year’s most unsuccessful bearish positions, it said, though still far behind Alibaba, where short sellers have lost $6bn this year, and Apple, whose rising stock price has wiped $3.1bn from the portfolios of those betting against it.The precipitous drop reveals the risky nature of short selling, which can lead to sizeable losses when stocks suddenly rise, even if an underlying bearish thesis is borne out over time — as the shift toward online shopping that has hit profits at brick and mortar retailers may still be.The losses were incurred by a broad group of short sellers including a sizeable portion of quantitative hedge funds that take out large short positions in companies in common stock indices, like the S&P 500, in which Target features.“A lot of losses will be going into quant books, but a lot of equity long-short hedge funds are playing this name as well,” Mr Dusaniwsky said.Target increased its profit forecast for the year to between $5.90 and $6.20 per share on Wednesday, from $5.75 and $6.05 previously, in part because of positive results from its expanded online shopping offering and same-day deliveries. Brian Cornell, chief executive, said the company had gone from “simply selling on a website to integrating digital within every part of our business, positioning our stores at the centre of the most comprehensive suite of digital fulfilment options in the US”.“Brian Cornell is operating and executing at a very high level and is the best operator in the retail space right now and deserves 100 per cent of the credit for Target’s success,” said Marc Cohodes, a California-based short-seller who does not hold a short position in the company. “He took a lot of crap for a long time and now his efforts are being recognised in the marketplace.”
4;TGT;Target Corp;2019-08-21T18:03:09Z;Target and Lowe’s sales show US shoppers still spending;Shares in retailers surge as American consumers remain bright spot in global economy;Blowout financial results from US retailers Target and Lowe’s sent their share prices up sharply on Wednesday and provided evidence that Americans are continuing to spend despite fears over the outlook for the economy.Shares in big-box retailer Target were up 20 per cent to close at an all-time high. Meanwhile, home improvement chain Lowe’s closed 10 per cent higher.Both companies posted stronger-than-expected sales growth during the second quarter. That boosted the consumer discretionary sector as a whole, which rose 1.5 per cent.The results also provided more evidence that spending by US consumers is one of the global economy’s bright spots, even as investors worry about recession risks and the Trump administration’s trade war with Beijing.This month’s inversion of the yield curve, which plots US government bond yields of different maturities and is seen as a harbinger of recession, sparked a new round of gloom. But Brian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America, told CNBC on Wednesday that he believed too much attention was being given to Treasury rates, pointing to consumer spending as a more important indicator.In a world where consumers have more choices than ever, inferior brick-and-mortar experiences will go away“What it’s going to come down to is what’s really going on in the economy,” Mr Moynihan said. “The underlying consumer is doing well and making more money. They’re employed. And more importantly, they’re spending more money.”Last week Walmart, a bellwether for middle-class spending, said US consumers were in “solid” financial health as it raised its outlook, and the US government released data showing retail sales remained robust.Some signs of consumer skittishness are emerging. A University of Michigan survey earlier this month showed consumer sentiment turning less positive. Notably, it showed the Federal Reserve’s quarter point rate cut in July, aimed at supporting the economy, raised consumers’ fears about a possible slowdown and led them to conclude they may need to reduce spending in anticipation of a recession.Results on Wednesday signalled, however, that the consumer economy is humming along. Same-store sales rose 2.3 per cent at Lowe’s, ahead of estimates of 1.7 per cent. Target said sales at established stores were up 3.4 per cent, topping forecasts for a 3 per cent advance.Target — which sells homewares, clothes, electronics and beauty products across the US — showed it was reaping rewards from investing in its online offering, same-day deliveries and in-store experience. It increased its full-year adjusted profit forecast to between $5.90 and $6.20 per share, compared with the prior range of $5.75 to $6.05.Sales through Target’s digital channels grew 34 per cent in the second quarter on a comparable basis. Its same-day delivery service accounted for nearly 1.5 percentage points of the group’s 3.4 per cent comparable sales growth.“In a world where consumers have more choices than ever, inferior brick-and-mortar experiences will go away,” said John Mulligan, chief operating officer at Target. “That’s why we’re investing heavily, both in our store assets and in the experience our team provides.”Lowe’s, which was forced to cut its profit guidance in May as rising costs hurt its first-quarter earnings, sounded a more optimistic note this time. “The underlying macroeconomic fundamentals in the US remain supportive as demonstrated by the solid pace of job growth,” said David Denton, chief financial officer.The strong results for US retailers have not been universal. Macy’s the department store chain, said last week it was having to discount merchandise, sending its shares down 13 per cent. And Home Depot, the world’s biggest home improvement retailer, cited the US-China trade stand-off among the factors in a downgrade of its sales forecast for 2019.On Wednesday, though, Home Depot shares set a new intraday record high.
5;TGT;Target Corp;2019-05-22T11:48:11Z;Target bucks US retail gloom with strong sales growth;Cheap-chic offerings and same-day delivery help drive first-quarter earnings;Target continued to gain the upper hand in the battle for US retail dollars, with its digital investment and aggressive push to offer same-day delivery powering sales for its latest quarter.Like-for-like sales, a closely followed industry metric, rose 4.8 per cent in the three months to May 4 as shoppers flocked to its stores. The rise marks the eighth straight quarter of same-store sales growth for Target and topped expectations for a 4.1 per cent rise.It further validates chief executive Brian Cornell’s audacious plan, announced in 2017, to invest more than $7bn over three years in technology, supply chain and private-brand labels to compete against Amazon on the e-commerce front and against Walmart and TJMaxx on the price front.Shares in Target jumped as much as 10.1 per cent on the news. While the rise was trimmed to 9 per cent by mid afternoon trade, that is still enough put the stock on course for its best day since December 2008.“Target had an outstanding first quarter,” said Mr Cornell. “Over the past two years we have made important investments to build a durable operating and financial model that drives consumer relevance and sustainable growth. Target’s first quarter performance and market-share gains demonstrate that the model is working.”Target’s strong first quarter stands in contrast to the pain being felt in other parts of the US retail sector. Nordstrom, Kohl’s and JC Penney — three of the largest department store chains in the US — all reported falls in quarterly sales on Tuesday, unnerving investors and triggering a sharp sell-off in retail stocks.While department store operators have been squeezed by falling traffic to shopping centres and online competition, sales at Target — or Tar-zhay as its devotees call it — have been supported by its “high-low” strategy. Even as the $37bn big box retailer has aggressively lowered prices on basic household items such as paper towels to drive shoppers to its stores, it is betting that consumers will also snap up home decor, clothing and other knick-knacks from its in-house brands that offer higher profit margins.Its strategy of using stores as hubs to fulfil online orders has also kept it competitive even as Amazon and Walmart started offering free next-day shipping.Online sales rose 42 per cent during the quarter, with its same-day delivery services contributing to more than half of that growth.Overall, sales came in at $17.4bn for the three months, a 5.1 per cent year-on-year rise. Net income jumped nearly 11 per cent to $795m, or $1.53 per diluted share, ahead of estimates of $1.43 a share.The profit gain came despite the rise in operating costs and slight dip in gross margin.“Throughout this year, we will continue to extend the reach of our same-day fulfilment options, strengthen our portfolio of owned and exclusive brands, remodel and open more stores and invest in our team,” said Mr Cornell. “We’re confident that we’re well positioned to deliver strong financial performance in 2019 and beyond,” he added.Shares in Target are up about 9 per cent so far this year after eking out a 1.3 per cent gain in 2018.
6;TGT;Target Corp;2019-03-05T15:13:06Z;Target boosted by best sales growth since 2005;Retail stocks lifted by strong final quarter performances;Target posted its biggest annual rise in like-for-like sales since 2005 while rival Kohl’s also posted stronger-than-forecast figures as the latest batch of retail sector results reassured Wall Street.Shares in big-box retailer Target opened 5 per cent higher while department store chain Kohl’s was up 2.2 per cent as investors cheered the fourth quarter figures and stronger than forecast outlooks for the year ahead.Same-store sales growth at Target accelerated to 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, rising 5 per cent in 2018 as a whole. Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive, said the big box retailer was reaping financial rewards from the investments it has made in revamping its stores and improving its online offering. Digital sales rose almost a third in the fourth quarter.The investments, together with rising logistics and wage costs, sent Target’s fourth quarter gross margin down from 26.1 per cent in 2017 to 25.7 per cent. Operating income for the year as a whole eased 2.7 per cent to $4.1bn.However, Target’s earnings per share outlook for 2019 of between $5.75 to $6.05 per share was higher than analysts had expected.Kohl’s target to deliver earnings between $5.80 and $6.15 per share for 2019 was also better than expected. The company, led by chief executive Michelle Gass, has struck a deal with Amazon to allow customers to return items purchased from the ecommerce giant at its stores.Annual like-for-like sales rose 1.7 per cent, although operating income dipped from $1.42bn in 2017 to $1.36bn.
7;TGT;Target Corp;2019-01-10T13:22:40Z;Target bests rivals with upbeat holiday sales;;Target led the way among a series of retailer updates for the festive season as solid sales growth during the final two months of 2018 led it to recommit to its full-year sales and earnings guidance.The Minneapolis-based retailer’s numbers reinforce pre-Christmas predictions from top industry executives for a bumper shopping season supported by a robust economy — notwithstanding debate about the impact successive Federal Reserve interest rate rises might have on sentiment, and broader concerns over rent and footfall afflicting the sector.The big-box store said comparable sales, a closely watched industry metric, rose 5.7 per cent in the final months of 2018 from a year earlier, with growth in all five of its core merchandise categories.The increase was driven by more shoppers both in-store and online, as well as a “small increase” in average ticket prices, the company said. Seasonal gifts, along with toys and baby items, saw the strongest growth.The sales bump helped Target reaffirm guidance for its fourth quarter of 5 per cent year-on-year growth in comparable sales, and full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $5.30 to $5.50 a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters forecast full-year adjusted earnings of $5.39 a share.Target also announced a series of leadership changes alongside its financial figures, including news its chief financial officer Cathy Smith would be retiring.Brian Cornell, chief executive, said he was pleased with the holiday season performance. In 2019 “we expect to build on this momentum as we gain further scale in our fulfilment capabilities and deliver profitable growth throughout the year,” he said.Target said it had started an internal and external search for its next CFO. Ms Smith joined the company in 2015, having previously been CFO at pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts.Elsewhere among US retailers, L Brands, the parent company of troubled lingerie purveyor Victoria’s Secret, reported flat comparable sales growth in the five weeks ended January 5 compared to a year earlier, while net sales for the same period were down 1.6 per cent at $2.5bn. But the company added that it expects to report fourth-quarter adjusted earnings towards the higher end of recently upgraded previous guidance of $1.90 to $2.10.Kohl’s reported a 1.2 per cent increase in comparable sales for the final two months of the year. While sales improved slightly, the department store operator said it faced a tough comparison with strong numbers during the 2017 holiday season.Target shares were down 1.6 per cent in pre-market trade, faring better than L Brands and Kohl’s, which both shed 5.4 per cent.
8;TGT;Target Corp;2018-11-20T12:37:44Z;Target shares drop 12% as retailer’s investments hit margins;Disappointing results come ahead of crucial holiday shopping season;"A ramp up in investments helped keep the tills ringing at Target during the latest quarter but this came at the expense of profit margins, which suffered a surprise drop, spooking investors who sent the shares sharply lower.The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its shares slump by as much as 12 per cent in early morning New York trading, putting it on track for its worst day since February 2017 when it had reported an even worse result than it had previously warned.This time the squeeze on profit margins, along with a miss in headline sales results, raised questions over whether the company could sustain its turnround strategy as it heads into the crucial holiday shopping season.Best known for its cheap-chic offerings and stylish designer collaborations, Target — or Tar-zhay as devotees have nicknamed it — has been slashing prices on household staples and making investments in delivery and fulfilment centres in order to better compete against rivals such as Amazon’s Pantry and Walmart’s Jet.com.The company’s “high-low” strategy of building up higher margin in-house brands while staying competitive on prices for basic everyday goods has helped drive a turnround in sales, but has hurt overall profit margins.The unexpected drop in gross margin, which fell 90 basis points to 28.7 per cent in the three months to October 28 from the year ago period, and contributed to the miss in adjusted earnings, appeared to have unsettled investors most.While net earnings jumped by more than 30 per cent to $622m, that was largely due to a lower corporate tax bill. Stripping this out, adjusted diluted earnings were $1.09 a share — well below estimates of $1.12.Sales rose a solid 5.7 per cent to $17.59bn during the quarter, as shoppers snapped up everything from toys to pressure cookers, but also missed Wall Street’s loftier expectations for $17.72bn worth of turnover.Like-for-like sales rose 5.1 per cent, a hair below the 5.2 per cent that analysts had forecast, and a slowing in the pace of growth from the 6.5 per cent recorded during the second quarter.Hopes had been high for Target ahead of the latest results, based on a strengthening US economy and robust consumer spending data. Stoking those expectations were rosier results last week from Walmart, Macy’s and Home Depot, with each of those retailers raising their earnings outlook for the full year.Target reiterated on Tuesday its full-year adjusted earnings guidance of $5.30 to $5.50 per share, a target which it last raised three months ago.But, in a sign that the retailer will be facing stiff competition in the battle for holiday spending, it said it expected fourth quarter comparable sales growth of around 5 per cent, which would represent another slight slowdown from the pace recorded in the previous two quarters.“We are encouraged the company reiterated full-year guidance; however we believe market expectations in this environment are high and stock is likely to see weakness,” said analysts at Cowen.Shares in Target have fallen 14 per cent since they hit a record high of $90.39 earlier in September."
9;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
10;TGT;Target Corp;2018-08-22T19:00:12Z;Target ‘hits bullseye’ with strong sales growth;E-commerce helps big-box retailer beat expectations and lift outlook;Target shares climbed on Wednesday after the big-box retailer’s latest earnings report sailed past lofty expectations, thanks to a strong boost from digital sales and its best quarterly comparable sales growth in 13 years.For the three months to August 4, revenue roses 6.9 per cent year on year to $17.8bn. Net earnings came in at $799m, up 19.2 per cent, and earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.49 were 23 per cent higher compared with a year ago.Digital sales also continued to rise, as the retailer seeks to keep pace with e-commerce rivals like Amazon. During the quarter, comparable digital channel sales were up 41 per cent year on year to make up 1.5 percentage points of the 6.5 per cent overall like-for-like sales growth during the quarter — which was Target’s best in 13 years, the company said.Quarterly traffic also made strong gains, rising 6.4 per cent, the fastest pace since the metric was first reported in 2008, Target added.Analysts had expected sales of $17.23bn and net income of $749m, or $1.40 a share. Revenues had been tipped to rise 4.1 per cent from a year ago, according to Factset.Target on Wednesday also lifted its full-year outlook. It is now targeting adjusted earnings per share of $5.30 to $5.50, up from its previous forecast for earnings between $5.15 and $5.45.Hopes had been high for Target and other retailers amid a strengthening US economy and robust consumer spending. Stoking those expectations were results last week from rival Walmart, whose shares shot higher after it unveiled its strongest US sales growth for more than a decade.Moody’s lead retail analyst Charlie O’Shea said Target’s earnings had “hit the bulls-eye”.“Reflecting the company’s myriad investments, margins reflect slight, almost de minimis compression, which is the short-term pain for long-term gain, and we note that working capital continues to improve, with accounts payable exceeding inventory, indicating improved leverage with vendors.”He added that the improved outlook for the full year was “consistent with our view that there are macroeconomic tailwinds that can be exploited by the strongest, most financially flexible retailers that are hitting on all cylinders, with Target definitely in that class.”Target shares, which fell nearly 10 per cent in 2017, are up more than 27.6 per cent in the year to date as of Tuesday’s close. They rose more than 5 per cent on Wednesday to hit a record high before falling back to sit 3 per cent higher in afternoon trading.Also reaching a record high on Wednesday was Lowe’s, the US home-improvement chain, which reversed course after an early decline to surge more than 8 per cent.Although Lowe’s trimmed its full-year sales growth forecast, it said revenue rose 7.1 per cent year on year to $20.9bn in the quarter. Marvin Ellison, the recently installed chief executive said Target was committed to improving its performance by “sharpening our focus on retail fundamentals” and limiting projects and initiatives that distract from its core home-improvement business.Along with Walmart and Home Depot, these major US big-box brands have illustrated how retailers with a large bricks-and-mortar presence can thrive even as e-commerce changes how consumers shop — in part, by using physical stores to complement digital platforms.Their performance contrasts with the gloom that has hung over the retail sector in recent years, as investors fret that companies are not nimble enough to keep pace with Amazon. Not all retailers are thriving, though — US department store chain JC Penney plumbed a record low last week after disappointing earnings, while Macy’s generally upbeat results met a cold reception.
11;TGT;Target Corp;2018-05-23T12:12:07Z;Target bid to boost online sales pressures margins;Shares drop after US retailer discloses smaller than expected rise in earnings;Target said on Wednesday its efforts to grow its online operations boosted sales but weighed on margins and pushed it to a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.Shares in the Minneapolis-based retailer were down 6 per cent in early trade after the company reported net income of $718m or $1.33 a share in the three months ended May 5. While that was up from $678m or $1.23 a share in the year ago period, it missed analyst expectations for $1.38 a share.The impact of Target’s investments in its online business were laid bare as the company noted that its gross margin declined to 29.8 per cent, compared with 30 per cent in the year ago quarter, weighed down by costs tied to digital fulfilment.Target has ramped up investments in its delivery services and infrastructure as it competes with Amazon and Walmart. Earlier this month, the company lowered its delivery fees.“We anticipate target shares underperform given the [quarterly] result is likely to increase fears an already competitive retail environment will become more costly,” said Mark Astrachan, analyst at Stifel.The investments did however help grow online sales by 28 per cent and total revenue climbed 3.4 per cent from a year ago to $16.8bn, reflecting comparable sales growth of 3 per cent. That topped analyst estimates for sales of $16.6bn and like-for-like sales of 2.9 per cent. Traffic also increased 3.7 per cent — its strongest quarterly performance in more than a decade.“We’re very pleased that our business continued to generate strong traffic and sales growth in the first quarter, as we made significant progress in support of our long-term strategic initiatives,” said Brian Cornell, chief executive. “Strong sales growth in our home, essentials and food & beverage categories offset the impact of delayed sales in temperature-sensitive categories, which accelerated rapidly in recent weeks as weather improved across the country.”Looking ahead, the company expects comparable sales growth to accelerate in the current quarter, rising in the low-to-mid single digits and adjusted earnings of between $1.30 to $1.50 a share.Target shares are up nearly 16 per cent year-to-date.
12;TGT;Target Corp;2018-03-23T18:50:37Z;Target/Kroger: left on the shelf;Two retailers besieged would not be better off as one;When it comes to fashioning a turnround, Target insists it is “playing our own game”. It should stick to playing alone. On Friday, reports surfaced that the bargain chic discounter was pondering a tie-up with Kroger, the US’s largest supermarket chain. Such a deal would be a blockbuster. Both chains have enterprise values greater than $35bn and both are in the midst of a wrenching transition from dependence on physical stores. But results to date indicate far more promise for Target than Kroger. A merger may offer standard scale benefits but grocery is one of the worst segments of American retail. Target should steer clear.Not that the company has had an easy time itself. After a massive cyber hack, executive churn and the relentless Amazon onslaught, Target’s share price fell 40 per cent between 2015 and 2017. But it has spent the past year investing heavily in remodelling its stores and building a hybrid physical and online model. Same-store sales growth started to snap back — up 3.6 per cent in the latest quarter. Shares are up 30 per cent in the past year. The question remains, however, just how profitable a revitalised Target can be given that its current operating margin is 6 per cent. Five years ago it was above 8 per cent.Even Target’s lower margin would be a dream for Kroger. The company reported a 2017 operating margin of less than 3 per cent amid unwelcome new competition from German discounters Lidl and Aldi.Kroger may have consolidated the traditional supermarket sector but investor sentiment towards it has soured. Its shares are down a fifth in the past year. Shareholders would undoubtedly welcome a bailout from the race to the bottom in grocery from Target. Target should not comply. About a fifth of its sales come from grocery but making a bigger bet means a tricky integration that is simply not worth the risk.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Could a combined Target/Kroger work?
13;TGT;Target Corp;2018-03-23T12:47:16Z;Kroger, Target jump on merger report;;Investors are stocking up on shares of Target and Kroger on Friday after a report said the two US retailers are in talks about a possible merger in a bid to fend off competition from Amazon.Shares in grocery chain Kroger spiked as much as 8 per cent in pre-market trading while those for Target, the big-box retailer best known for its cheap-chic offerings, jumped 2.3 per cent.According to Fast Company, the two companies began talks last summer about a partnership and the talks are ongoing this year.However, the two companies appear to be struggling to decide whether a merger is the best path forward, the trade magazine reported.Kroger declined to comment.A merger between Target and Kroger would create a retail juggernaut with nearly $195bn in combined sales last year and a market value of $58bn. That compares to the $177.9bn in annual sales recorded by Amazon and Walmart’s $118.1bn.Traditional US grocers have been roiled by Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods last year and Kroger has seen its margins squeezed amid an escalating price war.While Target has managed to buck the malaise that has gripped the wider retail sector by focusing on the ever-important “mom” demographic - a group that it has successfully lured with its product mix ranging from kiddie clothing and cheap-chic home decor to laundry detergent and snacks - the grocery division remains its biggest weakness.In this respect, a tie-up between the two could see Target improve its grocery business while Kroger will get access to Target’s customers and e-commerce infrastructure.As of Thursday’s close, Target has a market cap of $37.5bn while Kroger is worth around $20.6bn.
14;TGT;Target Corp;2018-03-06T13:32:56Z;Target boosts sales at expense of profit margins;;"Target kept the tills ringing over the holiday season - albeit at a price.The Minneapolis-based retailer on Tuesday reported a hefty 10 per cent jump in sales to $22.77bn during its fiscal fourth quarter, as shoppers snapped up everything from toys to pressure cookers and pieces from the company’s new home decor collaboration with Fixer Upper star Joanna Gaines.Within this, same-store sales - a key industry metrics - rose 3.6 per cent in the three months to Feburary 3, the most in three years and topping Wall Street estimates for a 3.1 per cent increase.However, shares fell in pre-market trading as investors appeared unnerved by the slight drop in profit margin.As part of its efforts to revive growth and better compete against the likes of Amazon and Walmart, Target has ramped up investments in its delivery services and infrastructures and is competing aggressively on prices.As a result, fourth quarter gross margin came in 26.2 per cent, compared with 26.6 per cent in the year ago period.Net income was up nearly 35 per cent at $1.1bn, as Target reaped in the benefit of US tax reforms. Stripping out the one-off tax gains, adjusted net income per share was $1.37, compared to its guidance of between $1.30 and $1.40 and analysts forecasts of $1.38.“Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of the significant investments we’ve made in our team and our business throughout 2017,” said chief executive Brian Cornell. “Our team’s outstanding execution of Target’s strategic initiatives during the year delivered strong fourth quarter traffic growth in our stores and digital channels, which drove healthy comparable sales in every one of our five core merchandise categories.”Looking ahead, Target is forecasting like-for-like sales to grow in the
low-single digits this year. Full year adjusted earnings per share is seen to be between $5.15 to $5.45, up from the $4.71 recorded in 2017 and compares to market expectations of $5.21 a share.Target — or Tar-zhay as its devotees call it - has managed to buck the much of the malaise that has dogged the wider retail sector with a focus on its own inhouse brands and cheap chic offerings.The company said it will offer more details on its investment plans for 2018 later this morning. This time last year, Target shocked the market by announcing plans to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin for the 2017 fiscal year to better invest in its business.Shares in Target, up by 31 per cent over the past 12 months, fell 2.4 per cent in pre-market trading."
15;TGT;Target Corp;2018-02-05T10:09:07Z;Wesfarmers/UK: home truths;As the group ponders a Brexit of its own, better value lies elsewhere;DIY chain owner, renovate thyself. Wesfarmers is taking A$953m (£544m) in writedowns on Homebase. That is pretty special considering the Australian conglomerate spent only £340m on the UK and Irish DIY retailer. Refreshingly, Wesfarmers has blamed itself — having bungled the integration — rather than Brexit, the go-to scapegoat for local businesses. With Wesfarmers considering a retreat of its own, investors should also seek value elsewhere.Homebase expects to lose £97m in the first half, a quarter more than in the same period last year. The purchase never looked compelling. Bunnings, Wesfarmers’ Aussie DIY store chain, ran at more than eight times the British business’s operating profit margins.Bunnings’ return on capital is the highest in the group. It has benefited from a hot local market for home improvement. A boom in the Aussie housing market has supported demand in recent years. Competitor Masters closed its doors a year ago.The good times may be over. Morgan Stanley analysts point to an 8 per cent decline in the value of the house price index, compared with a year ago. They expect the speed with which new houses are added to slow down. Bunnings Australia accounts for 30 per cent of Wesfarmers’ earnings before interest and taxes, second only to the Coles supermarket unit.Monday’s announcement also zeroed the brand value, goodwill and property of Wesfarmers’ Target unit, an Australian department store chain. As a non-food retailer with mid-range prices it is vulnerable to Amazon, which has recently entered the country. Competition from the group’s own Kmart chain of discount stores, too, has caused problems.Despite a 5 per cent drop in value, shares still trade at 17 times earnings before standard deductions. Investors should consider cheaper competitors with similar growth rates and less exposure to real estate, such as Metcash.
16;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target shows signs of life after Amazon;Fund managers have dumped many traditional stores on fears of online competition;There is an enduring and powerful myth that is repeated unquestioningly by market commentators: everything in the stock market today is staggeringly expensive.As surprising as this may sound to some, this much-peddled notion is not actually true. After a near decade-long bull market there are certain household name US stocks that are trading at similar valuations to where they were during the market nadir of 2009.They are, however, trading there for a reason. Large US retailers have been dumped by fund managers on fears that online competition, most notably from the all-conquering Amazon, will drive many traditional stores out of business. Was this the week when the market finally began to entertain the idea that, contrary to consensus, not all traditional retailers are doomed to extinction?Target shares jumped this week on news that its holiday season trading was stronger than expected, with the company raising its outlook for fourth-quarter and full-year earnings. Yet even after the rally Target shares remain far cheaper than the market, offering a trailing free cash flow yield of more than 12 per cent based on last quarter’s numbers and a forward price to earnings multiple of around 15 times.Yet the analyst expectations on which these forward earnings are based are likely to be too low. The Wall Street consensus remains sceptical of the company’s prospects, which is understandable for a management that has frequently been conservative in managing market expectations. Of the 28 bank analysts who cover the stock only four rank it as a “buy”, while 21 rank it as a “hold”, and three as a “sell”.Target management predicted adjusted earnings per share would be between $4.64 and $4.74 for the year, up from its previous forecast of $4.40 to $4.60 a share. Consensus analyst forecasts after the update still have this coming in at the lower end of that range.Today Target remains a cash generative business generating high teen returns on equity while employing conservative amounts of debt. At these valuations, the market only needs to start tentatively entertaining the idea that stronger retailers will have some place in a post-Amazon world and their shares may move from bargain basement to on-trend.miles.johnson@ft.com
17;TGT;Target Corp;2018-01-09T12:43:46Z;"Target hits the bullseye on holiday trading; raises earnings outlook again";;Target hit the bullseye for investors over the crucial holiday shopping period, triggering a 4 per cent rally in the company’s shares in pre-market trading.The retailer, best known for its cheap chic offerings and stylish celebrity partnerships, raised its fourth quarter and full year earnings guidance on Tuesday after reporting a stronger than expected sales gain for the last two months of the year.Like-for-like sales were up 3.4 per cent as shoppers snapped up everything from toys to pressure cookers and pieces from the company’s new home decor collaboration with Fixer Upper star Joanna Gaines.This, along with the expected bump from US tax reforms, prompted Target to up its earnings outlook once again. It now expects adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter to come in at $1.30 to $1.40 a share, compared to the prior range of $1.05 to $1.25 a share. For the full-year, it is predicting adjusted earnings per share of between $4.64 to $4.74, up from its previous forecast of $4.40 to $4.60 a share.“We are very pleased with our holiday season performance, which reflects the progress we’ve made against our strategy throughout the year,” said Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive of Target.The company said it sees the strong sales momentum continuing in 2018. It is penciling in a low single digit increase in like for like sales and adjusted earnings per share of between $5.15 to $5.45.Target — or Tar-zhay as its devotees call it — announced last March an audacious plan to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin for the 2017 fiscal year in order better compete against Amazon on the e-commerce front and against Walmart and TJMaxx on the price front.Among the initiatives the Minneapolis-based company has taken include: focusing on higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor through its own private brands such as Pillowfort and Threshold, as well as lowering prices permanently on a range of basic household items to drive foot traffic to its stores.In a bid to boost its two-day delivery services it has start turning its stores into mini distribution centers. It also snapped up delivery service start-up Shipt for $550m in cash last month.Target said on Tuesday that it expects online sales to grow by more than 25 per cent in 2017.
18;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Is Target on Amazon’s 2018 wish list?;;With the holiday season out of the way, is Amazon gearing up to do some shopping in 2018? One research firm is predicting that retail chain Target will find its way into the acquisitive e-commerce giant’s cart in the new year.Loup Venture — a tech-focused research and venture capital firm co-founded by a former longtime Piper Jaffray analyst, Gene Munster — has put the idea of an Amazon-Target tie-up on its list of tech predictions for 2018.It may sound like a bold move, but Loup Venture makes the case that there are plenty of synergies to be unwrapped by combining Amazon’s digital retail dominance with Target’s red-and-white themed brick-and-mortar presence.For one, Target has done a good job of tapping into the ever-important “mom” demographic — a group that Target has successfully lured with its product mix ranging from kiddie clothing and cheap-chic home decor to laundry detergent and snacks.Amazon too has taken aim at busy women who control their family purchases, targetting them with discounts and deals through their Prime service and serving up child-friendly video content.“Target’s focus on moms is central to Amazon’s approach to win wallet share”, the firm wrote in a New Year’s Day blog post.The second key factor is Target’s wide-reaching, but manageable, physical store presence, the firm said. Even though Amazon is primarily known for its 24/7 online stores, it has been preparing for a future that blends a primary digital presence with a secondary physical one.To that end, Amazon has recently opened of its first brick-and-mortar book stores, plans to go public with its Amazon Go shops and the purchase of the Whole Foods grocery chain, which added about 470 physical stores to Amazon’s basket, according to Loup.Snapping up Target — with more than 1,800 stores in the US, along with 39 distribution centres — would bring Amazon’s store count to about 2,300, Loup reckons. While substantial, that’s still far less than the more than the nearly 11,600 stores worldwide operated by the US retail heavyweight Walmart.Whether such a combination would encounter antitrust resistance is a tough question. But the firm sees the hypothetical deal as more likely to garner approval than not — its biggest competitor Walmart is expected to rack up $500bn in sales in 2017, a 2.6 per cent year-over-year jump, including about $315bn in US sales.Meanwhile a combined Amazon and Target would reach about $176bn in US revenue, Loup estimated. Among the top-18 US retailers, Walmart would still dominate with 23 per cent share, while an Amazon/Target duo would have just a 13 per cent slice of the pie.And Amazon’s pockets are plenty deep to afford a Target shopping trip, the firm said. It estimated that with a 15 per cent premium, Target’s take-out valuation could run about $51bn — 8 per cent of Amazon’s $564bn market cap.Guessing where Amazon may set its sights next is a favourite parlour game on Wall Street, given that its deals have the potential to move markets dramatically ranging from grocers to delivery companies and appliance makers.“Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy”, the firm said.Target shares are up 3.3 per cent on the first trading day of the new year at $67.43, while Amazon shares have gained 1.1 per cent to $1.183.12, with post-holiday optimism buoying retailers of all stripes higher.Photo credit: Reuters
19;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Target buys Instacart rival for $550m in same-day delivery drive;;Target is heeding to the age-old adage that the best defence is good offense.The Minneapolis-based retailer took a bold step towards strengthening its position in the race against Walmart and Amazon for delivery and e-commerce dominance on Wednesday by snapping up delivery service start-up Shipt for $550m in cash.Like rival Instacart, Alabama-based Shipt runs an “on demand” delivery service that connects users to independent contractors who will drop off an order of groceries at their doorsteps at the push of a button.Target said the acquisition will allow it to ramp up its same-day delivery services — an elusive prize that is widely seen as the key for any company that hopes to take on Amazon in the online retail space.“With Shipt’s network of local shoppers and their current market penetration, we will move from days to hours, dramatically accelerating our ability to bring affordable same-day delivery to guests across the country,” said John Mulligan, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Target.“By the 2018 holiday season, we will be servicing every major market across the country with same-day delivery, and Shipt’s service-oriented approach aligns well with Target’s commitment to delivering an exceptional shopping experience for our guests.”While Target has managed to buck the malaise that has gripped the wider retail sector by focusing on building up its own brand of cheap-chic offerings and investing in making supply-chain logistics more efficient, it still trails Walmart and Amazon when it comes to online sales.Shares in Target, down nearly 15 per cent so far this year, rose as much as 2.2 per cent on news of the deal before paring the gain to just 1.7 per cent.
20;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Target slides on worries over holiday shopping season;US stocks decline with all three main Wall Street indices in the red;Target shares briefly slid more than a tenth, on a day of declines for the benchmark S&P 500 after the US retailer offered conservative guidance for the critical fourth-quarter holiday shopping season.Despite stronger than expected third-quarter profits, investors sold down their stakes in the big box retail chain as it stared down deep-pocketed rivals who are expected to increase discounts to lure shoppers and gain market share. Target shares dropped 9.9 per cent to $54.16 by close of trading on Wednesday.The company, which has focused on its own brand of cheap-chic offerings to help drive a sales turnround in recent quarters, said it expected adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter would range from $1.05 to $1.25 a share. That was largely below the median analyst forecast for $1.24 a share.“The pressure that we are anticipating is around digital fulfilment as well as all the work we continue to do around value,” Cathy Smith, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a call with Wall Street analysts.Like-for-like sales — a key industry metric — are forecast to grow as much as 2 per cent in the fourth quarter, buoyed by the company’s investments in store remodels and its ecommerce business.That could translate to full-year same-store sales growth between 0 and 1 per cent, above its earlier expectations.Overall sales rose 1.4 per cent from a year earlier to $16.7bn in the three months to the end of October 28. Profits slid 21 per cent from a year earlier to $480m, or 87 cents a share. Both sales and earnings exceeded analyst expectations.Target announced in March a plan to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year to better compete against Amazon on the ecommerce front and against Walmart and TJ Maxx on the price front.Among the initiatives that Target is taking include: focusing on higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor through its own private brands such as Pillowfort and Threshold, as well as boosting its two-day delivery services by turning its stores into mini distribution centres.The company is also testing next-day home delivery of everyday household staples — from laundry detergent to paper towels — in an attempt to rival Amazon’s Pantry and Walmart’s Jet.com dominance in this area.It has also lowered prices permanently on a range of goods to drive foot traffic to its stores.Analysts with both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs characterised the fourth-quarter guidance as “conservative”, although the former added that the company’s rising same-store sales were “encouraging”.The slide in Target shares accompanied a broader drop across stock indices. The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 2,564.62 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.6 per cent to 23,271.28. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite followed the trend and was 0.5 per cent lower at 6,706.21.
21;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target shares extend drop to nearly 10% amid margin concerns;;Target failed to hit the bullseye for investors on Wednesday.The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its shares slump nearly 10 per cent in morning trading as its forecast for the upcoming holiday season underwhelmed Wall Street and overshadowed a strong set of results for the third quarter.Best known for its cheap-chic offerings and stylish designer collaborations, Target — or Tar-zhay as its devotees call it — has been slashing prices on household staples and ramping up investments in its delivery and fulfillment centres in order to better compete against rival Amazon’s Pantry and Walmart’s Jet.com.But while the company’s “high-low” strategy of building up higher margin in-house brands, while staying aggressive on prices for basic everyday goods, has helped drive a turnaround in sales, it has come at the expense of margins, as the company warned in March when it unveiled its turnaround plan.Although sales rose 1.4 per cent to $16.7bn, net income fell 21 per cent to $480m during the quarter amid higher costs as a results of these investments. Gross margin rate was 29.7 per cent, compared to 29.8 per cent reported in the prior year period.“The pressure that we are anticipating is around digital fulfillment as well as all the work we continue to do around value, and we’re offsetting that with cost savings continuing into the fourth quarter,” said Cathy Smith, chief financial officer, during a call with analysts.The focus on margins has been heightened by concerns that Target would need to step discounts and promotions to compete against deep-pocketed rivals Amazon and Walmart ahead of the critical holiday shopping season.These jitters were not assuaged by Target’s fourth-quarter earnings forecast. Adjusted earnings are expected come in between $1.05 to $1.25 a share for the fourth quarter, compared to average consensus forecast of $1.24 a share.“The reaction in TGT shares is a little surprising today even if buy-side expectations were a little higher than the print,” said Daniel Binder, analyst at Jefferies. “We think the upbeat earnings call had a balance of a conservative outlook and confidence in the turnaround initiatives, but after a large beat to the low end of Q3 EPS guidance, we think investors were hoping to see more on the FY18 revision.”Still, Target issued a confident outlook for its parts.“While the fourth quarter is always intensely competitive, we are entering this holiday season with lots of confidence,” said chief executive Brian Cornell. “And while it’s still very early we’ve been encouraged with the guest response to launch of Hearth and Hand as well as last week’s release of the Target exclusive version Taylor Swift’s new album, Reputation. While the bulk of the season is still ahead of us, we are very happy to see how these early efforts have set the tone for the season.”Shares in Target are down 9.4 per cent in midday trading taking its year-to-date losses to nearly 25 per cent.
22;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target lifts guidance as private brands drive sales growth;;Target continued to buck the wider malaise in the US retail sector, with the retailer raising its full year sales and earnings outlook after posting third quarter results that topped analysts’ expectations.However, shares slid in pre-market trading on Wednesday amid jitters over how it would fare against the likes of Amazon and Walmart ahead of the all-important shopping season.The company, whose focus on its own-brand of cheap-chic offerings has helped drive a sales turnaround in recent quarters, said it now expects earnings per share from continuing operations for 2017 to come in at between $4.38 to $4.58, up from the $4.35 to $4.55 range it gave just three months ago.Like-for-like sales – a key industry metric – are forecast to grow as much as one per cent, as investments in store remodeling, exclusive in house brands and e-commerce lure more shoppers to its stores and boost sales. It had previously predicted the metric to be flat, plus or minus 1 per cent.The higher guidance comes as Target reported a 0.9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in the three months to end of October, more than twice the 0.4 per cent increase that the market had forecast. Overall sales rose 1.4 per cent to $16.7bn, ahead of analysts’ estimate for $16.6bn. Net income of $480m, or 87 cents per diluted share, also exceed expectations of $468m, or 86 cents a share.“We’re very pleased with Target’s third quarter performance,” said Brian Cornell, chief executive. “The investments we’re making in our business will help Target drive long-term success and ensure we’re well positioned to deliver for guests in the all-important holiday season.”Target announced in March an audacious plan to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year in order better compete against Amazon on the e-commerce front and against Walmart and TJMaxx on the price front.Among the initiatives that Target is taking include: focusing on higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor through its own private brands such as Pillowfort and Threshold, as well as boosting its two-day delivery services by turning its stores into mini distribution centers. The company is also testing next-day home delivery of everyday household staples — from laundry detergent to paper towels — in an attempt to rival Amazon’s Pantry and Walmart’s Jet.com dominance in this area. It has also lowered prices permanently on a range of goods to drive foot traffic to its stores.And despite the steady sales gain and the company’s upbeat comments for the key holiday period, investors remained wary over the impact that this would have on profit margins. The retailer’s forecast for adjusted earnings to come in a between $1.05 to $1.25 a share for the fourth quarter failed to impress. Average consensus forecast was for $1.24 a share.Shares in Target fell 5.3 per cent in pre-market trading.“Q3 results for Target reflect the impact of its short-term investments for long-term benefit, with margins softening slightly as a result of Target’s tactical price investments, as well as the persistent market share battles with Amazon and Walmart in multiple categories, though we believe margin erosion is being mitigated to an extent by private and exclusive brands, which are resonating with shoppers,” said Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analysts at Moody’s.Results from US retailers have been mixed so far this earnings season. Margins, inventory management and comments on the upcoming holiday trading season have drawn closer investor scrutiny this quarter. Traditional underperformers such as Macy’s saw shares gain nearly 11 per cent last Thursday after the market overlooked a 11th straight quarter of like-for-like sales decline to cheer the rise in the company’s gross profit margin. JC Penney – another retailer that has fared poorly – also saw its shares rise after it beat expectations that were lowered only weeks ago.By contrast, TJX Companies, the parent of off price discount chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, and one of the more resilient retailers, was punished by investors after posting a rare miss in comparable sales and revenues.Likewise, Kohl’s received little love from the market after its margins fell short of expectations. The modest gain came despite the department store operator eking out its first like-for-like sales rise in nearly two years.(Photo: AP)
23;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target boosts holiday hiring in bet turnround momentum will continue;;Target said on Wednesday that it planned to hire more than 100,000 workers for the holiday season, a sharp jump from the 70,000 it hired last year and underscores the retailer’s confidence for the busiest shopping period of the year despite wider industry woes.The Minneapolis-based group said it planned to add about 100,000 temporary staff members to help stock shelves, man cash registers and assist customers across its 1,816 stores in the US. An additional 4,500 workers will also be hired to work at its distribution centers in anticipation of more online orders.The move suggests Target is confident that the momentum that it has seen in its sales turnround in the first six months of the year will continue into the second half.Shares in Target rose nearly 3 per cent to $59.58 on the news. The stock has gained 8 per cent over the past six months, joining rival big box chain Walmart in outperforming beleaguered department store operators Macy’s (down 28 per cent) and Sears (down 15 per cent).The holiday shopping season typically kicks off on Black Friday, or the day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January. The period is by far the most important one for the retailers with many generating as much as a third of their sales during this two month stretch.“Target has made significant investments in our business throughout 2017, and our commitment to hire 100,000 team members for the holidays will make shopping at Target even easier and more fun during one of the busiest times of the year,” said Janna Potts, chief stores officer.
24;TGT;Target Corp;2017-09-08T19:19:00Z;Target ups ante on price wars, sends retail stocks lower;;Target has upped the ante in the ongoing retail price war, saying on Friday that it has slashed prices on “thousands of items” in a bid to win market shares and boost foot traffic amid a tough trading environment.But the news, coming on the heels of Amazon’s move to cut prices on a wide range of household staples at Whole Foods last week, is likely to fan concerns in the market that the intensifying discounting would only further erode profit margins at the country’s major retailers.Indeed, the news prompted shares in Target to drop 2 per cent and dragged other retailers lower. Costco, Walmart and Dollar General — all purveyors of basic goods — are down 1.4 per cent, 1.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.Supermarkets have had a rough 2017 so far. Even before Amazon made public its interest in Whole Foods in June, grocers were reeling from falling food prices and the arrival of German discount grocers Lidl and Aldi in the US.The pain in the sector was underscored by Kroger, which reported a 30 basis points drop in gross margin during the second quarter earlier this morning, as it too had to ramp up promotions and discounts to compete for US retail dollars.Target had made no secret of its plans to cut prices on basic household goods. Earlier this March, the Minneapolis-based group unveiled an audacious plan to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year in order better compete against Amazon on e-commerce and against Walmart and TJMaxx on price.It’s betting that by lowering prices on everyday items like cereal and paper towels, it will be able to lure in shoppers and tempt them to buy higher margin products — namely its in-house brands of furniture, home decor and clothing.Its plan appear to be yielding dividends. In its most recent quarter, Target swung back to sales growth and lifted its full year earnings guidance. In contrast to other retailers, the company’s gross margin has also held up well, dipping to 30.5 per cent in the second quarter, from 30.9 per cent a year earlier.
25;TGT;Target Corp;2017-08-18T21:11:19Z;Week in Review, August 19;US retailers, Air Berlin, China Unicom, accountants and Akzo Nobel in the news;A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Mixed results for US chains battling rise of online rivalsA host of US retail companies reported earnings this week, revealing patchy but less dire results than analysts had forecast, as heavy investments by big box retailers appeared to pay off, writes Anna Nicolaou.The US retail sector is experiencing huge upheaval, as online shopping and in particular ecommerce behemoth Amazon have upended traditional business models, and consumer tastes evolve.Those best equipped to withstand the disruption have been companies with deep pockets, such as Walmart, which reported that ecommerce revenues rose 60 per cent in the second quarter. Comparable sales rose 1.8 per cent, the 12th consecutive quarterly rise.Target, whose cheap-chic offerings have garnered a loyal middle-class following, also offered positive news, reporting a 1.3 per cent rise in comparable sales, its first gain in five quarters. The growth follows Target’s announcement in March of a turnround plan to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year in order to compete better against Amazon online.Urban Outfitters, the teen-focused apparel company. reported adjusted earnings per share of 45 cents, topping the consensus for 36 cents and sending shares soaring 16 per cent as a sign of life for stores struggling with declining mall traffic.Other retailers fared worse, however. Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Pittsburgh-based sports chain, sharply lowered its earnings and sales outlook on Tuesday, while Coach also warned its sales in this fiscal year could come in below Wall Street expectations, sending shares tumbling.Ryanair fury as Lufthansa sizes up Air Berlin assetsAir Berlin became the second large European airline to go bankrupt this summer after it was forced to file for insolvency on Tuesday when its biggest shareholder pulled its funding, writes Tanya Powley.Germany’s second-largest carrier was saved from a full collapse after Berlin stepped in with a €150m loan to keep the airline flying through the busy summer months while it negotiated the sale of parts of the business to Lufthansa and one other airline.The move was triggered when Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based airline that owns 29 per cent of Air Berlin, decided not to pump in any more money after providing a series of cash injections over the past six years to keep it afloat.Air Berlin’s insolvency comes just four months after Alitalia, the Italian carrier, entered administration after its employees rejected a restructuring plan and Etihad, which also owns a significant stake in Alitalia, said it would provide no more funding.Air Berlin has been under pressure after racking up losses of about €2bn over the past six years. The situation has worsened as Etihad has faced its own challenges, forcing it to unravel its strategy of buying minority stakes in airlines to drive traffic to its hub in the Gulf. Etihad made losses of $1.9bn in 2016.Air Berlin’s collapse has sparked a fierce battle over the rights to prime German take-off and landing slots, with Ryanair, Europe’s biggest low-cost airline, branding a state bailout of the airline as a “conspiracy” to protect national carrier Lufthansa.China Unicom in line for $11.7bn of private capitalChina Unicom, the country’s second-largest mobile operator, will receive a $11.7bn capital injection from some of China’s biggest ecommerce and internet groups, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, writes Don Weinland in Hong Kong.The investment is the latest step in the government’s efforts to pump private capital into declining state-controlled businesses.Ten groups will buy a total of 35.19 per cent of Unicom’s Shanghai-listed unit. Of this, Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and one other group, JD.com, will hold a combined 12.6 per cent.State-backed companies will also invest. China’s biggest life insurance company China Life, as well as a government-controlled fund that invests in companies undergoing reform, will take large stakes.China Life will buy by far the biggest stake of any single group, at 10 per cent. Unicom’s parent company will maintain a 36.67 per cent holding.Tencent president Martin Lau described the ownership reform scheme as “a very momentous step in the development of the country”.The round of investment had been anticipated for months and was announced on Wednesday.So-called “mixed-ownership reform” — the introduction of private capital into state groups — has been touted by Xi Jinping, leader of China’s communist party, as a means of revitalising state groups.However, industry watchers say private investment in state groups has produced few, if any, results over the past two decades.Top management at state companies is still chosen by government agencies and bears little connection to commercial performance, experts say.KPMG and PwC fined over substandard external auditsUS and UK regulators shone a light on poor practice at accountancy firms this week, slapping both KPMG and PwC with hefty fines for audit failures, writes Hannah Murphy. KPMG was on Tuesday hit with a fine of more than $6.2m by the US Securities and Exchanges Commission over its audit of oil and gas company Miller Energy in 2011. Miller had overvalued certain assets by more than 100 times and last year settled accounting fraud charges with the SEC.A day later, PwC was fined £5.1m by the Financial Reporting Council — the largest ever penalty issued by the UK’s accounting watchdog — for “extensive misconduct” relating to the audit of a smaller consultancy firm RSM Tenon. PwC admitted to five separate instances of misconduct in its 2011 audit of the company, which was later forced to restate its accounts for that year after discovering “significant errors”.RSM Tenon was put into administration in 2013 after building up major debts and sold to rival Baker Tilly. Regulators are keen to improve the quality of external audits. So far this year, the FRC has launched investigations into the audit of UK companies including Rolls-Royce, BT and Mitie — which involve KPMG, PwC and Deloitte respectively.Akzo Nobel ends bitter spat with largest shareholderAkzo Nobel, the Dutch paintmaker behind the Dulux brand, agreed a truce with the activist investor Elliott Advisors following a bitter feud over the company’s rejection of a €27bn takeover offer, writes Michael Pooler.The Amsterdam-based group announced an agreement with its largest shareholder, which holds a 9.5 per cent stake in Akzo and for months has berated its management and brought legal challenges against the company.A dispute blew up earlier this year over the Akzo’s refusal to engage in buyout talks with its US rival PPG Industries. A combination would have created a dominant player in the $130bn global paints and coatings market.Under the peace deal, both parties will suspend all ongoing litigation for at least three months. Elliott has unsuccessfully pursued a legal case to force the removal of Akzo’s chairman, Antony Burgmans, who was seen an obstacle to a deal with PPG and is retiring next year.For its part, Akzo nominated two new board members and said it intended to nominate a third, in consultation with its major shareholders.In exchange Elliott Advisors, which is the UK arm of the New York-based hedge fund, will back the appointment of a new chief executive. Thierry Vanlancker is taking over from Ton Büchner, who resigned last month due to health reasons.The accord also included “alignment” on Akzo’s plan to split itself into two separate entities. As part of its defence against PPG, Akzo pledged to separate its speciality chemicals division, leaving a core business focused on paints and coatings.Elliott, which led a band of dissenting shareholders who publicly criticised the Dutch company’s handling of the PPG episode, said it “look[ed] forward to building upon the recent constructive dialogue”.This week Elliott also revealed it had increased its stake in BHP Billiton, with a 5 per cent cash position in the group’s London-listed shares. Elliott has alleged the miner has underperformed its peers, needs to return more cash to shareholders and exit its US shale operations.
26;TGT;Target Corp;2017-08-16T11:17:43Z;Target lifts full-year guidance as turnaround efforts gather steam;;Target continued to gain the upper hand in the battle for US retail dollars during the second quarter.The company, whose cheap-chic offerings have garnered a loyal following among middle-class shoppers, saw its shares jump more than 5 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday after it reported a return to sales growth and lifted its full year earnings guidance.Like-for-like sales – a closely followed industry metric – rose 1.3 per cent in the three months to end of July as shoppers flocked to its stores. The gain was Target’s first in five quarters and helped lift total group sales 1.6 per cent higher to $16.4bn, ahead of estimates for $16.3bn.As a result of the strong performance, the company said it now expected 2017 adjusted earnings per share to come in between $4.34 to $4.54, compared with prior guidance of $3.80 to $4.20.The rosier outlook makes Target one of the few retailers to lift – rather than cut – guidance. It should also add to optimism over the company’s audacious turnaround plan — announced in March — to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year in order better compete against Amazon on ecommerce and against Walmart and TJMaxx on price.While rival retailers have been shuttering shops and selling off real estate to cope with the unprecedented upheaval in the US retail space, Target is pouring in money to revamp its business.The company has expanded its range of in-house brands in higher margin categories such as furniture, kids decor and clothing, improved its supply chain so that it can turn its stores into mini distribution centres to boost its two-day delivery services, and cut prices permanently on a range of everyday household goods to drive traffic. It has also opened smaller stores to better meet the demand of its urban clients.While hefty discounting and promotional activities have been blowing holes through the margins of rival retailers, Target’s gross margin rate has held up relatively well, dipping to 30.5 per cent in the second quarter, from 30.9 per cent a year earlier.Net income fell 1.2 per cent to $672m during the quarter largely as a result of income lost from discontinued operations. Excluding this, adjusted net income was $1.23 per share, 0.1 per cent higher from the prior year period and confounding market expectations for a drop to $1.19 a share.In a bid to to boost its groceries business, an area where it is lagging, Target announced on Monday that it has hired executives from rival Walmart and from Cheerios maker General Mills.The Minneapolis-based group also said on Monday that it would buy delivery logistics company Grand Junction to help it expand its same-day delivery service to in-store shoppers.Target shares, down by a quarter since the start of the year, was trading 5.2 per cent higher ahead of the bell.
27;TGT;Target Corp;2017-07-13T17:37:17Z;Target counters US retail gloom with upbeat outlook;Sales slide reversed as strategy to compete better on price and ecommerce pays off;Shares in Target, the Minneapolis-based group whose cheap-chic offerings have garnered a loyal following among middle-class shoppers, surged as it became one of the few US retailers to raise — rather than cut — its guidance to investors.Target said that like-for-like sales — a key industry metric — were expected to increase modestly in the second quarter following a strong performance in May and June. The forecast is an upgrade on the low single-digit decline that the retailer was forecasting just two months ago when it issued its first-quarter earnings.Earnings per share are also expected to come in above the high end of its previously stated range of 95c to $1.15. The retailer’s share price rose more than 5 per cent to $53.56 by lunchtime trading in New York on the news.Brian Cornell, Target’s chairman and chief executive, said: “Following better than expected results in the first quarter, we’ve seen additional, broad-based improvement in traffic and category sales trends in the second quarter, despite continued challenges in the competitive environment.”The news also boosted the stocks of other retailers, including beleaguered department store operators Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.The rosier outlook comes on the heels of Target’s better than expected first quarter, and will add to further optimism over the company’s plan — announced in March — to sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year in order better compete against Amazon on ecommerce and against Walmart and TJMaxx on price.While rival retailers have been shuttering shops and selling off real estate to cope with the unprecedented upheaval in the US retail space, Target is pouring money to revamp its business.The company has expanded its range of in-house brands in higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor and clothing, improved its supply chain so that it can turn its stores into mini distribution centres to boost its two-day delivery services, and cut prices permanently on a range of everyday household goods to drive traffic.“Overall, we find the guidance update notable, particularly in light of worsening trends across the majority of retailers,” said analysts at Stifel. “We believe the positive guidance revision indicates early success of the company’s investments into the business, including in price, labour, and digital.”But analysts also cautioned that Target’s “high-low” strategy — building exclusive brands that would appeal to design-savvy consumers while staying aggressive on prices for basic goods that rival chains also sell — has its limits.The biggest hurdles would be in grocery, they warned, where sales have been languishing. Amazon’s $13.7bn deal to buy upscale grocer Whole Foods is expected to bring even more competition to this market. Target will report its second-quarter results on Wednesday, August 16.
28;TGT;Target Corp;2017-06-19T16:34:51Z;Mattress seller Casper valued at $750m in Target-led funding round;;"Casper has raised $170m in a new funding round led by Target, underscoring the rapid pace of change in consumer taste that has garnered the attention of retailers.The group, part of a new wave of mattress companies that focus on the online market rather than traditional retail outlets, raised the funds at a valuation of about $750m, excluding the new capital raised, a spokesperson told the Financial Times.The news, which was first reported by the New York Times, comes just days after Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, disclosed a deal to scoop up digital-focused men’s apparel retailer Bonobos for $310m in cash.Casper’s model differs from traditional rivals since its product is primarily sold through its website, as opposed to mattress stores where consumers test out models from various different brands. It only offers one type of mattress, made of memory foam, that sells for $550 for a twin size, up to $1,150 for a California king.Its mattresses ship in compacted form in a box, and customers are given 100 nights to test-out the product. Casper, founded in 2014, has aggressively advertised both online and offline; for instance, in subways in New York. The product also on Sunday became available to purchase at Target stores, according to the retailer’s website.Casper’s Series C round also included Tresalia, IVP, Norwest, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, NEA, and Irving Capital. Several celebrities invested, including Kevin Spacey, Curtis “50 Cent”Jackson and Carmelo Anthony. The group has raised $240m in total funding.The online market for mattresses is highly competitive, with groups like Leesa and Tuft & Needle also competing for consumer dollars.Target’s investment in Casper highlights the upheaval in the retail industry, which faces intense threats from online-only upstarts, but also e-commerce heavyweight Amazon. In fact, Walmart last September bought Jet.com for about $3bn as it looks to ramp-up its online offering.Department stores, which are in many ways the flag bearers for the older retail model, have faced a particularly challenging year as their sales have come under pressure. The six biggest players have collectively shed $8.61bn in market value this year, according to Bloomberg data."
29;TGT;Target Corp;2017-05-23T17:31:46Z;Target to pay $18.5m in data-breach settlement with states;;Another item has been added to Target’s bill over a massive data breach affecting millions of customers’ account and contact information in 2013.The US retailer will pay $18.5m to settle actions brought by enforcement agencies in 47 states and the District of Columbia, according to an announcement on Tuesday.The settlement resolves a probe into a 2013 data breach in which cyber attackers used stolen credentials from a third-party vendor to hack into Target’s gateway server and access a customer-service database, where they installed malware to cull customer data, including credit-card information and contact details, according to state officials.The breach affected more than 41m customer-payment accounts, the states said, and compromised contact information for more than 60m customers.In addition to the monetary payout, the settlement announced on Tuesday also calls for Target to implement a comprehensive information-security programme and hire an executive to oversee it. The retailers will also have to retain an independent third party to assess its security measures and segment cardholder data from the rest of its network and put in place steps to secure that information, among other measures.Target said in a statement:“We’ve been working closely with State Attorneys General for several years to address claims related to Target’s 2013 data breach. We’re pleased to bring this issue to a resolution for everyone involved. The costs associated with this settlement are already reflected in the data breach liability reserves that Target has previously recognized and disclosed.”Target had previously agreed to pay $10m to settle consumer lawsuits over the breach, as well as more than $39m to US banks and credit unions who said they suffered financial losses from the breach.While $18.5m may seem like chump change to a company with a $30.3bn market cap, it is still a sizable penalty for the relatively new field of data-breach enforcement actions.For comparison, the 2015 hack that compromised information for millions of users of dating-and-extramartial-affair website Ashley Madison resulted in a $17.5m settlement with 13 states’ attorneys general as well as the Federal Trade Commission.
30;TGT;Target Corp;2017-05-17T16:45:12Z;Target shares surge as turnround plan helps beat expectations;Attention to online sales and price cuts boosts retailer in competition with Amazon;It has been only three months, but an ambitious turnround plan by Target to focus on online sales and price cuts to better compete with Walmart and Amazon appears to be bearing fruit.Shares in the Minneapolis-based retailer climbed by the most in six months on Wednesday after the company became one of the few retailers to report first-quarter results that beat market expectations.Like-for-like sales — a closely followed industry metric — fell 1.3 per cent in the three months to the end of April. While this marks the group’s fourth straight quarter of decline, it was far better than the 3.6 per cent slump that the market had been expecting. It also compares favourably to other retailers such as department store operators Macy’s, Kohl’s, Nordstrom and JC Penney, all of which reported a sharper than expected first-quarter sales drop.As a result, the company said there is a “probability” that full-year adjusted earnings per share will come in above the midpoint range of its $3.80 to $4.20 guidance.Still, chief executive Brian Cornell said company executives are not sitting around “doing high fives”, adding that trading remains “choppy” amid a “seismic shift” in the retail industry.“We expect to see continued pressure from competitive closings and liquidations, which represent a long-term opportunity but divert consumer spending in the near term,” he said.The first-quarter performance comes as Target battles to pull in shoppers. In February, the company announced a plan to spend $7bn and at a cost of $1bn in operating profit this year to remodel existing stores, expand its small-store format, enhance its ecommerce strategy and lower its prices to counter pressure from Walmart and Amazon.Among the initiatives that Target is taking include: focusing on higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor through its own private brands such as Pillowfort and Threshold, as well as boosting its two-day delivery services by turning its stores into mini distribution centers.The company is also testing next-day home delivery of everyday household staples — from laundry detergent to paper towels — in an attempt to rival Amazon’s Pantry and Walmart’s Jet.com dominance in this area.The early results from these efforts can be seen in Target’s top and bottom line performance.Revenue slipped 1.1 per cent to $16bn during the quarter, but was still better than the drop to $15.6bn analysts had forecast. Net income rose 7.7 per cent to $681m, with the results flattered by a non-repeating tax charge that it incurred last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, also well ahead of the 91 cents a share the market expected.The company also continued to make gains on the digital front. Online sales rose 22 per cent during the quarter and accounted for 4.3 per cent of total group sales, up from the 3.5 per cent recorded in the prior year period.Shares in Target, which hit a five-year low of $52.72 in April, were up 3 per cent in midday trading.
31;TGT;Target Corp;2017-05-17T11:11:26Z;Target jumps after quarterly results bolster turnround hopes;;It’s been only three months, but an ambitious turnround plan by Target to focus on online sales and cut prices to better compete with Walmart and Amazon appears to be paying off.Shares in the Minneapolis-based retailer rose more than 6 per cent in pre-market trading after the company became one of the few retailers to report first quarter results that beat market expectations.Like-for-like sales – a closely followed industry metric – fell 1.3 per cent in the three months to end of April. While this marks the group’s fourth straight quarter of decline, it was far better than the 3.6 per cent slump the market had been bracing for.“Target’s first quarter financial performance was better than our expectations, reflecting strong execution by our team as they delivered for our guests in a very choppy environment,” said Brian Cornell, chief executive. “After starting the quarter with very soft trends, we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March.”As a result, the company said there is a “probability” that full year earnings per share will come above the midpoint range of its guidance.Revenue slipped 1.1 per cent to $16bn during the quarter, but was still better than the drop to $15.6bn analysts had forecast.Net income rose 7.7 per cent to $681m, with the results flattered by a non-repeating tax charge that it incurred last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21, also well ahead of the 91 cents a share the market was looking for.The stronger than expected first quarter performance comes as Target battles to pull in shoppers amid what it calls a “seismic shift” in the retail industry. In February, the company announced a turnround plan to spend $7bn and at a cost of $1bn in operating profit this year to remodel existing stores, expand its small-store format, enhance its e-commerce strategy and lower its prices to better compete with Walmart and Amazon.During the quarter, a focus on higher margin categories such as furniture and kids decor through its own private brands such as Pillowfort and Threshold helped take some of the sting out of the weak consumer spending environment. It has also sought to differentiate its apparel offerings from rivals with designer collaborations, most recently with Victoria Beckham.The company also continued to make gains on the digital front. Online sales rose 22 per cent during the quarter and accounted for 4.3 per cent of total group sales, up from the 3.5 per cent recorded in the prior year period.Shares in Target, which hit a five-year low of $52.72 in April, were up nearly 7 per cent in pre-market trading.
32;TGT;Target Corp;2017-03-20T00:03:41Z;Uber ride-sharing president Jeff Jones resigns;;Uber has lost another top executive in the wake of a series of scandals at the ride-hailing company.Jeff Jones joined Uber as its president of ride-sharing in September last year. Previously chief marketing officer at Target, Mr Jones was charged with improving Uber’s brand and reputation, encompassing broad responsibility for operations, marketing and customer support.Uber confirmed his unusually abrupt departure this weekend, just half a year after taking up the role. That period has seen a string controversies including allegations of sexual harassment, rows with regulators over testing of self-driving cars and a lawsuit from Google’s autonomous car unit, Waymo, alleging theft of intellectual property.“We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best,” a spokesperson said after the move was first reported by tech news site Recode on Sunday.Mr Jones’ resignation comes amid Uber’s search for a new chief operating officer, who will report directly to Travis Kalanick, the company’s co-founder and chief executive.
33;TGT;Target Corp;2017-02-28T22:57:50Z;Target shares dive as it shifts to cut-price strategy;Weak holiday earnings and lowered forecast highlight pain across US retail sector;Target has warned that its earnings could drop by a quarter this year as an unexpected shift in the US retailer’s pricing strategy sent its shares to their steepest intraday fall in 16 years.The big-box retailer earned a more aspirational image than rivals such as Walmart by mixing in cheap chic offerings that appeal to design-conscious consumers among its low-priced staples.On Tuesday, however, it said it would sacrifice $1bn of profit margin this year to lower prices permanently on certain products, which could knock its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings by as much as 24 per cent to between $3.80-$4.20 per share.This marks a shift away from its recent focus on one-time promotions, which had failed to pull in enough shoppers. The company said it expected a low-single digit decline in comparable sales for the year.The cut to Target’s outlook came as it announced that a disappointing holiday season had led to fourth-quarter earnings at the low end of its already-lowered guidance. Shares in the Minneapolis-based company responded by falling as much as 14.4 per cent. They closed down more than 12 per cent at $58.77.The news of Target’s weak fourth quarter underscored the pain being felt across the US retail sector. Moody’s this week estimated that 14 per cent of its US retail and apparel portfolio is made up of distressed issuers, the largest proportion it has seen since the financial crisis.The grim retail environment has heightened the competitive pressure on Target as companies from Walmart to struggling department stores such as Macy’s and Sears double down on price reductions.The industry is also bracing for further headwinds should the Trump administration impose a border adjustment tax that could increase imports costs for retailers significantly.Moody’s retail analyst Charlie O’Shea said Target had little choice but to revert to more permanent price reductions on certain products if it wanted to win back shoppers, but what was crucial was ensuring customers buy the more expensive goods once in-store or online.“You’ve got to get them into stores and [on to] websites to get them to buy products. And in this environment the reason you’re going to get them in there is price,” Mr O’Shea said.Target’s like-for-like sales — a key industry metric — fell 1.5 per cent in the three months to the end of January, which dragged overall sales for the year down 5.8 per cent to $69.5bn. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $817m, or $1.45 per share, down from $1.43bn, or $2.33 a year earlier.Target pledged to return to its original business model over the next few years of getting customers into its stores with everyday low prices on key items and then persuading them to buy more expensive and profitable items.The company said it would spend $7bn over the next three years on a combination of pricing, improving its digital and in-store experience, and improving its supply chain. It will add 12 new brands into its stores, as part of the move to get customers to spend on more than basic commoditised items.One of Target’s problems is its subpar strategy for grocery, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.“Target remains a place where people come for something else and buy some food, rather than being a place where people come to buy food and end up buying something else,” he said. “The latter is a much more powerful driver of trade, if only because of the frequency with which food shopping is undertaken.”
34;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target tumbles 14% on gloomy 2017 guidance;;US retail stock investors, look away now.Shares in Target tumbled by more than 14 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday after the department store operator issued fourth quarter earnings that came in at the low end of already reduced estimates and warned that full year earnings for 2017 could slump by as much as 24 per cent compared to 2016.The retailer, which issued a profit warning last month following a dismal holiday performance, said it continues to struggle to get customers back into its stores, in the latest sign of the malaise that has engulfed the wider US retail sector.As a result it said it expects like-for-like sales to drop by low-single digits for the 2017 fiscal year and is forecasting annual adjusted earnings to come in at between $3.80 to $4.20, down from the $5.01 it recorded in 2016.The gloomy outlook comes as Target reported fourth quarter earnings that just met the lower end of its revised projections.Like-for-like sales – a key industry metric – fell 1.5 per cent in the three months to end of January, and helped dragged overall sales for the year down 5.8 per cent to $69.5bn. Net earnings for the fourth quarter was $817m, or $1.45 per share.Brian Cornell, Target chairman and chief executive, said:Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly-changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores.Mr Cornell added that he planned to give more details on his plans to revive sales – including the introduction of 12 new brands and a shift towards lower priced products – at an investor event in New York later this morning.He said:We will accelerate our investments in a smart network of physical and digital assets as well as our exclusive and differentiated assortment, including the launch of more than 12 new brands, representing more than $10 billion of our sales, over the next two years. In addition, we will invest in lower gross margins to ensure we are clearly and competitively priced every day. While the transition to this new model will present headwinds to our sales and profit performance in the short term, we are confident that these changes will best-position Target for continued success over the long term.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
36;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Target sounds profit warning after weak holiday trading;;The run of bad news continues for US retailers.Target on Wednesday slashed its full year earnings guidance after sales over the all-important holiday shopping season came in weaker than expected.The retailer, which until today had managed to buck the malaise that has engulfed the wider retail sector thanks to its cheap-chic offerings, said it expects adjusted earnings per share for the year to come in between $5.00 to $5.10, down from its previous forecast of $5.10 to $5.30.Shares in Target fell nearly 5 per cent in pre-market trading.Much of the adjustments appeared to be the result of lacklustre trading in the current quarter. Like-for-like sales fell 1.3 per cent over November and December.As a result the Minneapolis-based company said it now expects same store sales for the fourth quarter to drop between 1 and 1.5 per cent, compared with its prior guidance of -1 per cent and + 1 per cent. Adjusted EPS for the quarter will also be affected, and is projected to come in at $1.45 to $1.55 compared to the $1.55 to $1.75 it had previously forecast.“While we were pleased with Black Friday sales, December digital sales growth of more than 40 percent and continued strength in our Signature Categories, these results were offset by early season sales softness and disappointing traffic and sales trends in our stores,” said Brian Cornell, Target chairman and chief executive.The company is due to release its fourth quarter results on February 28.Target is the latest retailer to disappoint investors with a lackluster holiday trading. Department store operators Kohl’s, Macy’s, Sears, JCPenney, high end jeweler Tiffany and booksller Barnes & Nobles have all reported that same store sales fell over the holidays.The challenging outlook for the retail sector has prompted both Neiman Marcus and Claire’s to pull their IPOs this month.
37;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Tech teams need to shake-up the way they work;IT is no longer about keeping the lights on but about creating moneymaking ideas;The speed with which technology has altered businesses — from retail and holiday bookings to food delivery — has been accompanied by a shift in the how IT teams need to be led at C-suite level.Once the main role of the IT department was to provide support services, with an eye on keeping costs down and critical systems running, says Adam Woodhouse, a director at consultancy KPMG. But he says: “When a leadership team is looking for bright ideas . . . that open up new revenue streams, that’s not good enough.”Tech leaders must understand their organisation’s main goals, says Ian Cohen, an independent consultant and former chief information officer for insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson. “It’s about being very commercial, very business savvy.”Executives at large companies in particular need to focus on their venture’s main aims. Mike McNamara, former chief information officer at UK supermarket group Tesco, gives an example: when he joined US discount retailer Target in June 2015, he found the company had about 800 different IT projects under way. This was a staggering number even for its size: Target has 1,800 stores in the US alone and sold $74bn of goods in 2015, an increase of 1.6 per cent over the previous year attributed to increasing use of digital channels.Mr McNamara and the leadership team identified which projects were important. Better digital channels, a more efficient supply chain and more effective technology for the company’s in-store employees were among the priorities. In two days they whittled down the list to fewer than 100 projects aligned with key objectives.Mr McNamara also cut the reliance on contractors, who made up 70 per cent of the IT team when he joined. This is now 30 per cent, while Target has recruited 700 more staff at centres in Minneapolis and Bangalore.To win in retail today, and in the future, you’ve got to own and build your own technologyThe reason for this shift was to have better control over the company’s corporate systems and to be able to respond swiftly to business demands: “To win in retail today, and in the future, you’ve got to own and build your own technology.”He also streamlined internal processes so reliable applications can be introduced quickly, using a philosophy known as “DevOps” (which more closely unites developments and operations teams). It has been popularised by internet companies such as Amazon and Facebook.This encourages software developers to work more closely with IT operations staff who manage the systems on which the software runs. Historically these groups worked separately, with development teams working on broad sets of software updates before passing them to colleagues in operations to implement, often via a series of handovers that could last for months.Instead, team members work in small groups, testing software and ironing out glitches as a project progresses. This allows changes to be made more quickly than under the old silo method. Analysts at IT research company Gartner say DevOps is becoming mainstream and may now be employed by as many as one in four of Forbes’ Global 2000 organisations.IT teams across the world would benefit from similar shake-ups, KPMG’s Mr Woodhouse says, as it makes them think more about users. “The fundamental thing they need to have in place are customer-focused technologists, rather than systems-focused technologists,” he says.Mr Woodhouse adds that, aside from speeding up the introduction of applications, it puts an end to the “blame game” that can ensue if something goes wrong with software, when operations team members blame the code and developers blame the systems.Mr McNamara is also a fan of DevOps. When he joined Target, the approach was used in a few areas, he says. “Now, it’s across the board. It’s just the way we work.”
38;TGT;Target Corp;2016-11-16T22:10:06Z;Target bucks tough trading conditions with strong results;S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average end the day lower;Investors received an early Thanksgiving Day holiday gift from Target on Wednesday after the retailer bucked tough trading conditions to deliver strong third-quarter results and raised its earnings outlook for the year.Shares in the Minneapolis-based retailer jumped the most in nearly eight years on the news. The stock rose as much as 9.6 per cent to a six-month high of $78.30 as investors responded to the improving sales trend ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season. It closed the day 6.4 per cent higher at $76.03.For the three months to October, sales fell 6.7 per cent to $16.7bn. Much of the decline was the result of lost revenue following the sale of its pharmacy and clinic business to CVS Health.On a like-for-like basis, sales fell only 0.2 per cent, far ahead of market expectations for a 1.1 per cent decline. The results were boosted by unexpectedly robust demand for clothes and school supplies during the back-to-school season in September and growth in online sales.Adjusted net earnings, which strips out the effect of the asset sale, came in at $608m, a 28 per cent rise from the year-ago period and ahead of forecasts for $472.1m.The figures suggest that the unexpected decline in traffic during the second quarter was a blip and that the turnround plan that chief executive Brian Cornell is trying to implement since taking over two years ago remained on course.Indeed, under Mr Cornell, Target has been increasing investments in e-commerce and has made expanding Target’s “cheap-chic” offerings his priorities.The efforts have been paying off. Much of the quarter’s growth was driven by gains in Target’s so-called signature categories — which include baby products, fashion and furniture and have been benefiting from the company’s collaborations with well-known designers such as Missoni and Marimekko.“This seems to indicate that, among other things, the new product launches, in particular Cat & Jack and Pillowfort, are likely resonating with consumers,” said Charles O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s. “All in all, Target seems well positioned for a successful holiday season and fourth quarter.”Elsewhere, the latest set of results from home improvement retailer Lowe’s painted a gloomier picture of the American consumer. Shares in the country’s second-largest DIY chain fell 2.9 per cent to $67.02 after the company reported sharply weaker third-quarter sales growth and lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance. The results are the latest sign that consumers are reducing spending on their homes and will probably add to fears in the market that the US housing market could slow after years of steady growth following the 2009 financial crisis.In the wider market, stocks were mixed. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were trending lower even as bonds resumed their global sell-off, in a sign that risk appetite was cooling after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory last week.At the close of trade the S&P was down 0.2 per cent at 2,176.9 while the Dow fell 0.3 per cent to 18,868.1. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, however, gained 0.4 per cent to 5,294.6.
39;TGT;Target Corp;2016-11-16T12:19:29Z;Target lifts guidance after back-to-school sales boost;;"Target delivered strong third quarter sales numbers for the third quarter, boosted by unexpectedly robust demand for new clothes and school supplies during the back-to-school shopping season in September and growth in online sales.The better-than-expected performance prompted Target to raise its full year earnings guidance and sent shares in the Minneapolis-based company up nearly 8 per cent in pre-market trading.For the three months to the end of October, sales fell 6.7 per cent to $16.7bn. Much of the decline is the result of lost revenue following the sale of its pharmacy and clinic business to CVS Health.On a like-for-like basis, sales fell only 0.2 per cent, far ahead of market expectations for a 1.1 per cent decline. Adjusted net earnings, a measure which strips out the effect of the asset sale, came in at $608m, a 28 per cent rise from the prior year period and ahead of forecasts for $472.1m.“We are very pleased with our third quarter financial results, which reflect meaningful improvement in our traffic and sales trends and much stronger-than-expected profitability,” said Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive. “We also continued to
gain market share in key Signature Categories and saw unexpectedly strong
sales in the Back-to-School and Back-to-College season.”Since taking over the top job in August 2014, Mr Cornell has made investments in e-commerce and a renewed focus on ramping up Target’s “cheap-chic” offering his priorities.The efforts have been paying off. Much of the quarter’s growth was driven by gains in Target’s so-called “signature” categories – which include baby products, fashion and furniture and have been benefitting from the company’s collaborations with well known designers such as Missoni and Marimekko.The company said comparable sales growth in the signature categories outpaced total comparable sales by more than 3 percentage points while online sales grew 26 per cent.In light of the improving sales trend ahead of the all important holiday shopping season, Target said it now expects like for like sales to come in at between -1 per cent to 1 per cent in the fourth quarter, compared to its previous guidance of -2 per cent to flat.For the full year, the company said it expects GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.67 to $4.87, compared with prior guidance of $4.36 to 4.76. The forecast for full year adjusted earnings per share has also been lifted to $5.10 to $5.30, compared with prior guidance of $4.80 to $5.20.Shares in Target, down 1.6 per cent so far this year, jumped 7.8 per cent ahead of the market open."
40;TGT;Target Corp;2016-09-21T18:20:56Z;Target and Microsoft renew share buybacks;Appetite for purchasing shares comes after second quarter lull;Target and Microsoft this week signalled renewed appetite for purchasing their own shares, suggesting that the pace of US share buybacksmay accelerate after a second quarter lull.After Microsoft on Tuesday announced it would recharge its nearly complete $40bn buyback programme with a new one of the same size, Target authorised a new $5bn scheme on Wednesday.This comes after buybacks slowed 3 per cent to $127.5bn in the second quarter of 2016 from a year earlier, as companies took a breather from one of the key accelerants driving the US equity rally.The figure marked a drop of more than 20 per cent from the quarter prior and pulled the overall payout to shareholders through dividends and buybacks marginally below its record pace.Investors said they did not view the recent drop in buyback activity as a harbinger of a wider decline.“I would think it’s a pause as there is nothing in the environment that has changed the dynamic,” said Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer of BMO Wealth.“The incremental stimulus is coming from the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan. The fact the ECB is buying US corporate debt is more important than the Fed.”However, some expect companies may remain on the sidelines ahead of US elections in November.“With the election looming, this is likely a note of caution as companies assess what’s going to change,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “You can see this not just in buybacks, but investment too.”Share buybacks have proved an essential source of support for the S&P 500 since 2013, particularly earlier this year as investors shunned equities — more than $120bn has been drained from mutual funds and ETFs invested in US stocks this year, according to EPFR.Companies have stepped into that void, spending nearly $1.9tn buying back their stock since the start of 2013, including 13 consecutive quarters in which buybacks eclipsed $100bn.That has often come at the expense of increased capital investment as executives seek to buoy earnings and support lofty valuations.Mr Ablin noted that the growth of earnings per share for the S&P 500 was double the growth rate of net income. “That’s strictly attributable to the fewer number of shares outstanding.”Companies have pointed to lacklustre economic activity for those decisions and embarked on a spree of mergers and takeovers in 2014 and 2015 in search of faster growth.Earnings have slid for five consecutive quarters, with Wall Street analysts pencilling in a slight decline in the current third quarter.Apple and General Electric ranked as the most prolific spenders on their shares in the three months to the end of June, buying back $10.9bn and $7.6bn of stock, respectively, FactSet data showed.The number of companies within the benchmark S&P 500 buying back shares in the quarter slid 8 per cent to 350.Multinationals have funded part of their buyback programmes with new debt as they take advantage of historically low borrowing costs. JPMorgan estimated in August that 39 per cent of buybacks were financed by debt this year, up from 22 per cent in 2015.
41;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target climbs on new $5bn share buyback;;The great US share buyback bonanza continues apace on Wednesday.A day after Microsoft greenlighted plans for a new buyback programme of up to $40bn, it was the turn of retail heavyweight Target to announce fresh plans to buy back its own shares.The Minneapolis-based company said it has approved a new $5bn stock repurchase programme – which will begin once the current $10bn programme ends this fiscal year.“Today’s announcements reinforce Target’s longstanding commitment to thoughtfully returning cash to shareholders while continuing to prioritise investing in our business,” said Cathy Smith, chief financial officer.The news sent Target shares 1.6 per cent higher in pre-market trading. Shares in the $39bn group have dropped more than 17 per cent over the past six months following two straight quarters of disappointing sales growth.
42;TGT;Target Corp;2016-08-17T21:16:34Z;Lowe’s sales and earnings disappoint investors;US stocks reverse course after Fed’s July meeting minutes;Lowe’s disappointed investors on Wednesday with sales and earnings that suggested the US’s second-biggest home improvement chain was yielding ground to rival Home Depot.Lowe’s reported sales and earnings that badly undershot the high bar set by Wall Street, prompting a share price tumble of 5.7 per cent to $76.88 on Wednesday, reducing the company’s market capitalisation to $68bn.The stock was the third-worst performer on the S&P 500 and Wednesday’s drop cut its gain over the past 12 months to 6.1 per cent.In contrast, Home Depot shares are up 16.1 per cent over the past year, lifting the company’s market value to about $168.8bn.Both companies have benefited from the rebound in the US housing market since national prices touched a bottom in the middle of 2012 and have been reporting steadily rising sales — in contrast to the wider gloom that has enveloped the US retail sector.But Lowe’s second-quarter results suggest that it might be falling behind its larger rival when it comes to capitalising on homeowners’ continued appetite for spending on residential renovation projects.For the quarter to the end of July, like-for-like sales at the North Carolina-based chain rose 2 per cent — well below the 4.1 per cent analysts were predicting and the 4.7 per cent gain reported by Home Depot earlier this week.Net sales also disappointed, climbing 5.2 per cent to $18.2bn, against expectations for a rise to $18.4bn. Net income came in at $1.16bn, or $1.31 per diluted share.The results failed to match those from Home Depot, which met analysts’ expectations and raised its full-year earnings guidance on Tuesday.Lowe’s is not the only high-flyer whose shares are suffering a reversal of fortunes. Target, another recent outperformer in the retail sector, fell 6.4 per cent to a six-week low of $70.63 after it cut its earnings guidance for the year.Urban Outfitters by contrast surged 15.4 per cent to $36.05 as investors cheered signs that the aggressive markdowns that the Philadelphia-based group has been using to draw in shoppers through its doors could finally be abating. The company behind Anthropologie, Free People and its eponymous brand was the day’s biggest riser on the S&P 500 after it reported a bigger-than-expected rise in second-quarter sales and profit on Tuesday.Away from retail, the wider stock market remains preoccupied with the timing of the next US interest rate rise. Consumer discretionary stocks — which have until recently benefited from investors’ search for yield — led the decline in the broader market after comments from New York Fed president William Dudley prompted investors to reconsider the odds of a rate rise this year.Stocks changed course after the release of the minutes of the Fed’s July meeting. At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 2,182.2 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 18,573.9. The Nasdaq Composite was little-changed at 5,228.7.
43;TGT;Target Corp;2016-08-17T16:17:41Z;Target shares tumbles as sales miss their mark;Retailer cuts earnings guidance ahead of crucial second-half trading period;Target’s first comparable sales decline in two years and falling traffic prompted the retailer to cut full-year earnings guidance in a stark warning to investors over the choppy US retail environment.The weaker earnings outlook sent Target’s shares down 6.5 per cent to $70.53 in late-morning trading in New York. Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive, said he was “planning for a challenging environment” in the crucial second half, which includes the holiday shopping season and back-to-school sales. He said Target had “the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time”.Target expects full-year earnings — adjusted for early retirement of debt — of between $4.80 and $5.20 a share. That compared with earlier guidance of between $5.20 and $5.40. In the second quarter, comparable sales dropped 1.1 per cent and the number of transactions dropped 2.2 per cent.Target’s first quarterly decline since 2014 will sharpen investor focus on Walmart’s earnings on Thursday, where US comparable sales are expected to rise 1 per cent.Shares in Sears fell 6.4 per cent to $16.65, Kohl’s was down 2.2 per cent to $45.07 and Lowe’s, the home improvement store, which also produced weaker earnings on Wednesday, fell 6.7 per cent to $76.03. Walmart was down 0.4 per cent to $72.57.Retailers in the US have had a bumpy ride over the past year or so with many struggling to meet the needs of an increasingly fragmented consumer market. Shoppers are prepared to spend, but they are demanding value for money and are spreading across different platforms from mobile to physical stores.This has led to competitive promotions at a time when Amazon’s sales have soared. Target said it has increased its promotions, but analysts said that some of its offerings may have looked comparably more expensive. It has also been hurt by the sale of its pharmacy arm to CVS, which has disrupted consumer visits.“The company continues to be impacted by challenged consumers across multiple income demographics, as well as a food business that still needs to gain traction to drive additional traffic,” said Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea.“The downward revision to its second-half expectations recognises that the back-to-school/college and holiday selling seasons may not provide meaningful sales ‘lift’, and we also believe both seasons will be highly promotional.”In the second quarter, total sales dropped 7.2 per cent to $16.17bn, including the lost revenue from the pharmacy divestiture, while earnings dropped 11.6 per cent to $1.07 a share. Excluding the sale, EPS rose 0.5 per cent to $1.23.Two particular areas of difficulty for Target this quarter were electronics and food. Apple’s sharp sales decline also hurt Target, which said sales of the technology company’s products fell 20 per cent at its stores during the quarter. Target said it was working with Apple partners to improve traffic and ensure it was carrying the right mix of products.
44;TGT;Target Corp;2016-05-18T20:27:25Z;Tesla jumps after Goldman Sachs backing;US stocks edge ahead in choppy trading session;Tesla shares shifted into top gear on Wednesday after the electric vehicle maker was upgraded by analysts at Goldman Sachs, who cited strong demand for Tesla’s cars and more stable macro backdrop for the upgrade.Shares in the carmaker advanced 3.2 per cent to $211.17 after the stock was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” and analysts maintained their price target of $250 a share.The number of analysts with a “buy” rating on the stock rose to 10 while three have a “hold” rating and six have a ‘sell’ rating, according to Bloomberg data.Elon Musk’s Model 3 mass-market vehicle, which was unveiled earlier this year, has already booked 400,000 reservations.Patrick Archambault, at Goldman, said that an update on the car, which he expects in early 2017, should “have the added benefit of driving incremental awareness and interest in the mass-market product, and has the potential to drive further reservations”.Noting the potential for positive news, Mr Archambault said that Tesla could make an announcement on a shared mobility, or journey-sharing, service at some point.Finally, he expects that a ramp-up in production of its falcon-winged Model X vehicles could also help lift shares later this year.Concerns about the company’s accelerated production plans to meet demand for the mass-market vehicle, delayed projections for positive free cash flow and delivery target misses have weighed on investor optimism, with shares down 11 per cent so far this year.But Mr Archambault said that the company’s shares were not “fully capturing the company’s disruptive potential”.The rally in Tesla shares came as US markets gave up gains after meeting minutes released from Federal Reserve showed an openness to lifting interest rates in June.The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.6 per cent on the day before paring back all gains to 2,047.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed nearly unchanged at 17,526.62, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 4,739.12.Elsewhere, Lowe’s shares advanced more than 3.3 per cent to $78.60 after the DIY chain reported stronger than expected first-quarter profits amid strong demand for home improvement goods.Profits at the retailer rose to $884m, or 98 cents a share, up from $673m or 70 cents a share in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 87 cents a share topped expectations for 85 cents. Meanwhile, sales rose 7.8 per cent to $15.2bn, ahead of forecasts.Target shares fell 7.6 per cent to $67.99 after the company reported a smaller than expected increase in first quarter like-for-like sales during a challenging period for US department stores.The company said that same-store sales, a key industry metric, advanced 1.2 per cent, below expectations for a 1.6 per cent rise.The company said that it expected comparable sales in the current quarter to be in a range of flat or down as much as 2 per cent.The news sent shares in rival Walmart nearly 3 per cent lower to $63.14. Target’s soft sales figures followed dismal results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Kohl’s.Meanwhile, shares in Hormel Foods, fell 8.6 per cent to $35.47 and were among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after margins shrunk in its refrigerated foods division, raising concerns about the maker of Spam and Jenny-O Turkey.Profit margins for the company’s largest division fell to 11.9 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, from 14.4 per cent the previous quarter, said Akshay Jagdale, an analyst at Jefferies.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
45;TGT;Target Corp;2016-03-16T11:03:50Z;Review: ‘Dealstorming’, by Tim Sanders;A team effort rather than individual attempt, multiplies your chance of clinching a deal;"In the early days of video games, serious players realised that to win the increasingly complex games being devised by software makers, they needed to team up. It might take one player years of frustration to battle to the end of a game, but if they shared tricks and cheats and praised each other’s best work in their newsletters and magazines, players could keep game designers on their toes.Sales used to be seen as an arena for individual heroism, a venue for the hard-driving, fist-pumping, commission-driven winner.Not any more. Organisations have become too complex. On the sides of both buyers and sellers, the boundaries between selling, marketing, product design and finance are too porous.Information about pricing and competition is a Google search away. To succeed in sales, more people have to be involved and won over. Like video game players, salespeople are finding that teaming up works.Tim Sanders discovered the importance of team selling while at Audionet, an early web broadcasting service. A hoary technology salesman advised him not to hammer away on his own. If he got stuck, he should look around for help within the company and even from clients. “Don’t just rely on your sales manager for all the solutions,” he was told. “Go wide if you have to . . . gather a team, put your brains together, and make it rain.”The two notions of deal making and brainstorming collided in Sanders’s mind to spark a third: dealstorming.It is an obvious idea, to pull in people from well beyond the usual sales channels to help sell. The challenge is avoiding chaos.Sanders’s book is one answer, a disciplined approach to organising different people and voices to sell. The power in dealstorming still resides with the account executive but the process can be a tremendous force multiplier.The seven steps in dealstorming echo those in any conventional sales process: qualify, by assessing the sale’s value and the difficulty of closing it; organise and assemble people with useful perspectives; prepare by briefing them; convene them in a tightly facilitated meeting with a specific goal; execute on what is agreed; analyse and repeat, and finally report to your team on how the sale went, so you can use what you learnt in future deals.The magic, though, is not in this skeletal structure. It is in the soft tissue, the slight adjustments, the sensitivity to human emotion, the ability to forgive, to be rejected and to seduce.Sanders tells the story of meeting Ed Catmull, the co-founder of Pixar, who tells him that the making of Toy Story, Pixar’s first hit, was one of a “thousand problems solved”.Sales is no different.Dealstorming selling is also about matching new with old — the infinite information sources of the internet with good old humbug. Sanders tells of the founder of a gadget trading start-up who was struggling to meet the chief of Target’s electronics division. When he learnt that the man was a devoted alumnus of the University of Minnesota, he created a 50lb cherrywood carving of the university logo, etched with the school fight song.

46;TGT;Target Corp;2016-02-24T13:23:33Z;Cheap-chic focus powers Target turnaround;;Target’s turnaround continued apace during the fourth quarter as its renewed focus on “cheap-chic” helped the retailer regain its standing among middle-class shoppers.Like-for-like sales rose 1.9 per cent for the three months to end of January, easily trumping expectations for a 1.4 per cent rise.Since taking over as Target’s chief executive in August 2014, Brian Cornell has made investment in e-commerce and designer collaborations his priorities – and the effort has been paying off.Much of the quarter’s growth was once again driven by gains in Target’s so-called “signature” categories – which includes baby products, fashion and furniture. The company said in a statement that like-for-like sales in these categories grew more than three times faster than the company average. Perhaps most encouraging for Target, which has been trying to shed its reputation as being laggard in e-commerce, online sales surged 34 per cent and contributed 1.3 percentage points to comparable sales growth.Nonetheless, total sales for the quarter dipped 0.6 per cent to $21.6bn as the increase in same store sales was more than offset by the impact of the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses in December to CVS Health.Net earnings came in at $1.4bn, compared to a loss of $2.6bn in the prior year period. One blemish in what was an otherwise solid set of results was gross margin which fell to 27.9 per cent from 28.5 a year earlier as Target stepped up discounting and promotions during the holiday shopping season.Mr Cornell said:With traffic growing for five consecutive quarters and our signature categories of Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness leading our growth, Target’s results demonstrate that we are focused on the right strategic priorities.The focus on selling low-priced designer gear has helped shield Target from much of the gloom that has engulfed the wider US retailer sector. Just yesterday Macy’s reported a 4/8 per cent drop in fourth quarter like-for-like sales while Wal-Mart saw a meagre 0.6 per cent rise in same store sales.Shares in Target, down 3.8 per cent over the past year, fell 1.6 per cent in pre-market trading.
47;TGT;Target Corp;2016-01-08T18:23:25Z;Grocers cross over to broader selling in fight for survival;Tie-up with J Sainsbury and Argos to cross-sell goods could be more difficult than imagined;Each time I walk into a Target store, I end up spending at least $150. It does not matter if my shopping list has five items or 15. Somehow, as I wander through the aisles of one of the US’s best-known general merchandise retailers, things just leap into the cart.While buying granola bars and cheddar cheese, I find cheap and cheerful yoga pants beckon. Then the toy aisle suggests a birthday present, and the kitchen section serves as a reminder that the measuring spoons broke last week.This is cross-selling at its most effective. But it only works if all of the offerings are attractively displayed and, crucially, worth buying. Target has long positioned itself as the upscale, better-quality alternative to Walmart and much of its appeal lies in the fact that its goods are stylish and well made, while still much cheaper than department stores.It is not an easy balance to strike and requires a deep understanding of the market at a time when grocery margins are under threat from discounters, and chains like H&M and Primark are siphoning off fashion-conscious clothing shoppers. Target failed miserably when it tried to cross the border into Canada, and its peers in the US and elsewhere have also struggled. Kmart continues to suffer falling sales while, in the UK, Marks and Spencer has been deeply disappointing.To me, and fellow Americans, M&S is best known for stereotypically British goods and prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s underwear. But its main business model involves trying to sell all kinds of clothes to the customers who flock to its successful high-end food markets. This week, chief executive Marc Bolland threw in the towel after six years of trying to turn round the business’s reputation for dowdy, unfashionable apparel and hard-to-navigate general merchandise offerings. Though food sales have grown for 25 straight quarters, clothing sales dropped yet again over Christmas, this time by 5.8 per cent. M&S’s share of the UK clothing market has fallen from 16 per cent in 1997 to 9.9 per cent today.Now another UK high street chain is pinning its hopes on cross-selling. Supermarket J Sainsbury this week revealed it made an offer in November for Home Retail Group, owner of the Argos retail chain. That business, best known as a catalogue store, has invested heavily in online sales and rapid delivery. Sainsbury’s pitched the potential tie-up partly as a defensive move against Amazon’s entry into the grocery delivery business, which is ramping up this year.The supermarket chain is also enthusiastic about putting Argos outlets in its stores. The aim is to sell groceries to Argos customers as they pick up goods they have previously ordered online, while encouraging Sainsbury’s shoppers to throw video games and mobile phones into their trolley along with their cereal and milk.Some analysts and investors are dubious, noting that the two chains have quite different customer bases — Sainsbury’s slants towards the high end, while Argos stores feel quite downscale and price conscious.The other looming problem is the rapid growth of online retailing. It may prove harder to cross-sell on a phone or a computer screen. I am a sucker for extras at Target, but Amazon has so far failed to push my buttons. It deluges me with follow-up emails about things I might also like to buy — but they go straight into the online bin.brooke.masters@ft.com
48;TGT;Target Corp;2015-11-30T18:37:26Z;Traffic defies doubts about Cyber Monday;Analysts expect a record $3bn to be spent on the peak US online shopping day;Heavy Cyber Monday traffic overwhelmed Target’s website at times on Monday even as analysts voiced growing doubts over the significance of the biggest US online shopping day of the year.US online sales are expected to rise 12 per cent to a record $3bn this year, Adobe Digital Index said. But retailers are seeing faster ecommerce growth earlier in the holiday season as they offer deeper discounts for a longer period of time both in stores and online.Online shopping grew 18 per cent to $1.6bn on Thanksgiving Day and 15 per cent to $2.7bn on Black Friday, Adobe estimated, with total ecommerce sales up 17 per cent to $8.03bn between Thanksgiving and Sunday.That is still less than 10 per cent of the $83bn Adobe expects Americans to spend over the entire holiday season, and the growth has been driven in part by discounts that could weigh on retailers’ profits.Target announced 15 per cent discounts across its site for the first time, with deep reductions on apparel and toys as it sought to be “a not-to-be-missed destination for deal-seekers on Cyber Monday and throughout Cyber Week”, according to Jason Goldberger, president of Target.com and Mobile.Apple iPads, gaming consoles and televisions were its top sellers over the Black Friday weekend, it added.The Monday after Thanksgiving has also historically been Amazon’s busiest day of the year, with customers around the world ordering 43m items last year at a rate of 500 items per second. Yet the National Retail Federation estimated that the number of consumer planning to shop online this Cyber Monday would fall 5 per cent from the previous year to an estimated 121m.Focus has shifted instead to the growth of mobile shopping, with retailers like Amazon introducing more than 150 “Lightning Deals” that will only be available on its mobile app from Thanksgiving day through to December 9.The NRF’s survey suggested that 24.4 per cent or 29.6m consumers planned to shop on their mobile devices on Monday, compared with 19.3 per cent last year. Adobe said mobile traffic overtook visits from desktop computers on Thanksgiving Day.But analysts are quick to point out that retailers continue to struggle with monetising mobile growth. Mobile accounted for 70 per cent of ecommerce growth in the third quarter but only 16 per cent of total dollars spent, according to Goldman Sachs.The growth predictions also left investors unimpressed. By early afternoon, shares in Kohl’s and Macy’s were each down 2.3 per cent, Gap was down 2.2 per cent and Nordstrom shares slid 1.9 per cent to $56.63. Urban Outfitters was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 retail index, falling 4.65 per cent to $22.55.mamta.badkar@ft.com@mamtabadkar
49;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Mobile sales spike on mixed Black Friday;US stores see healthy traffic as online discounts resemble 2014;Consumers turned to their smartphones and tablets to drive a sharp increase in online sales, as early indications signalled a mixed start to the Black Friday weekend of bargain hunting in the US.While many consumers queued for hours on Thanksgiving to ensure they got the Xbox or high definition television they wanted, others stayed home clicking on deals. Anecdotal evidence from analysts and retailers suggested traffic to stores was healthy, but the first estimates of in-store spending do not come out until Sunday.Online sales jumped by a quarter to $1.73bn on Thanksgiving Day, according to Adobe Digital Index, which tracked 180m visits to shopping sites through the day. Sales from mobile devices accounted for 37 per cent of all online sales, up from 29 per cent last year, though mobile accounted for 57 per cent of all retail site visits.Black Friday online sales climbed 14 per cent to $2.74bn, Adobe said, with a third of sales coming from mobile devices. Products were discounted by 24 per cent on average, it added.Brick-and-mortar sales over Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday were projected to reach $12.1bn, which would be a decline from last year, according to ShopperTrak, suggesting a drop in sales at physical stores as retailers stretched the shopping season over a longer period.Underscoring the increasing importance of integrating online and physical stores, Cory Brewer said he had been persuaded to queue for an Apple Watch at one of Target’s Chicago stores on Thanksgiving evening because it came with a $100 store gift voucher.“I can buy other presents, for my girlfriend, or food,” he said. “I do most of my shopping online now, it’s easier, cheaper and there’s more of a selection.”Large retailers such as Walmart and Target have been investing in improving the integration of their in-store and online services, as shoppers increasingly use mobile devices to research products, redeem coupons, share recommendations and buy. This holiday season will be an important test of how these blending strategies are faring.Target said its online sales reached a new record on Thanksgiving Day, with the number of orders placed on its website or app for in-store pickup up 35 per cent from last year. It said it was seeing in-store traffic “on par with or slightly above” recent years.Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, said during the day that Black Friday had been its “ most integrated” between bricks-and-mortar and its website and app so far. It said “tens of millions of customers” had visited its stores and website.“They prepped beforehand — more than 25m customers accessed store maps and [promotions] through our online and mobile tools for Black Friday,” said Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer of Walmart US.Online retailing has transformed holiday shopping but still only accounts for between 7 per cent and 16 per cent of US retailers’ sales, analysts estimate, so strong digital growth is coming from a relatively low base.The season that once started on Black Friday now spans all of November and December, as retailers have expanded their promotions and discounts to make the season longer.Online access and the fact that many retailers’ Black Friday promotions now start on Thanksgiving Day means that the frenzy of Black Friday morning has mellowed, reducing the number of irate and exhausted customers fighting over items.It also means that the long weekend has become a less reliable indicator for the rest of the holiday season. Charlie O’Shea, an analyst at Moody’s, argued that this year felt like the longest season he had experienced, starting with the much-hyped release of toys tied to the latest Star Wars film in September.25%Year-on-year increase in US online sales on Thanksgiving Day (Source: Adobe Digital Index)Dave Brandon, chief executive of Toys R Us, said Star Wars products were faring well at his stores, but it depended on the toy. Noting the “unprecedented” amount of Star Wars products, he said it would be interesting to evaluate whether or not there has been overkill when the hype dies down.Mr Brandon said that Hasbro’s PieFace — a YouTube video of which went viral earlier this year — was proving extremely popular, and Adobe said the game was running low on inventory online. Other popular items included Monopoly, Lego Dimensions and Barbie.While Mr Brandon was happy with the early traffic at Toys R Us, he hesitated to jump to conclusions so early in the weekend. Many estimates for toy sales were projecting “mid-to-high” single-digit growth for the broader holiday season, he noted, but “thus far I’ve not seen that extent of growth”.“I do think the customer is being careful, although consumer confidence is relatively high and fuel prices are low.”I do think the customer is being careful, although consumer confidence is relatively high and fuel prices are lowAlthough consumer spending has been fuelling broader economic growth in the US, certain areas such as apparel have been weak recently, which some attribute to unseasonably warm weather.Those Americans feeling flush have been spending more on cars, eating out and travelling. However, lower income households appear to have been held back by rising rents and scant wage increases.This appeared to be playing out at stores in Chicago. Wendell Springs, who queued for five hours on Thanksgiving afternoon to secure an Xbox for his son’s birthday and a 55-inch colour television at a price he could afford was not feeling particularly optimistic.“I’ve been broke all my life, so [a better economy] makes no difference,” he said. “I go to work, go home, pay my bills, that’s it.”Across town, however, Clarissa Smith and her family planned to spend an additional $700 on gifts this Christmas, and had just spent $1,000 at Target.“This is just the beginning,” she said smiling. “Things are better financially, I got a better job.”
50;TGT;Target Corp;2015-10-14T20:21:35Z;Sales woe and Walmart warning hurt retailers;Snapshot of consumer spending casts doubt on the sector;Shares of US retailers were punished as the latest snapshot of consumer spending cast doubt on the sector ahead of the holiday shopping season.The S&P 500 Retailing index, whose more than 40 members range from Amazon to Bed Bath & Beyond, was the second-worst performer on Wednesday after an important measure of sales fell in September. The index was down 1.2 per cent.Official US government figures showed that a gauge of retail sales, excluding food and energy, had unexpectedly fallen last month, even with the tailwind of lower petrol prices, a steady job market and house prices that are still rising.The report “suggests that US consumers are beginning to tighten their purse strings”, said Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities. “This will be a particular concern for the Federal Reserve as this segment of the economy remains the key source of support for the economic recovery.”Anxiety swirling around the retail sector deepened after Walmart, the largest US retailer, forecast sluggish sales growth and warned that profits would be depressed by hefty investments in its online business.Walmart shares shed 10 per cent at $60.03 while losses deepened for its rivals. Target slid 3.5 per cent to $76.19 and Best Buy, the consumer electronics chain, fell 6 per cent to $34.83.The S&P 500 Food & Staples Retailing index was the worst performing on the benchmark, sliding 3.7 per cent.Away from the discomfort for the retail sector, it was a weaker day for the US stock market. The S&P 500, whose rally has trimmed its loss for the year to 3 per cent, was 0.5 per cent weaker by markets close at 1,994.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, home to 30 of the best-known US companies, was 0.9 per cent lower at 16,924.75. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite performed slightly better, escaping with a drop of 0.3 per cent to 4,782.85.While red was the dominant colour on the S&P 500, with 340 stocks lower in by close, there was better news for some companies. Shares of TripAdvisor, a travel site that gathers reviews on hotels and allows consumers to book hotels, surged 25.5 per cent to $83.72 after it struck a deal to incorporate Priceline’s hotel offerings into its website.The news cheered investors of TripAdvisor, which had dropped 11 per cent this week, but proved painful for a rival travel portal. Expedia shares tumbled 4.9 per cent to $121.85, making it one of the 10 biggest losers on the S&P 500.Sticking with the business of travel, shares of Delta Air Lines climbed 1.8 per cent to $48.59 after the carrier said third-quarter profit had almost quadrupled to $1.31bn. Delta is benefiting from the weaker oil price, like other airlines, but also from its decision to buy an oil refinery a couple of years ago.Yesterday’s rise was not enough to leave Delta’s shares in the black for the year. They are down 1.2 per cent after surging 79 per cent last year and 131 per cent in 2013.richard.blackden@ft.comTwitter: @richardblackden
51;TGT;Target Corp;2015-09-10T11:09:09Z;FTC urges start-ups to invest in cyber security;Edith Ramirez calls for spending on product defences to match gadget ingenuity;The technology start-ups feted as in the vanguard of US innovation have been told by a leading regulator that they must integrate cyber security defences into their products from day one rather than leaving the issue until they are successful.Securing personal data is one of the most important challenges faced by the US, the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission said as she kicked off a tour to show smaller businesses how to bolster their defences against hackers.Edith Ramirez called for a “culture of security” at start-ups, where developers think about security when they first conceive a product, rather than tacking it on when it has already become successful.Even after high profile attacks at US companies including Target, Sony Pictures and Anthem, the consumer protection agency warned many companies fall short when trying to protect consumers.“A number of companies still don’t understand the importance of making the appropriate investment when it comes to security,” she told the Financial Times.“The economic incentives may not necessarily always be there to make the requisite investment. Sometimes the devices themselves might be difficult to embed appropriate security in. So we want to see the ingenuity that we see behind all these terrific new devices and services also thinking about how to embed security.”The FTC has made cyber security a priority, pursuing more than 50 companies for “deceptive and unfair acts” that violate consumer privacy. A court ruling late last month allowed the FTC to press ahead with a lawsuit that alleges hotel company Wyndham Worldwide did not do enough to safeguard its customers’ personal data, which some in industry have worried will lead to more punitive actions by the agency.On the sidelines of its first ‘Start with Security’ event, held in San Francisco, Ms Ramirez said the case simply validated the FTC’s already “vigorous enforcement work”, which the regulator intends to continue to pursue.But she called on Congress to do more to address data security.Devastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to mount a concerted fight-back against the hackers“I personally feel that ultimately Congress needs to take action on data security. It is one of the most important challenges we face as a nation. The data breaches we hear about on a regular basis demonstrate its an area that requires more attention,” she said.Some companies have resented being pursued by the FTC for inadequate security when they feel attacks such as the recent high profile breaches at the US Office of Personnel Management, where records of more than 21m federal employees were stolen, show the government is also struggling to protect personal data.Ms Ramirez rejects the idea that companies should not be pursued because government has also been vulnerable. “If you want to be in business and you want to stay in business you absolutely need consumers to trust your products and services. At the FTC our jurisdiction is commercial security so that is what our focus is on,” she said.There are few clear standards on how companies should build their cyber defences, as it is hard to create concrete requirements when hackers frequently change tactics and find new vulnerabilities. Instead of creating a recipe for companies to follow, the FTC is trying to encourage companies to share best practices at a series of forums across the country, starting with the technology industry in San Francisco and heading to Austin in November.It is also working with other regulators such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Association to tackle flaws in the security of connected cars, after a number of high profile ‘proof of concept’ hacks.The FTC founded the Office of Technology, Research and Investigations centre earlier this year to expand its expertise and has recruited cyber security experts at hacker conferences such as Black Hat and Def Con to help improve its skills base.
52;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Target to pay $67m over Visa data breach;Retailer settles with issuers after 2013 hack of about 40m customers’ credit card details;Target has reached a $67m agreement with Visa over a massive breach of customers’ payment data during the 2013 holiday shopping season that tarnished its reputation and raised serious questions about the company’s data security systems.The company said the required number of card issuers had entered into the agreements. It declined to say how much the issuers would be reimbursed. However, a person familiar with the settlement said the amount that Target had agreed to fund Visa and its issuers was up to $67m. The breach has been estimated to have cost banks more than $200m.“Offers are being extended to the remaining group of eligible Visa issuers using a settlement formula that would enable them to achieve the same economics as the Visa issuers that have already settled with Target and Visa,” the company said.The 2013 hack resulted in the theft of about 40m customers’ credit card details and about 70m customers’ names and contact details. The breach shook consumer confidence in Target, hitting sales in the months following the disclosure of the stolen data.Identity and credit card data theft is becoming an increasing headache for retailers, with the number of US breaches in 2014 climbing to a record high of 783, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, a 27.5 per cent increase from the previous year. The ITRC said that since it started collecting data in 2005, there had been more than 5,000 incidents of data theft of more than 675m records.Home Depot is another US retailer that has been hit by customer data theft, while Sony last year became embroiled in an embarrassing leak of executive emails after being hacked.Lloyd’s, the UK insurer, has estimated that the total cost of cyber attacks to businesses has reached as much as $400bn a year.The Target settlement was not greeted warmly by all involved.Carrie Hunt at the The National Association of Federal Credit Unions said Congress “should enact national data security standards for retailers and hold them directly accountable for their data breaches”.She added that while the settlement was a start credit unions deserve to be fully compensated for their losses.Charles Zimmerman of Zimmerman Reed, class counsel for five banks over the data breach, urged his clients not to accept the settlement, accusing the companies of negotiating the deal “under a veil of secrecy”.The banks being represented are Umpqua Bank, Mutual Bank, Village Bank, CSE Federal Credit Union, and First Federal Savings of Lorain.Since the breach, Target has been investing in improving its data security systems. The measures it has taken include strengthening its monitoring and logging capabilities, installing whitelisting (or anti-spam) point-of-sale systems and a comprehensive firewall governance process.It has also limited vendor access to the server involved in the breach and enhanced security of accounts, it has said.Target said that it had already accounted for the costs of the settlement in its previous results.Visa said it “has worked to help Target reach a resolution for the expenses incurred by financial institutions as result of the 2013 compromise. Nevertheless, the fact remains that data breaches are an unfortunate situation for all parties involved – especially consumers”.“This agreement attempts to put this event behind us, and increase the industry’s focus on protecting against future compromises with new technologies.”Target’s shares closed 0.9 per cent higher at $79.69.
53;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Target rallies on deal to sell pharmacy chain;United Technologies plans to sell or spin-off Sikorsky;"Target shares advanced on Monday after pharmacy chain, CVS Health agreed to buy the retailer’s chemist and clinics business for $1.9bn.The deal gives CVS Health more than 1,600 of Target’s pharmacies, which will run in its stores under the CVS brand. The pharmacy chain will also be included in all-new Target stores that offer pharmacy services.CVS Health said the deal would help expand its retail presence and lower healthcare costs for consumers.Analysts at Stifel said they liked the news as its supports “a few core themes” that have emerged over the year.David Schick, an analyst at Stifel, said: “First, retailers need to focus on maximising what they really do better than others, rather than believing they can simply expand into dominant roles in adjunct categories or geographies; second, retailers don’t need more footage; and third, return on invested capital matters.’’Mr Schick said the deal has the potential to work along these themes. “Of course, execution and consumer seamlessness will matter — but on paper this makes a lot of sense,” he said.CVS Health and Target plan to develop five to 10 small, flexible format stores over a two-year period after the deal is closed. The stores will be called TargetExpress and include a CVS/pharmacy.Shares of Target, which gained 41 per cent over the past year, rose 1 per cent to $80.48. CVS Health shares rose 0.4 per cent to $102.58.Shares of United Technologies fell 3 per cent after the Hartford, Connecticut-based company said it would exit its helicopter business subject to board approval. United Technologies said it would either spin off or sell its Sikorsky Aircraft business after a decision has been made by the end of the third quarter.“Separation of Sikorsky from the portfolio will allow both United Technologies and Sikorsky to better focus on their core businesses,” Gregory Hayes, chief executive, said.Including Sikorsky, the company expects 2015 earnings per share of $6.55 to $6.85 a share, lower than its previous forecast for $6.85 to $7.05 a share. The reduction reflects 10 to 20 cents of one-time separation costs.Shares of Lumber Liquidators declined as much as 3 per cent after the company terminated the employment of its chief merchandising officer, William Schlegel.Lumber Liquidators said it would integrate its merchandising and marketing departments, which would be headed by Marco Q Pescara, who has been the chief marketing officer since 2006. The news comes a month after Robert Lynch, the company’s then chief executive, unexpectedly resigned and two months after the company announced that chief financial officer Daniel Terrell would step down in June.The Virginia-based company has come under pressure since a 60 Minutes segment earlier this year alleged that its laminate flooring had excessive levels of formaldehyde — a chemical compound that has been linked to cancer. By the close of trading in New York, shares in the company had pared back losses at $21.48.Shares of Standard Pacific advanced 6 per cent to $8.83, while shares of Ryland Group gained more than 5 per cent to $45.02 after the homebuilders announced that their respective boards had approved a merger to create a single company with a market valuation of $5.2bn.A breakdown in Greek debt talks hurt sentiment on Monday and pushed US stocks lower.The S&P 500 declined 0.5 per cent to 2,084.43, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.6 per cent to 17,791.17. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4 per cent to 5,029.97.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar"
54;TGT;Target Corp;2015-06-02T17:26:47Z;Toys R Us turns to IPO veteran for CEO role;Retailer hands reins to former Domino’s Pizza chief David Brandon;Toys R Us, the American toy retailer taken private a decade ago, has handed the reins to a man who has steered two companies through flotations.David Brandon, former chief executive of Domino’s Pizza and Valassis Communications, was named the next chief executive of Toys R Us on Tuesday and will succeed company veteran Antonio Urcelay at the start of July.The appointment lays the groundwork for the privately held company to return to the stock market after withdrawing plans to do so in 2013.Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Vornado Realty Trust took Toys R Us private in 2005 in a $6.6bn deal. The company filed plans with US securities regulators for an initial public offering in 2010.Mr Brandon had a “very successful relationship” with Bain, which had owned Domino’s at the time the 63-year-old executive took the company public in 2004, according to a person familiar with the matter.The chief executive-in-waiting left Domino’s in 2010 to become the director of intercollegiate athletics for his alma mater, the University of Michigan.Toys R Us has been at work steadying its operations after losing $1.3bn in the two years ended January. The big box toy retailer has faced stiff competition from Walmart and Target, as well as the rise of ecommerce giant Amazon. Sales fell 1.5 per cent to $12.4bn in the company’s last fiscal year.Mr Urcelay, who will retire from the company, was charged with improving operations at the Wayne, New Jersey-based retailer when he was appointed chief executive in 2013.The retailer’s board of directors said Toys R Us had “made significant progress in transforming the business in recent years”.The hiring on Tuesday was viewed favourably by markets, with five-year credit default swaps, a measure of the concern that Toys R Us would default over that time horizon, sliding nearly 4 per cent.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
55;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;Fear of reputational damage after security leaks may be overhyped;It seems that customers have short memories when it comes to recalling online data breaches;"For the second time in just over a year, beauty products retailer Sally Beauty Holdings is investigating reports of fraud involving payment cards used by customers in its US stores.In a statement issued on May 4, the company said it was working with police and others to “gather facts, while working to ensure our customers are protected . . . Customer confidence and security remain our priority”.The company may find those customers are more forgiving than it expects. While reputational damage is often presented by technology suppliers as the consequence of security breaches, evidence suggests the public has a short memory, though senior executives will continue to pay the price for a bad leak.Last year’s hacking of Apple’s iCloud service, for example, in which intimate photos of celebrities were stolen and published online, has done little to dent its financial performance. However, while the Sony Pictures breach did not lead to a boycott by movie-goers, the company’s co-chair, Amy Pascal, stepped down after the scandal. Despite this, in its Q3 2014 financial statements, the company said it “doesn’t expect to suffer any long-term consequences” as a result of the attack.A survey of 4,235 US adults conducted by Software Advice, part of research company Gartner, found almost 80 per cent were not aware of the eBay breach, revealed in May 2014, which forced the online auction site to advise its 145m users to update their passwords.“Negative reputational impacts are totally exaggerated, in my opinion,” says Gartner analyst Avivah Litan. “I think customers forget about a breach very quickly and it doesn’t impact their interest in buying goods or services from the breached company.”She puts this down in part to “breach fatigue” caused by panicky headlines.Marc van Zadelhoff, vice-president of strategy in IBM’s security division, agrees: “The more frequently data breaches occur, the more desensitised people become, resulting in less of an impact to the brand’s reputation.”Etienne Greeff, chief executive of SecureData, a specialist security consultancy, says: “Reputational damage ranks low on the scale. It’s just not a big deal . . . It’s the regulatory fines and cost of remediation that influence corporate strategy.”Technological advances, rising global tensions and human failings are making it ever more vital to improve cyber security.Continue readingEven these costs may not amount to much, according to Benjamin Dean, a fellow at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs. He analysed financial results from Sony, Home Depot and Target following well-publicised security breaches and concluded that the associated expenses reported by the companies amounted to less than 1 per cent of annual revenues.“After reimbursement from insurance and minus tax deductions, the losses are even less,” he wrote.Here, we take a look at the five of the largest-known data breaches to date and how they have affected companies.Heartland Payment Systems
Payment processing company Heartland announced it had fallen victim in 2008 to a security breach involving credit and debit card data. At the time, security experts said up to 100m cards, issued by more than 650 financial services companies, may have been compromised in what was described as the biggest criminal breach of card data. A US computer hacker, Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the crime. The breach cost the company $147.6m, but it claimed back $31.2m in insurance payouts.Four months after it disclosed the hack, Heartland was returned to Visa’s list of validated providers.Sony PlayStation Network
In April 2011, names, addresses, passwords and credit card data relating to 77m user accounts on Sony’s video game online network were compromised. The network shut down for several weeks and the company was later fined £250,000 by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office for what it called “a serious breach of the Data Protection Act”. In the US, the company spent $15m on settling lawsuits arising from the incident.Target
The hacking of IT systems at the US retailer resulted in the theft of the details of 40m payment cards and 70m other records, including customer email addresses and telephone numbers.Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive, resigned in the aftermath. In its most recent financial statement, the company said costs relating to the breach totalled $252m, but added these were offset by an insurance payout that took the total down to $162m. And, according to Columbia University’s Mr Dean, once tax deductions are taken into account, the net losses tally $105m.Home Depot
The hacking of US retailer Home Depot resulted in the theft of more than 50m customer credit card numbers and emails. In the third quarter of 2014, the company said the breach had cost it $43m in pre-tax expenses, “partially offset by a $15m receivable for costs the company believes are reimbursable and probable of recovery under its insurance coverage, for pre-tax net expenses of $28m”. Mr Dean said that this “represents less than 0.01 per cent of Home Depot’s sales for 2014”.Anthem
The breach at this US health insurance company may have netted crooks medical data relating to 78.8m people.The incident continues to be analysed by the company and the government, but lawyers are already preparing class-action lawsuits.“I think Anthem did a relatively good job of disclosing its breach in terms of timeliness and owning up to it,” says Gartner’s Ms Litan. “They still got canned by the media, but if would have been much worse had they waited longer to disclose, as other breached companies do.”"
56;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:15:06+0000;US health group Anthem hit by hackers;Targeted database held details of about 80m people;Anthem, the second-biggest US health insurance company, late on Wednesday revealed that it was the victim of what is thought to be the biggest cyberattack to hit the sector, with as many as 80m of its customers potentially exposed.The company said that the records of an unknown number of its present and former customers had been taken, including their social security numbers and salary details.The company database that was the target of what Anthem called a “very sophisticated external cyberattack” held details of about 80m people in all, around half of them current customers.In a message to the insurer’s members, Joseph Swedish, chief executive, said that the company had “no evidence” at this stage that credit card or medical information was stolen along with other records, although the breach is still under investigation.The large size of the database that was targeted in the attack stands to make the Anthem breach one of the largest to hit a US financial institution, potentially ranking alongside the 76m customer records that were taken when JPMorgan was hacked last year.However, the extent of the personal information in the Anthem case is much greater, encompassing not only extensive employment and social security records but a range of personal information including medical IDs and email and street addresses.The breach was discovered by the company itself, making it one of the relatively rare cases where a large-scale hack was identified by internal means rather than being reported by third parties, according to an official at Mandiant, a cyber security company called in after the problem was discovered.The first signs of extensive data breaches usually come when information from the stolen records starts to appear on other sites, as happened with credit card details taken from retailers like Target and Home Depot.Anthem said it had contacted the FBI about the attack and “immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability”. However, in a sign that it had yet to get to the bottom of the full extent of the problems, Mr Swedish said the company was “working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data”.
57;TGT;Target Corp;2015-01-16T17:24:55Z;US retailers stumble in Canada;Clutch of premium brands build up their cross-border presence as household names retreat;Less than two years after Target opened its first stores in Canada, the US retailer has found that its efforts north of the border missed the mark.The company’s expansion campaign was plagued with problems from the start. Canadian consumers hoping for a taste of the affordable fashion and discount chain closer to home were met with empty shelves, lacklustre merchandise and higher than expected prices. The venture resulted in nearly $2bn in operating losses for Target, and now an embarrassing retreat.“We were losing money every day,” chief executive Brian Cornell admitted.There have been several success stories over the past few decades by US mass-market contenders moving north of the border, such as Home Depot, Costco, L Brands and Walmart. But Target is not alone in hitting problems in Canada, a country of 35m people with a $400bn retail trade.In October, Sears announced it would sell a majority of its stake in its struggling Canadian unit to raise as much as $380m to offset its losses, while other household names such as Best Buy have cut back their cross-border presence in recent years after failing to gain traction.Nordstrom, the premium US department chain that opened its first store in Calgary in September, delayed its plans to open 20 of its Rack outlets in Canada “given everything on our plate in both the US and Canada and the complexity of it”.And yet they keep coming — with the latest American entrants hailing from the upper end of the retail spectrum.Canada’s appeal appears to be its relatively robust economy and steadily affluent consumer base. Now, a clutch of premium US retailers are racing to build up in the country.Fashion brands Michael Kors and Calvin Klein have both said they want to expand in Canada, while Canadian retailer Hudson’s Bay acquired Saks Fifth Avenue for $2.9bn last July with the aim of launching the upscale US department chain on home turf. It plans to open seven full-line stores and 25 Saks Off Fifth stores, beginning in the autumn.Lucky Brand, the denim retailer, has opened 11 locations in Canada, recording 18 per cent same-store sales growth in 2014 — outperforming all its other markets.Industry observers say that the Canadian retail market — at just a tenth of the size of that of the US — is still under-penetrated. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, a well-regulated banking sector and resilient job market have triggered a swifter economic recovery than in the US — and a wealth of underserved shoppers with potentially deeper pockets.“Canadian consumers are feeling better about discretionary spending than many counterparts elsewhere and, as a result, the accessible luxury price-point is a real sweet spot for US retailers,” says Jeff Schiamberg, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets.“In terms of department stores there is Sears at the lowest-end, and the mid-market placed Hudson’s Bay, but currently no major operators carving out a niche at the highest end of the sector,” he says.With just 150 malls across the country and little development in the pipeline, real estate has become a critical part of the puzzle.“We’ve wanted to be in Canada for years — but the challenge was finding the right locations for our stores,” Karen McKibbin, president of Nordstrom Canada, told the FT last year.“There is a highly educated fashion customer being served by a robust retail community. Still, we feel there is an opportunity in Canada to provide customers with more options for where to shop and we think we can do a lot of business.”But Nordstrom — and its peers — will be keen to avoid the pitfalls encountered by Target and other US retailers. For the time being, they are remaining upbeat, if cautious.“We are very happy with our business in Calgary but recognise we have a lot to learn as we open more stores in Canada,” says Nordstrom spokesperson John Bailey upon news that Target was abandoning the country.Carlos Alberini, chief executive of Lucky Brand, says the company’s biggest hurdle has been gaining brand recognition without a large store presence — a point Target hoped would work in its favour with its aggressive launch.“Canada is a big market and achieving high brand awareness without a large store presence, significant marketing spend and many years in the market is very challenging,” he says.Historically, Canadian consumers have been keen to embrace American brands, with thousands regularly crossing the border to their southern neighbour on shopping trips. However, as Target found out, they were more than willing to place pricing and product mixes over convenience.“These new entrants have to be savvy and remember there are important cultural differences to be considered — especially in Quebec or areas where there will be less awareness of particular US labels,” says RBC’s Mr Schiamberg.The major homegrown competition — upmarket chains Holt Renfrew and Harry Rosen — are preparing for their rivals. Harry Rosen announced a $100m expansion and store upgrade when it found out Nordstrom and Saks were coming to Canada. Three major stores are set to open in 2015.“It’s a marketplace with enormous spending power and potential, but is unforgiving to those unwilling to adopt to its nuances,” Mr Schiamberg says.
58;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target: frozen out;Empire builders often fail to understand facts on the ground;Last year, Target said that rolling out more than 100 stores in Canada in just two years was too ambitious. It turns out that the appropriate number of Canadian locations was zero. On Thursday, it abruptly said it would wind down its entire Canadian operation — 133 remaining stores and 18,000 workers.US empire builders, commercial and otherwise, have long struggled to accept that foreign countries are hard to conquer. Like other invaders expecting to be greeted as saviours by the locals, Target failed to appreciate the facts on the ground. Canada is not, as it turns out, a colder, friendlier version of its southern neighbour. Labour and property are more expensive. Managing the supply chain is trickier because pockets of population density are dispersed. And brand recognition can be a curse. Canadians were well aware of Target’s reputation for affordable quality, so when the chain did not deliver the shopping experience customers expected, that poor first impression was hard to reverse.The Canadian catastrophe comes after a tough stretch for the chain. Its reputation was damaged by a customer credit card breach in late 2013. But the company changed its CEO last August, and since November its shares have rallied nearly 30 per cent, including a 2 per cent pop on Thursday.In its upcoming fourth-quarter results, Target Canada will show a loss of $5.4bn stemming from the shutdown, though the cash costs will be just $500m to $600m. Fortunately for shareholders, new chief Brian Cornell has shown no attachment to the previous management’s vision. The rally in Target shares reflects not just the end of the Canadian losses but also company comments that fourth quarter sales in the US will be better than expected.But Canada appeared to be a natural extension of a business that had reached $70bn in US sales. If Target cannot find growth just over the border, it is fair to ask where it can.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
59;TGT;Target Corp;2015-01-15T17:58:41Z;Best Buy blighted by gloomy sales outlook;Electronics retailer sinks on S&P 500 after forecasting flat sales growth;Best Buy was punished by investors on Thursday despite reporting strong holiday sales figures, as the electronics retailer warned on its sales outlook for the first half of its new fiscal year.The Richfield, Minnesota-based company said it expected same-store sales growth in the first half would be in the flat to negative low-single digits and that non-Gaap operating income would decline by 30-50 basis points.The company warned of external pressures, including deflationary pricing, weak industry demand for certain consumer electronics, declining demand for extended warranties and exchange rate volatility. These could hurt its results and are driving structural changes in the industry.Best Buy reported a 2.6 per cent rise in domestic same-store sales during the nine-week holiday period ended January 3 compared to a year ago, driven by sales in televisions and mobile phones. But the company warned that sales were “partially driven by the excitement around high-profile products and would not likely continue at holiday levels”.Online sales grew 13.4 per cent in the same period, slower than the 23.5 per cent growth reported in the year-ago period when gaming helped boost sales.“At this point, we don’t think Best Buy is seeing anything to spark a lot of caution in its posture,” Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS said. He added that the company’s decision to warn on sales “just reflects the realities of the consumer electronics business that include intense competition and rapid price deflation”.Best Buy was the worst the performing stock on the US benchmark as its shares fell 14 per cent to $34.30. The retailer’s shares are down more than 9 per cent in the last year.Samsung Electronics and BlackBerry both denied reports that the South Korean electronics group was in talks over an acquisition of the Canadian smartphone maker. BlackBerry shares, which had surged 30 per cent on Wednesday, on a report that Samsung had made an approach to buy the company for as much as $7.5bn, declined 20 per cent to $10.10.The Swiss National Bank’s surprise decision to scrap its three-year-old ceiling of SFr1.20 per euro, pushed gold prices up 2.5 per cent to $1,259.80 an ounce, as the precious metal regained its safe haven status. The rise in gold prices also buoyed gold stocks. Shares of Kinross Gold advanced 9 per cent to $3.50, shares of Newmont Mining gained 9 per cent to $21.51 and Barrick Gold shares gained 9 per cent to $11.37.Target shares gained 2 per cent to $75.67, after the retailer said it was pulling out of Canada and filed an “application for protection” under Canadian law, in a move that leaves 17,600 workers at risk of losing their jobs.Shares of food retailing company Supervalu gained nearly 4 per cent to $9.44 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “neutral” from “sell” and raised their price target to $9 from $8.The S&P 500 slipped 1 per cent to 1,992.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 17,320.71. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent to 4,570.82.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
60;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target axes struggling Canadian business;;Target abandoned its struggling Canadian business on Thursday after failing to turn around its operations, putting more than 17,000 jobs at risk and wiping out the company’s full-year profit with a $5.4bn writedown.The US retailer, celebrated for bringing fashionable offerings to middle and low income consumers, failed to connect with Canadian tastes and executives feared that the four-year-old venture would fail to reach profitability for another six years.Target, which operates 133 stores in Canada and employs 17,600 people, filed an “application for protection” under Canadian law as it liquidates the business.The company could record loss of more than $2.2bn for the year ending January 31, according to the latest Wall Street estimates, after taking a writedown of about $5.4bn in the fourth quarter.Cash costs to discontinue the Canadian business could reach as high as $600m and are likely to take place in the company’s upcoming fiscal year.Brain Cornell, who took the reins of America’s second-largest discount retailer last year, said that the company could not find a “realistic scenario” in which its Canadian operations would be profitable until at least 2021.“Of all the options that we evaluated, there is no question that a complete exit from Canada was the most difficult,” Mr Cornell said. “After extensive internal due diligence and research, paired with counsel from outside experts, we fulfilled our obligation to do what was right for our company and our shareholders.”The US retailer’s expansion into Canada, which began in 2011 with the first stores opening in 2013, was closely scrutinised and followed by American competitors who viewed the country as an untapped market.Nordstrom, the luxury department store chain, has opened the first of six stores, with plans to bring its low-cost Rack division in the coming years.Empire builders often fail to understand facts on the groundContinue readingTarget said it would set aside roughly $59m, pending court approval, for an employee trust that would provide nearly all of the unit’s staff members with 16 weeks’ pay.Jason Kenney, minister of employment and social development in Canada, said the government would “work as quickly as possible” to provide assistance to those retrenched.The Canadian arm, which was called a “mess” by some analysts, drew criticism from the start as Target opened stores rapidly but stocked shelves with merchandise that was met with antipathy from local customers.Target also drew ire for its prices in Canada, which were higher than those found in the US.Mr Cornell, who joined from PepsiCo, insisted that the exit was the “right decision for the company.” A cyber hack in late 2013 that exposed the details of millions of customers followed by lacklustre performance in the US sharpened the pressure on Mr Cornell.Wells Fargo said the move was “an indication of Cornell’s leadership style, that there are no ‘sacred cows’.” David Schick, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, noted Target could now return more capital to shareholders and invest in its digital operations.“This allows Target to refocus on the US and, over time, buy incrementally more stock back while reinvesting in the business transformation,” Mr Schick said.Shares in Target climbed 3 per cent to $77.50, nearing an all-time high reached earlier this month, after the company also said sales in the US eclipsed its expectations over the holiday period and that its adjusted fourth-quarter earnings would be about 6 cents higher than projected.eric.platt@ft.com@ericgplatt
61;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
62;TGT;Target Corp;2014-11-28T00:15:44Z;US retailers prepare for Black Friday bumper sales;Stores open earlier to capture changing shopping patterns;US retailers are readying for bumper Black Friday sales by opening stores earlier than usual and carving into the time families traditionally spend eating Thanksgiving dinner, amid shifts in spending patterns by US consumers.US consumer sentiment is at its highest level in more than seven years, boosted by lower petrol prices and improving job prospects. Retailers are hoping to gain from the estimated 140m shoppers expected in malls and online over the holiday weekend by extending store hours for those in search of the best deals.The National Retail Federation, the largest US industry retail group, estimates that November and December sales this year will increase 4.1 per cent to $617bn – making it the best holiday season since 2011.Kmart was the first big box retailer to open its physical stores on Thanksgiving morning, with the shoppers welcomed at 6am. Best Buy and JC Penney opened at 5pm, followed by Target, Walmart and Macy’s at 6pm. A host of other retailers were due to open between 10pm and midnight, and remain open continuously until the end of Friday evening.At the Manhattan branch of JC Penney in Herald Square, throngs of shoppers milled impatiently outside the doors just before 5pm, clad in thick winter coats and clutching paper coupons.But when the doors opened, the crowds appeared to stay still and heaved at its entrances, despite pleas to enter the store.“They are all desperate for these 100 for $100 vouchers we’ve advertised – but no one is actually going inside and looking at the stock – we shouldn’t be handing them out in the door ways, it’s crazy “ said one exasperated manager standing on an empty aisle.Store supervisor Shelley Bailey said a second wave of shoppers were expected at around 8pm.“We’ve opened 2 hours earlier than we did last year and knew people would come running for the best deals. We’ve been preparing for weeks,” she said.“But we also know people want to enjoy their dinners and get into the city. We’re open for 36 hours, there will be plenty here for those taking their time.”Two blocks up at one of the largest stores in the world, traditional Black Friday scenes of frenzied stampedes brewed outside Macy’s in the minutes before 6pm.Security and metal barriers kept the jovial hordes in place until the doors opened, at which point the crowd broke into scenes of contained chaos.“You have to know what you want and do your research before hitting a place like this. And if you do, it can be fun,” said Shirley Olsen of Mastic, Long Island, adding she was braving the crowds in search of outerwear, jewellery and linen.“The discounts are really good this year, and deal hunting is always a part of the weekend for our family even if we’ve never done it on Thanksgiving before. This is far less crazy than what I’ve seen on Black Friday in years past.”Calvin Silva, a retail analyst at Nasdaq, said: “The notion that Black Friday is a single day event of doorbuster discounts has fallen by the wayside – this is a multi-hour marathon.” He believes that deep discounting by online-only rivals such as Amazon has added further pressure to bricks-and-mortar retailers.“There’s been a paradigm-shift taking place in retail, as businesses realise they need to leverage multiple channels in order to maximise sales from customers, who increasingly browse online before entering a store,” he added.“The deals have been starting earlier and earlier – and businesses are benefiting by customising their inventory according to how people spend.”A report by accountancy firm BDO this week estimated that more than one-third of all retailers will have already offered the majority of their holiday promotions by the time consumers sit down to their Thanksgiving turkey lunch.As retailers adjust to new and fluctuating sales volumes through the week because of the prolonged holiday shopping period, some are taking a different approach to the scenes of spending frenzy traditionally associated with the weekend.Chains from Costco to Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue have all chosen to keep their stores closed for Thanksgiving Day, while offering online discounts and website promotions.Some analysts suggested this could be a risky strategy. Accenture estimates that 45 per cent of consumers were still planning to shop on Thursday, and analysts cautioned that keeping doors closed could be short-sighted.“You have to be a player – there are still millions of consumers who see getting their hands on a ‘doorbuster’ deal as much a part of Thanksgiving as turkey on the table,” said Bob Drbul, an analyst for Nomura. The coming weekend would represent about 10 per cent of total spending over the holiday period, he added.“Many retailers have been finding their footing with online strategies and spreading their deals over a wider timeframe. But you have to get your share of the Black Friday pie if you really want to stay competitive in this game.”
63;TGT;Target Corp;2014-11-27T15:47:39Z;Black Friday buoys hopes for retailers;Sector has not enjoyed gains of last year’s level;US consumer confidence has been rising all year and sharply lower oil prices have sparked optimism among investors in retail stocks that wallets will open a lot more as the holiday season begins.Wall Street overwhelmingly expects a 2 per cent year-over-year gain in Black Friday sales but at least a third of those surveyed expect 4 per cent growth, according to Convergex.Analysts at Jefferies are more optimistic over holiday sales growth on the back of job and wage growth, credit expansion in areas beyond car and student loans, lower petrol prices, and another strong year for the stock market and the housing market.E-commerce will be crucial and retailers that have invested in online operations are expected to benefit from stronger online shopping.Stores like Walmart and Target are set to gain market share because they have capitalised on online consumer trends.Earlier this year, Target released a new application called Cartwheel that offers a one-day 50 per cent discount on one toy.Matthew McClintock, an analyst at Barclays, said this was “unique” to Target and “shows how technology is infiltrating Black Friday strategies”.Similar to last year, retailers are expected to rely on two main levers, price and time. But with promotions only likely to go so deep, analysts expect the discounts to run longer.While retailers have planned for deep promotions, it is only the unplanned discounts that weigh on profits, Mr McClintock said. Product delivery delays caused by West Port strikes could result in unplanned discounts.Shares in retailers have not had as great a run as they did last year.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is up about 6 per cent so far this year, far shy of their nearly 41 per cent gain in 2013.Apparel retailers are likely to have the hardest time because they suffer from “a sea of sameness”, said John Kernan, an analyst with Cowen & Co.This is largely because consumers that have been awash with discounts since the recession are now looking for value and are more likely to fork over cash on interesting products.“Everything in traditional apparel is stale and commoditised and the only place where the consumer is not waiting for a discount is where something is new and unique, like athletic apparel and electronics,” said Mr McClintock.Athletic apparel makers are expected to benefit from this shift even at full price. Nike and Under Armour, Apple with its iWatch and FitBit are likely to capture a lot of market share.“We believe the growing dichotomy between the performance of apparel and non-apparel brands is being furthered by the fact that the internet allows for the formation of a somewhat limitless competitor base,” said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura.He expects companies such as Kate Spade, Signet Jewelers and L Brands will fare better than apparel makers.The benchmark S&P 500 posted its 47th record high for the year on Wednesday. US markets remained closed on Thursday in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday.Email: mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
64;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;US retailers move Black Friday sales push online;;"The race is on. Retailers have kicked off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever this year, moving the battle for Middle America’s dollars online in the run up to Black Friday, the biggest US shopping event of the year.Traditionally, queues have formed in parking lots and checkout aisles before midnight on Thanksgiving Day, with bargain-hungry customers squabbling outside stores for first dibs on promotional deals. That frenzy used to mark the start of the holiday shopping season.Now that has changed. As more people than ever shop online, and amid bitter competition from rivals, many leading retailers are starting their offers earlier and online in an effort to lure customers. Some are selling discounted items at a loss.“It used to be called Black Friday, then it became Thursday, now it’s a week long,” noted Duncan Mac Naughton, US chief merchant at Walmart. “Maybe we should just call it November.”Black Friday is a newer and smaller phenomenon in the UK, but the pace has also quickened for retailers there.Asda, the UK arm of Walmart, said there would be three times as many special offers than last year, but did not put a figure on its financial commitment to the event this Friday. “It will be the biggest Black Friday in the UK ever. It will certainly be the biggest we have ever done,” said Andrew Moore, head of Asda’s general merchandise business.In the US, Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, Target and Home Depot all unveiled their first digital-only holiday deals in the first week of November. BDO, the accountancy firm, reckons more than a third of retailers will already have offered most of their holiday promotions by the time consumers sit down to Thanksgiving dinner.It will be the biggest Black Friday in the UK ever. It will certainly be the biggest we have ever done“By 2020, the official start to the holiday season may be in October,” says Ted Vaughan, US partner in BDO’s retail and consumer practice.“Consumers expect holiday promotions to come early and end late, and it’s becoming increasingly challenging for retailers to provide attractive deals while preserving margins.”Digital contenders are also changing the stakes. Amazon, the most-visited online retailer in the US on Black Friday last year, started rolling out “lightning” sales every 10 minutes.As retail sales in the UK continue to show growth, the FT keeps up with all the latest news and reports

Further readingMeanwhile, mobile devices are set to play a big role this season. A study by Criteo, a market research group, predicted 27 per cent of purchases would come from smartphones.The National Retail Federation, the largest US industry retail group, estimates that November and December sales will increase 4.1 per cent to $617bn – the highest level in three years.According to Mintel, the research company, this year’s Black Friday could generate up to £200m of UK sales – double 2013’s figure.But some say Black Friday may not be good for British retailers as it typically pulls sales forward from Christmas. “Retailers are either taking market share away from each other, or moving purchases around in terms of time,” says Bryan Roberts, a director of Kantar Retail."

Sales climbed nearly 3 per cent to $17.7bn.Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 45 cents a share on sales of $17.6bn.Same-store sales gained 1.2 per cent ahead of estimates for a 0.5 per cent gain.Target, which was subject to a data breach last year, has incurred total net breach-related expenses of $158m since the fourth quarter of 2013.Target’s expansion into Canada showed some signs of improvement.Sales climbed nearly 44 per cent to $479m but the Canadian segment reported a loss of $211m before interest and taxes. This was, however, better than a loss of $238m in the year-ago period.The retailer expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings in the range of $1.13-$1.23 a share, with the lower end of the range below analyst estimates for $1.23 a share.It now expects full-year earnings of $3.15-$3.25 a share, narrower than its previous forecast for $3.10-$3.30.Target shares gained 7 per cent to $72.50, pushing its year-to-date gain to nearly 12 per cent. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 retailing industry group index gained 1.2 per cent.Staples was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 after the retailer topped third-quarter sales expectations.The office supplies chain reported net income of $216.8m or 34 cents a share in the quarter ended November 1 compared with $135.2m or 21 cents a share in the year-ago period.

66;TGT;Target Corp;2014-11-12T00:12:50Z;Opinion: Hackers cost retailers dear;Your company has probably been hacked;Companies may not know it, but it is highly likely they have already been hacked. Hardly a day goes by without a security breach being reported by a retailer. As of early November, the Identity Theft Resource Center in the US had confirmed of 644 breaches for the year to date, a 25.3 per cent increase over the same time period last year (514 breaches).Yet most organisations still fail to recognise the reality of their situation, best described in a speech by Robert Mueller, who retired as director of the US’s Federal Bureau of Investigation in September. As Mr Mueller said: “There are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those that will be.”The stark reality is organisations need to wake up and recognise that, no matter how much time, effort and resources they put into defending their infrastructure, the bad guys will always find a way in. Attacks may occur through holes in core software that have not been patched by vendors because they are not yet aware of the defects, or by malicious insiders who make use of and abuse their privileged status. Failure by employees to follow corporate best security practices may also have led to a breach.Businesses need to recognise there is no such thing as perfect security and stop looking for an ideal solution. They should, instead, focus on adopting a risk management approach to protect their business assets. For example, retailers have video surveillance cameras, loss prevention officers, and theft insurance to deter crooks and mitigate against criminal losses. In other words, they already accept the fact that criminals will steal from them, and so they put systems in place to help limit the damage. An organisation’s attitude to cyber security should be no different.With cyber crime, however, the scale of the losses can be staggeringly different. A case in point is Sony, which in May 2011 publicly reported that cyber attacks cost it $171m. The company also recently offered to pay an additional $15m to settle a class-action lawsuit.Other high-profile examples of data breaches from the retail world, include Target Stores, a US retailer that reported up to 70m customers had been affected following a cyber hack last December, and Home Depot, which is reported to have had the accounts of 56m credit card holders compromised in an attack discovered in September.However, what is perhaps most frightening, from an international perspective, is that state actors are increasingly recognising the value that can be taken from cyber space. For instance, for countries that have significant manufacturing and industrial economies, but have made little headway in terms of innovation, stealing the design documents for a patented process can save hundreds of million of research and development dollars.This helps keep thousands of citizens employed and means products for export can be produced at a fraction of the usual price. These costs are borne by victim companies and countries. A prime example of this is the theft of a paint manufacturing process from DuPont, the US chemical company, by an insider working in collusion with companies controlled by the Government of the People’s Republic of China.It is not only nation states or big brands that are targeted. Small companies can also become victims. Although many SMEs may feel they are unlikely targets because of their small customer base, relatively low revenue or the niche services they provide, they are just as likely to be the stalked by cyber criminals. It is very hard to predict an attack and there is no telling where the next one will come from, what will trigger it or who the victim will be.To mitigate the risks of such an event, companies must acknowledge it is more than likely their security will be breached, then allocate funding based on the potential damage that is likely to caused by an attack.They also need to make their organisations as unappealing a target as possible, reducing the criminals’ return on their investment by raising the costs of an attack with strong encryption, distributed data sources, and by compartmentalising customer data. This approach is the same as in the physical world, where alarms, locks, cameras and guards persuade criminals to look for easier targets.Crucially, they should ensure there are measures and systems in place to detect a breach swiftly.Responses to a breach should be rehearsed in advance. Have your public statements for customers, employees, regulators and the press prepared, appropriate website messages ready, and alternative payment methods in place to reduce losses.Finally, make sure you test your emergency procedures. A speedy recognition of – and a quick response to – a breach will help to lessen the damage.The writer is senior vice-president and fellow at IT security company Neustar, and in 2013 he received the FBI Director’s Award for outstanding cyber investigation for his part in uncovering and dismantling the “butterfly” botnet
67;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Home Depot attack bigger than Target’s;;Home Depot said on Thursday that up to 56m payment card details may have been affected when it was hit by hackers, making the cyber attack much larger than the data breach on Target during the holiday shopping season last year.The US DIY retailer said the attack, now the largest breach of a retailer on record, lasted for five months before it was alerted to the problem on September 2, but that its systems were now safe from the hackers.Home Depot said it was working “around the clock” with security companies, banks and the US secret service to discover the source of the breach that it confirmed this month. It does not know at this stage how much data was actually stolen.Frank Blake, chairman and chief executive of Home Depot, said he apologised for the “inconvenience and anxiety” the attack had caused to customers. They will not be liable for fraudulent charges on the cards, he added.Shares in Home Depot drifted slightly lower in after-hours trading despite the company stressing that its financial performance would not be affected, unlike Target where earnings were hit after its breach.Home Depot reiterated its guidance for sales in 2014, up 4.8 per cent year on year, and increased its forecast for diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share for the full year will grow by 21 per cent to $4.54, higher than its previous guidance of $4.52, it said.However, the company warned that does not include an estimate for further costs relating to the breach which could include having to pay for customers’ cards to be reissued, future litigation and further capital investments in security.The Home Depot attack has affected more credit card details than the attack on Target late last year, where data about 70m customers were lost but only 40m cases involved card information.Well-resourced cybercriminals …are able to invest time in researching their targets to find a way into the network. Once they’re in, they stay quiet and fly unobserved under the radar, potentially for months at a timeThe Target breach last holiday shopping season hit that retailer’s earnings as it had to shell out for better security and incident response, while coping with some shoppers staying away. The breach led to the resignation of the chief executive and chief information officer.Cyber security companies said boardrooms across the world were shaken by the Target attack, which led to many companies increasing spending on cyber security.Home Depot said in a statement that the custom-built malicious software that hackers used to attack its systems had been eliminated and the company had added an extra layer of encryption at tills. Chip and pin technology, which can be more secure but is not yet commonly used in the US, will be in all Home Depot’s US stores by the end of the year, it said.Trey Ford, global security strategist at Rapid7, a US cyber security company, said the breach would cost Home Depot a lot of money, and that other large global retailers would be watching as the investigation continued.“This is why big box retailers are great targets for sophisticated, well-resourced cybercriminals. They are able to invest time in researching their targets to find a way into the network. Once they’re in, they stay quiet and fly unobserved under the radar, potentially for months at a time,” he said.
68;TGT;Target Corp;2014-09-18T00:24:50Z;Corporate pressure on NFL mounts;;Target has withdrawn all of the merchandise related to one of the National Football League’s leading players as corporate pressure continues to mount on the most powerful US sporting organisation amid multiple domestic violence and child abuse scandals.Target said on Wednesday that it had withdrawn all merchandise related to Adrian Peterson, of the Minnesota Vikings, from all Target stores and its website following child abuse allegations against the player. The Minnesota-based company’s decision came hours after the team indefinitely deactivated Mr Peterson. Target said it “continues to closely follow the allegations”.Nike on Wednesday said it had suspended Mr Peterson’s endorsement deal, while Minnesota-based Radisson Hotels pulled its sponsorship of the team on Monday.In a statement, Nike said it “in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and has shared our concerns with the NFL”.The scandal surrounding Mr Peterson – and the NFL’s response – comes on the heels of domestic abuse allegations against another star player, Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens.The league has come under fire since its decision to suspend Mr Rice for just two of 16 regular-season games after a video emerged of Mr Rice dragging the unconscious body of his then-fiancée from an Atlantic City hotel elevator. The league suspended him indefinitely after new footage emerged on September 8 that showed Mr Rice knocking his wife out in the elevator. On Tuesday, the players union lodged an appeal against the ruling.The NFL is the most popular US sports league, generating billions of dollars in annual revenues from sponsorship deals and broadcast rights. But many of the most prominent sponsors have expressed concerns about the allegations in a way that is novel for a league that has in the past dealt with players accused of murder.Anheuser-Busch, the chief beer sponsor of the league, said it was “disappointed and increasingly concerned” with the league. Sponsors including FedEx and McDonald’s have also said they are monitoring the situation.Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton had also called for Mr Peterson’s indefinite suspension.Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, has come under intense criticism for his handling of the situation, with calls for his resignation growing. Mr Goodell has appointed Robert Mueller, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the league’s handling of Mr Rice’s case.On Tuesday the league named Cynthia Hogan, who helped Vice-president Joe Biden craft the Violence Against Women Act when he was a senator, as its chief Washington lobbyist.
69;TGT;Target Corp;2014-09-03T16:27:25Z;Home Depot probes possible data theft;;Home Depot, the largest DIY chain in the US, sought to reassure consumers as it investigated reports of a mass theft of customers’ payment data.The chain said that if it confirmed a breach, it would offer free identity protection services and credit monitoring to customers who might be affected. It also reminded customers that their banks or the retailer itself would be responsible for any fraudulent charges on their cards.“We’re looking into some unusual activity that might indicate a possible payment data breach,” the company said. “We know that this news may be concerning and we apologise for the worry this can create.”If the possible attack is confirmed, it would be the latest in a growing number of data breaches by hackers on US retailers and banks.Brian Krebs, a well-known cyber security analyst who first reported the possible issues at Home Depot, said in a blog post that the suspected theft of card data from the company could be larger than the data theft of 40m credit and debit cards from Target earlier this year, based on information he had received from banks.After closing 2.5 per cent lower on Tuesday, Home Depot’s shares fell a further 2.4 per cent by close of trading on Wednesday.The increasing complexity of software and automation of business functions is contributing to a rise in large-scale attacks, said Jeff Williams, chief technology officer of Contrast Security, which develops internet security products. In addition to Target, online retailer eBay said in May that hackers had accessed millions of customers’ user names and other personal data.“If Home Depot pans out to be a Target-sized breach then three of the biggest breaches in all of history will have been in the last year, which is exceptional,” said Mr Williams. “As systems get more complex and more critical they’re easier to attack and more vulnerable to attack.”The theft of Target’s customer data ended up costing the retailer nearly $20m of related expenses in the first quarter and pushed it to replace its chief executive and cut its full-year forecast.Authorities including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Secret Service recently launched an investigation into a wave of cyber attacks against financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank by assets.If Home Depot pans out to be a Target-sized breach then three of the biggest breaches in all of history will have been in the last year, which is exceptionalCyber security researchers said retailers were proving to be equally alluring targets because they hold massive amounts of financial data but their security systems are rarely as sophisticated as those of large banks.The weak security on credit cards used in the US also makes it relatively easy for cyber thieves to steal the data, said Jaime Blasco, a researcher at security company AlienVault. Europe uses so-called “chip and pin” cards, which require a code to work. The US is only now requiring banks to use those more secure cards, a transition that will not be completed until next year.“Most of the biggest breaches that we are seeing are happening here in the US, and the problem is with these old credit card systems,” said Mr Blasco. “In Europe we have been using chip and pin credit cards for 10 years, and we don’t have those problems any more.”Mr Krebs said data suspected of being stolen from Home Depot were put up for sale on Tuesday via an underground online forum. Similarities with the Target breach, he wrote on his blog, suggested the same group of hackers could be responsible for both attacks.
70;TGT;Target Corp;2014-08-21T17:24:18Z;US retail: not sure what is in store;Target, among others, is trying to shift online, but what to do with those stores?;The post-results conference call has a patented script for troubled retailers. Blame an external factor (weather!) for weak growth, then propose a generic plan (promotions!) to drive more traffic to stores. In this year’s second-quarter results, this approach has been on full display, with disappointments at bellwethers such as Walmart and Macy’s. Lost in the quarter-to-quarter jockeying is a bigger question. How much of the old store retail model is salvageable?Target is an interesting case study for anyone prognosticating on the future of the big boxes. Between 2009 and late 2013, its shares jumped 80 per cent, reaching a market value of $40bn. But a data breach in November – 40m credit card numbers were compromised – has shaken the retailer. Its shares have drifted down since then, and a new CEO was recently hired. Its second-quarter results were poor – though less poor than before. Store traffic was down 1.3 per cent, an improvement from the declines of 2.3 and 5.5 per cent in previous quarters.One bright spot for Target is online sales, which grew 30 per cent in the quarter, though Wells Fargo reckons that e-commerce is only 3 per cent of group revenue. According to the Census Bureau, second quarter e-commerce sales grew 5 per cent nationwide, twice the overall retail sales growth rate, and e-commerce was 6 per cent of all retail sales. Target’s online efforts are commendable, but physical retailers have a tricky balancing act because of their vast store base. Target and its peers have initiated programs where customers order merchandise online and pick up the shipments in physical stores. The hope is that shoppers, once in the store, will make impulse purchases they wouldn’t have made online.Not a bad idea, but it is hard to imagine a brutal reduction in the number of stores can be avoided by incremental initiatives like these.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
71;TGT;Target Corp;2014-08-20T17:16:22Z;Cyber attack takes toll on Target;;Target has slashed its full-year profit outlook amid stagnant sales, fallout from a botched expansion in Canada and battered customer confidence following a massive cybersecurity attack.The third-largest retailer in the US reported a 62 per cent drop in second-quarter profit, with company earnings of $234m hit by heavy promotional discounting and a $148m charge relating to the high-profile theft of 40m shopper payment card details late last year.Target, whose new chief executive Brian Cornell started a week ago, said it now expects to generate adjusted earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.30 in the current financial year, down from its earlier estimate of $3.60 to $3.90 a share. Wall Street analysts had expected the outlook would be cut to $3.44 a share.While total revenue edged up 1.7 per cent to $17.4bn, Target’s US same-store sales were flat in the quarter to August 2.In Canada, they fell 11.4 per cent, bringing total losses in that market to $1.4bn in the 18 months since it opened the first of 130 stores.“We bit off way too much, too early,” admitted chief financial officer John Mulligan on Wednesday about the botched Canadian expansion. He added that Canadian consumers’ reaction to Target, damped by high prices and a poor product mix, had seen “marginal improvement but is nowhere near where we need it to be”. Last week rival Walmart also lowered its full-year forecast, as lower-income US consumers continue to migrate online or shift to smaller stores and discount outlets.But Target said that there were some bright spots, including a surge in back-to-school sales during July and August and a 30 per cent spike in its online sales following heavy investment in mobile and so-called “omnichannel” operations. Mr Cornell said he would focus on turning round the retailer’s fortunes.“Clearly, we have to have a sense of urgency here and a sense of pace. No one is happy with our current performance. And our focus right now is to make sure we’ve got plans in place in the short term to improve traffic. We’ve got plans in place to improve our performance in Canada, and we’ve got to continue to move faster from a digital and mobile standpoint to meet the needs of our guests,” said Mr Cornell, who joined the company from PepsiCo following the resignation of Gregg Steinhafel in May.“I’m going to be a good student of the business,” he said.Mr Cornell’s appointment marked the first time Target has hired a chief executive from outside its own ranks. Target shares rose 1.8 per cent to $60.33 by close of trading in New York.
72;TGT;Target Corp;2014-07-31T13:43:41Z;Target turns to PepsiCo for new head;;Target has appointed Brian Cornell from PepsiCo as its first chief executive from outside the company since the second-largest US retailer was founded more than a century ago.Mr Cornell, 55, who will start on August 12, will have to contend with the continuing fallout from a damaging cybersecurity breach late last year that rattled consumers’ confidence. He will also spearhead a turnround effort in Canada, following a botched push into the market that began in 2011.The experienced retail executive, who resigned as head of PepsiCo’s Americas food business last week, previously worked at Target’s bigger rival Walmart, where he was head of the Sam’s Club division.Target has had a bruising six months since hackers broke into its systems during last year’s busy Thanksgiving holiday shopping period and stole the personal information of 70m people and the payment card data of 40m.It has been looking for a new chief executive since the board forced Gregg Steinhafel to step down in May amid concerns about the direction of the business.“Our company has made it very clear in recent months that we have a lot of work do in order to improve in the eyes of our customers and shareholders. A new leader was required to accelerate that effort,” said Dustee Jenkins, vice president of public relations on Thursday.“In Brian the board has chosen an outsider, but more importantly someone with global experience in both grocery and consumer product retailing, plus a history of leading transformational efforts at a time when we need a transformational figure at the helm.”Target cut its full-year forecast as it said it would need to spend more than a year fixing the various problems across its business. Its first-quarter net profit fell more than expected, down 16 per cent to $418m.Mr Cornell will not only have to find a way of reigniting sales in the US. Analysts believe his main priority will be to get a grip on Target’s troubled expansion into Canada. Tony Fisher, the president of Target Canada, was fired in May.“The most pressing concern for investors will be Canada, a disastrous path that was meant to lead to growth but has seen Target burn through $1.64bn in cash and could even result in the company pulling out of the country all together. With consumers, you don’t get a second chance at a first impression,” said Stacey Wilditz, retail analyst at SW Retail Advisors.She added that unlike more downmarket rivals, Target had enjoyed a wave of customer popularity thanks to its distinctive home and apparel offerings at premium, which had been lost as the company focused more on mass-market product and groceries.“They need to rediscover fast their unique brand identity and position, which is what really made them stand out from the crowd,” Ms Wilditz said.Mr Cornell acknowledged the task at hand, saying: “I will focus on our current business performance in both the US and Canada and on how we accelerate our omnichannel transformation.”Target’s shares have underperformed the wider US stock market over the past 12 months, with a 14 per cent drop. The S&P 500 has gained 17 per cent and Walmart has fallen 4 per cent.Before joining Walmart, Mr Cornell held the position of chief executive at Michaels Stores and before that was chief marketing officer for Safeway.Target is due to announce its second-quarter earnings on August 20.
73;TGT;Target Corp;2014-07-06T12:44:00Z;US companies caught in crossfire on right to carry guns in stores;;Brandon Randall grew up in a small town in rural Minnesota where every family home stored licensed guns and most weekend activities centred on shooting ranges and hunting trips. But his attitude towards firearms has shifted.“When I became a parent, my viewpoint changed dramatically on whether people should be able to carry weapons into supermarkets or drugstores – there’s just no need for a loaded rifle to be in that kind of space, or near my children,” Mr Randall said from his home in Arizona.“I support the rights of Americans to have firearms in their houses but there’s a big difference between private property and public spaces. It doesn’t necessarily prevent me from shopping or eating in these places, but it sure makes me uncomfortable.”While Mr Randall may be willing to keep spending, many US retailers are discovering that thousands of others are not. Frustrated by Washington’s inaction over gun violence, fledgling consumer pressure groups, often led by parent activists, are taking the issues generated by the country’s gun laws into their own hands.“Mom groups” have turned up the heat on big-name businesses to force in-store policy changes on “open carry” rights, part of an attempt to tackle the historically passive stance of corporate America. Now, it appears that the rallies, petitions, social media campaigns and walkouts being used to grab the attention of executives are increasingly hitting their mark.On Wednesday, Target became the latest retailer to ask shoppers to take their firearms away from its aisles after lobbying by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, an anti-gun group partly funded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.Starbucks, Chipotle and Applebee's are other major household names – part of a group of at least a dozen US consumer companies – that have asked customers to leave their guns at home in the past year after similar campaigns.“Bringing firearms into Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create,” said interim chief executive officer John Mulligan.“Starting today we respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target, even in communities where it is permitted by law.”Shannon Watts, a mother of five from Indianapolis and founder of Moms Demand Action praised the company’s decision, calling it a “stunning” victory in the absence of gun reform in Congress.“We have opened the eyes of a business icon and made them recognise that it’s more important to listen to their customer base majority than a bullying vocal minority. We say if change can’t come through government, then it can come in how we use our voices and wallets,” she said, adding that mothers are responsible for 80 per cent of spending decisions in US households.“When state laws don’t protect customers, then companies must do it instead. A lot of this is about changing American business culture in the wake of tragedies like the Newtown school massacre. Executives must realise that they have an important and powerful role to play in demanding a new status quo.”We have been thrust unwillingly into the debate . . . to be clear: we do not want these events in our storesCompanies are caught between warring customer factions on either side of the gun control debate. Stores have become ideological battlegrounds with pro-gun “open carry” activists staging events in stores, shopping with assault-style weapons slung over their shoulders.Target only changed its stance after demonstrations took place in stores in states including Texas, Alabama, Ohio and North Carolina in the past three months. Similarly, last September Starbucks chief executive officer Howard Schultz asked customers not to openly display firearms after his coffee shops were used as rallying points for public protests. Mr Schultz said he felt a responsibility to protect his staff and prevent the intimidation of patrons.“We have been thrust unwillingly into the debate . . . to be clear: we do not want these events in our stores,” he said, saying both sides had played a role “in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction.”Many pro-gun shoppers say they will take their dollars elsewhere if retailers block their right to take responsibility for their own defence.“No more shopping at Target, since Target feels it necessary to prevent me from protecting my family with a legally owned and legally carried firearm,” customer Peggy Conrick posted on Facebook after the company’s decision this week.“Leaving it at home or in my car is not at option. Any store that doesn’t allow me to protect my family is a store I will not be shopping at.”The “moms groups” campaigns also run counter to new laws across several states making it easier for licensed gun owners to carry weapons where people congregate.On Tuesday, Georgia’s Safe Carry Protection Act came into effect, allowing gun-permit holders to bring their weapons into bars, restaurants and places of worship, unless explicitly banned by proprietors.
74;TGT;Target Corp;2014-05-21T21:09:19Z;Target cuts forecast after data breach;;Target’s first-quarter profit fell more than expected and the US retailer cut its full-year forecast as it continued to reel from a data breach, fewer visits to US stores and a bungled Canadian expansion.Net income fell 16 per cent to $418m, or 66 cents a share, in the three months ended May 3, from $498m, or 77 cents a share, a year ago. That was lower than the 71 cents Wall Street analysts had forecast. Sales rose 2.1 per cent to $17.05bn from $16.7bn, in line with forecasts.Target has had a bruising six months since hackers broke into its systems during the busy holiday shopping period and stole the personal information of 70m people and the payment card data of 40m. This month it removed its chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, and on Tuesday replaced the head of its Canadian business, which has lost $1.5bn since the first stores opened there last year.“We are not where we need to be,” John Mulligan, interim chief executive, said.Target said it would spend more this year to improve US sales, fix Canadian operations and catch up with rivals in the increasingly important arena of digital sales, which will eat into full-year profit. Adjusted earnings are expected of $3.60-$3.90 a share, down from a previous estimate of $3.85-$4.15 a share.That excludes any expenses related to the cyber attack, the company said, adding that it was “unable to estimate future expenses related to the data breach”. Mr Mulligan said the company would not know the full extent of its liabilities until the third quarter of this year.Target is also holding off on share buybacks until the second half of the year at least, he added.The company is facing numerous class action lawsuits over the breach and executives have had to testify before Congress. The incident racked up $18m in net expenses in the first quarter, as $26m in total costs were offset somewhat by insurance.Target shares rose 1 per cent to $57.20 on Wednesday in New York. The stock has dropped 9.5 per cent this year.Although the massive data breach, which could have exposed the personal and credit card data of up to a third of the US population, created a public spectacle out of Target, the retailer was already battling on multiple fronts.Since the downturn, it has struggled to boost US store traffic as customers maintained a tight hold on their purse strings or opted to shop at online rivals.Even as Target slashed prices to draw in customers – narrowing its gross margins to below 30 per cent – US same-store sales fell 0.3 per cent in the first quarter. The number of transactions dropped 2.3 per cent but its average ticket price rose 2.1 per cent as shoppers bought more expensive items.Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, said the traffic decline began before the November data breach. “Weak store visits suggest newly incoming/promoted Target executives must consider further scaling down the US store base,” he said.While the company is forecasting 2 per cent comparable sales growth in the US this year, Mr Mulligan acknowledged that lifting traffic would be “very difficult”.The company is aiming to get more customers shopping online, which accounts for about 2.5 per cent of sales. It said it had success in allowing customers to order online and pick up items in stores. A pilot programme that offers same-day delivery of items from stores will be expanded to Boston, Minneapolis and Miami in June.In Canada, losses before interest and taxes widened to $211m from $205m a year ago, while sales grew to $393m from $86m last year, when Target opened its first 24 stores in the country.That quickly grew to 127 stores but the company’s first international foray turned into a bungled attempt that exposed the company to ridicule as shoppers turned away from merchandise seen as too expensive and not catering to local tastes.Additional reporting by Anjli Ravalshannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
75;TGT;Target Corp;2014-05-05T13:29:44Z;Target chief steps down after data breach;;Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, has resigned from the US retailer after a disastrous cybersecurity breach that ruined its festive shopping season at the end of last year.Analysts said Mr Steinhafel’s departure reflected board displeasure with the handling of the cyberattack and the under-investment that led to it, as well as broader worries that Target was losing its relevance in the ecommerce era.The Minneapolis-based retailer had been criticised for reacting too slowly to a data breach that lasted nearly three weeks, and Mr Steinhafel’s resignation comes more than five months after it began. The attack started in late November 2013 but was not announced until December 19.The retailer said on Monday that Mr Steinhafel, who has been with the company for 35 years, would be replaced temporarily by John Mulligan, its chief financial officer. In March, the group announced the resignation of its chief information officer.Target grew to become the fifth-biggest US retailer with annual revenue of $72bn thanks to its focus on “cheap chic”, stylish clothes and household goods at affordable prices. But in recent years it has struggled to keep the brand fresh.Mr Steinhafel also launched an expansion into Canada last year, but the effort sapped profits and ran into trouble as Target’s products did not suit local tastes.The cyber breach made things worse: Target’s like-for-like sales fell 2.5 per cent in the quarter to the end of January as wary customers stayed away from the chain.In one of the worst data breaches the retail sector has seen, cyber criminals infected Target’s payment systems with malicious software, stealing the personal data of 70m people and the credit and debit card details of at least 40m.Faye Landes, analyst at Cowen & Co, said in a research note: “We take [Mr Steinhafel’s departure] as a sign that [Target’s] many problems are deep-seated, and we now fear that the company will be even more rudderless.“Presumably the board was not pleased with Steinhafel’s performance, and we think that it is fair to assume that current business trends are not particularly good.” She said the board might also want to see better merchandise on the shelves.David Schick, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said Target was in a tougher spot than many of its peers because the customers it traditionally relied on were doing more online shopping than others.“[Target] continues to face the issue of the younger, more affluent, more urban discount shopper simply not wanting to go to stores in the same way as their predecessors,” he said.Target said it was searching for a permanent replacement for Mr Steinhafel and had hired the headhunting group Korn Ferry.Last week it named long-time government adviser Bob DeRodes as its new chief information officer, replacing Beth Jacob.The retailer also said last week that it was working with MasterCard to roll out credit and debit cards equipped with chips after criticism that its current swipe technology was not secure enough.

Primark’s decision to locate its first US outlet on the site of Filene’s – a now-closed Boston department store famous for its bargain basement – is historically poignant if nothing else. The UK-based discount clothes chain will feel at home when it moves in next year.In a triumph of hope over experience, investors cheered the news. Shares in Primark owner Associated British Foods rose 8 per cent. UK retailers – most recently Tesco – have a mostly dismal record in the US. Primark will be taking on the likes of TJ Maxx (located just down the street from Filene’s) and Target. Market valuations are optimistic for Primark. On 27 times forecast earnings, AB Foods shares are at a premium to both rivals: TJX Companies is on 17, and Target 13.But it is not hard to see why AB Foods is so keen to take a risk in the US. Primark is the biggest and most exciting part of the group. Its profits grew 26 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal year and it produced a return on capital of 32 per cent. Other businesses in the conglomerate are duller. First-half profits in sugar fell by almost two-thirds as prices fell.And what really drives Primark is expansion. Same-store sales grew 4 per cent in the first half – pretty good, although less healthy than the 7 per cent in the same period last year. To keep double digit growth going it needs to keep building. Primark has 160 stores in the UK and 70 in continental Europe. The US is the next logical step, although sticking with European expansion alone would have been lower risk. Still, Primark will not bet the farm in the US. Net debt stands at £827m, which is less than 0.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. US expansion costing, say, £100m to £200m is – much like its products – easily affordable.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
77;TGT;Target Corp;2014-03-05T15:58:32Z;Target’s IT chief resigns in wake of data breach;;Target has announced the resignation of its chief information officer and an overhaul of its information security and compliance practices, in the wake of a massive cyber security attack on the US retailer during the holiday season.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the Minessotta-based discount stores group will conduct an external search for an interim replacement for Beth Jacob to help the company through the transformation.“While we are still in the process of an ongoing investigation, we recognise that the information security environment is evolving rapidly,” he said on Wednesday.Ms Jacob, who was appointed to the role in 2008, oversaw Target’s computer systems. She is the first high-profile executive to leave the company since the data breach.Target has said personal data of 70m people and the credit and debit card details of at least 40m were stolen between November 27 and December 15, after malicious software was deployed against the retailer’s payment systems.Mr Steinhafel said the company will also begin an external search for a chief compliance officer and plans to “elevate” the new role of the chief information security officer, seeking an external candidate for that position, too.Last week, Target reported that its fourth-quarter net income almost halved year-on-year, to $520m, and revenues fell 5.3 per cent, to $21.5bn, as the data theft deterred customers.Although Target has since experienced a small rebound in sales, it warned last week that the cyber attack may still have a “material adverse effect” on this year’s earnings.Hacking-related costs have so far totalled $61m, although Target said it expects all except for $17m to be covered by insurance.In addition, Target is investing $100m in cards equipped with chips, which analysts have said are less prone to hacking than the traditional magnetic stripe cards that are still commonly used in the US. It is also offering free credit monitoring for a year to all Target customers.The company hired Promontory Financial Group in January to help re-evaluate its technology and processes, as part of the process to restore trust in its security procedures.Faye Landes, analyst at Cowen & Co, said any measures that the new executives take “will be costly” for the retailer, particularly as it “appears likely that Target has been underinvesting in IT”.She added: “We suspect that [Ms Jacob’s] replacement will not be someone who tells the press that it is a misconception that ‘the most important skill set of a CIO is that of a techie’,” referring to a 2012 interview given by Ms Jacob.Separately, cosmetics chain Sally Beauty said on Wedesday it was the latest victim of a breach targeting their payment systems. Although the company had “detected an attempted intrusion” it said there was “no reason to believe there has been any loss of credit card or consumer data”.
78;TGT;Target Corp;2014-02-26T21:44:46Z;Abercrombie in vogue with investors;;Abercrombie & Fitch rallied 9 per cent after the company’s fourth-quarter profit topped expectations and the retailer said it would accelerate a share buyback programme.The fashion retailer, which owns the Hollister chain as well as its namesake brand, said profits more than halved in the period, falling to $66.1m, or 85 cents per diluted share.When adjusting for charges, including the closing of its Gilly Hicks lingerie brand and its cost-cutting programme, Abercrombie said it earned $1.34 per share, ahead of Wall Street forecasts.Same-store sales declined 8 per cent in the three months to February, slightly better than expectations of an 8.8 per cent dip.That, coupled with the announcement of an accelerated $150m share buyback programme, was enough to send its shares 11.2 per cent higher to $40.04.Net sales in the fourth quarter fell 11 per cent from a year earlier to $1.3bn.Abercrombie expects same-store sales at its stores to decline by a “high-single digit” per cent over the remainder of the year, although overall sales are to be buoyed by a 20 per cent increase in online orders.The company said margins were pressured as it increased promotional activity in its stores to ratchet up demand.“We are in a different environment in terms of price resistance,” chief executive Michael Jeffries said on a call with analysts. “Clearly, it’s an old axiomatic statement that good fashion doesn’t have a price attached to it but today it does.”Barnes & Noble shares rose 4.2 per cent to $18.47 after the US bookseller said it swung to a third-quarter profit of $63.2m, or 86 cents per diluted share, as the company continued to cut expenses in its Nook e-reader business.Sales fell 10 per cent to $2bn, roughly in line with analyst expectations.Chief executive Michael Huseby said the company benefited from a strong book catalogue during the quarter as well as improved marketing initiatives.Barnes & Noble reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which forecasts retail same-store sales to decline by a high single-digit per cent.The company has refocused itself around its core business of selling books in brick-and-mortar retail stores and away from the Nook digital business, which includes ebooks, ereaders and tablet computers.Nook sales have languished against well-capitalised rivals from Samsung and Apple.Target, the US retailer that has struggled since it disclosed hackers gained access to shopper information, rose 7 per cent on Wednesday to $60.49 after the company’s chief executive said “sales trends have improved in recent weeks”.Profits for the quarter, which runs to February 1, fell 46 per cent from a year earlier to $520m, or 81 cents a share. Revenue edged 5 per cent lower to $21.5bn.First Solar was among the biggest declining stocks on the benchmark S&P 500, falling 9.1 per cent to $52.74 after the company said profits fell 58 per cent in the fourth quarter.The company said profits fell to $65.2m, or 64 cents per share, as sales fell 29 per cent to $768m.First Solar said the results included asset impairments and restructuring charges after market close on Tuesday.First Solar has had difficulty filling its order book, selling slightly more solar panels than it was able to manufacture over the course of the year.“We continue to see lack of upside in First Solar’s utility scale model given checks which suggest a challenging US growth outlook for large-scale utility projects [and] mixed, early results in new growth markets,” Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee said.Overall, US equities rose moderately as better than expected new home sales counterbalanced recent weak figures on the country’s housing market.The S&P 500 was flat at 1,845.16 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.1 per cent to 16,198.41. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.1 per cent to 4,292.06.
79;TGT;Target Corp;2014-02-26T15:20:42Z;Target earnings top shrunken expectations;;Target Corp’s holiday quarter earnings beat expectations, sending shares higher, even as the US discount retailer dealt with the fallout from a cyber security attack in its domestic market and weak store traffic in Canada.Shares rose 7.5 per cent to $60.74 by midday New York trading on Wednesday.Before the earnings release investors had slashed forecasts for the company that had lost more than $3.5bn in market value since it disclosed in December that 40m shoppers’ credit and debit card records and 70m people’s personal data had been compromised.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the company’s spare-no-expense response to the crisis might even be paying off. Target has boosted its discounts and offered a year of free credit card monitoring to all its shoppers.“We will continue to work tirelessly to win back the confidence of our guests and deliver irresistible merchandise and offers, and we are encouraged that sales trends have improved in recent weeks,” he said.Although net income almost halved to $520m, or 81 cents a share, from $961m, or $1.47, a year earlier, the Minneapolis-based company exceeded analysts’ reduced expectations of 79 cents.Sales declined 5.3 per cent to $21.5bn in the three months to February 1, but the fall was in line with Wall Street’s lowered forecasts.The company said it expected earnings a share for the current quarter to range from 60 cents to 75 cents. For the full year, Target forecasts earnings a share to range between $3.85 and $4.15. Analysts expect earnings about the $4 mark.Target incurred $61m in expenses related to the breach during the quarter, but those costs were offset by a $44m insurance payment, bringing down the net cost to the retailer to $17m.Industry watchers have sought to gauge the longer-term impact of the incident. Although the company said it expected to absorb any near-term shocks, it was not able to estimate future expenses related to the data breach, beyond saying that these could have a “material adverse effect” on 2014 earnings.Potential costs include those tied to reissuing cards, lawsuits, federal investigations and enforcement proceedings and consulting feesPotential costs include those tied to reissuing cards, lawsuits, federal investigations and enforcement proceedings, legal expenses, investigative and consulting fees, and capital investments.Target is investing $100m in cards equipped with chips, which analysts have said are less prone to hacking than the traditional magnetic stripe cards commonly used in the US.Target has struggled with uneven sales since the financial downturn as its middle-income shoppers are still keeping a tight rein on spending. Although sales before the data breach were in line with expectations, a drop in traffic to its stores in the weeks after damped quarterly numbers. Harsh east coast winter weather also added to pressures.Efforts to clear excess inventory and control costs helped the retailer’s gross margins decline to 27.6 per cent in the quarter, compared with 27.8 per cent in 2012. The company expects to cut $1bn in spending by 2015.Meanwhile Target’s Canada business underwhelmed in its performance as costs continued to increase and sales lagged behind, resulting in a widening fourth quarter operating loss of $329m, from $148m the year before. Canadian customers have stayed away as merchandise has not met local tastes and prices have been higher than the group’s US stores.
80;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target shrugs off Canada woes;;Target is pushing ahead with its expansion into Canada, despite soaring costs and a cyber hacking crisis in the US discount retailer’s home market.Target opened 124 stores across 10 provinces last year and now seeks to add another nine locations in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia, the company said on Wednesday.But the Minnesota-based group’s much-hyped first major international foray, on which it said it would spend just over $4bn in 2013, has had a troubled start, as costs escalated and sales remained weak.“Target has failed miserably in Canada,” said Brian Sozzi, chief equity strategist at Belus Capital Advisors. “They have invested a lot more than expected in the business, but the main problem is they didn’t tailor stores to the market.”Canadian customers have stayed away as merchandise has not met local tastes, analysts said. Prices at Target – renowned for bringing cheap chic to low-price retail – are also too high. Near-empty shelves have been another criticism as a result of restocking problems.This month Target said lacklustre sales at its Canadian stores would have a bigger impact on fourth-quarter results than it had initially thought as it slashed prices to clear out unsold goods, hurting gross margins.Department store Sears has also been hampered by poor Canada sales, warning it faces a hefty loss for the fourth quarter. Sears Canada has been winding down operations at several stores and selling off merchandise at discounted rates.For Target, the data breach in which the credit card details and personal data of tens of millions of customers were stolen has only complicated efforts to control spending. Industry watchers have said Target’s costs are set to increase as a result of litigation, upgraded technology, fraud reimbursement and card reissuance.Target, which has 361,000 employees, announced 475 job cuts last week and said it would eliminate 700 posts in its Minneapolis headquarters, in the largest round of corporate job cuts since 2009. It also said it would no longer offer health insurance for part-time employees.“Target is facing battles on many fronts. The main challenge for them is getting the store traffic back in the US where it has more than 1,700 stores,” said Michael Monatani, analyst at ISI Group.“As for Canada, Target has to learn from the mistakes of the last year and correct problems over time, which I’m confident it will do. The company is in a crisis situation and needs loyal customers.”Target shares have fallen almost 15 per cent since mid-November to $57.08.Despite its struggles, the retailer, which has eyed the Canadian market for more than a decade, says it remains committed to its push across the border.Tony Fisher, Target Canada president, said: “As we head into 2014, we will continue to enhance the guest experience at all stores, while continuing to expand our presence in new Canadian neighbourhoods.”
81;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;US retailers unite to boost defences against cyber criminals;;US big box retailers are joining forces to strengthen their defences against cyber criminals following data breaches that have compromised tens of millions of shoppers.The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), a trade group for the country’s largest retailers, said on Monday it had launched an initiative to counter potential cyber threats and promote additional safeguards for personal data.“Retailers place extremely high priority on data security and invest tremendous resources to prevent attacks, but cyber criminals are persistent and their methods of attack are increasingly sophisticated,” said RILA president Sandy Kennedy.Target disclosed that personal data from more than 70m people and the credit card details of at least 40m had been stolen between November 27 and December 15 after malicious software was deployed against the retailer.Department store Neiman Marcus said 2,400 customer credit cards might have been used fraudulently and the data of approximately 1.1m could have been compromised. Michaels Companies, the arts and crafts retailer, said it too was investigating a possible security breach on its payment card network.“By working together with public-private sector stakeholders, our ability to develop innovative solutions and anticipate threats will grow, enhancing our collective security,” Ms Kennedy added.The group will form a council of senior retail executives to enable information sharing about potential threats. It will also lobby lawmakers to develop federal legislation on data security breach notification.Retailers are trying to do everything they possibly can, but ultimately it is a game of cat and mouse with one side trying to outsmart the otherLike other industry watchers, RILA is calling for the elimination of credit and debit cards that use magnetic stripe technology, which are outdated and easily exploitable. It wants chip-based smart cards and universal PIN security to be adopted instead.RILA also seeks to forge closer relationships with banks, credit card processing companies and other members of the payment cycle, as well as improve communication with consumers on how their personal data are used.But security experts say retailers have little chance of providing a completely secure payment system for customers against sophisticated cyber thieves. Corporate security teams have faced great difficulty in tracking and eradicating such malware in commercial settings, as hackers tend to sell on the software via multi-layered underground forums.“Retailers are trying to do everything they possibly can, but ultimately it is a game of cat and mouse with one side trying to outsmart the other,” said Richard Bortnick, a lawyer who advises companies about cyber security risks. “There is only so much a retailer can prepare for the worse case scenario.”
82;TGT;Target Corp;2014-01-24T00:14:40Z;FBI warns retailers of more cyber attacks;;The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned US retailers they may face further cyber attacks after detecting 20 hacking cases in the past year that used the same malicious software that was deployed against Target over the Thanksgiving shopping season.The agency cautioned retailers about the risks posed by “memory-parsing” malware that can compromise card swiping machines and other point of sales systems, the FBI confirmed on Thursday.“We believe POS malware crime will continue to grow over the near term, despite law enforcement and security firms’ actions to mitigate it,” the January 17 report entitled “Recent Cyber Intrusion Events Directed Toward Retail Firms” said.News of the three-page confidential document, first reported by Reuters, came after retailer Target disclosed that personal data from more than 70m people and the credit card details of at least 40m had been stolen between November 27 and December 15. Department store Neiman Marcus has also said 2,400 customer credit cards may have been used fraudulently and the data of approximately 1.1m may have been compromised.“The accessibility of the malware on underground forums, the affordability of the software and the huge potential profits to be made from retail POS systems in the US make this type of financially motivated cyber crime attractive to a wide range of actors,” the FBI added.IntelCrawler, the Los Angeles-based cyber security group, last week said malware had been deployed against at least six other US retailers. Meanwhile, the Online Trust Alliance, a non-profit group, estimates that more than 740m records were exposed in 2013, making it the worst year for data breaches to date.The FBI report highlighted the difficulties corporate security teams face in tracking and eradicating such malware in commercial settings, particularly as hackers sell on the software via multi-layered underground forums. One type of malware has been offered for as much as $6,000, the FBI said.Small- and medium-sized local and regional businesses, where losses ranged from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars, have been the main targets of POS malware cases the FBI had investigated.The agency examines cyber crime cases alongside the Secret Service, which is investigating the data breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus. A Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment.Separately, Target said that John Mulligan, its chief financial officer, will testify before the US Senate Judiciary Committee on February 4 about the data breach. The news capped a turbulent week for the US retailer, which also announced it would cut 475 jobs from its global workforce.
83;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Target was not sole cyber attack victim;;"The malware used to steal tens of millions of customer credit-card details from Target over Thanksgiving has been deployed against at least six other US retailers, according to a cyber security group.Researchers from IntelCrawler, a Los Angeles-based company, said that they have traced the attack back to a 17-year-old hacker who created malware called BlackPOS.Andrew Komarov, chief executive of IntelCrawler, said that six other point-of-sales systems had been compromised by the same malware, short for malicious software, two in LA and the rest in other US cities.“Most of the victims are department stores. More BlackPOS infections, as well as new breaches, could appear very soon; retailers and the security community should be prepared for them,” he said.Cyber security companies have been known to issue reports on new attacks to raise their company profile. The Financial Times was unable independently to verify the attacks reported by IntelCrawler.IntelCrawler is not the first cyber security company that has warned that more retailers were likely to be attacked using the same methods deployed in the Target attack. But until now no one has claimed to have traced exactly how many and where the retailers are.Retailers have become more vulnerable over the past year, according to Bitsight, which tracks where cyber attacks originate to compile a credit rating-like score for companies.Bitsight said that 40 per cent of the Fortune 200 retailers, excluding supermarkets, had a worse score than Target on its index. In the six weeks from the beginning of November, it found more than a thousand different infections from corporate networks at 139 US retailers.As online threats race up national security agendas and governments look at ways of protecting their national infrastructures a cyber arms race is causing concern to the developed worldTarget admitted last week that it had lost data from more than 70m customers stolen in the Thanksgiving cyber attack, as well as reporting last month that at least 40m credit-card details had been stolen. Neiman Marcus, the department store, also said that it had discovered evidence that some of its customers’ cards may have been compromised last month.Target this week agreed to testify before Congress in February about the data breach, a House of Representatives subcommittee said on Wednesday.Representative Lee Terry, who chairs the commerce, manufacturing and trade subcommittee of the House committee on energy and commerce, said that the hearing would investigate what effects data breaches such as this have on consumers.The subcommittee said that it expected to take testimony from law enforcement officials and other witnesses, alongside Target representatives. Industry watchers have said that lawmakers are seeking to make an example of Target.“By examining these recent breaches and their consequences on consumers, we hope to gain a better understanding of the nature of these crimes and what steps can be taken to further protect information and limit cyber threats,” Mr Terry said.Although the Federal Trade Commission has in recent years brought legal action against companies that violate consumers’ privacy rights, there is no federal law that requires disclosure of security breaches to customers and law enforcement agencies."
84;TGT;Target Corp;2014-01-15T17:35:26Z;Target data theft sounds wake-up call for retailers;;Confessing to a cyber attack used to be an eerily quiet business. Shares could shrug and sales remain steady when confidential customer data or vital intellectual property was lost, as confused consumers and investors did not know how to react.But when Target admitted last week that the data of more than 70m customers were stolen in the Thanksgiving cyber attack, something unusual happened: it damaged its business. The US retailer warned sales would decline this quarter as the theft had scared some customers off. It has since acknowledged that patrons who shopped at the retailer outside of the November 27 and December 15 period may have also been affected.Cyber attacks are on the rise with cyber security experts warning retailers especially have become more vulnerable and still more could get caught up in this one breach. Neiman Marcus, the department store, said this week it discovered evidence some of its customers cards may have been compromised last month.Mike Fey, chief technology officer at Intel Security, formerly McAfee, said the Target breach, in which 40m credit card details were accessed, heralded a new era in cyber attacks, where companies would start to feel the impact as they now could be accused of being negligent.“It was a dirty little secret, I thought, in the investing world that if your factory burnt down you would have to quickly tell investors you lost a material asset, but if your super secret formula for your product is stolen you didn’t have to tell anybody,” he said.Until now, the threat has been so difficult to measure it has often been ignored. Victims often saw little financial impact and many companies did not even declare the attacks as a material change to their business.Nine out of 10 cyber security attacks had little or no impact on the share price of the victim, according to research done last year by law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, which warned that investors did not fully appreciate the dangers a company can face after a breach.Until the Target attack, the largest data breach on record for a retailer was in 2007 when 90m records were stolen from TJX Companies, the parent company of retailers TJ Maxx and TK Maxx.TJX sales continued to grow strongly at the time despite the attack and, unlike Target, the company did not say that customers were scared off by the hack. Shares remained flat in the weeks after it admitted to the attack.But by the end of the year, the breach had ended up costing the company more than $130m because of the extra cost of the investigation and settlements with banks, card issuers and customer class actions.There have recently been lawsuits where companies can sue partners such as banks or retailers for neglecting security, so Target could face a “fairly hefty price tag”, said Mr Fey. “Target has a whole set of penalties facing them from banks and retailers.”Customers and small banks have filed 70 class action lawsuits in 21 states and Washington DC, claiming Target did not sufficiently protect consumer data, said Tina Wolfson, a lawyer at Ahdoot & Wolfson who is bringing one of the cases. Target said it would not comment on pending litigation.Senator Richard Blumenthal and other lawmakers have called for Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to probe Target after the data breach. The FTC has the authority to hold businesses to account if their data security policies are not sufficiently stringent.Target is now offering customers a year of free credit and identity theft monitoring and has said those who have had purchases made fraudulently with their accounts will not be held responsible.For the companies there is no way to put in place reserves as there is no way to know how bad the damage could be or who is liable to pay for the cost of such breachesEven in Target’s case, shares were barely hit by the attack – falling 2.2 per cent after the first announcement and 1.2 per cent after the second – despite the company warning that earnings would be impacted.Brian Yarbrough, retail analyst at Edward Jones, said retailers have been concerned about cyber security for some time, but neither they nor sector analysts were factoring in financial hits as a result of data breaches, as potential losses were so difficult to predict.“For the companies there is no way to put in place reserves as there is no way to know how bad the damage could be or who is liable to pay for the cost of such breaches,” he said.Cyber security experts are warning that, once hackers have developed malware to attack the software behind a point-of-sale device, they are unlikely to stop at one large retailer.Patrick Peterson, chief executive of cyber security company Agari, said the Target attack should be a “wake-up call” to other retailers.“Once you have a very, very successful technique like this why wouldn’t you go after all the retailers?” he said. “This is an arms race where we see the bad guys pulling into the lead.”Bitsight, which tracks where cyber attacks originate to compile a credit rating-like cyber security score for companies, said 40 per cent of the Fortune 200 retailers, excluding supermarkets, had a worse score than Target on its index. The number of attacks on the retail sector rose over the past year, the company said.Joe Feldman, retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said the biggest issue for retailers right now is the financial impact of nervous customers staying away. “With so much choice out there, you would just go to another retailer,” he said.
85;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target sales hit by data breach;;A huge theft of payment card data from Target is causing financial harm to the US retailer as it admitted that its sales had been hit and more customers could be affected.Target said on Friday that due to the breach it expected like-for-like sales to be down 2.5 per cent from a year ago in the quarter to the end of January. The retailer also said that the names and contact details of up to 70m people could have been stolen, in addition to up to 40m whose credit card details it had previously said were vulnerable. It said it did not know how much overlap there was between the two groups.Target also cut its profit forecast as some customers avoided its stores due to fears of fraud.The theft has turned into a crisis for the discount chain at the worst time of year as it was locked in a battle with rivals for shoppers during a highly competitive festive shopping season.Target has been criticised for the way it has dealt with the crisis because, since its announcement of the breach on December 19, it has sent out several partial statements containing information that it has later revised.“The way they handled it is not really an ‘A’,” said Stacey Widlitz, an analyst at SW Retail Advisors. “It was drift, drift after the fact.”The theft has pointed to the continued vulnerability of big organisations to cybercriminals.Target said it would “attempt to contact” affected customers if it knew their email addresses, a move that Ms Widlitz questioned given that many would be on the lookout for scams.If I got an email from Target . . . am I going to open that email? Are you crazy?“If I got an email from Target . . . am I going to open that email? Are you crazy?” she said.Target said its sales had been stronger than expected before its announcement on December 19, but “meaningfully weaker than expected” since it announced the breach.It said it expected sales to be down between 2 per cent and 6 per cent for the remainder of the quarter.When Target announced the breach it said that no further data could be stolen, but the reassurance did not sway some consumers.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said: “I know that it is frustrating for our guests to learn that this information was taken and we are truly sorry they are having to endure this.”Ms Widlitz said that Mr Steinhafel’s job was not in jeopardy but that “he’s got a lot of explaining to do”.Target said shoppers would have “zero liability for the cost of any fraudulent charges arising from the breach”.Target shares fell 1.1 per cent to $62.65 on Friday.
86;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Encrypted PIN data taken in Target breach;;"The theft of credit and debit card data from Target extended to encrypted personal identification numbers, the retailer said on Friday, acknowledging that the pre-Christmas hacking was worse than its first public assessment.Some 40m cards were affected in one of the biggest ever data breaches in the US, causing inconvenience for millions of shoppers at the peak of the holiday shopping season.Accessing PINs along with card data could potentially allow thieves to withdraw money at cash machines. However, the retailer said the information was “strongly encrypted” and “we remain confident that PIN numbers are safe and secure”.However, one banker warned that there was a risk that the PINs could be unencrypted and funds withdrawn from cardholders’ accounts.The Secret Service and justice department are investigating the hacking. Target announced a week ago that accounts had been accessed between November 27 and December 15.In the aftermath of the episode, banks including JPMorgan Chase placed limits on spending to mitigate the impact of any fraud stemming from the data breach. Customers’ cash withdrawals were first capped at $100 and card purchases at $300, causing trouble for last-minute Christmas shoppers. The limits were later relaxed.Shares in Target fell 0.5 per cent to $62.15 on Friday. The stock has modestly underperformed peers since news of the breach first emerged.John Kindervag, a security analyst at Forrester Research, said the encryption should hold though the fact that PIN data had been taken raised further questions about Target’s storage of information.“It shows that Target was aggregating a lot of data that was unnecessary for them in the back end,” he said.“Assuming they did key management OK everything is fine; there’s nothing to worry about,” he said. “We call that killing your data, devaluing it by proper encryption. Most standardised algorithms – despite all the things you see on TV – generally can’t be hacked or broken.”Target said: “Target does not have access to nor does it store the encryption key within our system. The PIN information is encrypted within Target’s systems and can only be decrypted when it is received by our external, independent payment processor. What this means is that the ‘key’ necessary to decrypt that data has never existed within Target’s system and could not have been taken during this incident.”Nonetheless, Mr Kindervag said: “If you used your debit card at Target it’s probably a good idea to change that PIN number.”"
87;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target security breach hits 40m customer accounts;;Thieves have stolen credit card data from up to 40m Target shoppers in a huge security breach that has hit the US retailer at the height of the holiday shopping season.The theft points to the continued vulnerability of big organisations to cybercriminals. Data security has become a top priority for companies and governments worried about protecting sensitive information.The theft could hardly have come at a worse time for the discount chain, the world’s eleventh biggest retailer by sales, which is locked in a battle with rivals for festive shoppers.The breach occurred between November 27 and December 15, a period that included the biggest shopping day of the year, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.In a message for customers on its website Target urged them to “remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing your account statements and monitoring free credit reports”.Edward Markey, a Democratic senator who is vocal on privacy issues, said: “Target shoppers should not have targets on their backs for data thieves …We need to quickly uncover the extent of the harm suffered by Target customers from this massive data breach and fix the security weaknesses exploited by these fraudsters.”A Target spokeswoman said the retailer had “hundreds of people” answering telephone calls from concerned shoppers, but she declined to comment on whether any fraud had already been detected.The theft affected only shoppers in its bricks-and-mortar stores, not transactions on its website, Target said. Security analysts say store check outs have become a major target for cybercriminals in recent years.The theft appeared to be one of the biggest breaches of data security in the retail sector since TJX Companies – a discount chain that owns TJ Maxx in the US and TK Maxx in the UK – said in 2007 that it had fallen victim to criminals.Federal prosecutors later said that the TJX case was part of a broader scheme in which hackers stole more than 41m credit and debit card numbers from a total of nine big retailers.Target said the information involved in its case included customer names, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates and CVV three-digit security codes.John Kindervag, a principal analyst with Forrester Research, said: “This is a breach that should have never happened.”He said the theft of CVV codes suggested that they were being stored, a practice banned by card brands. “Clearly by exposing CVV information Target has demonstrated a blatant disregard for . . . compliance regulations as well as card security best practices,” he said.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said: “We regret any inconvenience this may cause . . . We take this matter very seriously and are working with law enforcement to bring those responsible to justice.”Target said it had alerted the authorities and financial institutions as soon as it found out about the incident and that the theft had now ended.On the cusp of this weekend’s Super Saturday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year, the spokeswoman said: “Guests should feel confident shopping.”Target shares fell more than 2 per cent on Thursday in a flat market.
88;TGT;Target Corp;2013-12-01T20:58:53Z;US Thanksgiving sales set to be down;;US retail sales are likely to be down on last year in the four days from Thanksgiving to Sunday despite the early opening of stores and a surge in online spending, according to initial estimates.The National Retail Federation said on Sunday that it expected total spending over the long holiday weekend – when some stores opened earlier than ever on Thanksgiving night – to drop to $57.4bn from $59bn last year.It said 141m people were buying over the holiday weekend, up from 139m last year, but a survey of their shopping intentions indicated that their average spend would fall to $407 from nearly $424 last year.On Thanksgiving and Black Friday alone, sales at stores rose by a modest 2.3 per cent from last year, according to estimates from ShopperTrak, a research group.The retail federation’s estimates suggest that Saturday and Sunday were much lighter shopping days.ShopperTrak reiterated its longer-term forecast of a 2.4 per cent rise in sales in November and December as a whole. That would be the slimmest gain since 2009, when holiday sales were down from the previous year.Ecommerce continued to boom as more consumers opted to avoid the crowds and shop online, where many retailers offered the same “door buster” discounts they had in stores.On Thanksgiving, online sales climbed 18 per cent year-on-year to just over $1bn and on Black Friday they jumped 39 per cent to $1.9bn, according to analysis by Adobe Systems.Ecommerce extends beyond online-only businesses such as Amazon and eBay. Traditional retailers are taking more traffic away from their stores with their own websites. For example Target, a style-oriented discount chain, said it experienced twice as many online orders as on Thanksgiving last year.Despite improvements in labour and housing markets, retailers and economists say US consumers continue to be inhibited by economic uncertainty, rising living costs, confusion over healthcare and political gridlock in Washington.At malls and big box retail parks, shopper numbers on Black Friday itself were down 11.4 per cent from last year, ShopperTrak said, as consumers were lured by retailers that opened earlier than ever on Thanksgiving at 6pm or 8pm.Bill Martin, ShopperTrak’s founder, said it was expensive for retailers to open on Thanksgiving because they had to offer holiday pay and other incentives to employees and that would put their profitability in the spotlight.“You’ve got extra expenses and deep discounts, so the question is: did anyone make any money?” he said.Retailers typically begin the holiday season with a few loss-leading discounts, but they are carefully planned. Profitability often takes the biggest hit later in the season when they are forced to offer big unplanned discounts to offload products that have flopped.NPD, a research group, said the top-selling items on Thursday, Friday and Saturday were clothing, which accounted for 28 per cent of purchases, followed by toys at 11 per cent.The long Thanksgiving weekend accounts for about 10 per cent of retail sales in November and December, according to analysts at Cowen & Co.The holiday season can account for between 20 and 40 per cent of retailers’ annual revenues, said the National Retail Federation.
89;TGT;Target Corp;2013-11-21T18:53:12Z;US retailers lack Christmas cheer;;Target, Sears and Abercrombie & Fitch have joined a roll call of retailers reporting weak pre-Christmas results as the actions of management exacerbated the effects of a fragile economy.Target, the style-minded discount chain, posted a 0.9 per cent rise in like-for-like US sales that fell short of Wall Street forecasts on Thursday. It said its decision to enter Canada this year was eroding its profits far more than expected.Sears, a department store that hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert has been struggling to revive since 2004, reported a net loss of $534m for the three months to November 2 and said its like-for-like sales fell 3.1 per cent.Abercrombie & Fitch, a youth retailer that some analysts say has lost its fashion edge, reported a $15m net loss and a 14 per cent fall in US like-for-like sales. It warned that it expected weak sales to continue into the end-of-year shopping season.November and December are make-or-break months for retailers, when many make between 20 and 40 per cent of their annual sales.But many Americans are reluctant to splash out because of the fragile jobs market, rising living costs and uncertainty over healthcare bills under “Obamacare”, said Thom Blischok, chief retail strategist at Booz & Co. “We might call it an ‘underlying foundation of economic fear’,” he said.Target’s weak performance prompted the retailer to suspend its share buyback in the past quarter, a move it linked to its “commitment to maintain its strong investment-grade credit ratings”.The discount chain’s aggressive expansion into Canada has turned sour as its 124 stores in the country are sapping its profitability. Its net income of $341m for the past quarter translated into lower than expected earnings per share of 54 cents. The company said its Canada business had wiped 29 cents from that number.Reflecting investment costs and the discounts Target had to offer to sell excess inventory, the gross margin of its Canadian business – a key measure of profitability – was 14.8 per cent, versus 30 per cent in the US. Target shares fell 3.7 per cent to $64.03 on Thursday morning.Sears shares were also down – 1.5 per cent lower at $60.79 – after its results. Its total sales dropped $585m from a year ago to $8.3bn, reflecting the fall in like-for-like sales as well as the closure of some stores and the spin-off of others.Abercrombie & Fitch had already said it was not optimistic about the Christmas shopping season, so investors put its outlook to one side and focused on its earnings per share – excluding some hefty charges – of 52 cents, which surpassed expectations. Abercrombie shares edged up 0.3 per cent to $35.09.
90;TGT;Target Corp;2013-08-23T19:36:28Z;Week in review, August 24;;"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Corporate person in the news: Meg Whitman, chief executive, Hewlett-PackardWhen Meg Whitman took on the top job at Hewlett-Packard nearly two years ago, people who knew her had one overriding question: Why?This week, with HP stumbling badly in its long-running turnround, that may be a question that she is also asking herself, writes Richard Waters.One of the few women to have risen to the top in Silicon Valley, Ms Whitman certainly did not need the recognition or the money.The fortune she reaped from her nine years at the helm of online marketplace eBay is estimated to be worth $1.9bn by Forbes, making the token $1 in salary she is paid by HP an irrelevance (though additional equity awards have lifted her annual income to more than $15m since she joined the company.)Ms Whitman has already used her personal wealth to build a new career well beyond the technology world. Her failed $144m bid as a Republican candidate for governor of California in 2010 turned out to be the most expensive run for statewide office in US history.Nor did the former eBay boss bring the sort of experience that many thought was needed to revive a venerable but faded name in US technology. She lacked either a background in business IT, or deep operational experience to get to grips with HP’s sprawling range of hardware, software and services businesses. Also, she had left eBay as its own fortunes were starting to wane, and the company required a turnround of its own under new chief John Donahoe.Pesky Brussels bureaucrats are depriving Europeans of brighter smiles with rules that prevent the sale of teeth-whitening products directly to consumers, said Procter & Gamble (a peddler of teeth-whitening products). It is lobbying for regulations to be relaxed, bringing Europe into line with the US, Brazil and China.Despite that, her determined and focused performance since taking on one of the toughest jobs in Silicon Valley has won her grudging respect even from some people who doubted her decision to take the job in the first place. She has remained very much on-message in trying to keep HP’s executives and its shareholders focused on the long and painstaking turnround, with the need for effective execution her overriding message rather than any big changes in strategy, according to one person who has worked with her.That made this week’s news particularly galling for the former eBay boss, as she admitted that “inconsistent execution” had been behind a slide in HP’s competitive position in two of its key markets, PCs and low-priced industry standard servers. After a stock price surge of nearly 80 per cent this year on hopes that HP’s revival was starting to take hold, it amounted to a major setback and admission of failure, leading to a shake-up among the company’s senior executives as Ms Whitman sought to tighten performance.Ms Whitman has herself survived at least one potential threat to her leadership, with three of the company’s directors quitting after shareholders expressed their unhappiness about the company’s disastrous acquisition of UK software company Autonomy in 2011. Despite being one of the HP directors who voted unanimously for that deal, Ms Whitman survived the investor rebellion.This week, she declared, HP was finally ready to go back on the acquisition trail again. So what are the risks of another big debacle from a deal gone bad? “Don’t worry about that,” she tried to assure the company’s shareholders earlier this week. “We are very focused and disciplined.”Vestas ousts chief executive as outlook turns favourableVestas bowed to investor pressure on Wednesday and ousted Ditlev Engel (pictured) as chief executive of the Danish wind turbine manufacturer, writes Richard Milne.The move revealed that Bert Nordberg, Vestas’ chairman for the past year, is the man calling the shots in efforts to pull the group out of a difficult few years.Mr Nordberg now has a chief executive he knows well: Anders Runevad, a former colleague from both Ericsson and its mobile phone joint venture with Sony. Mr Runevad will take over a lossmaking company that has been battered by multiple profit warnings.Dawn Airey, the former chairman and chief executive of Channel Five, is to join Yahoo as head of its European operations. The
52-year-old earned the affectionate sobriquets “Scarey Airey” and “Zulu Dawn” from some former colleagues, but has insisted she is “tough with a soft centre”.Many of the past problems have now been cleared up: Vestas, which lost its crown as the world’s biggest wind company to General Electric last year, now sports an entirely new executive team. Mr Nordberg has switched the focus away from revenue growth to cash flow and profitability. But two big investor lawsuits – one in the US and one in Europe – still hang over the company.Mr Runevad will benefit from a more optimistic attitude from investors towards wind companies, especially after the US renewed its subsidy regime this year. Vestas’ share price has quadrupled since its lows in November, although they are still down 85 per cent from 2008.Mr Engel paid the price for his decision to keep building new factories and hiring workers after the financial crisis. He was then forced to cut a third of the workforce as part of a deep restructuring needed to fend off Vestas’ creditors.Bleak results point to belt tightening by US shoppersWhile the talk in the markets is of an improving US economy that will in due course lift interest rates, it seems many Americans are not feeling good enough to splash out at the mall, writes Barney Jopson.That was the message of bleak results from US retailers this week, which stoked pessimism about the crucial end-of-year shopping season.Clothes retailers were the nexus of the bad news. Sales in the quarter to early August fell at the teen fashion retailers Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, as well as the department stores JC Penney and Sears, where consumer caution aggravated busted company strategies.They followed declining sales last week at Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, and Macy’s, another department store whose recent run of good form ground to a sudden halt.On average retailers have fallen short of Wall Street’s profit expectations by 1 per cent, according to Retail Metrics, a research group.Target managed to report a slim rise in sales; it was less than Wall Street wanted. Its chief executive spoke for many when he said he expected consumer spending to be cautious for the rest of the year “in the face of ongoing household budget pressures”.The gloom, however, was not unremitting. At Home Depot and Lowe’s sales were up by double-digit percentages, as they benefited from spending linked to a rebounding housing market. The conclusion: Americans have not stopped spending entirely.Glencore Xstrata chief insists deal will pay offGlencore Xstrata’s first interim results as a combined group this week produced a $7.7bn writedown that inevitably led to questions as to whether Ivan Glasenberg overpaid to bring Xstrata’s mining assets into the commodities trading house he has led for more than a decade, writes James Wilson.Glencore’s deal to acquire Xstrata – the biggest ever between mining groups – took more than a year to complete, a period during which the sector fell out of favour with investors. Prices of some mined commodities have fallen amid signs that the China-led resources boom has slowed.Mr Glasenberg defended the logic of the deal and insisted it would still pay off for Glencore.The impairment stems from the difference between the valuation now attributed to some parts of Xstrata – particularly its early-stage projects – and the price paid, as measured by Glencore’s stock price when the all-share deal was completed in May.Highlighting the downturn in mining, Glencore Xstrata’s interim earnings were down 28 per cent before interest and tax, on a pro-forma basis assuming the companies had been combined since the start of the year.However, Mr Glasenberg promised Glencore would deliver more annual synergies from the deal than the $500m so far estimated.Next month the group is set to explain details of those larger synergies and say where it expects further growth to come from.Recruitment drive targets dealmakers and tradersA number of investment banks have started to expand their European franchises by hiring dealmakers and traders, raising hopes that the jobs market for bankers has reached a turning point, writes Daniel Schäfer.Nomura, Citigroup and Bank of America are among a number of banks that have started hiring in Europe in recent months, in a sign that recruitment is picking up after a two-year cull that saw thousands lose their jobs.Recruiters said they are at their busiest in a number of years as banks add new staff in revenue-generating positions in areas ranging from M&A advice to equities trading. It came as data showed that the rate of job losses in the global investment banking sector has slowed significantly.Staff levels in the front offices of the 10 largest investment banks fell 0.8 per cent between the first and second quarter to 54,165, according to data that will be published on Thursday by Coalition, the research company.This was less than half the rate than in the first three months of the year and comes after two years of drastic job cuts.A number of banks are beginning to expand in areas where they are making good returns.After a year of staff reductions Nomura, the Japanese bank, is looking to make senior hires for its European sector coverage and for its regional offices, people close to the situation said.It is also adding mid-level bankers to its leveraged finance team."
91;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target warns of cautious consumers;;Target forecast that consumers would remain “cautious” in their spending for the rest of the year, as the US discount retailer reported weaker-than-expected quarterly US sales.The 1.2 per cent rise in US like-for-like sales in the quarter to August 3 nonetheless beat its biggest rival Walmart, which announced a fall in sales last week. Target also met Wall Street profit expectations, a feat several other retailers have failed to achieve.For the full year, however, it said on Wednesday that it expected profits to be “near the low end” of its previous guidance range of $4.70 to $4.90 per share.US retailers have reported a series of gloomy results that suggest improvements in the labour and housing markets are not giving many consumers enough confidence to spend more.At the 65 retailers that have reported results for the past quarter, profits have been on average 0.7 per cent below Wall Street expectations, according to Retail Metrics, a research group.Gregg Steinhafel, Target chief executive, said: “For the balance of this year, our US outlook envisions continued cautious spending by consumers in the face of ongoing household budget pressures.”Also on Wednesday, Staples, the office supplies retailer facing tough competition from ecommerce, said its sales fell 2 per cent to $5.3bn from a year ago in the past quarter. Its earnings per share came in two cents short of market expectations at 16 cents.Home improvement, however, continued to stand out as a bright spot. Lowe’s, a store shoppers turn to kit out new houses and renovate old ones, reported a 9.6 per cent rise in sales at stores open at least a year. That followed even steeper sales growth on Tuesday at its main rival Home Depot.At Target, Mr Steinhafel said an increase in US income tax this year continued to affect consumer spending, particularly among lower-income households.“Recent job growth numbers have been encouraging, but labour force participation and income growth remain weak,” he said.Target shares fell 3.8 per cent to $65.39 on Thursday.It made a net profit of $611m, or 95 cents per share, down 10 per cent from the same period last year partly because of the cost of entering the Canadian market, where Target has opened 68 stores so far this year in a search for new growth.Faye Landes, analyst at Cowen & Co, pointed out that Target’s gross margin in Canada – a key measure of profitability – fell to 31.6 per cent from 38 per cent in the previous quarter, a possible reflection of intensifying competition.In the past quarter, Loblaw, Canada’s biggest retailer by sales, acquired the pharmacy chain Shoppers Drug Mart for $12bn while Sobeys, another local chain, bought Safeway’s Canadian stores for $5.7bn.
92;TGT;Target Corp;2013-08-19T21:36:14Z;Target / Walmart: wagers, please;The market is ignoring the differences between the two. Does this make sense?;"For Americans, there is something uniquely depressing about bad quarterly results from Walmart. The company employs 1.3m people in the US, a per cent of the employed population. It sells Americans over a quarter-trillion dollars of goods annually, more than a 10th of all retail sales. So when Walmart says its US comparable-store sales did not grow and cuts its growth targets, as it did last week, everyone shivers a bit.Investors in Target – which reports its own results on Wednesday – don’t just shiver. Since Walmart’s bad numbers, Target’s shares have fallen almost as much as its larger rival’s. For most of the past two years, in fact, the stocks have been in step – despite big differences between the two. Most importantly, Target is slightly upscale of Walmart. This is working in its favour, judging by comparable-store sales in the US: over the eight prior quarters, Target’s had averaged 2.7 per cent, to Walmart’s 1.4 per cent. Walmart makes a third of its revenue internationally; Target is only now going abroad– to exotic Canada. Walmart is more focused on food (half of US sales) than Target (a fifth). Target, finally, lacks a warehouse club division to match Walmart’s Sam’s Club.The market has looked at these contrasts and decided that, for now, they do not amount to much. Both trade at about 14 times forward earnings (two years ago, they both traded at 11). Does this make sense?The two companies have not always traded together: during the 2008 tumult, down-market, staples-driven, geographically diverse Walmart did radically better. Target bounced in the happier years that followed. So if the American consumer is slipping backwards again (as demonstrated by soft results not only at Walmart but at mid-market Macy’s and fancy Nordstrom, too) Walmart may merit a premium. Against this, Target’s partisans will point to its greater growth and its opportunities abroad. The parallel valuations allow for a cheerful little wager: pessimists take Walmart, optimists Target.

93;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US consumers’ tight budget takes toll on Target sales;;Target added to signs that US consumers remain on tight budgets by reporting an unexpected fall in sales following similarly disappointing results from Walmart last week.The mass market retailer, which serves a slightly wealthier clientele than cut-price Walmart, also reported profits that fell short of market expectations for the three months to March 4 and cut its earnings guidance for the year. Target shares fell 2.5 per cent in premarket trading in New York.The group’s like-for-like US sales fell 0.6 per cent in the quarter, although it had said in mid-April that it expected them to be flat. Its net sales were $16.7bn, up 1 per cent from a year ago, partly thanks to the opening of 24 new stores in Canada.Target blamed the decline on cold spring weather – a factor whose influence is subject to debate in retail – which it said depressed sales of clothes and other “weather-sensitive” product categories.When Walmart reported a 1.1 per cent fall in like-for-like sales last week, it blamed a rise in the payroll tax rate this year, delayed tax refunds from last year and lower than expected food inflation, as well as the weather.Target reported net income of $498m, or 77 cents per share, which was less than Wall Street’s forecast of 87 cents per share and 26 per cent lower than a year ago.“While we are disappointed in our first quarter performance, we remain confident in our strategy,” said Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive.The group cut its full-year earnings per share guidance to $4.70 to $4.90 from $4.85 to $5.05.
94;TGT;Target Corp;2013-02-27T14:22:29Z;Target set to open 24 stores in Canada;;Target will open its first 24 stores in Canada by early April and vowed to invest a further $1.5bn in the country this year as the retailer seeks to offset weak sales in the US.The discount chain has been preparing to open in Canada since buying leases on about 200 premises two years ago, but it said on Wednesday that the expansion would reduce profits this year by more than expected.Target, renowned for bringing cheap chic to low-price retail, confirmed on Wednesday that it planned to have 124 stores in Canada by the end of the year as it reported meagre US sales and profits for the Christmas shopping season.Doug Stephens, president of Retail Prophet consulting, said Canada was a “tremendous opportunity” for Target because it was much less crowded than the US, where there is a surfeit of shops and ecommerce is expanding rapidly.“There’s been an absolute dearth of competition in Canada,” he said. “The whole country has been owned by a handful of national chains. We haven’t had any shake-up since Walmart came in in the 1990s. It’s been static.”Because it will sell both general merchandise and groceries, Target’s competition will include Sears, another US peer, and Loblaw, Canada’s biggest grocery chain by sales.Target declined to provide a revenue forecast for its Canadian business, but said expansion costs would reduce its earnings per share by 45 cents in 2013. It forecast earnings per share for the year of $4.70 to $4.90.Target’s like-for-like sales in the US grew just 0.4 per cent in the three months to February 2, worse than the 1 per cent growth reported last week by Walmart, its main rival, which also disappointed investors.Gregg Steinhafel, Target chief executive, said the group faced “a highly promotional retail environment and continued consumer uncertainty”. Consumer spending this year has been damped by a rise in payroll taxes and delayed income tax refunds from 2012.Target’s net profit for the quarter fell 2 per cent from a year ago to $961m, translating to earnings per share of $1.47 that were one cent short of consensus estimates. Target shares fell 1 per cent to $63.41 on Wednesday.In January 2011, Target agreed to pay C$1.82bn to acquire leases on up to 220 sites operated by Zellers, a fading Canadian discount retailer.Most of US retail is parochial compared with other sectors of business, but a lack of domestic sales growth is prompting more companies to contemplate downsizing and expansion elsewhere.Walmart is by far the most adventurous, having built an international business with $135bn of sales last year in 26 countries.Target, based in Minneapolis, is facing competition from Amazon and has been more aggressive than most in cutting its commercial ties with the online rival – it no longer sells Amazon’s Kindles.
95;TGT;Target Corp;2013-01-04T03:21:04Z;US holiday retail sales disappoint;;Limited spending by US consumers produced a lacklustre holiday shopping season for many retailers, which are likely to face pressure on profits and questions over whether they should have fewer stores.Target reported flat December sales while the owner of Victoria’s Secret for once fell short of sales expectations. Macy’s, despite decent results, said it would close six stores this year.Sales at stores open for at least a year rose on average 2.3 per cent in December among the 19 retailers that reported figures on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters. That compares with a 3.5 per cent rise in the same month last year and headline inflation currently running at 1.8 per cent.December is the most important month of the year for retailers and in a desperate effort to win consumer dollars – even at the cost of profits – many stores resorted to big price cuts in the days before Christmas.Joel Bines, a consultant at AlixPartners, said: “Essentially [retailers] averted disaster. That’s the best you can say about this holiday season.” Excluding drug stores, like-for-like sales were up 4.5 per cent.Retail Metrics, a research group, said December sales were not as disappointing as some had feared, but had been hit by a stream of negative news, including worries over the “fiscal cliff”, winter storms and the Newtown massacre.The S&P index of big retailers rose 0.9 per cent on Thursday.Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, said the holiday sales figures would revive questions over whether the US has more stores than it needs in a fragile economy.“You have to add that many people who shop at the promotional stores also shop on the internet, where sales were abounding from the 1st to the 31st of December,” he said.Just before Christmas, research group ComScore said ecommerce spending was up 16 per cent from a year ago in November and December.Barnes & Noble, the bookseller that is facing a bigger threat from digital commerce than most, reported a 10.9 per cent fall in sales at its stores and on its website in the nine-week holiday period to the end of December.Last week Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, spent $89.5m to buy a 5 per cent stake in Nook Media, a joint venture between Barnes & Noble and Microsoft which runs the Nook ebook division.Target is the US’s second-biggest general retailer by sales after Walmart and analysts had expected it to report like-for-like sales growth of 1.5 per cent. Instead it reported flat sales after a fall in the number of shoppers was not offset by an increase in the average dollar spend.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret, reported a lower-than-expected 3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in December. Macy’s, a department store, reported like-for-like sales up 4.1 per cent as it announced the closure of six “underperforming” stores.Gap, which reported a 5 per cent rise in December sales, also announced that it was moving upmarket by paying $130m to buy Intermix, a women’s fashion boutique. Its 32 stores in North America give Gap a foothold in the luxury sector, where sales have generally been stronger than in mid-market fashion.December’s best performers included Costco, a warehouse club, where like-for-like sales rose 9 per cent from a year ago, and Nordstrom, a high-end department store where like-for-like sales were up 8.6 per cent – both ahead of expectations.
96;TGT;Target Corp;2012-11-26T21:58:52Z;Facebook defies Wall Street gloom;;Facebook shares jumped higher on Monday as the social networking site continued to win over investors on Wall Street who were once sceptical of the prospects for its mobile business.The gains came as the broader US equity market retreated in the week’s first trading session, after stocks last week had their best weekly gain since June.The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 1,406.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.3 per cent lower to 12,967.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3 per cent to 2,976.78.Facebook rose 8.1 per cent to $25.94 as analysts at Bernstein Research said the market was underestimating the company’s potential revenue growth for the next two years, which would be driven by its mobile business.Carlos Kirjner, analyst at Bernstein, raised his price target for the company’s shares to $33 and changed his rating to “buy” from “hold”.Mr Kirjner highlighted innovations and changes by the company to adapt the site to mobile devices as a source of strength for its future revenues.One of the big concerns for investors has been the company’s ability to increase sales through advertising on mobile devices as users shift away from personal computers.Shares in Facebook have dropped some 31.7 per cent since their public float in May but have recovered in recent weeks since reaching their all-time low of $17.73 in September.Wall Street stocks fell throughout the morning session on Monday as retailers pared their gains from last week.Despite reports highlighting a strong start to the holiday selling period, the S&P 500 retailing index – up 4.7 per cent last week – retreated 0.2 per cent.A report at the weekend said online sales rose more than 20 per cent with the start of the Christmas shopping season.But the news was not enough to boost shares in some of the country’s largest retailers. Walmart lost 0.4 per cent to $69.91, and Target fell 2.6 per cent to $62.78.Amazon rose 1.6 per cent to $243.79 as the online retailer said it would issue its first bond in more than a decade. The company’s website was the most visited online retail site during Black Friday, according to reports.Abercrombie & Fitch rose 0.5 per cent to $44.60 as analysts said the teenage clothing retailer was one of the biggest beneficiaries from the start to holiday shopping last Friday.“Traffic is off to a strong start this holiday season and after a year of many challenges, we believe they have turned a corner,” said Paul Lejuez, analyst at Nomura. “[Abercrombie] stores were among the most crowded in the mall on Black Friday.”Meanwhile, investors continued to assess the likelihood that politicians in Washington would resolve the fiscal cliff of tax cuts and spending rises.David Bianco, equity market strategist at Deutsche Bank, said: “The S&P should rally as it becomes clear that the fiscal cliff will be averted and US GDP growth will stay positive in the first half of next year.”Apple shares continued to march higher after falling to a multi-month low earlier in November. The iPhone and iPad maker moved 3.2 per cent higher to $589.53.Citigroup launched coverage of the company at the weekend and assigned three analysts to cover Apple, which ranks as the largest company in the world by market value.The analysts said one of the primary challenges that the company faced in its next few quarters was from low-end smartphone makers.The S&P 500 financial sector index lost 0.5 per cent as a Financial Times report said global banking regulators were looking to force banks to hold more capital following several high-profile scandals.JPMorgan Chase, hit by more than $6bn in losses through a massive credit derivatives position earlier this year, fell 0.5 per cent to $40.88.Other bulge-bracket Wall Street banks also declined.

97;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Online sales soar on Black Friday;;Online sales jumped more than 20 per cent in the US at the traditional start of the Christmas shopping season as the growing use of tablet computers fuelled “couch commerce”.Black Friday internet sales climbed 26 per cent on a year ago, to $1bn, according to ComScore, while IBM, using a different methodology, recorded a 21 per cent increase.The figures came as the US retail federation reported stronger sales across all forms of retail than many analysts had expected, suggesting that improvements in the job and stock markets could be boosting spending.The most visited retail site on Friday was Amazon, the dominant internet-only retailer, but next in the top five were the websites of three bricks-and-mortar stores – Walmart, Best Buy and Target – followed by Apple, according to ComScore.Black Friday is the busiest shopping day of the year but Capital Economics research has shown it is not a reliable indicator of total holiday season spending, which can account for 20-40 per cent of retailers’ annual sales.The ease of shopping on tablet computers encouraged more so-called “couch commerce”, with purchases on mobile devices accounting for 16 per cent of all online transactions and iPads alone making up 10 per cent, IBM said.But although more people took to the internet, the average spend per person fell 4.7 per cent to $181 and the average number of purchases fell 12 per cent to 5.6, according to IBM.The National Retail Federation said total retail sales rose 13 per cent from last year to $59bn over the four days from Thanksgiving to Sunday.Although the 139m people who shopped were 8m more than last year, they were fewer than the NRF’s forecast of 147m.After the Thanksgiving weekend, US retailers typically offer a blizzard of online discounts on what has come to be known as Cyber Monday, but its relevance has been diluted by the decision of many to start unveiling deals last week. Amazon began last Monday.To counter the trend of consumers shopping online during Thanksgiving on Thursday, several retailers – including Walmart and Target – opened their stores earlier than ever with big discounts on Thursday night.Order Barney Jopson’s startling account of the hidden influence and boundless ambition of Amazon, overlord of a mini-economy that goes well beyond online shoppersThe decision to open early pulled shopping trips forward, resulting in sales at bricks-and-mortar stores on Black Friday falling 1.8 per cent from a year ago to $11.2bn, according to separate estimates from ShopperTrak – the first drop since 2008.But consistent with the NRF, Bill Martin, ShopperTrak’s founder, said that sales on Thursday and Friday combined would exceed last year’s figure, although specific data for Thursday were not yet available.“You really saw savvy shopping,” said Jay Henderson, strategy director at IBM’s Smarter Commerce division, noting that consumers had scoured carefully for the best discounts.He said bricks-and-mortar retailers were “working hard to combine what they do in-store with what they do online”.Walmart, which is trying to stop losing business to Amazon, offered early access to discounts for consumers who downloaded its mobile app, liked it on Facebook or signed up for email alerts.
98;TGT;Target Corp;2012-11-12T18:56:52Z;Wall St struggles to move on from slump;;Independent oil production and services companies rose on Monday after a report by the leading global energy forecasting agency said the US would become the world’s biggest oil producer by 2017.The gains came as the International Energy Agency said in its latest global outlook that US oil production was expected to surpass that of Saudi Arabia and Russia in the next five years.Nabors Industries was among the leading risers in the sector group as the oil and gas land drilling contractor that operates in the US and Canada climbed 2.6 per cent to $13.47.Marathon Petroleum gained 1.4 per cent to $53.88 and oilfield services equipment marker National Oilwell Varco moved 2.6 per cent higher to $70.79.Energy sector stocks on the benchmark S&P 500 saw muted gains on the day and were up 0.1 per cent.The day began with US equities trading higher before a midday slump as Wall Street looked to move on from a post-election decline that sent stocks to their lowest level in three months last week.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed fractionally higher to 1,380.00 as the week’s first trading session was met with lower volumes as the US bond market was closed for a national holiday.The benchmark fell 2.4 per cent last week as fears of political gridlock in Washington gripped investors following the outcome of the US elections.The Nasdaq Composite index was slightly lower to 2,904.26 as the tech-heavy benchmark looked to shake off five consecutive weeks of losses.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat and finished at 12,815.16.Investors continued to gauge the chances that the US would find a compromise to avoid the fiscal cliff of tax rises and spending cuts that could push the sluggish economy back into a recession.“We still believe that the fiscal cliff will be averted with compromise legislation, but President Obama’s re-election and a larger Democrat majority in the Senate raise the likely amount of tax hikes versus spending cuts in the new legislation,” said David Bianco, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Bank, as he urged clients to buy shares after the recent dip in stocks.Others expressed more doubt. Barry Knapp, chief equity strategist at Barclays, said: “With a polarised federal government, we do not see an increased probability of avoiding the tax cliff, brinkmanship over the debt ceiling or enacting pro-growth tax and entitlement reform in 2013.”Shares in Jefferies jumped 14 per cent to $16.27 after US financial holding group Leucadia National said it would buy the midsized US investment bank in a deal that valued it at $3.6bn. Leucadia shares fell 3 per cent to $21.14.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year and comes a week after Stifel Financial, a rival investment bank to Jefferies, said it would buy boutique financial specialist KBW for $575m. Shares in Stifel gained 0.2 per cent to $30.37.Apple shares were 0.7 per cent lower at $542.83 as the iPad and iPhone maker tried to recover after falling into bear territory, down more than 20 per cent in recent weeks. The S&P 500 information technology sector lost 0.4 per cent.Retailer Target Corp fell 0.1 per cent to $61.98 as it followed Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by revenues, in saying that it would open its Black Friday discounting sales earlier than normal this year. Walmart shares rose 0.2 per cent to $72.48.JC Penney dropped 12.9 per cent to $17.97 as the US department store chain continued to struggle after it posted disappointing quarterly results last week.In a report released yesterday, analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said JC Penney was the second-most heavily shorted company on the S&P 500. More than 40 per cent of the company’s publicly traded equity is held by investors who are betting on a decline in its share the price, the analysts said.Ebay shares were 0.5 per cent lower at $47.47 as the online marketplace company said it would partner with Xiu.com, a Chinese online fashion and luxury retailer, to launch a local shopping website in China.New York Times lost 2.5 per cent to $8.20 as its new chief executive, Mark Thompson, took up his post at the newspaper publishing company amid ongoing controversy at the BBC, where he was former director-general.
99;TGT;Target Corp;2012-11-04T18:32:35Z;Li & Fung – mystery shopper;Sourcing group has become addicted to deals;It is easy to get addicted to deals: buying growth can produce spectacular numbers. The problem comes when investors enable the habit, making it that much harder to break. Exhibit A: Li & Fung, the sourcing group whose clients include Target and Walmart. Its shares perked up last week in expectation that the $500m it raised in bonds will go on yet more deals.Bought-in businesses are hard for outsiders to understand and more of them only make it even tougher. Hence the sharp fall in Li & Fung’s shares in August, when its first-half numbers undershot expectations. In the past four years, the company has spent $5bn on 33 deals. But what exactly they have contributed is not clear. Take the four deals so far this year. Had they all been included as of January 1, net profits would have been lower in spite of their 7 per cent net margin – twice the level the group itself managed.Shareholders are not giving the company carte blanche, at least. Since August, Li & Fung’s shares have traded on a forward price-earnings multiple of about 19 times – well below the 25 times average they had commanded for the previous seven years. Yet investors’ apparent approval of last week’s hybrid – which is debt that looks like equity to rating agencies – will only allow more deals.There are reasons to expect earnings will improve. Raw material costs have eased and US quantitative easing will have helped fund Li & Fung’s clients. But investors should ask more about the deals that have been done.Look at operating margins on purchases since 2011. These offer margins at least three times Li & Fung’s own levels. In such a shoestring industry, that is eye-catching. Knowing more about the expected effect of these fat-margined businesses on their parent would be a start if investors are to really understand what they are buying.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
100;TGT;Target Corp;2012-11-01T22:59:27Z;Sandy set to distort US spending;;Hurricane Sandy’s impact is likely to distort spending patterns on the US east coast as the end-of-year shopping season begins, analysts said, while retailers reported better than forecast October sales growth.With damage assessment continuing and clean-up work beginning slowly, Tom Clarke, a director in the retail practice at AlixPartners, said some households would probably end up spending less on luxuries ahead of Christmas.“You’ll see a shift in spending. Folks will take discretionary income and funnel it to rebuilding and re-establishing the basics, and away from fashion and accessory items, more whimsical purchases,” he said.Home Depot and Lowe’s, two home improvement retailers that consumers will turn to for building materials and white goods, had positioned supplies in advance of the storm so they could quickly replenish stores along its path.November is a crucial month for retailers with the biggest shopping day, Black Friday, coming on the day after Thanksgiving.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, a research group, said storm disruption was likely to reduce national retail sales growth in November by 1 to 2 percentage points.However, retailers that reported monthly sales figures for October Thursday made scant reference to the storm.Like-for-like sales excluding drug stores rose 4.7 per cent from the same month last year, according to Thomson Reuters, better than the consensus forecast of a 4.3 per cent rise.Although sales at Target, the mass market discounter, fell short of expectations, the numbers overall continued a pattern of strong consumer spending that has defied persistent economic uncertainty.“The expectation was that many retailers were going to come out and use the storm as an excuse to clear the decks in terms of [sales] expectations and nobody did that,” said Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors. “I think most retailers don’t know the true impact of the storm yet.”Some retailers are likely to be left with some excess holiday inventory, which could result in price markdowns that are good for shoppers but bad for profitability.However, Macy’s, which reopened its Manhattan flagship store on Wednesday, raised its forecast for sales growth in the second half of 2012 Thursday to about 4 per cent from 3.7 per cent.But he added: “The plans for supporting holiday [sales] were far enough along. Most folks are not waiting for a lot of merchandise to still get here from overseas.”
101;TGT;Target Corp;2012-10-17T21:47:13Z;Mobile fuels 10% jump in eBay users;;Ebay reached a milestone in its turnround efforts by notching up double-digit user growth and matching analysts’ estimates for the third quarter.Ebay’s Marketplaces business – which has lagged behind the growth of PayPal, the group’s payments arm – increased users by 10 per cent following the rise of mobile devices used for shopping, the penetration of emerging markets and a website redesign.John Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, said he expected that the growth of new users would translate into more items being sold on the site. “New buyers are turning into more frequent buyers,” he said.The internet retailer reported overall revenues of $3.4bn, a 15 per cent increase over the same quarter last year, and earnings per share of 55 cents on the pro forma basis by which Wall Street measures the company, a 14 per cent increase. Analysts were anticipating $3.41bn in revenues and earnings per share of 54 cents.Ebay is betting largely on technology advances to improve the shopping experience on its site and to forge partnerships with large traditional retailers such as Toys R Us, Macy’s, and Target, which work with eBay to reach customers online through website developments, payment options and mobile offerings.The company is increasingly staking its claim as an intermediary between bricks-and-mortar stores and online commerce.“We’re focused on being a partner, not a competitor to retailers of all sizes,” Mr Donahoe said, drawing a distinction between eBay and its competitor, Amazon, which has been criticised for having business interests in conflict with merchants who use the site.PayPal again was a driving force of growth for eBay, with $1.37bn in revenues, a 23 per cent rise from the same quarter last year. Executives hinted that there was some truth to recent rumours that there would be lay-offs at PayPal, but would not specify a number. Mr Donahoe emphasised that any reductions would be the result of streamlining nine product organisations into one. “This is not a case where we’re trying to pursue cost saving measures,” he said.Bob Swan, eBay’s chief financial officer, said the company had raised its forecasts for the full year, despite expecting an “OK holiday season” in the fourth quarter. It anticipates revenues between $13.9bn and $14.1bn for 2012 and earnings per share between $2.32 and $2.35.Next year, Mr Donahoe said the company would focus more on strengthening relationships with retailers and develop a series of new consumer-oriented mobile features that shoppers could use while in a physical retail store.“2013 will be a year of test and learn with consumer experiences,” Mr Donahoe said. “We’re trying to not succumb to a press release-a-week or some fancy flash and sizzle, but build a strong business.”The shares traded down 0.4 per cent in after-hours trading to $48.
102;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target to match online rivals’ holiday prices;Retailer steps-up campaign to thwart Amazon;Target is launching a price-matching service over the critical pre-Thanksgiving and Christmas retailing season in a bid to compete better with online rivals such as Amazonwhich are eroding its sales revenues with cheaper offers.The discounter, which sells stylish clothes under the same roof as toothpaste and cereal, will match prices from Amazon.com, and the websites of Walmart, Best Buy, Toys R Us and Babies R Us between November 1 and December 16.Target has been exploring ways to buoy sales against the backdrop of intense competition from online retailers and an uncertain economic climate that is keeping many low-income shoppers away from its stores.The nation’s second-largest retailer by sales behind Walmart relies heavily on the holiday season when retailers can make up to 40 per cent of their annual revenue during the two-month period.Best Buy announced earlier this week it would match the prices of online retailers – though not on the biggest trading days such as Black Friday. Alternatively, Toys R Us has said it will match competitors’ prices at their stores but not rival online offers.Gregg Steinhafel, the chief executive, told reporters on Tuesday that Target’s strategy for the holiday season was going to be “highly promotional and intensely competitive”.Matt Nemer, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo, questioned how successful Target’s price matching strategy would be. “There are two issues with this. Amazon’s prices are more competitive particularly in key traffic driving holiday categories such as consumer electronics. Also, Amazon’s prices move a lot, so how do you keep track?”In January, Target sent a letter to its vendors asking them for help in discouraging “showrooming” – when shoppers browse bricks-and-mortar stores to research products which are then bought online from competitors such as Amazon. For several years, Amazon ran Target’s ecommerce arm but the retailer decided to take back control last autumn as part of its effort to revive its brand online.In May, the company announced it would stop selling Amazon’s Kindle brand of ereaders and tablets in response to growing competition from the online vendor.To draw in more customers to its stores the company has also added fresh food and drugs to its trademark assortment of stylish clothes and household items, opened smaller urban outlets and offered discount programmes and free delivery services for customers who use Target’s credit, debit or Visa cards.The Minneapolis-based group reported net income of $704m – or $1.06 per share – in the three months to the end of July.Target said it would offer an additional week through to December 24 on its price-matching policy for any lower prices found on its own website, which can differ from in-store prices, and in print advertisements of other retailers.Mr Steinhafel said he was “confident” Target would meet its 2012 financial goals, even as consumer sentiment and demand for goods, while recovering, were still far from pre-recession highs. Uncertain job and salary prospects for many Americans combined with economic concerns both at home and abroad are keeping many shoppers away.Target shares rose 1.8 per cent to $62.90.
103;TGT;Target Corp;2012-10-04T17:57:56Z;US retail sales growth slows;;US retail sales growth slowed in September but was in line with expectations against the backdrop of uncertainty over the economic recovery and the presidential election, writes Barney Jopson in New York.Like-for-like sales rose 3.6 per cent from a year ago in September at 17 retailers that report monthly figures, according to Thomson Reuters, after a 6.1 per cent rise in sales during back to school shopping in August.“It’s not hot, it’s not not, it’s just ‘meh’,” said Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, as economic data continues to send mixed signals to consumers. Gap, Costco and the TJX Companies narrowly beat expectations with gains in like-for-like sales of 6 per cent each. Department stores had a relatively weak month as Nordstrom and Macy’s posted smaller gains that fell slightly short of expectations. At Kohl’s, another department store, sales fell 2.7 per cent.The figures indicated the sector was on course for a “decent” but not spectacular end-of-year shopping season, Ms Kahn said, but she added that the impact of the November 6 presidential election was a wild card.“From a consumer point of view you may have very strong expectations and if your candidate wins maybe you’ll be jubilant and it’ll be reflected in higher shopping,” she said. “If your candidate loses maybe you’ll think the country will go into a tailspin and you’ll be pessimistic.”Joel Bines, a consultant at AlixPartners, said retailers were likely to start their end of year marketing blitz later than normal because of the election and the associated heavy spending on political advertising. “With media prices being what they are and the general distraction of the nation, retailers are being prudent about their marketing dollars. They’re saying ‘Let’s just wait till November 7’,” he said.Discounts and promotions are expected to be abundant this year as retailers battle for market share, promising a concentrated blizzard of activity. Mr Bines said consumers had held back in September after a splurge of back-to-school spending.Target, a mass market discounter, posted a 2.1 per cent gain in sales. Rises in house prices and the stock market are lifting consumer sentiment, as is the Federal Reserve’s attempt to stimulate the economy by loosening monetary policy.On the negative side are higher gas prices and worries about the jobs market, the US budget deficit and eurozone crisis.
104;TGT;Target Corp;2012-09-20T21:58:43Z;Walmart to stop selling Amazon’s Kindle;;Walmart is to stop selling Amazon’s Kindle tablets and ereaders in the latest move by a bricks-and-mortar retailer to cut links with the online behemoth threatening traditional chains.The decision by the world’s biggest retailer by revenue follows Amazon’s launch of an upgraded Kindle Fire HD tablet, designed to compete with Apple’s iPad in the crucial end-of-year shopping season.The animosity of traditional retailers towards Amazon has become increasingly evident over issues ranging from a lack of sales tax on online purchases to consumers using bricks-and-mortar stores as Amazon “showrooms”.Walmart, which is facing growing competition from Amazon and trying to expand its own online sales, will continue to sell iPads as well as tablets from Google, Samsung and Sony.The retailer said in a statement that it had “made a business decision to not carry current Amazon products beyond our purchase commitments and existing inventory”.It said: “Our customers trust us to provide a broad assortment of products at everyday low prices, and we approach every merchandising decision through this lens.”The Kindle Fire has intensified the threat Amazon poses to Walmart – in categories from cleaning products to furniture – because the online retailer has developed it as a quicker and easier route for customers to buy other products from its site.Sarah Rotman Epps of Forrester Research said Walmart was an important distribution channel for all electronics manufacturers, but predicted that its decision to stop selling Amazon products would have a “negligible” effect on Kindle sales because Amazon had many other alternatives, including its own website.“From a financial standpoint, Walmart’s decision is not hurting Amazon,” she said. “But, from a competitive stand point, it is certainly aggressive and may provoke retaliation.”In May, Target, a bricks-and-mortar rival of Walmart and Amazon, said it would stop selling Kindle products. In February, Barnes & Noble, the book seller and maker of rival devices, said it would stop selling printed books published by Amazon.Best Buy, the electronics chain facing tough competition from Amazon, continues to sell Kindles.Amazon began shipping a new 7-inch, $199 model of the Fire HD in the US on September 14. Larger versions priced at $299 and $499 will begin shipping in November. Walmart said it had not placed any orders for the Fire HD.Amazon courted controversy with customers by displaying advertisements on its new Kindle Fire, which enabled it to lower the tablet’s price. After an online backlash, it said it would let consumers pay $15 more to opt out of the advertisements.Walmart executives tend to bristle at the description of Amazon as “the Walmart of the web”, but a string of Walmart efforts to compete in ecommerce have had only limited success.
105;TGT;Target Corp;2012-08-15T13:26:04Z;Target boosted by urban stores;;Target championed the performance of its new compact stores as the US discount retailer reported better than expected profits for the past quarter and raised its earnings guidance for the year.The Minneapolis-based group reported net income of $704m – or $1.06 per share – in the three months to the end of July, beating Wall Street estimates. It said it expected to report a full-year earnings per share between $4.20 and $4.40.Target has been adding food and drugs to its trademark assortment of stylish clothes and housewares. Its sales, already pre-announced, were up 3.5 per cent to $16.45bn in the quarter even against a backdrop of fragile consumer sentiment.Its earnings were boosted by a lower than expected tax rate.Gregg Steinhafel, Target chief executive, said he was “very pleased” with the response to its first three compact CityTarget stores, which are aimed at the growing number of US consumers who want convenient shopping options closer to home instead of drive-to big box stores. The stores are in Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago.Mr Steinhafel said: “We look forward to serving guests in these dense urban areas with an exciting store format and uniquely tailored assortment.”Target plans to open its first stores in Canada next year and its investments in space in new markets continue to weigh on profitability.Its shares closed up 1.7 per cent to $64.50 in New York.Elsewhere Abercrombie & Fitch, the struggling youth fashion chain, saw its shares jump nearly 9 per cent after reporting profits that were slightly less dismal than analysts had expected.Mike Jeffries, chief executive, nonetheless said: “The second-quarter results we are reporting today are disappointing and below our expectations coming into the quarter.”The retailer posted a net profit of $15.5m – or 19 cents per share – which was one cent per share ahead of expectations but still less than half of the $32m it posted in the same period last year.Analysts said the Abercrombie brand – associated with the scantily clad staff and booming dance music of its stores – is losing its lustre, a trend made worse by weakness in the global economy.The company had already announced weak revenue figures, with its like-for-like sales falling 10 per cent year-on-year in the quarter, including the first drop in US sales since 2009.Shares in Staples, the stationery retailer, closed down 14.6 per cent to $11.49 in New York after reporting worse than expected profits and falling sales due to weakness in both its North American and international businesses.
106;TGT;Target Corp;2012-07-05T15:24:52Z;US retailers hit by slower spending;;US shoppers spent in a less robust fashion in June, as uncertainty over economic growth and falling consumer confidence took a toll on some of the country’s largest retail chains.Total sales at stores open for at least a year rose just 0.3 per cent last month, according to Retail Metrics, the research group. Sales were less than the 1 per cent forecast, and below the 7.2 per cent gain made in June 2011.“Retailers found a difficult 7.2 per cent year-over-year comparison and navigating a deteriorating economic backdrop just too much to overcome,” said Ken Perkins, president at Retail Metrics.A slowdown in China, Europe’s debt crisis, a looming fiscal cliff in the US, high federal debt levels and flagging employment gains are contributing to a tough summer for retailers, he said.Analysts said June lacked any real selling catalysts and purchases made earlier than usual this year because of the unseasonably warm winter were also a drag on sales.Macy’s reported worse than expected sales, up just 1.2 per cent in June from the same month a year ago as a result of an economic environment that Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said was “stagnant at best”. Analysts surveyed by Retail Metrics had expected a 2.3 per cent rise.The operator of the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s department stores also cited less spending by tourists in leading cities such as New York.Sales at Target, the discount chain, rose 2.1 per cent, falling short of analysts’ projection for a 2.8 per cent gain.The individual department, chain, discount and apparel stores that report monthly sales figures represent roughly 10 per cent of total US retail sales and are an indicator of consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy.Retailers tabulate sales at locations open at least a year, a key indicator of a retailer’s growth as they exclude new and closed stores.Costco, the wholesale store which sells everything from potato chips to outdoor plants, posted a 3 per cent rise in same-store sales in June. The company missed analysts’ forecasts for the fourth time in a row, as a strong dollar hurt the value of its sales overseas.Sales at TJX, which owns the discount stores TJ Maxx and Marshalls, rose 7 per cent, beating estimates of 3.7 per cent.Same-store sales at Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret, gained 7 per cent, better than forecasts of 2.6 per cent.Saks, the luxury retail chain, said same-store sales rose 6 per cent in June, crediting strong demand for women’s shoes and men’s tailored clothing. Analysts had expected a 4.2 per cent rise.
107;TGT;Target Corp;2012-05-16T13:54:25Z;Target sales increase beats expectations;;Target posted better-than-expected earnings for the first three months of 2012, even as plans for its Canada expansion took a toll on the US discount retailer’s results.America’s second-largest retailer by sales after Walmart posted first-quarter net income of $697m or $1.04 a share, compared with $689m or $0.99 a share in the same period last year.The Minneapolis-based company, which has more than 1,700 stores across the US, plans to open its first Canadian outlets in 2013. After stripping out items such as these expansion costs, earnings totalled $1.11 a share.Shares in Target, which sells stylish clothes under the same roof as toothpaste and cereal, rose 0.4 per cent in early Wednesday trading to $55.32.Total revenues grew 5.9 per cent to $16.87bn from $15.94bn in the same period last year, beating analysts’ expectations of $16.83bn.Gregg Steinhafel, Target chief executive, said: “While our outlook for the remainder of 2012 reflects continued economic uncertainty, we are confident in our strategy, keenly focused on delivering an affordable and inspirational merchandise assortment …and committed to making thoughtful investments in our US and Canadian business segments.”As announced earlier this month, sales in the first quarter rose 6.1 per cent to $16.5bn from $15.6bn last year. This was due to a 5.3 per cent increase in comparable-store sales and the contribution from new stores, thanks to warm weather and the early Easter holiday.Sales slowed in April, however, against a backdrop of renewed uncertainty surrounding US growth and employment prospects. Target, like its rivals, is still contending with a slow economic recovery at home that has left many of its lower-income shoppers wary.While the retailer hopes that a fall in petrol prices will increase their customers’ spending ability, it is managing inventories tightly in preparation for a possible further retraction in sentiment.First-quarter online sales for the company increased at a slower rate than in-store sales, but the company said it was strengthening its web platform in order to better improve its longer-term sales outlook. Earlier this month Target said it would stop selling Amazon’s Kindle brand of ereaders and tablets by early summer in response to growing competition from the online vendor.Nearly 12 per cent of sales in Target stores were paid for with the company’s branded debit and credit cards, which offer a 5 per cent discount and free online shipping. Penetration has jumped from a year ago when only 7.6 per cent of purchases were made with the cards. But net credit revenues declined 7 per cent in the quarter compared with last year.“This is partly fuelled by the recession. It has also to do with Target getting rid of their co-branded Visa card which you could use at other stores. Now it is just a store card. Also, more people are using debit rather than credit cards and more people are paying off their balances, meaning that the interest rate payments to the company are less,” said Joseph Feldman, retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.In spite of the company saying it expected “a slow and uneven economic recovery” for the full-year 2012, Target raised its outlook for the year by 5 cents and said it expected earnings per share of $4.10 to $4.30 a share, when taking into account costs linked to its entry into Canada.
108;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US retail spending slows in April;;US shoppers cooled their spending in April as they faced a softer economy and seasonal challenges, according to monthly sales figures from some of the country’s largest retail chains.Total sales at stores open for at least a year rose just 0.8 per cent last month, according to Retail Metrics, a research group. That was below the expected 1.5 per cent forecast increase and compared with an 8.7 per cent surge in April last year.Last month retailers faced headwinds, including an earlier Easter and unseasonably warm weather in February and March, which brought sales forward, as well as a weaker economic environment, highlighted by a rise in unemployment insurance claims and slow private sector job growth.“All of this was just too much to overcome for retailers as softness was evenly distributed across the retail landscape,” said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.Some analysts had hoped the momentum from March’s 3.9 per cent sales rise would carry over into April.“April put March into perspective,” said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the Pennsylvania university’s Wharton School. “People bought their spring clothes, but they bought them in March instead of in April. It was just regular, slow, solid progression.”Same-store sales at the discounter Target rose 1.1 per cent, less than half the 2.9 per cent expected. Costco, the membership warehouse club, reported a 4 per cent gain compared with an estimated 5.4 per cent rise.Target “received an early season boost from the combination of warm weather and an earlier Easter”, said Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of the chain.Sales were weaker than forecast at middle-market chains, including Macy’s, the department store, where sales rose 1.2 per cent, below the 1.9 per cent forecast. The company said it had expected April’s figures to fall from March – when they rose 7.3 per cent – because of the combination of an early Easter and late Mothering Sunday.At Saks, the high-end department store, sales were up just 2 per cent compared with estimates of 5.6 per cent. Among the few department stores to report a gain was Nordstrom, where sales rose 7.1 per cent, above forecasts.The apparel retailer Gap reported a steeper than forecast 2 per cent drop as lower sales at its Old Navy stores offset increases at Gap and Banana Republic.But other clothing chains reported strong gains. American Eagle Outfitters, the teen-focused retailer, on Wednesday raised its first-quarter earnings outlook after comparable sales in the first three months of the year jumped 17 per cent.“We experienced broad-based strength in our spring merchandise selling, which enabled us to pull back on full-scale promotional plans,” said Robert Hanson, chief executive.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Henri Bendel, also boosted its profit guidance after it reported April sales climbed 6 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent.TJX, the brand-name discounter, said its sales rose 7 per cent, twice the forecast gain.
109;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target to stop selling Amazon Kindle;Retailer antagonism grows against online rival;Target, the US mass market discounter, will stop selling Amazon’s Kindle brand of ereaders and tablets in response to growing competition from the online vendor.The retailer said that it would “phase out all Amazon and Kindle branded products by the end of this month” as part of a “continuing evaluation into its product selection”, after stocking the devices for two years.Target’s move, communicated to stores last week, underlines growing antagonism between Amazon and brick and mortar retailers, which are threatened by the online retailer’s aggressive discounting, entry into new merchandise categories and attractive shipping service.The decision will affect Amazon’s new Kindle Fire tablet, its range of Kindle ereaders and all accessories for the devices, including covers and chargers. Target will continue to sell other ereaders and tablets, such as the Nook from Barnes & Noble and Apple’s iPad.The change of strategy by Target comes after the retailer reported last November that Amazon’s Kindle was the best-selling tablet in its stores on the day after the Thanksgiving holiday, typically the busiest shopping day of the year.For several years, Amazon ran Target’s ecommerce arm but the retailer decided to take back control last autumn as part of its effort revive its brand online. As part of this strategy, the company has struck new retail partnerships and in January it said it would rollout special displays of Apple products, including the iPad, which competes with the Kindle Fire tablet.Target has in the past complained about the practice of “showrooming”, a growing habit by shoppers to view a product in-store then buy it from an online seller.Amazon came under fire in December from traditional retailers after it offered shoppers discounts if they used their smartphones to scan product labels at retail stores to compare prices with those on its own site.Retailers also complain that Amazon enjoys an unfair price advantage because it is not required to collect sales tax from customers in many US states.Joseph Feldman, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said that Target’s decision may have been influenced by Apple. Target declined to comment, saying it did not discuss its vendor negotiations publicly. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.Tensions between Amazon and another traditional retailer, Barnes & Noble, were laid bare earlier this year when the book seller said it would refuse to stock print titles from Amazon’s nascent publishing arm.Shares in both Target and Amazon held steady on Wednesday at $57.98 and $230.25 respectively.
110;TGT;Target Corp;2012-04-06T18:36:52Z;Brighter US economy raises stores’ spirits;;Bright colours, bright weather and a brightening economic picture delivered strong sales growth for ÛS retailers in their latest monthly reports.Sales were up 3.9 per cent in March at the 20 or so stores that report monthly figures, beating forecasts for the fourth consecutive month, according to Retail MetricsThe lift, which including robust growth at Gap, Target, Macy’s and the discounter TJX, came partly due to the confluence of unseasonably warm weather and cheery fashions that clicked with shoppers.“Walking into the typical mall is like walking into a tulip garden,” said Joel Bines, a retail analyst at AlixPartners. “There is so much colour and freshness that it is really remarkable.”Also boosting the cash registers was an improving US economy and rising consumer confidence, which has so far not been dented significantly by rising gas prices.But weaker-than-expected numbers on US job creation released on Friday tempered economic optimism and the early spring spending of February and March mean consumers are likely to splash out less in April.In a reminder of the restructuring still needed in a flabby sector, JC Penney, the department store led by Apple’s former head of retail, said on Thursday that it would lay off 600 of its headquarters staff, about 14 per cent of the total there.At Gap, a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in North America followed a smaller gain last month that ended a run of seven consecutive declines.
111;TGT;Target Corp;2012-04-05T13:40:15Z;Upbeat consumers boost US retailers;;An improving jobs market and unusually warm weather helped to lift US retail sales in March by nearly 4 per cent, beating Wall Street expectations and continuing a run of positive months.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.9 per cent at the 20 or so at the retailers that report monthly figures, according to Retail Metrics, revealing little evidence of higher petrol prices crimping spending.“In general, there was real strength across the retail sector, across all parts of the value chain from luxury down to deep discounters,” said Joel Bines, a retail analyst at AlixPartners.Warm weather encouraged people to continue early spring clothes shopping, a trend that began in February.“Those [retailers] who missed [expectations] missed because of product and price, not because the consumer was not out shopping,” said Mr Bines.Gap, the clothes retailer, reported a second consecutive month of rising sales: at Gap-branded stores in North America they were up 9 per cent following a 1 per cent gain in February, when it started selling clothes from a new creative team.At TJX and Ross Stores, two leading discounters of clothes and household wares, sales rose 10 per cent from a year ago.At Target, the mass-market discounter, sales rose 7.3 per cent and Macy’s, a department store, also reported a 7.3 per cent increase.Mr Bines said clothes retailers could also claim credit for rolling out an attractive set of spring fashions.“Walking into the typical mall is like walking into a tulip garden. There is so much colour and freshness that it is really remarkable. It’s really resonating with the consumer,” he said.
112;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
113;TGT;Target Corp;2012-04-04T19:14:07Z;Newspapers collaborate to counter US decline;;US newspaper companies are fighting back against a narrative of declining print advertising, falling circulation and shrinking newsrooms, with a message of increased industry collaboration, growing confidence in new digital business models and even occasional investment in new print products.At a Washington conference this week that brought together the Newspaper Association of America, the Associated Press and the American Society of Newspaper Editors, publishers said collaborations including NewsRight, an online rights clearance initiative, and Find n Save, a local deals site, were generating new revenues.“The time of doom and gloom for the industry is behind us, replaced by the time of innovation, experimentation and creativity,” Caroline Little, the NAA’s chief executive officer, told delegates.Dean Singleton, outgoing chairman of the Associated Press, urged the industry to unite to “take on common enemies” and “fight those who free ride on our content.”Much of the debate, however, focused on an upturn in publishers’ digital revenue expectations. “It’s been a tough three years, [but] I think people see a new horizon that offers real opportunities,” said Bob Dickey, head of Gannett’s community newspaper division.Gannett’s trials of digital subscriptions had been “ahead of expectations on all fronts”, and it would introduce the model to all 80 of its titles by September, he said. “We truly believe that it is what will stabilise our business as we move into 2013,” he added.Gannett’s research showed that consumers were willing to pay more for its content. Mr Dickey said: “Instead of them thinking what they pay for is the delivery of the content, we want them to think about [paying for] the content [itself]. This is not about someone throwing the newspaper on your doorstep.”Publishers that had started charging online had not suffered the loss of traffic many feared, said Mary Junck, chairman and chief executive of Lee Enterprises, while consumers’ adoption of tablets and smartphones had driven a 70 per cent jump in the industry’s mobile unique visitors.“The tablet has an environment where [consumers] are accustomed to buying apps,” noted Doug Franklin of Cox Media Group. Jim Maroney, chairman and chief executive of the Dallas Morning News, said tablet users were spending 28 minutes on average reading its replica editions, similar to the time they spent with the newspaper.The Dallas Morning News raised the price of print subscriptions in October, but offered readers 5 per cent off if they did not want digital access. About 70 per cent paid for digital access, Mr Maroney said: “That was another good sign that we’ve got a very engaged print subscriber who also wants to be engaged with our products digitally.”The meeting came as a Generator Research report estimated that newspapers in North America still face a decline in their total print and digital revenues, from $36.4bn in 2011 to $32bn in 2012, dragged down by a 23 per cent fall in print advertising and 15 per cent drop in print subscriptions. However, publishers expressed cautious confidence in print.”There’s a lot of life left in print,” Ms Junck said. “When you go to Walmart and Target and ask ‘what drives customers to your stores?’ they’re going to say the pre-printed insert in the Sunday newspaper.”Gannett’s Mr Dickey acknowledged that some print editions would shrink, and newspapers would cut national and international news to focus on local coverage where they could differentiate themselves. On Mondays and Tuesdays, when circulation is typically lowest, print editions could become specialised, focusing only on sport or business, he speculated.
114;TGT;Target Corp;2012-03-13T16:09:14Z;JC Penney enjoys taste of Apple magic;;"For a board that has recruited a chief executive to engineer a turnround, vindication normally comes when changes bear fruit and trigger a rally in the company’s share price.JC Penney, a US department store, skipped straight to the rally before any changes were made, simply by recruiting an electrifying candidate: Ron Johnson, the man who created the Apple stores.The retailer has been a sector laggard for several years, but news of Mr Johnson’s arrival in June 2011 – and his hiring of several former Apple colleagues – helped its shares to outperform its peer group before he had changed anything.Mr Johnson, who took over from Mike Ullman as chief executive in November, has admitted that when he said he had decided to join the department store countless people asked: “What were you thinking?”He recalled that Apple had been in a weak, unpromising state when he joined it in 2001 and said that at JC Penney he saw an “open opportunity” to transform the department store – a once great format that had become lost and tired – into “your favourite store”.Mr Johnson’s plan, which he began to implement on February 1, includes cutting prices, ending erratic discounts, bringing in new fashion ranges, making its stores less cluttered, and creating a gathering place at the heart of its stores called Town Square.He has persuaded several old Apple hands to join him: Laurie Beja Miller, who will manage Town Square; Dan Walker as chief talent officer; Mike Kramer as chief operating officer, and Kristen Blum as chief technology officer. Michael Francis, who joined as JC Penney’s new president, worked with Mr Johnson at Target in the 1990s.The prospect that the JC Penney group might be touched by Apple magic helped its shares rise 37 per cent between news of Mr Johnson’s appointment and the start of February. Over the same period its peers in the S&P consumer discretionary index climbed 10 per cent.Unfortunately for Mr Johnson, after the overhaul began he said February sales were “trending below last year” and analysts say JC Penney continued losing market share, notably to Macy’s, its arch-rival, and Target. But Mr Johnson says it is early days and investors seem to be keeping the faith."
115;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Hard times spell challenges for headhunters;;Back in early October, Target said goodbye to Michael Francis, its chief marketing officer. More than five months later, as the US discount chain tries to find an identity that combines the new grocery products it sells with its old touch for cheap chic, it has yet to say a public “hello” to his successor.Although Target’s sales are still relatively strong in a tough retail environment, it is not alone in struggling to make a smooth progression in executive appointments.“There is a succession issue in retail in the US and it’s pretty significant,” says Mary Saxon, a partner in the retail and consumer practice at Heidrick & Struggles. “There’s a great deal of external recruiting and a new emphasis on leadership.”Headhunters say that finding senior recruits for companies facing challenges is a different matter from identifying executive talent when times are good.Bertrand Richard, head of European board practice at Spencer Stuart, says that if the company has a chance of improving, it is not a problem to find suitable candidates, but simply that the right sort of person is different from those who would consider joining a healthier group.The sort of candidate intrigued by this role is, he says, “people who are interested in private equity-type deals”.According to Mr Richard: “Turnaround guys are much more interested in an assignment than in a career. They take the job for three to four years, sure that in one way or another they won’t be there in five years’ time: either they’ll be out or they’ll have turned the business around and quit.”By contrast, someone considering joining a multinational company in normal circumstances is more interested in the chance to climb to the top of the organisation, he says.Beyond the general talk about how companies seek leadership rather than management when times are hard, lie specific issues about the qualities sought in prospective recruits to a company in trouble.Simon Hayes, head of the financial services board practice at Odgers Berndtson, says that in difficult times, companies focus on resilience. “In a market where the stresses and strains have to be greater, the ability to cope with those pressures goes up the scale,” he says.Mr Hayes is clear that clients are looking for executives prepared to take difficult decisions. “It’s relatively easy to be Mr Nice Guy in good times but in tough times, when you have to go through the business with a red pen – well, not so many people enjoy that part of the job.”But the idea that difficulties require someone wielding a hatchet at the top of a company is challenged by Nigel Nicholson, professor of organisational behaviour at London Business School.“In difficult times, managers can be quite brutal. That is very counter-productive, as people won’t tell them the truth and people will find hiding places to keep themselves safe,” he says.Instead, he says that the time for new executives to challenge a company and take a forceful approach is when business is going well. That is when a company should seek executives “who can make sure people do not get too cosy or complacent”.Hard times, say headhunters, change the search process as well as the qualities businesses are looking for. Both candidates and companies carry out more due diligence and are more cautious.“Five years ago there was a view that it didn’t really matter where you went in terms of financial services – compensation outweighed corporate future,” says Mr Hayes. “Now you have to be a genius or a fortune-teller to see how markets will go and, more importantly, what prospective employers might look like.”Against the background of relatively high US unemployment, one would think everyone would like a call from a headhunter. But Ms Saxon says the reality is that “people are receptive to listening, but when it comes to making a commitment, the drop in home values and investment plans help create a heightened caution about making the right choice in terms of a move”.Increased thoughtfulness among candidates and companies should, in theory, produce better appointments than those made in good times when rising tides lift all boats. Mr Francis’s successor has not been named yet, but the recruitment environment should mean that he or she is worth the wait.
116;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Gap and Target post strong February sales;;US retailers recorded better than expected sales in February as positive economic news and warm weather prompted an early start to spring shopping.New fashion items at Gap helped generate its first sales growth in seven months as overall retail sales grew 6.5 per cent from a year ago among the 20 or so companies that report monthly figures.The gain was the biggest since June 2011, according to Retail Metrics. Sales at Target, the mass-market discounter, rose 7 per cent and Macy’s, the department store, posted a 4.6 per cent increase.Barbara Kahn, marketing professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, said the strong sales figures reflected higher consumer confidence and lower unemployment and indicated that growing concern over rising gas prices was not yet inhibiting spending.But she added that Gap’s fortunes were a reminder that: “Consumers have to want to shop, but there has to be something in the stores they want to buy too.”At stores open at least a year, sales of the Gap brand in North America rose 1 per cent in February, as it started selling clothes from a new creative team that is aiming to reverse Gap’s long decline into dowdiness.“Customers responded well to our spring product,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive. Last week Gap had reported a bleak Christmas.Keith Jelinek of AlixPartners, a consultancy, said warm temperatures had encouraged shoppers to start buying spring clothes and outdoor furniture: “Retailers always want to blame the weather, but the weather definitely helped because this time last year we had very serious storms that pushed people inside.”Another month of strong growth at stores that specialise in cut-price goods, with 9 per cent increases at both TJX and Ross Stores, suggested consumers remain cost-conscious.“They’re being very precise in what they want to buy. They’re not updating their whole wardrobe. They’re being wise with their spend,” Mr Jelinek said.Last week, Walmart, which does not report monthly sales, said US unemployment had not yet fallen to a level where financial pressure on its core low-income customers had visibly eased. On Thursday the retailer, the world’s biggest by sales, said it would raise its annual dividend 9 per cent to $1.59 per share.At Limited Brands, which owns the store chains Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Henri Bendel, sales rose 8 per cent in February.
117;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;JC Penney wobbles as it steps into new era;;JC Penney, the US department store group that reduced and simplified its pricing this month, said its sales so far were worse than last year, but the former Apple executive who is overhauling the company said other parts of his plan were working.Ron Johnson, who created Apple’s retail stores, became chief executive of the underperforming department store group last year. On February 1, he put into action a plan to woo shoppers by replacing its confusing array of discounts with permanently lower prices.In comments accompanying JC Penney’s earnings for the three months to January 28, when it recorded a $87m loss, Mr Johnson said on Friday, “February sales are trending below last year.”This was especially true on the days when one year ago JC Penney got a sales boost by offering extra discounts and coupons, Mr Johnson said, the kind of promotional marketing that he has now brought to an end.His appointment has highlighted the pressure on a number of retailers to reform in order to survive in an overcrowded US market where a fragile economy and the rise of ecommerce are making it hard to maintain market share.“As we said in January, sales would be an unknown in the early phase of executing our new strategy,” Mr Johnson said. “Regardless, we are confident that the benefits of our simplified business model will more than offset the sales decline so we can meet or exceed our 2012 earnings guidance.”Some analysts have expressed doubt over whether shoppers “trained” to hunt for bargains would take to JC Penney’s three unchanging price tiers: “everyday” prices, month-long discounts on seasonal items and ultra-low prices on clearance items for two days a month.The company’s quarterly loss came due to the costs associated with laying the foundations for its new pricing strategy and hiring new executives, including others from Apple and from Target, where Mr Johnson also worked in the 1990s.“While 2011 was a year of transition at JC Penney, 2012 will be a year of transformation,” Mr Johnson said.Citing improvements so far this month, Mr Johnson said customers were liking the stores’ new fashion ranges and praising its customer service, less cluttered stores and wider aisles.Sales at JC Penney’s US stores open at least a year fell 1.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, underlining the need for change.JC Penney shares fell 0.5 per cent on Friday to $41.72 while the market rose about 0.2 per cent. The stock has outperformed the market significantly since Mr Johnson joined as investors hope he can bless the chain with some Apple dazzle.In a bleaker position is Sears, a rival, which reported a 4.1 per cent fall in like-for-like sales for the quarter and a group net loss of $2.4bn.In a radical change of course, Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund manager who controls Sears Holdings, this week initiated a partial break up by spinning off a portion of its business valued at between $400m and $500m and selling 11 stores to raise up to $270m.Macy’s, the strongest US department store, this week reported like-for-like sales up 5.2 per cent in the fourth quarter.
118;TGT;Target Corp;2012-02-24T22:07:46Z;S&P 500 climbs to post-crisis peak;;The S&P 500 closed at a post-financial crisis high, as the 2012 rally in US equities moved up another leg.The benchmark US index gained 0.3 per cent over the week to close at 1,365.74, two points higher than its previous post-crisis peak last April. That was the best close for the index since June 2008.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly topped 13,000 for the first time since 2008, but ended the week at 12,982.95, for a weekly gain of 0.3 per cent.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,963.75, as Apple, which accounts for more than a tenth of the index, climbed 4 per cent to $522.41, just five dollars short of an all-time high. The world’s largest public company bowed to pressure from investors to give shareholders greater influence over the election of directors.Although all three major US indices are now at multi-year highs, investors were far from exuberant.Fund flow data continued to trend negative. Domestic equity funds suffered a second successive week of outflows, according to data from Lipper. Equity funds have seen net redemptions year to date, despite a rally that has now seen the S&P 500 climb 8.6 per cent.Investors of a statistical bent are focused on the transport sector of the Dow Jones, which has fallen 3.8 per cent in February, even as the broad index has climbed 2.2 per cent. Higher oil prices are weighing on the sector, but “Dow theory” suggests transport stocks are a leading indicator for the rest of the index, because they are the first to feel the effects of economic slowdown.“Sentiment is becoming more worrisome,” noted Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, who has advised clients to take profit.Tech stocks have been the driving force behind the rally in the S&P 500, significantly outperforming the broad index since last April. That trend continued this week, despite a poor performance by computer-markers.Dell shares fell 4 per cent to $17.43 over the week, and its larger rival Hewlett-Packard tumbled 10 per cent to $26.64. Both companies saw earnings fall for the quarter ended January 31, while HP also saw a 7 per cent decline in revenue compared to the same period in 2010.“In general, the easy margin expansion related to PC supply chain re-engineering is behind the company, suggesting more volatility in operating margins and earnings going forward,” Richard Gardner at Citigroup said in a note.Shares in Salesforce.com surged on Friday after the company, which provides cloud-based software to businesses, reported a jump in revenue in the quarter ended January 31.Shares climbed 11.2 per cent over the week to a nine-month high of $143.64. Shares had sold off in the final quarter of 2011, after the company’s previous quarterly results showed revenue momentum slowing. But the stock has now rebounded 40 per cent this year.“These…results undeniably refute the concerns in Q3 that momentum in the business is slowing,” Walter Pritchard at Citigroup said in a note.Walmart fell 5.9 per cent to $58.79 as a second consecutive quarter of US sales growth was not enough to drive profit growth. Fourth-quarter earnings fell steeply, as the world’s largest retailer by revenue discounted heavily to attract customers.Margin compression resulting from promotions and raw material costs was a feature across the consumer staples sector.Shares in Safeway fell 8.8 per cent to $20.93 over the week as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins, although investors were braced for poor figures and shares climbed 4.9 per cent to $55.22.First Solar share slumped 16.5 per cent to $35.58, approaching their lowest price since the solar panel manufacturer’s 2006 debut, after the German government announced plans to cut solar energy subsidies by 30 per cent.Sears Holdings rallied 25.3 per cent to $68.31, even as the department store chain reported a fourth-quarter loss of more than $2bn. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and a significant shareholder, which is set to begin with the $270m sale of 11 stores in April.Netflix shares suffered their third consecutive weekly decline, having rallied almost 75 per cent in January. It fell 8.4 per cent over the week to $111.67, after Comcast announced plans for a rival video-streaming service. Netflix shares remain up 61 per cent for the year, however.MetroPCS climbed 16.2 per cent to $12.01 after reporting a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged larger rivals by offering customers attractive rates, but it also showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs.
119;TGT;Target Corp;2012-02-23T21:44:25Z;Sears jumps on spin-off and sale plans;;Shares in Sears Holdings jumped after the department store chain said it would raise up to $670m from asset sales and other restructuring, as it published quarterly results.A fourth-quarter loss of $2.4bn had been expected after the company pre-announced disappointing holiday sales and said it would close stores in December. Investors instead focused on the turnround plan announced by Edward Lampert, the company’s chairman and chief investor. The process is set to begin in April with the $270m sale of 11 stores.The shares climbed 18.7 per cent to $61.80, $15 above their price before December’s announcement.That helped the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 to a healthy gain, although it remained in negative territory for the week, and was not helped by a 5.9 per cent fall for Kohl’s, the mid-market department store, which reported a decline in profits of nearly 8 per cent.In the consumer staples sector, high costs ate into margins for several companies.Shares in Safeway fell 7.6 per cent to $20.95, as profits at the supermarket chain fell, despite a rise in same-store sales.Mass market retailer Target also reported a fall in net fourth-quarter income and a decline in gross margins. Analysts had forecast worse figures and the shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $54.50.Procter & Gamble investors responded positively as the company bowed to analyst pressure to streamline its business, by announcing it would cut 5,700 jobs and $10bn in costs over the next four years. Shares in the consumer goods maker climbed 3.1 per cent to $66.42.Elsewhere, stocks closed within 0.2 points of a post-financial crisis high, as the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,363.46 points.Wall Street had opened lower but was given a shot in the arm by better than expected data from the Kansas Fed manufacturing index, a closely watched indicator of economic activity in the mid-western states of the US.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 12,984.69 points, its highest close since May 2008.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,956.98 points, as Apple shares climbed 0.7 per cent to $516.39, after the company bowed to pressure to give investors greater influence over the election of directors.Shares in Vivus gained 77.5 per cent to $18.73 after the drugmaker received backing from a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel for a new weight loss pill.Hewlett-Packard shares fell 6.5 per cent to $27.05 after the computer maker reported a 7 per cent fall in sales after the bell on Wednesday. Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, promised a multi-year turnround of HP’s large businesses, but analysts stressed the challenges.“[The turnround] will require significant investment in streamlining operations, regaining product leadership and positioning the company to benefit from key industry trends,” said Richard Gardner, technology analyst at Citi. “The company will have to make these investments while navigating a number of extremely competitive, mature end markets – not a journey for the faint of heart.”Shares in First Solar fell 8 per cent to $37.20, as investors reacted to the German government’s plans to cut subsidies for solar power generation. Analysts were expecting the solar panel manufacturer to report a fall in profits of more than 10 per cent when it released fourth-quarter results after the close of trading on Thursday.MetroPCS climbed 13.8 per cent to $11.70 as the company reported a sixfold increase in fourth-quarter profit. The pay as you go mobile phone network has challenged large mobile networks by offering customers attractive rates. But the company showed strong cost discipline in the fourth quarter, cutting back on phone subsidies and marketing costs. The cost of acquiring new customers fell, while most analysts had expected it to rise.Oil and gas exploration and production companies continued to report fourth-quarter results and 2012 budgets, with two winners evident on Thursday.QEP Resources climbed 7.8 per cent to $34.03 and Denbury Resources was up 5.5 per cent to $20.71 as the companies responded to decade-low natural gas prices in different ways.Denbury saw fourth-quarter profits easily beat analyst expectations, thanks to strong oil output from the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.QEP resources reported a fourth-quarter loss, but saw earnings from its field services operation, which is less closely tied to gas prices, almost double compared with the same period in 2010.Shares in Salesforce.com gained as much as 10 per cent to $144.33 in after hours trading, after the business accounting software provider reported revenue that exceeded analyst expectations.
120;TGT;Target Corp;2012-02-23T17:46:08Z;Sears spins off stores after $2.4bn loss;;Sears Holdings, the e mbattled US department store, signalled a change in course by spinning off part of its business and selling 11 stores to raise about $670m as it reported a record net loss of $2.4bn.Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund manager at its helm, said the company was “unwilling to continue on the current course” as it unveiled restructuring moves that were welcomed by the stock market. Its shares jumped 20.6 per cent to $62.81.Sears is one of the most storied names in US retail but it has been in decline for more than a decade and is still criticised as a tired operation. Mr Lampert, who chairs and controls Sears Holdings, has failed to turn it round since he created it in 2005 by merging the department store with Kmart.Since late 2011, as it became clear its performance had worsened during the year, Sears has faced a fresh round of speculation about its ability to meet its debt obligations and stay in business.On its first earnings call with analysts in several quarters Sears tried to quash the bleakest prognoses while beginning to meet some investor demands.It said that it would raise between $400m and $500m by giving existing Sears shareholders the right to buy shares in a new business created by spinning off its Hometown and Outlet stores and some hardware shops. It would raise a further $270m by selling or ending its leases on 11 stores.Some analysts have promoted the benefits of breaking up the company, and in a partial concession to such arguments Mr Lampert said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday: “The ability to successfully transform the disparate businesses we have in the Sears Holdings portfolio under a single management structure has proved very difficult.“We intend to separate the management of several of our businesses from that of the core Sears and Kmart formats, with the goal of allowing each business to pursue its own strategic opportunities.”Sears said its plans also highlighted the “unrecognised value” in its assets, but at the same time it stressed that it already held “ample” liquidity of $3.2bn. “In my opinion, Sears Holdings has a profit problem, not a liquidity nor an asset problem,” Mr Lampert said.In the three months to January 28, Sears reported a net loss of $2.4bn compared with a profit of $374m in the same period last year. The quarterly loss, which Mr Lampert described as an “anomaly”, accounted for the bulk of a full-year net loss of $3.14bn.Sears’ quarterly revenue dropped 4 per cent to $12.48bn, with declines in consumer electronics and appliances sales eclipsing growth in clothes, shoes and home goods.Elsewhere in the retail sector, Kohl’s, a rival department store, reported an 8 per cent fall in net income to $455m on sales up 0.3 per cent to $6.02bn in the three months to the end of January.Target, a mass market discounter, said its net income fell 5.2 per cent to $981m on sales up 3.3 per cent to $20.94bn in the same period.
121;TGT;Target Corp;2012-02-23T15:54:06Z;Target reports fall in profits;;Target, the US mass market discounter, reported a fall in profit and moderate sales growth in the crucial Christmas quarter.A 5.2 per cent drop in net income to $981m, or $1.45 a share, was not as big as Wall Street expected, but a sales increase of 3.3 per cent to $20.94bn fell short of expectations.The company’s operating profit margin fell by 0.62 percentage points to 8 per cent of sales, confirming Target’s place alongside a host of other retailers that have sacrificed profits in the battle for consumers amid intense competition in the sector.Target’s profits were also hit by costs associated with its entry into the Canadian market.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.2 per cent, better than the 1.5 per cent gain posted by its larger rival Walmart, with which it now competes on goods ranging from fresh food to clothes.Target shares fell 0.2 per cent to $52.87 in morning trading in New York.
122;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Alberta Ferretti to offer collection at Macy’s;;Macy’s, the US department store chain, has announced that Alberta Ferretti will be the latest contributor to its highly successful designer capsule series.The collection, which will be sold in 185 stores from April as part of Impulse, Macy’s contemporary fashion department, was primarily inspired by the Italian designer’s love of Capri and the Amalfi coast.Pieces, ranging in price between $49 and $119, will include the floaty ultra-feminine dresses, lightweight pants, peasant-style blouses, lace and knitwear that Alberta Ferrettihas become known for as a high-end fashion label.“I would like to thank Macy’s for giving me the opportunity to experiment with my capsule collection using Italian quality and tradition. To create clothes with such wonderfully low prices has been an extremely interesting and stimulating challenge for me,” said the 61-year old designer. “The ubiquity of Macy’s across the United States has given me a unique opportunity to gift my ‘Italian Dream’ to a vast and diverse audience.”Ferretti will be the sixth guest designer for the Impulse department, with previous collaborators including Matthew Williamson and Kinder Aggugini. The most high-profile Macy’s collaboration to date was with Karl Lagerfeld, who presented a line of contemporary pieces in black, white, pink and grey for the department store last August.Partnerships between top designers and chain stores to create collections at more accessible price points have become a major trend in the fashion industry over the past two years.H&M has released collections designed by Versace, Lanvin and Stella McCartney, whilst Target has hosted guest lines by Missoni and Jason Wu.
123;TGT;Target Corp;2012-01-12T23:15:14Z;Target seeks to refocus its image;;"Target, the US discounter that brought cheap chic to big box retail, is to open 25 mini Apple stores within its own shops as sector analysts say it is facing an identity crisis.The retailer won the faux French pronunciation Tar-zhay from admirers by selling designer clothing and funky housewares at low prices. But by diversifying more recently into fresh food and pharmacies, it has diluted its brand in the eyes of some experts.Ed Little, a retail marketing specialist, said: “They’ve been a leading innovator for so long. But the general feeling in the marketing world is they’re going through an identity crisis, really trying to figure out who they want to be.”At its root lies a tension between two different ways of pulling people through its doors. One is to become a one-stop-shop where customers can buy everything, including bananas and ibuprofen; the other is to be a beacon of style not available anywhere else.“All the emphasis they put now into food is a diversion from the hip, trendy, design-focused brand personality that they worked so hard to develop,” said Mr Little, who previously worked at Nordstrom, Macy’s and J Crew.Target on Thursday signalled an effort to regain the edge once encapsulated by its “design for all” slogan. It confirmed the partnership with Apple and announced that five small boutiques – selling products as diverse as antique-style dishes and dog food – would spearhead its launch of stores-within-stores in May.Mr Little said: “I think it is a step in the right direction for Target to differentiate and innovate, distancing themselves from the mass marketers of commodities.” Target did not provide further details about the mini Apple stores.The announcement comes during a period of upheaval. Target reported a disappointing 1.6 per cent rise in December sales. Last week, it ended its six-year partnership with Wieden + Kennedy, its lead advertising agency. It is still without a chief marketing officer after Michael Francis left last October to join JC Penney.Asked how food and drugs could sit under the same brand as Apple iPads and Missoni’s Italian handbags, Stacia Andersen of Target’s home division said: “Our guests expect to be able to find a wide variety of things. So, while we have food and pharmacy, and that meets their everyday needs, our job is really to delight and surprise them with new things.”While a Target spokeswoman said the end of its work with Wieden + Kennedy was not linked to any one thing, she said: “We’re looking at 2012 to provide a fresh, innovative look.” Target also announced a $5bn share buy-back plan on Thursday.Until last year, Apple’s retail division was run by Ron Johnson, a former Target executive who is now chief executive of JC PenneyWith its mix of clothes and home goods, electronics and music, food and drugs, Target’s competitors range from department stores (which have mimicked its design partnerships) and Best Buy, the electronics chain, to Amazon, the online retailer, and Walmart, the behemoth of discounting.Some analysts said Target’s holiday sales fell short of expectations because it lost customers to Walmart as the world’s biggest retailer by sales moved aggressively to cut its prices amid intense competition.Target’s sale of designer products began with architect Michael Graves in 1999 and since then it has worked with a variety of partners, including Liberty of London and Rodarte, a US fashion label.Its five boutique-in-a-store partners – Privet House, Cos Bar, The Webster, Polka Dog Bakery and The Candy Store – currently run no more than a handful of stores each. Target’s ambitious plan, which it will fund itself, is to give them a place in each of its 1,700-odd stores, but only for six weeks. They will then be replaced by other boutiques.Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, agreed that Target was struggling to define itself and praised the Apple initiative.“Apple stores will attract young customers and that’s the challenge for all retailers today,” he said. “Young customers love to shop in speciality stores and in stores that are convenient. They don’t spend a lot of time in malls and stores where older people go.”"
124;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Target to open Apple stores within shops;;Target is to open 25 Apple stores within its own shops as it launches a series of new retail partnerships to refresh its bullseye brand.“What we are looking at with Apple is a test in 25 stores,” said a Target spokeswoman on Thursday, when the company also announced a $5bn share buy-back programme.The US discount retailer declined to provide further information, but unveiled more details about partnerships with five smaller boutique stores that will open shops within Target stores for an initial period of six weeks.They are Cos Bar, The Webster, Polka Dog Bakery, Privet House and The Candy Store.“It’s another way to make the seemingly inaccessible accessible,” said Brian Robinson, a Target design executive.Target announced plans for a $5bn share repurchase programme, closely following a $10bn buy-back which will be completed early this year.The current programme, announced in late 2007, reclaimed more than 185m shares for an average of $51.53 a share. The new $5bn plan was expected to be completed in the next two to three years.Shares in the US mass-market discount chain gained 0.7 per cent in early New York trading to $49.35.The buy-backs are part of a plan to increase Target’s dividend to as much as $3 by 2017. The company also announced a 30 cent dividend for shareholders on Thursday.“Our plans envision continued generation of much more cash than we believe is appropriate to invest in our core business,” said Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer.Much of Target’s available cash for 2012 was supporting its Canadian market launch, which includes plans to open up to 150 new outlets before 2013. But the company said it expects to invest $1.5bn into share repurchases this year. The amount will increase once the Canadian push is under way.Last week, Target announced a 2.6 per cent increase in December sales as the retail sector as a whole reported a 3.6 per cent rise during the crucial holiday spending period. Despite the gain, the chain also downgraded its earnings-per-share forecast for the fourth quarter from $1.43-$1.53 to $1.35-$1.43.For the third quarter, the retailer said net income rose 3.7 per cent to $555m, or 82 cents a share, which beat estimates.
125;TGT;Target Corp;2012-01-05T19:48:17Z;US consumers: hey, big spenders;Will they expend new-found vigour by consuming, or go into their bunkers?;It looks as if, little by little, US consumers are regaining some of their strength. But will they expend their new-found vigour by actually consuming, or will they dig down deeper into their bunkers?The answer matters for the world economy. US consumption accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the country’s GDP and 15 per cent of the planet’s. This means that a 3 per cent contraction in US consumption would be the equivalent to the economy of, say, Colombia, simply disappearing.The good news is certainly not ubiquitous. It comes in dribs and drabs. Household net worth took a nasty step down in the third quarter as property and share prices slipped. But Thursday’s private sector jobs report from payroll processor ADP was surprisingly robust (and will look even better if confirmed by Friday’s official jobs figures). It was accompanied by another tick down in initial jobless claims. In addition, delinquencies for many types of loan fell in the third quarter, according to the American Bankers Association. Consumer debt payments, as a percentage of disposable income, have reached lows last seen in the 1990s even while credit is expanding.The ultimate confirmation will come, of course, from the results of the companies where Americans spend their money. Here the signals are mixed. There are some bright spots, such as the Macy’s department store chain, and car sales were surprisingly strong. But several of the biggest retailers to report – Kohl’s, JC Penney, and, most significantly, Target – have posted disappointing Christmas trading.A thriftier US might be stronger and more balanced in the long run, and the great crash may have taught consumers valuable lessons. But austerity, whether from governments or from individuals, could not come at a worse time. By all means have virtue, but tomorrow.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
126;TGT;Target Corp;2012-01-05T16:14:50Z;US retailers cut forecasts despite gains;;Several US retailers have downgraded their earnings forecasts even as stores reported overall gains in holiday sales, underlining a structural shift toward lower profit margins driven by the internet and stiff competition.Target, JC Penney, Kohl’s and American Eagle all downgraded their earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter as retailers reported a 3.6 per cent rise in sales in December, some 0.3 percentage points above market expectations.Sales growth came at the cost of reduced profit margins as retailers relied on discounts of up to 70 per cent to attract shoppers, a feature that could be hard to reverse as demanding, internet-savvy consumers become “trained” to expect them.Stacey Widlitz, an independent retail analyst, said: “Retailers are creating a new margin structure in order to gain share. The fear factor is taking over, even when [sales] trends are encouraging.”American Eagle, a teen fashion retailer, was “a perfect example of the new normal”, she said. Its like-for-like sales in November and December were up 12 per cent from a year ago, but it cut its quarterly earnings forecast to $0.33-$0.35 per share from $0.40-$0.44.Ms Widlitz said she had just paid $18 for a vest from American Eagle that was being sold for $76 before Christmas.Heavy spending on advertising and free shipping for online orders are also eroding profits in a sector that was already “low margin, high volume” compared to industries such as technology and pharmaceuticals.The biggest surprise of the day was Target, the mass market discounter, which signalled the end of a strong run by reporting weaker-than-expected December sales – up 1.6 per cent from a year ago – and downgrading its profit forecast to $1.35-$1.43 per share from $1.43-$1.53.The retail landscape is being reshaped by consumers who have become rigorous bargain hunters since the economic downturn and avid users of online stores and smartphones, which have delivered price transparency and one-click convenience.“Gone are the days of guaranteed margins and predictability,” said John Long, retail strategist at consultants Kurt Salmon. “The retailer is in much less control than they were before.”Ms Widlitz said: “Last year it was all about getting the consumer in your door and hoping that they’ll be loyal next year. But the reality is there is no loyalty.”Competition is intense as a growing number of analysts acknowledge that a weak economy and the rise of ecommerce have left the US with too many stores.Profit margins in retail are thin because barriers to entry in the sector are low and most retailers have limited ability to raise prices. At department stores, operating margins are typically between 6 and 12 per cent.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which compiles monthly sales figures, described the 2011 holiday season as “a modest success.”JC Penney, the department store group, reported a 0.3 per cent rise in like-for-like sales in December and forecast a larger quarterly loss than previously expected of between $0.45 and $0.30 per share.Kohl’s, a rival, said like-for-like sales fell 0.1 per cent in December and lowered its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter to $1.70-$1.73 per share from $1.93-$2.04.Profit forecasts, however, were not universally bleak. Macy’s raised its fourth quarter forecast to $1.55-$1.60 per share from $1.52-$1.57 as it reported a 6.2 per cent rise in December sales.Mr Long said another factor reshaping margin structures was the need for retailers to invest in being “ubiquitous”. He said that a Fifth Avenue store in New York, or a good-looking website, or a smartphone app were not, on their own, enough.“Retailers really need to take a hard look at the degree to which they are satisfying customers need to buy wherever they are.”
127;TGT;Target Corp;2011-12-08T00:29:33Z;JC Penney takes $38m stake in Martha Stewart;;JC Penney, the US department store, has struck a $38m deal to take a stake in lossmaking Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, whose home and lifestyle products it will sell from branded units within its own stores.The deal is the first strategic move by Ron Johnson, who was recruited to lead JC Penney from Apple’s retail business and is seeking to reverse an unexpected loss in the past quarter by developing more distinctive products and stores.JC Penney said on Wednesday that it had paid $38.5m for a 16.6 per cent stake in Martha Stewart Living, a group whose eponymous founder became a symbol of American homemaking and cookery.But in a blow to Martha Stewart Living, Macy’s reacted to the deal by putting its selling of Martha Stewart products under review.JC Penney has struggled to compete with rivals such as Macy’s and Kohl’s as they acted faster to reverse a drift toward sameness in the sector by introducing exclusive designers and celebrity brands not available elsewhere.So far this year, Martha Stewart Living has reported a combined net loss of $19.7m. The group’s shares had fallen by 37 per cent since the start of January, but news of the deal triggered a 33.3 per cent surge on Wednesday that lifted them to $4.16.Martha Stewart Living said that over the 10-year period of the deal it expected to receive more than $200m from JC Penney, including design fees, advertising commitments and royalty payments.But Macy’s spoilt Martha Stewart’s celebrations by saying: “In light of the proliferation of Martha Stewart-branded product in the market place, Macy’s is reviewing the Martha Stewart products sold at Macy’s for potential changes in the future.”Shares in JC Penney, which will gain representation on the Martha Stewart board, closed up 0.6 per cent at $33.51.Mr Johnson, credited with creating Apple’s retail stores, became JC Penney’s chief executive last month. One of his first tasks was to report a $143m quarterly loss.He said on Wednesday: “The opportunity to work with Martha and create an entirely new shopping experience, both in-store and online, is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”Mr Johnson has already recruited two former Apple colleagues as senior JC Penney executives as well as a former colleague from Target, where Mr Johnson also worked.This year, Ms Stewart returned to the board of the company she founded, having been convicted in 2004 of lying to investigators about a stock sale and serving five months in prison. She later agreed to a five-year ban from serving as a director of a public company.The two companies said that trom February 2013 there will be “distinct Martha Stewart retail stores” inside the majority of JC Penney department stores.For Martha Stewart and other brand owners, stores-within-a-store combine the opportunity to broaden their distribution with an ability to maintain tight control over product presentation and face-to-face interaction with customers.Blackstone advised Martha Stewart Living and Peter J Solomon advised JC Penney.
128;TGT;Target Corp;2011-11-25T19:19:49Z;Wall St battle turns into Black Friday store wars;Consumers pack stores amid ‘Occupy’ protest and pepper spray;Protests against excessive consumption and a pepper spray attack by an aggressive bargain-hunter marked the two extremes of a busy post-Thanksgiving shopping day.US retailers opened earlier than ever on the eve of the day known as Black Friday, seeking to secure a share of holiday spending that may rise only modestly from last year due to consumer worries over jobs and housing.Full-bore consumerism has long been a pillar of the American economy. But this year Black Friday, which often accounts for 10 per cent of all holiday spending, became the latest target of Occupy Wall Street’s grassroots activism.“Stop supporting big companies. Support the working class. Support small business. Stop feeding the rich,” yelled half a dozen Occupy protesters at some of the 10,000 people that Macy’s estimated were waiting for its flagship store in Manhattan to open at midnight.One protester asked people standing inches away from him: “Are you guys listening?” The answer seemed to be no.At the front of the queue was Robert Glover, a Brooklyn transport worker and newspaper delivery man who was more interested in buying a Polo Ralph Lauren shirt than debating whether he was enriching America’s “1 per cent”.“They’re just saying that because they can’t afford to shop here,” Mr Glover told the Financial Times. “I don’t really care. I’m buying stuff for myself. No one else.”Early openings by Macy’s, Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us and Walmart before the end of Thanksgiving sparked criticism from some employees and commentators who said they were ruining the stay-at-home tranquillity of the holiday.At a Walmart in Porter Ranch, California, a 10pm stampede through the doors turned ugly when police said a woman used pepper spray to “gain an upper hand” over her fellow shoppers. Up to 20 people suffered minor injuries as the woman attempted to clear a path to the electronics section.The National Retail Federation has estimated that holiday spending will rise by 2.8 per cent from a year ago. In 2010, holiday sales increased by 5.2 per cent to $452bn after two years of declines.“The pepper spray scenario is the new way of the world. People will do anything they can to get that deal,” said David Bassuk at AlixPartners, a consultancy. But Mr Bassuk added he was not convinced retailers were offering better bargains. “It is all marketing. It really is. But what you see with the long lines is that marketing works.”
129;TGT;Target Corp;2011-11-20T16:10:53Z;Free shipping erodes US retailers’ profits;;Free shipping for online purchases is eroding the profitability of US retailers as they are compelled to offer the service – pioneered by Amazon – by fierce competition for the dollars of seasonal shoppers.With end-of-year sales starting after Thanksgiving this week, on the day known as Black Friday, retailers including Walmart, Target, JC Penney and Macy’s have already reported reduced profit margins after introducing free shipping.The proliferation of free shipping, albeit with restrictions, is a sign of retailers’ anxious attempts to woo consumers on tight budgets who have been hit hard by the weak US economy.It also reflects the ability of Amazon – the dominant online-only retailer – to set a bar for price and other services that squeezes bricks-and-mortar rivals trying to capture a share of growing online sales. Wall Street expects their margins to shrink further before Christmas.“The cost of getting the customers’ attention is going up, whether it’s because of free shipping, marketing or promotions,” said Adrianne Shapira, managing director at Goldman Sachs.“What’s concerning to us is that as costs go higher, the flow-through from an incremental sales improvement to the bottom line is not as great. You get less bang for your buck.”In the past two weeks, two-thirds of the retailers tracked by Goldman reported a year-on-year decline in quarterly gross profit margins, a key metric that shows how much revenue a retailer retains after the direct costs of procuring and shipping goods.Faye Landes, managing director of Consumer Edge Research, said: “Everyone has to do [free shipping] because Amazon has trained people to expect it. And with most things like this, there’s no going back.” In the US, Amazon offers free shipping on orders of at least $25.Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, is offering free shipping for electronics, clothes, cosmetics and household goods with a minimum order of $45.In the three months to the end of October the company’s gross margin fell 0.44 percentage points from a year ago to 24.6 per cent of sales, unnerving investors.Gross margin declined 0.18 percentage points at Target, a Walmart rival. Among department stores, it fell 1.68 percentage points at JC Penney and by 0.5 percentage points at Macy’s.As smartphones accelerate the growth of ecommerce, mass-market discount chains and department stores are stepping up investments in their online businesses to staunch a loss of market share to Amazon.According to estimates by eMarketer, online holiday sales in the US will rise 16.8 per cent this year to $46.7bn, more than five times as fast as overall retail growth.Kasey Lobaugh, head of ecommerce at Deloitte, said most retailers still had higher margins in their online businesses than their stores.But he said there was a risk that free shipping could become a costly commodity service that triggered a “race to zero” profit. “You haven’t differentiated yourself or created unique value. You’ve just said ‘me too’,” he said.
130;TGT;Target Corp;2011-11-16T22:03:17Z;Eurozone contagion fears drive US bank sell off;Midwestern refiners hit by narrowing Brent-WTI spread;A warning from Fitch Ratings that US banks are vulnerable to contagion from the eurozone debt crisis trigerred a late sell-off on Wall Street.“Unless the eurozone debt crisis is resolved in a timely and orderly manner, the broad outlook for US banks will darken,” Fitch analyst Joseph Scott wrote.The financial sector of the S&P 500 tumbled 2.5 per cent, led down by Morgan Stanley, which fell 8 per cent to $14.66.Goldman Sachs fell 4.2 per cent to $95.60, Citigroup was off 4.1 per cent to $26.86, Bank of America fell 3.8 per cent to $5.90, and JPMorgan fell 3.8 per cent to $31.47.In another sign of rising financial contagion, the two year interest rate swap spread over Treasuries, which is seen as a proxy for US bank counterparty risk, rose above 50 basis points for the first time since May 2010.Earlier, the S&P 500 had moved slightly positive, as soild industrial production and housing market data added to a sense that US markets were shaking off eurozone shackles. But the benchmark US index eventually closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,236.92.“Its very frustrating. We’re trying to shift back to a US-centric analysis, but this Fitch report has brought the eurozone back into focus,” said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Federated Investors.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.6 per cent to 11,905.97, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.7 per cent to 2,639.61.Elsewhere on Wednesday, companies along the hard drive supply chain were given a boost, after Western Digital Corp, the single largest manufacturer, said it had reached a deal with Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK to buy “heads” – a crucial component in hard drives, which Western Digital has had trouble manufacturing since it closed factories due to flooding in Thailand last month.Western Digital shares closed up 7.1 per cent to $26.82, also boosted by a report that the European Commission will clear the company’s bid to acquire Hitachi’s hard drive unit.“This is a big deal as heads were the biggest challenge to restarting production,” said Jayson Noland, a tech analyst at Robert W Baird, “but it’s impossible to quantify the impact until we get details on the deal from Western,” he cautioned.Quarterly results from Dell were more sobering for the sector, with revenue from sales of personal computers, still the single largest source of demand for hard drives, falling 4 per cent year-on-year.Dell shares were off 3.2 per cent to $15.13, although some analysts were encouraged by signs of strong growth in storage and enterprise services.“The company seems to be executing its plan to transform into higher value and higher margin areas,” said Jeffrey Fidacaro at Susquehanna.Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology surged 23.4 per cent to $6.74, after a jury dismissed claims that the company had colluded with Korean firm Hynix Semiconductor to fix the prices of computer memory chips.The case had been brought by Rambus, a tech innovation company, which had been seeking more than $4bn in damages.The market capitalisation of Rambus, which relies on aggressive litigation to protect its patent rights, collapsed, falling more than 60 per cent to $7.11.“Following two key legal losses, which we believed were the cornerstone to our investment thesis in Rambus, we are now recommending investors exit positions,” Jeff Schreiner, an analyst at Capstone investments, told clients as he dropped coverage of Rambus after the decision.Midwestern oil refiners took a hit, as the discount of WTI crude oil to Brent crude shrunk to its lowest in more than six months.Western Refining Inc fell 13.5 per cent to $13.42, and CVR Energy tumbled 16.3 per cent to $18.38. Both companies are almost exclusively dependent on WTI, which has sold at a steep discount to Brent for most of the year, as transport constraints created a supply glut at the WTI terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.News that Canadian firm Enbridge will allow WTI crude to flow to the Gulf Coast from Cushing through a newly acquired pipeline next year erased much of that discount.Even refiners with a small exposure to WTI were significantly affected.Shares in Tesoro fell 6.9 per cent to $25.00. WTI only accounts for 20 per cent of Tesoro’s crude, but Citigroup had expected that output to produce 60 per cent of 2012 earnings because of the lower input costs.The share prices of refiners with as little as 15 per cent exposure to WTI crude, such as Valero Energy, have seen strong correlation with the Brent-WTI spread this year, at least until August, when they were caught up in the wider market sell off. Valero fell 9.3 per cent to $22.56 on Wednesday.Abercrombie & Fitch plunged 13.6 per cent to $48.10, after third-quarter results badly disappointed analysts. Earnings per share of 56 cents were a full 15 cents lower than the average analyst expectation in a Bloomberg poll.Autodesk rose 4.5 per cent to $35.58, after the design software maker reported third-quarter profit of 44 cents a share, exceeding analyst estimates, despite worries about that business would cut back on spending given global growth concerns.
131;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target profits beat forecasts;;Target, the US mass market discount chain, reported profit growth ahead of Wall Street expectations and underscored its sales momentum as the US heads into the crucial holiday shopping season.The retailer said net income rose 3.7 per cent to $555m, or 82 cents a share, in the third quarter, beating estimates of 74 cents a share as it pulled in shoppers with discounts and higher margin clothes and beauty products.Sales at stores open at least a year rose by 4.3 per cent from a year ago in the three months to the end of October, confirming that it continues to grow faster than Walmart, its biggest rivalTarget stocks more upscale merchandise and attracts higher income shoppers than Walmart, which on Tuesday reported its first US sales growth in over two years, but at the cost of a decline in profitability.Both retailers will open earlier than ever next week at the official start of an ultra-competitive holiday shopping season – Walmart at 10pm on Thanksgiving and Target at midnight, on the cusp of the sales day known as Black Friday.Target said it expected fourth-quarter earnings per share of between $1.43 and $1.53, higher than some analysts had forecast.Gregg Steinhafel, Target chief executive, said: “We’re confident that we have the right strategy and team in place to drive continued strong performance this holiday season and well into the future.”Target shares rose 2.2 per cent to $54.34 on Wednesday morning in New York.
132;TGT;Target Corp;2011-11-14T21:56:18Z;Retail results fail to cheer Wall Street;IBM boosted by Buffett taking $10bn stake;Solid results from Lowe’s and JC Penney were not enough to prevent US stock markets from opening the week down, as analysts zeroed in on margins at the start of a big week for retail earnings.Lowe’s closed up 1.7 per cent to $23.50, as a 0.7 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales helped earnings beat analyst estimates. But overall income was 44 per cent lower than in the same quarter last year, as the home improvement retailer has been forced to close stores.JC Penney fell 2.8 per cent to $32.98, on a third-quarter loss of $143m. A loss had been expected, as the department store chain is implementing its own restructuring programme, but analysts were troubled that the company lowered fourth-quarter guidance.Bellwethers Walmart, Target and Staples are all set to report results this week, but analysts were downbeat on the retail sector on Monday.The past 13 weeks have seen double-digit percentage returns for eight of the nine consumer discretionary subsectors, signalling to investors of a statistical bent that stocks may be overbought.Company-specific analysts also expressed doubts that retailers could maintain strong margin growth if consumer spending eases.“With gross margins at near-peak levels, mounting headwinds from free online shipping, and ramped promotions and holiday marketing, we remain on the sidelines,” Adrianne Shapira at Goldman Sachs wrote to clients.Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, did urge clients to buy more defensive consumer staple names, noting these had set expectations for 2012 margins lower than any other non-financial sector.Broad indices fell, with the S&P 500 down 1 per cent to 1,251.78, following European indices, which suffered losses despite a successful auction of Italian sovereign bonds.Banks again suffered most from investors' eurozone nerves. The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 2 per cent, led down by Bank of New York Mellon, which fell 4.5 per cent to $20.55 after announcing it would take a $100m hit in the fourth quarter from restructuring costs.Bank of America dropped 2.6 per cent to $6.05, despite announcing it will pocket $1.8bn in after-tax gains from the sale of more than 10bn shares in China Construction Bank.Joe Morford, US bank analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the sale, which will reduce BofA’s stake in CCB to less than 1 per cent, was inevitable, “given management’s ongoing strategy to strengthen the balance sheet and divest non-core assets”.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 12,078.91, given some ballast by Boeing, which gained 1.5 per cent to $67.94, as investors had their first chance to react to the company’s biggest ever civilian aircraft deal – an $18bn agreement to sell at least 50 jets to Emirates.Also in the Dow, Caterpillar was up 0.4 per cent to $96.53, after Goldman Sachs analysts declared the company a “conviction buy” in anticipation of strong margin growth at the earth moving equipment manufacturer.IBM closed fractionally down at $187.35 – a rare occasion when a Warren Buffett investment did not produce a bounce.The “sage of Omaha” revealed Monday morning that his Berkshire Hathaway company had accumulated a $10bn stake in IBM over several months, Mr Buffett’s first tech-centric investment.Unlike Mr Buffett’s previous financial crisis-era investments in the likes of Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Mr Buffett has purchased common shares in IBM, rather than bargaining with management for guaranteed yields.Mr Buffett revealed the stake during a media interview on Monday morning, causing some consternation that Berkshire Hathaway had not been required to reveal its growing stake in SEC filings.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 2,657.22, given some support by Google shares, which gained 0.6 per cent to $613.00.Salesforce.com rose 2.8 per cent to $133.52 after a glowing “buy” recommendation from Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard for the provider of “cloud” software for businesses.While other analysts have been wary of Salesforce’s high capital spending on an ambitious growth project, Mr Pritchard told clients: “We believe it is nearly mathematically impossible for margins not to accrete meaningfully in the 2013 fiscal year and drive cash flow in excess of consensus.”Miner Titanium Metals was up 1.8 per cent to $15.88, driven by strong options activity, as some investors sought to profit from renewed takeover talk.QEP Resources tumbled 7.6 per cent to $34.21 after the gas explorer forecast 2012 earnings of $1.45bn to $1.55bn, compared to analyst expectations of $1.62bn.Computer Sciences, the IT outsourcing company, continued its precipitous decline. Shares fell 3.9 per cent to $25.46, leaving the stock off 22 per cent since the company slashed full-year guidance last Wednesday, citing weak demand from public sector clients.
133;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US senators introduce internet sales tax bill;;Debate over whether online shoppers should pay sales tax is set to intensify after a bipartisan group of US senators introduced a bill that would make it easier for state governments to collect the levy.Many Americans have escaped paying sales tax on online purchases because retailers are not required to collect it in many states where they do not have a physical presence, but bricks-and-mortar retailers have complained this gives online rivals an unfair edge.On Wednesday, a group of Republican and Democratic senators introduced a bill to help states collect internet sales tax from all out-of-state retailers. But it is being fiercely opposed by Ebay and others who say it will stifle the growth of ecommerce.The tax issue has been pushed up the political agenda by the explosive growth of online shopping and the weak public finances of many US states, which are struggling with budget deficits and eager to find new sources of revenue.The bill would “level the playing field for local main street businesses” versus their online peers, said Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator from Illinois who was among those introducing it.“Most small business people don’t want a government handout. They don’t want special treatment. They just want to be able to compete fairly against other businesses,” he said in a statement.The senators said the bill was not creating new taxes, raising existing ones or obliging any states to collect sales tax.Instead, it allowed states to fully enforce their existing tax laws by closing a loophole that emerged when the internet created a place-less form of retail not envisaged in legislation.Intensive lobbying by traditional retailers such as Walmart, Target and Best Buy has helped force the debate on to the national stage as they lose sales to Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer.While Amazon has been presented as a symbol of the perceived injustice – and has opposed piecemeal state-by-state tax initiatives– the online retailer said it strongly backed the bill because it has always supported a single “federal solution”.The bill, however, was attacked by Ebay, whose internet marketplace is an outlet for thousands of small online-only retailers.Tod Cohen, its vice-president for government relations, said: “This is another internet sales tax bill that fails to protect small business retailers using the internet and will unbalance the playing field between giant retailers and small business competitors.”Ebay wanted businesses below a certain size to be exempted from the bill, but said the chosen threshold – “remote sales” of $500,000 a year – was below established definitions of small businesses.New York and California are among a small number of states that have already modified their laws to make online retailers collect sales tax, but the Senate bill creates a new simplified tax system to make it easier for other states to follow suit.“It does not make sense to expand internet sales tax burdens on small businesses at a time when we want entrepreneurs to create jobs and economic activity,” said Mr Cohen.Earlier this year, Imran Khan, a JPMorgan internet analyst, described the internet sales tax as “probably the headline risk” to the continued growth of ecommerce.Amazon’s critics have said its success and ability to undercut rivals on price is dependent on avoiding collecting sales tax from shoppers, a charge that Amazon denies.
134;TGT;Target Corp;2011-11-09T00:07:07Z;Apple introduces DIY check-out by mobile app;;Apple has simplified shopping at its bricks-and-mortar stores by introducing new ordering and payment methods that underscore its credentials as a pacesetter in retail innovation.The technology group, which is influencing retail after transforming computing, music and mobile phones, on Tuesday made it possible for customers to pick up online orders in a store and introduced a self-check out facility.The changes, which were made via updates to its online shopping app, will accelerate the way mobile communications technology is blurring the boundary between online and offline retail.“Just as Amazon set the tone online, Apple is starting to set the tone on in-store experience and other retailers will be inspired to follow,” said Cathy Halligan, a former chief marketing officer at Walmart.com.But Gale Daikoku, Gartner retail technology analyst, said Apple’s moves did not herald a dramatic change because of security concerns and customers’ general preference for dealing with other human beings.“This is a really cool thing,” she said. “Is it something we will see massively adopted? I don’t think anytime soon.”The self-check out facility, called EasyPay, lets customers buy accessories less valuable than computers and phones without any direct contact with an Apple employee, a process that some other retailers remain wary of due to worries about theft.Consumers who are logged into an Apple account on their smartphone can scan the bar code of a product in a store and buy it using the credit card linked to that account.Apple said store employees could ask to see the electronic receipts that will be loaded on to smartphones during the transactions.Self-check out facilities that take cash or credit cards were pioneered by grocery stores in order to speed up check out queues and reduce staffing costs.Mike Gatti, executive director of marketing at the National Retail Federation, said: “This is Apple taking it to the next level, using the mobile device with your payment information in the cloud. It’s going to be the mobile wallet.”The in-store pick up facility lets consumers use the Apple Store app to search the inventory of nearby stores for the item they want, order and pay for it online, then pick it up in person as soon as one hour later.“Consumers want convenience and they want to make sure there is no wasted trip to the stores,” said Ms Halligan, who is now senior vice-president of sales and marketing at PowerReviews, a social commerce company.Retailers that already allow in-store pick up, such as Walmart and Home Depot, say it is also popular with customers who do not want to wait for an online purchase to be delivered.Target and other big retailers also have apps that let consumers scan bar codes to find product information, but they do not enable purchases.Ebay, the online marketplace, has begun to sell retailers services similar to those unveiled by Apple through its new X.commerce business, which includes the PayPal payments system and RedLaser, a barcode scanner.
135;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US retail sales fall short of expectations;;US retail sales rose in October but growth decelerated and fell below market expectations as retailers head into a holiday shopping season of fragile sentiment and fierce competition.In spite of a weak economy, sales increased 3.8 per cent from a year ago to rack up a 26th successive monthly rise, according to Retail Metrics. But they fell below analyst forecasts of 4.4 per cent growth and below the 5 per cent-plus increases of the previous three months.Although spending has not collapsed, the US is entering the biggest shopping period of the year with consumer confidence plumbing depths last visited in the 2008-09 recession.Fifty four per cent of the retailers that report monthly sales fell short of expectations, among them both those that reported overall increases and declines.At Gap, the struggling fashion retailer, sales at North American stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent from a year ago while its group-wide sales were $1.14bn.JC Penney, the mid-market department store, also missed expectations with like-for-like sales that dropped 2.6 per cent.High-end department stores failed to live up to market hopes as well, as Saks reported a 1.8 per cent increase in sales and Nordstrom a 5.4 per cent gain.Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in Accenture’s retail practice, said: “When you consider all the other things battering consumers … the fact [they] are still spending at a healthy clip is encouraging.”He added: “Is it possible we’ll look back at October and say we saw a bit of pull back? Absolutely. But it’s also possible we’re seeing some variability in a month that is not typically the strongest.”Competition between retailers in the run-up to Christmas is likely to be especially tough as cash-strapped consumers confront high unemployment and a weak housing market.Macy’s, Target and Kohl’s this week said that for the first time they would open at midnight on the day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, when retailers traditionally kick off the holiday shopping season with big discounts.Holiday shoppers plan to spend less on gifts and seasonal merchandise this year than last: $704.18 versus $718.98, according to a National Retail Federation survey.But analysts say consumers typically spend more than they intended and the NRF is forecasting that retail sales in November and December will grow 2.8 per cent to $456bn.Steve Riordan, global managing partner of advisory services at PRGX Global, said: “There won’t be a holiday bump unless [consumers are] digging into savings or running up the credit card.”He added that consumer sentiment had become as volatile as financial markets: “We’re super excited one day and ready to jump off the cliff the next … It’s hard to make a decision as a consumer.”
136;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Wall Street ends week with a spring in its step;;In a week where the S&P 500 moved into bear territory, breaking below the 1,100 barrier for the first time in a year, Wall Street closed Friday in surprisingly good cheer, buoyed by strong retail sales data and a better than expected employment report.The 23 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters posted a 5.1 per cent year-on-year increase in same-store sales for September, handily beating analyst expectations. The corresponding figure in September 2010, when the economy appeared to be in much ruder health, was only 2.7 per cent.Bellwether discount retailer Target posted a 5.3 per cent increase in sales and its shares rose 5.1 per cent for the week to $51.56.Limited Brands, which operates high-end chains including Victoria’s Secret, enjoyed double digit year-on-year sales growth. The stock rose 5 per cent for the week to $40.43.Bulk goods retailer Costco posted a 12 per cent rise in sales, although a decision to raise membership fees to offset higher commodity prices alarmed investors. Shares fell 3.8 per cent to $79.02, the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500.The consumer discretionary index of the S&P 500 was up 4.1 per cent for the week. Since markets began to slide in late July, the sector has outperformed the broad S&P 500 by more than two percentage points.“We’ve had sixty days of bad economic news and falling markets, but consumers are still going out and buying stuff, and at a healthy clip too,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.But some retail analysts were worried resilient consumer spending may be debt-driven.“Taken as a point in time, September sales data do look very strong,” said David Strasser, hardline retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “But we question whether that is sustainable, if consumption is outpacing wage growth.”At 4.7 per cent in July and 4.5 per cent in August, the personal savings rate – the fraction of US personal income that is not consumed – has fallen beneath 4.8 per cent for the first time since 2009.The broad S&P 500 was up 2.1 per cent for the week, as European politicians appeared to inch towards a co-ordinated recapitalisation of the continent’s banks. An FT report to that effect late on Tuesday had sent the S&P 500 up 4 per cent in forty minutes.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent for the week to 11,103.12, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.6 per cent to 2,479.35.But US banks ended a volatile week on a low note. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 3.7 per cent Friday. A leak, late on Thursday, of a draft text of the Volcker rule, which would seek to stop proprietary trading by banks, caused alarm. By the week’s end, Tuesday’s euphoria at the prospect of European bank recapitalisations had also given way to worries about the speed of implementation.“As with everything in Europe it’s going to happen slower than the markets want,” said Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities.Bank of America was down 3.6 per cent for the week to $5.95, after a 6 per cent fall on Friday. Goldman Sachs fell 5.5 per cent Friday to end the week down 2 per cent at $94.56. But despite its own 6 per cent fall on Friday, Morgan Stanley ended the week up 5.4 per cent to $14.24.That represented a turnround for Morgan Stanley, which was hit early in the week by reports that some banks were cutting exposure to the firm, as the cost of buying insurance on its debt hit 30-month highs.On Friday Morgan Stanley received a vote of confidence from analysts at its rival Goldman Sachs. Goldman’s options team put out a note recommending clients buy calls and sell short-dated credit default swaps to profit from a rise in the Morgan Stanley share price.“We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan exposures appear overdone,” Goldman’s equity research analysts wrote in the note.Apple shares were down 2 per cent for the week to $369.80, after a lukewarm reception for its latest iPhone model, and the death of founder and figurehead Steve Jobs.Sprint was by far the biggest faller in the S&P 500, losing 10 per cent of it market capitalisation on Friday afternoon, to close the week down 10.9 per cent at $2.71, after its chief executive said the mobile phone network may need to raise additional capital.Sprint also announced it will upgrade to a 4G network next year, which sent the share price of its current wireless network provider, Clearwire, tumbling 32.2 per cent to $1.39.Material stocks were the best performers in the S&P 500 on renewed hopes for global growth. Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan was up 11.7 per cent to $34.01. Cliffs Natural Resources, which extracts iron ore and metallurgical coal, used in the manufacture of steel, was up 9.2 per cent to $55.87.Wynn Resorts, the casino chain, reversed two weeks of heavy losses to close the week up 12.1 per cent to $129.06. Nomura analysts came out in defence of the stock, which had been hit by fears of a decline in Chinese junket tourism to Macau.Shares in Yahoo jumped 17.5 per cent to $15.47 over the course of the week after reports suggested Microsoft was preparing a bid for the internet portal. Microsoft denied interest but Alibaba remained in the running, along with various private equity houses.AMR, the holding company of American Airlines, was down 15.5 per cent for the week to $2.50, on reports the company is considering bankruptcy.Seed company Monsanto was up 18.1 per cent to $51.56 after reporting strong quarterly sales.
137;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Time of greatest fear offers opportunity;;In 45 furious minutes this week, Wall Street was spared a mauling by the bears.Late on Tuesday the S&P 500 was submerged below the 1,100 level, more than 20 per cent off its April high and closing in on official bear market territory. Then a Financial Times report that European Union finance ministers were looking at a co-ordinated recapitalisation of the continent’s banks triggered a 4.1 per cent rebound in stocks.Whether investors avoid further losses this year depends on more than just what happens to Europe’s banks, however.Just as important, perhaps more so, is the question of whether the US will avoid slipping into another recession. While overshadowed by the headlines of the eurozone drama, economic data out this week raised hopes that the feared double dip might not be imminent.First, on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management revealed that manufacturing was still expanding in the US even as it slowed elsewhere.Then, figures released on Thursday showed that new claims for unemployment assistance had held steady at about 400,000 per week. As Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management notes, if the US was on the brink of recession, claims should be ballooning, not hovering. A steady claims rate is relatively good news: share prices tend to fall when jobless claims rise.Finally, the most important release of the week was stronger than expected. The US added 103,000 jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday. The agency also revised an earlier reading of zero change in August to a 57,000 jobs increase.Collectively, these data are a reminder that the fundamentals of the US economy are in better shape than many think. As such, any further action by central banks and European leaders to address the sovereign debt crisis there bolsters the case for equities.Since the summer, US stock markets have been haunted by the prospect of a European bank collapse or the break-up of the euro. These scenarios have loomed over US banks, and the cost of buying insurance against a default on their bonds, via credit default swaps, has soared. Analysts have scrambled to calculate US banks’ exposure to the European crisis.Financials have fallen the most of any S&P sector in response to contagion fears, followed closely by materials and industrials, reflecting concerns about the strength of global demand.The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has fallen to below 2 per cent, pointing to a protracted Japan-style slump. Leading indices from the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a forecaster, shout recession.But it is important for investors to recognise that the more probable outcome in Europe is likely to fall short of catastrophe. A technical recession, possibly, which would lead to a slowdown in US trade with Europe, but not a 2008-style crisis. The US economy should continue growing, and with it corporate earnings.For all the gloom in financial markets, S&P 500 earnings per share this year are expected to hit a record $99.19, according to S&P Capital IQ. Much of those earnings are expected to come from consumer discretionary companies such as Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond and Target. Consumer discretionary stocks have been outperforming.“You should never underestimate US consumers,” says Richard Jaffe, a retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “They have been paying down debt and are in a position to go out and spend on their credit cards.”Another factor buoying US households is falling oil prices. Crude has declined more than $20 a barrel from its April peak, reducing inflationary pressure and leaving shoppers with more money to spend.Over coming weeks, further data will clarify the uncertainty over US growth, while investors will scrutinise third-quarter earnings and guidance from companies. Any upside surprise will reward value investors who bought at a time of greatest fear.Stock market sentiment is now almost as bad as it was in early 2009. But with the publication of US bank stress tests, that was also the point at which the market began a two-year bull run. It is worth recalling Warren Buffett’s dictum: be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.
138;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
139;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Strong retail sales boost Wall Street;;Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent, on the back of better-than-expected September sales reports from a host of retailers.Discount retailer Target Corp jumped 4.3 per cent to $51.91 after sales climbed 5.3 per cent compared with September 2010, exceeding average analyst expectations of a 3.9 per cent increase.Limited Brands, operator of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain, among other brands, was up 0.8 per cent to $40.59, after reporting same store sales growth of 11 per cent, double average expectations.The Goldman Sachs department store index was up 4 per cent, 0.8 per cent better than expected by Goldman’s own analysts, also on strong sales figures.Saks was up 5.8 per cent to $9.46 with same store sales rising 9 per cent. Tiffany was up 6.4 per cent to $66.58.Consumer discretionary stocks, which are normally highly cyclical, have not fallen as hard as other sectors during recent market volatility. Consumer discretionary stocks are down 11.6 per cent since July 25, 2 percentage points less than the broad S&P 500.“Household savings figures were down in August, so there are signs consumers are willing to dip into savings to boost spending,” said David Strasser, hardline retail analyst at Janney.“That showed up in September sales figures, which are strong across the board. The question is whether it is sustainable.”The broad S&P 500 was up 1.8 per cent to 1,164.96 by the close. The European Central Bank’s promise to keep unlimited financing for continental banks in place until at least the middle of next year, boosted US bank stocks.Bank of America was up 8.8 per cent to $6.28 and Morgan Stanley was up 4.8 per cent to $15.18 as financials in the S&P 500 rose 3.2 per cent, more than any other sector.Wall Street was also buoyed by better-than-expected data for jobless benefit claims. Although initial applications increased 6,000 to 401,000 in the week ended October 1, the average analyst prediction was 410,000.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent to 11,123.33 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.9 per cent to 2,505.82.The solar panel manufacturer First Solar was up as much as 10 per cent on speculation about a takeover bid from General Electric or German company Siemens, although analysts poured cold water on the idea.“I’ll give you $100 if GE bid for First Solar,” said Theodore O’Neill, energy analyst at Wunderlich Securities. “They only take over companies that are broken, which First Solar isn’t. I don’t think anyone is about to bid.”First Solar settled at $64.53, a gain of 6 per cent for the day.Express Scripts, which procures prescription drugs from pharmacists for health insurers, jumped 11.4 per cent to $40.02, despite lowering its annual profit forecast and earnings-per- share projections by 6 per cent. Analysts had been expecting worse, given evidence of declining demand for expensive medication.Same store sales growth of 3.1 per cent at the pharmacy chain Walgreen also disappointed analysts. But the stock rose 1 per cent to $33.36. Edward Kelly at Credit Suisse was cheered that “Walgreen continues to successfully pass through inflation” to customers.Yahoo fell 1.7 per cent to $15.65. The stock had surged almost 10 per cent late on Wednesday on hopes of a bidding war between Microsoft and Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba for the US internet portal, but Microsoft has denied interest.Microsoft was up 1.7 per cent to $26.22.The Apple share price held steady, down only 0.2 per cent to $382.01, despite the death of co-founder Steve Jobs.Monsanto surged 7.6 per cent to $71.29 as several analysts reacted to strong results out on Wednesday. The seed company is now up 16.7 per cent for the week.Jeffrey Zekauskas at JPMorgan upgraded the stock to “buy” and told clients Monsanto could prosper in a downturn: “Farmers may under apply the amount of fertilisers, given difficult economic conditions, as they did in 2009, but they do not have similar flexibility to avoid and economise in planting seeds.”Hotel chain Marriott International was up 2.1 per cent to $28.78, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results of 29 cents a share.
140;TGT;Target Corp;2011-10-06T15:37:33Z;Back-to-school shopping lifts US retailers;;Back-to-school shopping and heavy discounting fuelled sales at US retailers in September, beating Wall Street’s expectations as consumers searched for deals in a turbulent economic environment.Sales rose 5.8 per cent at stores open at least a year, ahead of an estimated 4.9 per cent gain, according to Retail Metrics, the research firm.“The general disconnect between US retailers…and broader weakness in the global economy continued in September,” said Ken Perkins, Retail Metrics president. He noted that the labour market “continues to struggle to gain job-building momentum”, citing Thursday’s report that weekly jobless claims rose back above 400,000. The government is due to report on September job creation and unemployment on Friday.As the stock market has taken a wild ride, driven by concerns over the eurozone debt crisis and fears that US growth may remain in low gear, consumers have been more pessimistic about economic conditions.Despite those worries, shoppers flocked to discounters like Target and Costco, and department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s to stock up for the new school year.Target sales rose 5.3 per cent from a year ago, the company’s biggest single monthly increase outside of the Easter holiday since before the recession, Mr Perkins noted. That beat an expected 3.9 per cent rise. Costco, the membership-based discounter, posted a 12 per cent gain compared with a forecast 9.9 per cent rise.Kohl’s recorded a 4.1 per cent gain, compared with a forecast of 2 per cent, helped by aggressive promotions. Sales at Macy’s were up 4.9 per cent, compared with an expected 4.4 per cent, a performance that chief executive Terry Lundgren said “underscores that our business remains on track, despite the persistently negative macroeconomic news”.With Americans watching their wallets more closely, retailers “who have figured out how to do business with the consumer in these economic times” are succeeding, said Mike Brown, a vice-president at AT Kearney, the consultancy. “We are looking at strong performance from retailers who are offering the consumer great value.”He pointed to luxury retailer Saks, which posted a 9.3 per cent sales rise compared with an expected 6.2 per cent gain, saying that stores which sell high-end products that people feel they “have to have” continue to do well despite the rocky economy.Other department stores were not so successful, however. Bon Ton Stores sales fell 3.6 per cent while JC Penney was down 0.6 per cent, both missing expectations. Following the disappointing sales data, JC Penney cut its forecast for third-quarter earnings to 10 to 15 cents a share from about 25 cents a share, and said it expected sales growth in the July to September quarter to be flat.Clothing retailers reported mixed results. Sales at Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath and Body Works, jumped 11 per cent compared with an expected 3.9 per cent rise. But Gap sales dropped a greater-than-expected 4 per cent.“While there were some bright spots across our brands and business units, we’re clear and focused on the steps necessary to improve our business performance going forward,” said Glenn Murphy, chief executive of Limited Brands.Hurricane Irene, which brought record flooding and damage to the east coast at the end of August, was likely to have affected shopping patterns last month, said Michael McNamara, head of MasterCard Advisors Spending Pulse, which tracks US retail sales. He said store closings over the final weekend of August pushed some back-to-school shopping into September and also boosted sales at hardware suppliers as homeowners repaired damaged houses.
141;TGT;Target Corp;2011-09-07T18:58:17Z;Best Buy launches rival online marketplace;;Best Buy, the US electronics retailer whose business has been eroded by smartphone-carrying shoppers and price comparison websites, is fighting back by launching its own rival to online marketplaces such as Amazon’s.The company has been the chief victim of shoppers who visit its stores as show rooms to research products, but then use their smartphones to buy at lower prices online from other retailers.On Wednesday, it launched an online marketplace in the US on which other retailers can post products alongside its own as it tries to broaden its product offering and improve its visibility to online consumers.The company also wants to win back investors who are sceptical about its ability to weather the combination of e-commerce growth, falling prices and shoppers who are increasingly becoming canny and capricious.John Thompson, senior vice-president of Best Buy and general manager of online operations, told the Financial Times: “We’re trying to be transparent in a way that allows consumers to find the product they want.”However, Best Buy is arriving late to a game where Amazon and Ebay already have big head starts. “It’s going to be tough,” said Jeremy Brunelli, senior analyst at Consumer Edge Research.Best Buy was seeking ways to reverse a consumer perception that its products were more expensive than those sold by Amazon, and even traditional rivals including Walmart and Target, he said.“In this world of austerity, with consumers worried about their budgets, price is the most important thing,” he added.The lower prices of online retailers stem partly from the fact that they do not have to charge many of their customers sales tax. Mr Brunelli said Best Buy could succeed in altering price perceptions by including online-only retailers in its marketplace.Best Buy’s shares have fallen 25 per cent so far this year and performed worse than the broader consumer index, which is trading at the level where it began the year. The company’s sales grew 1 per cent in the past quarter after two consecutive quarterly falls.The company already offers as many as 10,000 products online, more than in its stores, and said the marketplace would increase the number by a third.The other retailers on Best Buy’s marketplace are Buy.com, Mambate, SF Planet, ANT Online, BeachAudio.com and Wayfair.“Increased assortment of products, brands and price points is exactly what people have told us they want,” said Mr Thompson.To distinguish it from other online marketplaces, some of which tend towards sprawling disorder, Best Buy stressed that the sellers and products on its version would be carefully selected.“Consumers won’t have to spend time sorting through redundant products or comparing prices from multiple websites,” the company said.
142;TGT;Target Corp;2011-08-19T21:22:39Z;Wall Street bruised by heavy tech sell-off;;The S&P 500 index finished the week down almost 5 per cent, as tech shares suffered their steepest losses since the financial crisis and traders absorbed a barrage of bad economic news.Shares in technology bellwether Hewlett-Packard closed at $23.60, their lowest price since 2005. The shares were down 20 per cent on the day, and off by 27 per cent for the week.Although HP reported that it topped earnings forecasts for its most recent quarter, it revised its full-year profit forecast sharply downward, from at least $4.27 a share to between $3.59 and $3.70. The company cited potential restructuring and acquisition costs, as well as slowing PC sales to consumers.Léo Apotheker, HP chief executive, is considering spinning off the computer manufacturing unit to refocus the company on software. He announced the company will pay $11bn in cash for UK-based software group Autonomy, at roughly an 80 per cent premium.Kulbinder Garcha, Credit Suisse analyst, said the Autonomy acquisition is “the correct strategy, which eventually could unlock value”. However, he said the price was very high, with HP “paying $10bn for a business that will represent between 1 and 5 per cent of revenue”. Credit Suisse reduced its 2012 earnings per share forecast for the company by 11 per cent, to $4.56.Moody’s, the rating agency, downgraded its rating outlook for HP from stable to negative, citing the acquisition, which it expects to be partially funded by debt.Dell also reported disappointing consumer sales earlier in the week. Its shares were down 5.9 per cent for the week at $14.00, though they rallied 1.7 per cent Friday after data showed Dell taking market share from HP.Overall, tech stocks in the S&P 500 index were down 8 per cent for the week, their worst one-week drop since October 2008. The Nasdaq Composite index was off 6.6 per cent for the week to 2,341.84.Positive quarterly results from Salesforce, the cloud computing company, provided no relief. The company reported earnings per share of 30 cents, one cent higher than expected.But its shares slumped 17 per cent on the week to $111. Despite robust revenue growth, Philip Winslow, software analyst at Credit Suisse, cut his 2012 earnings per share forecast for Salesforce from $1.95 to $1.76, citing ”higher expenses related to accelerated hiring, acquisitions and marketing activities”.Intuit, the business software developer, was a rare bright spot after it announced it would pay its first dividend following a strong quarter.Earnings per share at Intuit rose from $1.77 in the same quarter last year to $2. The company will pay a maiden dividend of 10 cents a share. The company was one of the leading gainers on the S&P 500, its shares up 3 per cent for the week to $43.65.After Thursday’s sell-off, on worse-than-expected results from the Philadelphia Fed business survey and a slowdown in home sales, traders were relieved on Friday that the broad S&P 500 index did not touch the year low of 1,101, set last week.Todd Salamone, director of research at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “There is some support at 1,100. If we reach that level, some buyers will come in, but we don’t know how many. It could prove more of a speed bump than a roadblock to bears.”The broad S&P 500 index closed down 4.7 per cent for the week at 1,123.53. The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.6 per cent at 10,817.95.Although financials did not lead the sell-off this week, the closely watched KBW Bank index reached a new low for the year on Friday, marginally below last week’s low, and its lowest level since July 2009. The index was off 5.9 per cent on the week.Shares in Citigroup fell 10.3 per cent for the week, to $26.77. That is its lowest closing price since July 2009, though not below the intraday low hit last week of $26.25.Bank of America, among the leading decliners last week, outperformed the index this week, finishing the five days down 3.1 per cent at $6.97. The bank has moved aggressively to raise capital, selling non-core units such as Canadian credit cards and announcing a reduction of 3,500 staff on Friday.Merger activity helped some stocks to big gains. Motorola Mobility was up 54.7 per cent for the week at $37.87, a shade beneath the $40-a-share price Google bid for the mobile phone handset manufacturer earlier this week. Google shares were down 12.9 per cent for the week at $490.92.Sprint was up 6.9 per cent for the week at $3.43 on reports the cellular network provider could be subject to a bid too. That helped telecoms shares in the S&P 500 outperform the market, down only 0.2 per cent for the week.Other outperformers included utility shares, up 1.9 per cent for the week, and consumer staples, down only 0.1 per cent.A mixed week for retailers saw discount brands Target and Walmart up for the week after beating revenue expectations in quarterly earnings reports. Walmart rose 5.1 per cent for the week to $52.30, within touching distance of its price at the start of August, before the market slump.Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 were down 5.6 per cent for the week, led by Abercrombie & Fitch, down 19.6 per cent $56.36, a level last seen in April.Cigarette manufacturers were stronger after they announced plans to sue the government over proposed new graphic health warnings on packaging. Lorillard was up 6.9 per cent for the week at $108.62, and Reynolds American up 5.1 per cent at $35.76.
143;TGT;Target Corp;2011-08-18T22:16:48Z;Gap and Sears struggle to revive images;;Weak quarterly results from Gap and Sears Holdings underlined the challenges facing US retailers that have been struggling to revive their images at a time when consumers are already being cautious.Gap, the largest US apparel company by revenues, said on Thursday that its second-quarter net income fell 19 per cent to $189m, or 35 cents a share. The company has been unable to pass along commodity cost increases to its customers and efforts to update its merchandise have so far failed to increase sales.US same-store sales at Gap’s namesake outlets were down 3 per cent year on year, while sales at its Banana Republic stores slipped 2 per cent and sales at Old Navy were flat. Glenn Murphy, chief executive, acknowledged that the quarter was “difficult” and expressed frustration that his stores have not been drawing enough traffic.Earlier this year, Gap replaced the head of the North America Gap brand and appointed a new creative director, in hopes of finding fashion trends with better appeal to young people and women. Mr Murphy said he still hoped to see noticeable improvement in the results by the holiday shopping season.Meanwhile, Sears Holdings reported a wider quarterly loss on Thursday, as customers flocked to its rivals in search of bigger bargains and better service.The company, which runs Sears and Kmart stores, also announced another round of jobs cuts. It said it would sack 250 workers, two months after it cut 700 jobs.Sears has been hit hard by the weak US economy and analysts have criticised its strategy of shutting stores and discounting heavily. They say the company, which sells everything from clothing to electrical appliances, has struggled to compete with rivals offering lower prices and better service.In the second quarter, the company reported a loss of $146m, or $1.37 a share. That followed a loss of $39m, or 35 cents, in the same period a year ago and sent Sears’ share price down 8.2 per cent to $555.23 on Thursday.“We are not satisfied with our results and are taking actions to turn round our performance in a challenging economic environment,” Lou D’Ambrosio, chief executive of Sears Holdings, said in a statement.Weakness at Sears Holdings has persisted since 2005, when billionaire Edward Lampert combined Sears and Kmart in a $11.9bn deal.The company’s sales have fallen each year since as competitors such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot have invested in their stores and grabbed market share. Sales slid again in the second quarter, declining by 1.2 per cent to $10.3bn.“They have underinvested in stores, they have cut service levels and consumers are saying that the asking price for their products is not worth it for the level of service they get,” said Gary Balter, retail analyst at Credit Suisse.Sears Holdings took a $48m charge from the closing of 29 stores this year. Mr D’Ambrosio said that shrinking profit margins were due to markdowns and promotions that were needed to clear inventory.Rather than invest in its stores, Sears Holdings has been focused on improving its online presence and creating brands, such as the Kardashian Kollection.Mr Balter said sales driven through clearances were “not the solution to Sears problems”, and that its poor customer service was depleting the value of its strong brands, such as Kenmore and Craftsman.In a letter to investors in February, Mr Lampert argued that upgrading stores was just one part of becoming a “go-to” retailer, and that “emerging” areas such as online and rewards programmes were more important.“Our decisions to allocate capital in these areas are based on the expected future performance of the investments without worrying about the quarter-to-quarter reporting consequences,” he said.
144;TGT;Target Corp;2011-08-17T20:53:41Z;S&P 500 ends higher despite Dell gloom;;By Ajay Makan and Telis Demos in New YorkUS technology stocks fell after consumer electronics bellwether Dell turned in a downbeat earnings report.Dell the Texas-based computer manufacturer, saw second-quarter sales rise only 1 per cent to $15.7bn, slightly underperforming expectations, because of weak consumer demand for personal computers.Its shares closed down 10.1 per cent at $14.20, more than reversing a 2 per cent gain on Tuesday.Although net income was up to 48 cents a share from 28 cents a share in the same quarter last year, the company reduced its forecast for revenue growth in the fiscal year 2012 from 5-9 per cent to 1-5 per cent.“We remain impressed with the improvements Dell has made over the past 12 months,” said Amit Daryanani at RBC Capital Markets. But he did not recommend buying the shares, despite the falling price, citing “our belief that more defensive names will likely outperform”.Dell dragged down rival computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard, which lost 3.7 per cent to close at $31.39. Tech stocks were the worst performing of the S&P 500 index sectors, down 0.9 per cent.Analysts suggested manufacturers of tablets and netbooks would benefit from Dell’s troubles over the longer term but Apple, maker of the iPad tablet, saw its shares fall marginally to $380.44.Earlier, shares rose more than 1 per cent as traders shrugged off a 0.2 per cent month-on-month increase in producer prices in July, which stoked fears of inflation. The rise in producer prices was 0.4 per cent excluding food and energy prices, the highest since January.But a rally faded into the close, and the broad S&P 500 index closed up just 0.1 per cent at 1,193.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up fractionally at 11,410.21, but the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.5 per cent to 2,511.48.Bob Haber, the principal of Haber Trilix advisers said today’s volatility could be the shape of things to come. “People don’t know how far a rally is going to go so it is very tempting to sell after small rises to lock in gains”A positive earnings report from Target had given some early lift to sentiment. The US’s second-largest discount retailer posted earnings of $1.03 a share, beating expectations of 97 cents a share. Its shares were up 2.4 per cent to $50.55 after paring early gains.That followed positive data from Home Depot and Walmart on Tuesday. Consumer staples performed well for a second day running, rising 0.8 per cent.But, shares in some retailers were falling sharply. Abercrombie & Fitch beat analyst expectations with earnings of 35 cents a share but its shares slumped 8.7 per cent to $64.87.Erika Maschmeyer, an analyst at Baird, said traders were unimpressed by the company’s refusal to discuss how much the poor economic environment will weight on revenue growth next year, but she expected the shares to recover in value by the end of the month.Telecom shares were the best performing sector on the S&P 500. Sprint shares continued to rise in the afterglow of Google’s bid for Motorola Mobility, with some traders predicting Google might bid for the network next. Sprint was up 3.6 per cent to $3.72 on the day, up 16 per cent for the week.Verizon and AT&T rose 2.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively as yield-seeking investors sought stocks which will pay reliable dividends.Shares in Tudou, a Chinese streaming video website, fell in their first day of trading after pricing an initial public offering late on Tuesday. The shares opened on the Nasdaq at $31. The stock finished 7.4 per cent lower at $26.85. “We cannot time the market,” said Gary Wang, Tudou chief executive. “But long-term investors like our story a lot. Fundamentally, it’s a play on the size of the Chinese consumer market and our focus on entertainment video is especially appealing to young consumers.”The pricing offered hopes that the IPO market could be thawing after freezing during the market volatility earlier in August but investors still appeared to be skittish. Tudou was forced to price its offering at an almost 60 per cent discount to rival Youku, whose shares were up 10.7 per cent to $26.47 on Wednesday.Cigarette manufacturers rose on news that a group of companies led by Lorillard are suing the US government over planned graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging. Lorillard was up 3.1 per cent at $108.38. Philip Morris International gained 2 per cent to close at $69.06.
145;TGT;Target Corp;2011-08-17T16:59:42Z;US retailers report strong quarterly profits;;US retailers reported surprisingly strong quarterly results on Wednesday, offering evidence that consumers are continuing to spend in spite of fears about unemployment and a weak economy.Target, the second largest US discount retailer by revenues, said that its second-quarter net income rose 3.7 per cent from a year ago to $703m, or $1.03 a share. The company’s shares rose nearly 4 per cent in early trading as the results easily exceeded estimates of Wall Street analysts.While rival Walmart has struggled in the US during the past two years, Target tends to attract discount shoppers with higher incomes. The company has successfully remodelled many of its stores, added grocery options and said on Wednesday that customers spent more per visit during the past three months.“Serious economic challenges, including inflation, persistent unemployment, weak housing and financial markets and fiscal crises at every level of government continue to limit consumer confidence and spending,” said Gregg Steinhafel, Target's chief executive. “Though we are not immune to these factors, which are beyond our control, we remain keenly focused on ways we can create value for our guests and generate profitable sales.”In the second quarter, Target also benefited from efforts by consumers to pay off their debts. The company’s credit card business recorded a bad debt expense of just $15m, down from $138m in the same period a year ago.Laura Gurski, head of AT Kearney’s retail practice, said that as economic weakness has persisted, successful retailers have become better at managing their inventories and prices in a downbeat economy.“Retailers have fine tuned their understanding of how people are buying and have figured out how to manage their inventories and hold off on markdowns to drive better profitability,” Ms Gurski said.On Tuesday, Walmart said that it was introducing smaller product sizes to accommodate its low-income customers. But mid-range customers have been flocking to warehouse clubs such as BJ’s Wholesale to stock up on essentials and groceries.BJ’s on Wednesday reported a 27.7 per cent year-on-year jump in second-quarter earnings. Profits climbed to $45.7m, or 84 cents a share, and exceeded the company’s guidance by 10 per cent.Laura Sen, chief executive of BJ’s said that membership fees, higher merchandise margins and bigger profits from petrol helped support sales.“We are very excited about our positive sales momentum for the second quarter and first half of 2011,” Ms Sen said. “It is clear that our members are doing more of their weekly food shopping with us.”Meanwhile, Staples, the US office supply company, bucked the recent downward trend in the sector and reported a 36 per cent increase in second-quarter net income. With stronger sales to businesses and back-to-school purchases, the company raised its 2011 earnings outlook.Staples and other office suppliers have struggled in recent years, as businesses have cut back on purchases and cut jobs. Ron Sargent, chief executive, said in a conference call on Wednesday that the US economy appears to be “stuck in neutral” but an economic slowdown was unlikely.“From what I see, we have no chance at another recession,” Mr Sargent said. “I think we’re probably more likely to stay in economic purgatory for a while long longer.”
146;TGT;Target Corp;2011-08-07T16:10:16Z;Big US chains begin to ‘shrink’ their stores;;American shops are getting smaller as retailers seek to reach consumers through new compact formats in the face of a stagnant economy, demographic shifts and a growing demand for convenience.Retailers including Walmart, Office Depot and Best Buy are introducing smaller stores in urban areas, a departure from the “big box” stores on which they built their success at out-of-town sites in the past three decades.Tesco, which has forged into the US with stores that are smaller than traditional supermarkets, is shrinking its format further with convenience stores that might be dubbed “micro-boxes” by US standards.“The cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all doesn’t seem to work that well any more,” says Ira Kalish, director of global economics at Deloitte Research, who links the shrinking of stores to the diversification – or fragmentation – of consumer profiles and preferences.But the convergence of so many retailers on small formats is creating stiff competition and exacerbating the difficulties of operating on expensive and unfamiliar plots, squeezed between the offices, car parks and apartment blocks of big cities.Walmart, the discounter that dominates US retail, has opened three Walmart Express test stores in recent months and says it wants to open 15 to 20 by the end of next year.At about 15,000 sq ft, the Walmart Express stores are just 8 per cent the size of Walmart’s trademark Supercenters, which are 185,000 sq ft and cover the same ground as two-and-a-half standard football pitches.Tesco of the UK began its move into California under the Fresh & Easy brand with stores of between 7,000 sq ft and 10,000 sq ft. But to push deeper into urban areas it plans to open stores as small as 3,000 sq ft, roughly the size of a UK convenience store.“We are always looking at different sizes of stores,” says Tim Mason, chief executive of Fresh & Easy.The shrinking of stores is partly borne of the “age of convenience”, says Ken Berliner, president of Peter J Solomon, a boutique investment bank. “Consumers want more choices. Retailers need to offer whatever the consumer wants to buy, however they would like to buy it, whether in stores, through a catalogue or online.”Cash-strapped shoppers are also less willing to fund long drives to big boxes given high gas prices.That helps explain the post-crisis popularity of small-format dollar stores – Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only – which between them already have more than 20,000 stores. They, too, are building more.Consumers’ expectations for convenience have been raised by online shopping, an option that has harmed Best Buy, the US’s biggest traditional electronics retailer.Part of its response has been to create small-format Best Buy Mobile stores, which sell telephones and tablet computers and will expand in number this year by 150 to 325.Target, a Walmart rival, is next year planning to open five experimental City Target stores, which will be between 60,000 sq ft and 100,000 sq ft, compared with the typical 135,000 sq ft.The downsizing also signals that retailers are adjusting to a higher concentration of people in urban areas – one result of the housing bust, which emptied new developments in the Sunbelt states of the south-western US.John McIlwain, senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, says two deeper demographic trends are also at play.First, people in their 20s and 30s are living in urban areas longer than previous generations because they are marrying and having children later.Second, baby boomers are moving back into city centres because they want to be able to walk to shops and entertainment.But, in spite of retailers’ plans, city-centre stores are “typically not their first choice”, says Mark Keschl, national director of retail at Colliers, a property agency.Retailers can run big-box stores off a single blueprint for inventories, staffing and fixtures.But in each city location, they must adapt to a different set of constraints, ranging from narrow lanes for their trailer trucks to the existence of labour unions, he says.Some retailers are not keen on the idea. Safeway, a grocery chain whose typical stores are half the size of a Walmart Supercenter, has two small shops in California but they are “a labour of love”, says Melissa Plaisance, head of investor relations.“We are profitable in both, but it’s very hard … Hard to do enough volume to cover the costs.”
147;TGT;Target Corp;2011-07-22T16:48:00Z;Borders collapse signals a new retail chapter;;"At a store on the southwest corner of New York’s Central Park, signs blaring “Everything must go!” and “Nothing held back” were put up overnight, confirming that Borders had entered its final chapter – and that US retail was beginning a new one.The loss-making book chain was sent into liquidation this week and its going-out-of-business discounts, flagged in big yellow letters on Friday, dispelled the usually cosy feel of its Columbus Circle store.The previous day several lunchtime customers had nestled into its quieter corners: a woman browsing the religion section with a bowl of water for her dog; a man splayed like a sun-bather on the floor of the events zone.Borders’ role as a home-away-from-home is one reason why its extinction has been greeted with sadness. But the company’s demise – leaving Barnes & Noble as the US’s only national book chain – is about more than the end of an era in books.Three decades ago, the rule of thumb in US retail was that there was room for three big players in each product category. “Good, better, and best,” as Walter Loeb, a veteran retail consultant, recalls.But today, so a new theory goes, each category has room for just one specialist chain, competing with Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer by sales, and Walmart, the dominant mass merchant whose low prices yielded $260bn of US sales last year.Following the collapse of Borders – a victim of online shopping, the e-book and a dose of bad management – the book business now fits this model.It points more broadly to the slow death of diversity across big retail, a process that has been accelerated by the US’s seemingly unshakeable economic funk. With that come questions about which category will be next – and whether any can escape.Consumer electronics, another of Amazon’s strengths, went down to one national chain in 2009 when Circuit City went into liquidation, leaving struggling Best Buy in the top spot.In music – first sold in hard copy online and now easily digitised, like books – not even one national chain has survived.“We’re in a ‘no excuses’ environment,” says Faye Landes, managing director of Consumer Edge Research. “Amazon and then the recession mean there is not much room for people who aren’t good at retailing.”The broadening range of goods online and people’s growing comfort with e-commerce is well known: that is why online sales are growing at or above 15 per cent year-on-year, reaching $46bn or 4.5 per cent of all retail sales in the first quarter, according to Census Bureau data.The limited spending of all but the rich is also obvious. Steven Burd, chief executive of Safeway, the grocery chain, said this week: “My gut basically splits our customers as about 25 per cent ‘recession’s over with, times are good, spending as they always did’. And then the other 75 per cent ‘really very cautious and very concerned’.”Even Walmart cannot feel secure. It accounts for $10 of every $100 spent in US retail, according to Euromonitor, but its sales have slipped in each of the past eight quarters. For some consumers, two other big box merchants, Target and Costco, fill Walmart’s shoes.What’s also new – thanks to smartphones and comparison shopping sites – is that consumers are better informed, more canny and more eager for bargains than ever.The category where the next victims are most likely to fall is office supplies, where Office Depot, Staples and Office Max toil on.“It seems to defy logic. You’d think that’s one of the most commoditised industries,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, retail analyst at Forrester Research. But years of competition with Walmart may have pared them down to a “hyper-efficient model” early, she says.Then there is sporting goods, home to Dick’s, Hibbett Sports, Foot Locker and Sports Authority. They were once shielded by the belief that consumers would not go online to buy anything they wore. But that has been proved wrong.“Look at shoes,” says Ken Berliner, president of Peter J Solomon, a boutique investment bank. “It has the highest number of styles, colours and sizes of any category; everyone’s feet are different; but even so, Zappos [acquired by Amazon in 2009] has been incredibly successful online, continuing to take share from brick-and-mortar retailers.”Groceries is one category where the US is not expected to see an online retailer such as the UK’s Ocado, because selling perishable goods is too difficult and expensive outside high-density cities. Both Walmart and Amazon are doing tests, but they have not found a profitable model.For other bricks-and-mortar retailers, the outlook is not unremittingly bleak.Leon Nicholas, senior vice president at Kantar Retail, a consultancy, says that if diversity is dying, it is only among the bigger stores: “What we’re seeing is a more fragmented, postmodern sort of marketplace, where shoppers slide across channels and retailers.”There is still demand for small stores that are quirky or localised. Among bigger stores, most analysts say the winners will be those that make shopping more than a chore.“Consumers want to be entertained as they shop,” says Mr Berliner. “Better retailers create an original and exciting store experience. They understand how to entice people into their stores and make them feel good about purchasing their goods.”The leading examplar is a technology company: Apple.Its stores are so admired that JC Penney, a department store, has recruited the man behind them, Ron Johnson, as its chief executive. They have even been cloned – transparent staircases and all – by ambitious fraudsters in China, as an expat blogger revealed this week.It is a painful irony for Borders that, with its comfy corners and knowledgeable staff, it scored high marks on the experience scale. But the forces massed against it were too great."
148;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Amazon urges California referendum on online tax;;Amazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, is set for a political fight in California after it called for a referendum on the state’s controversial move to tax online shopping.The call is likely to sharpen a confrontation between Amazon and bricks-and-mortar rivals including Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have backed moves to make online retailers collect sales tax from shoppers.California’s tax measure was included in the state budget passed last month as it struggles to reduce a $9.6bn deficit. Most US online shoppers do not pay sales tax, because the US does not have a federal tax law on e-commerce, but California is the eighth state to introduce a local tax.The sales tax issue is laying bare tensions between traditional retailers and online rivals that have been steadily grabbing market share from them in recent years.A referendum petition was filed last week by a California-based consultant who works for Amazon, which is itself based in Washington state.Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, presented the issue late on Monday as “a referendum on jobs and investment”, after Amazon announced last month that it would cut ties with online advertising partners in California to escape the tax.Mr Misener said in a statement: “We support this referendum against the recent sales tax legislation because, with unemployment at well over 11 per cent, Californians deserve a voice and a choice about jobs, investment and the state’s economic future.”A lobbying group representing bricks-and-mortar retailers, the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, quickly hit back at Amazon.“Amazon.com’s actions prove that the online-only retailer will say and do anything to maintain an unfair competitive advantage over brick-and-mortar businesses in California,” said Danny Diaz, spokesman for the alliance. “The lengths Amazon will go to evade collecting sales taxes – even spending tens of millions of dollars on a ballot referendum – should concern all Californians.”The alliance’s members complain that a tax loophole has given online retailers an unfair price advantage and are calling for “a level playing field”. They include Walmart, Home Depot and Best Buy as well as Target, Sears and JC Penney.Under the California tax measure, online retailers must collect a sales levy if they have a presence in the state, including a relationship with a local website that redirects shoppers in exchange for a fee.Overstock.com and some smaller online retailers have followed Amazon’s lead in cutting ties with online advertisers in California, in an attempt to avoid having a tax presence.Any individual or company can arrange a public referendum in California, but they must first show that there is sufficient support for the measure. Amazon will have to collect more than 500,000 signatures at least a month before any ballot.California’s constitution has been changed multiple times over the years by successful voter initiatives and public referendums, which have extended the state’s constitution to the extent that it is now the third longest in the world, with only India and the state of Alabama having longer constitutions.
149;TGT;Target Corp;2011-07-08T21:16:38Z;Wall St tumbles on disappointing jobs data;;Financial stocks led the way down in the final session of a choppy week on Wall Street as weaker-than-expected employment numbers dashed hopes that the “soft patch” in the US economy was coming to an end.The S&P financial index was down 1.3 per cent at the close, but the energy, industrial and technology sectors were not far behind as investors dumped riskier assets after the disappointing employment data.BB&T suffered the most in the financial sector, losing 3.3 per cent to $26.09. Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent to $10.71, despite news that it had reached a deal to sell its Balboa Life Insurance unit to Securian Financial, a US provider of insurance and retirement plans.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index was down 0.7 per cent at 1,343.81, although the measure was still up 0.3 per cent over the week.The losses were prompted by news that the US economy had added only 18,000 jobs in June, which was well below the 105,000 expected by economists.“This is terribly disappointing news,” said Brett Hammond, senior economist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management. “It is easy for the markets to shrug off one month of bad data, but this is two months in a row now,” he said.The negative reaction to the data were particularly acute due to strong ADP employment numbers in the previous session, which had raised hopes that Friday’s data would be strong.The ADP report showed that 157,000 private jobs had been created in June, ahead of the 95,000 expected, causing many analysts to revise upwards their expectations for the official number.This raising and then dashing of hopes left cyclical stocks sharply lower in the session after gaining on Thursday.In the industrial space, Caterpillar was down 1.1 per cent to $110.41 despite news that China’s regulator had approved its acquisition of mining equipment firm, Bucyrus International.Elsewhere, Cummins was down 1.9 per cent at $106.77 while the S&P industrial index was 1.2 per cent lower.The worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index was JDS Uniphase, which fell 4.6 per cent to $15.94. The S&P technology index was down 0.5 per cent, paring some of its 9 per cent gain over the past two weeks.The best performing sectors were defensives. The S&P utilities index was down 0.3 per cent while the telecommunications sector fell 0.3 per cent.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was up 1.6 per cent at 16.21.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 12,657.05, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,859.81. But in spite of these losses, the indices were up 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, over the week.Before the losses on Friday, the Dow was just 0.7 per cent short of a three-year high and Nasdaq was less than 0.1 cent away from a ten-year peak. These near-records came after two weeks of gains on Wall Street as investors began thinking the recent soft patch in the US – which pushed stocks down more than 7 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was finally coming to an end.The ADP employment data on Thursday appeared to strengthen the bullish case, causing a “risk on” trade. Investors were also looking to position themselves for a healthy earnings season, which begins on Monday when Alcoa reports.But the data on Friday left investors wondering if the strong 5.9 per cent rebound in the last two weeks may have been premature.“Hopefully, with supply disruptions related to the Japan earthquake and tsunami fading, and oil prices off their peaks, the labour market will perk up again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.“If not, it is going to be an uglier second half than most anticipate,” he added.In corporate news this week, News Corp was in focus as the furore over allegations of phone hacking at one of its British newspapers escalated. The stock was down 7.3 per cent at $16.75 over the week, as the paper in question was closed down and some speculated that News Corp’s proposed takeover of BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, could be in jeopardy.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performers this week, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.14 after reporting strong retail sales numbers.
150;TGT;Target Corp;2011-07-07T21:10:11Z;Wall Street boosted by employment data;;Wall Street bounced higher after US employment data surpassed expectations and a number of retailers reported strong same-store sales, helping the markets to shake off the malaise of the last few days.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performing stock on the S&P 500, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.67 after reporting a 4.5 per cent rise in June same store sales, which was at the top end of its projected range.Elsewhere, Limited Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, rose 2.7 per cent to $40.35 as same-store sales jumped 12 per cent last month, easily topping the 3.8 per cent expected by analysts.Hot Topic, the teen retailer, was up 13.2 per cent to $8.40 while Kohl’s added 7 per cent to $55.78 after also reporting healthy sales numbers.Urban Outfitters was up 6 per cent to $32.58, helped by a ratings upgrade.This raft of strong news left the S&P retail sector up 2.4 per cent, while the S&P consumer discretionary sector climbed 1.3 per cent, one of the best performing major indices in the session.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent to 1,353.22, the first substantial rise in a mostly flat week, led by the financial, industrial, technology as well as the consumer discretionary sectors as strong employment data prompted a “risk on” trade on Wall Street.Sentiment was boosted by news that the Automatic Data Processing number on employment had come in better than expected. The survey found that 157,000 private jobs had been added to the US economy in June, which was ahead of the 95,000 that had been forecast by economists.This raised hopes that the crucial non-farm employment data on Friday, which is closely watched by the markets as an indicator of the strength of the US economy, would come in strong as well. Analysts upgraded their expectations for non-farm payrolls following the ADP figure.Separately, labor department figures showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment benefits slipped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 418,000 last week, which was better than the 420,000 reading economists had expected.This healthy data added weight to the bullish argument that the last few months of weak economic data – which left the markets down 7.2 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was just a summer “slow patch” from which the US economy would recover.“The recent ISM data, the same store sales figures and the ADP report all bolsters the case that the soft patch was indeed just a temporary blip,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist with ING Investment Management.Hopes that the US economic recovery would begin to accelerate again helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.7 per cent to 12,719.57.The Nasdaq Composite added 1.4 per cent to 2,872.66, closing just a fraction away from a fresh decade-long high.Financial stocks were the best performing of the session as risk appetite improved and traders positioned themselves for a healthy official jobs report on Friday.JP Morgan Chase was one of the best performing financial stocks, adding 1.9 per cent to $41.32 as its private investment arm, One Equity Partners, agreed to buy APAC Customer Services, an outsourced services company, for $470m.Shares in APAC were up 55.2 per cent to $8.44.In other news, NYSE Euronext was up 3 per cent to $35.40 after its shareholders voted to approve the proposed tie up with Deutsche Börse, clearing the first of many hurdles in the merger process.The energy and materials sector were also up in the session as commodity prices ticked higher. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, was up 3.7 per cent to $55.49 while Halliburton added 3.1 per cent to $54.30.The S&P materials index was up 1.5 per cent while the energy index added 1.4 per cent.The technology sector also benefited from the “risk on“ trade, adding 1.1 per cent. The sector was led by KLA Tencor, a semiconductor equipment maker, which was up 7 per cent to $42.53, bouncing back to its 50-day moving average line.Utility, healthcare and telecommunication stocks were among the worst performing as investors rotated out of defensive sectors.Pfizer was down 2.7 per cent to $20.23, leading the losses in the healthcare sector, as the drugmaker said it was considering spinning off its animal health and nutritional unit to focus on the pharmaceutical business.The S&P utility sector was up 0.4 per cent, while the telecom and healthcare indices were flat.In other news, News Corp saw high volume trading after the media group closed one of its popular British newspapers amidst a furore over phone hacking, but the stock was only down 0.2 per cent to $17.43.
151;TGT;Target Corp;2011-06-15T00:59:04Z;Apple retail head to lead JC Penney;;"Shares of JC Penney, the mid-market US department store, surged more than 17 per cent after the company announced it had recruited Apple’s head of retail to be its next chief executive.JC Penney, which has about 1,100 stores, said on Tuesday that Ron Johnson, senior vice-president of retail at Apple for the past 11 years, would take over from Mike Ullman as chief executive in November.JC Penney said Mr Johnson would invest $50m of his own money in its stock “as a demonstration of his confidence in JC Penney’s long-term potential”. JC Penney shares closed up 17.4 per cent at $35.37 in New York.Mr Johnson, 52, will face the task of boosting the company’s performance after sales fell in each of the past three years as consumers abandoned middle market retailers following the financial crisis.Mr Ullman, chief executive since 2004, had not previously indicated that he was preparing to step down. He will stay on as executive chairman and retain responsibility for store organisation and the supply chain.“We are not surprised to see top talent get recruited from Apple given years of unparalleled success,” said Ben Reitzes, information technology analyst at Barclays Capital. “Also many executives have become so wealthy, they can afford to take risks.”In an effort to boost its profitability, JC Penney said in January that it would wind down the catalogue operations on which it built its name; close six underperforming stores; and shut two of its five customer service call centres.It also gave board seats to two activist investors, Bill Ackman and Steven Roth, who have stakes in the company, a move that forestalled the possibility of a proxy battle over strategy.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square fund and Mr Roth’s Vornado own about 18 per cent and 11 per cent respectively of JC Penney.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, said she expected Mr Johnson “to improve JC Penney’s merchandising … in-store experience and customer service”.Mr Johnson, who will join JC Penney’s board in August, oversaw the birth of Apple’s retail network and its growth over a decade to 323 stores in eleven countries, including outlets in New York, Paris and Shanghai noted for their innovative design.Apple’s stores have welcomed more than 1bn visitors, with a record 71m visiting in the last quarter, up 51 per cent from a year earlier. Sales were up 90 per cent at $3.2bn.Mr Johnson previously worked for 15 years at Target, a discount retailer that is among those to have won the business of cost-conscious shoppers from stores such as JC Penney."
152;TGT;Target Corp;2011-05-19T21:38:20Z;US retail: shopaholic investors;For those who like growth, there are dynamic companies in the group;A dozen prominent American retailers displayed their financial wares last week, from big boxers (Walmart, Target) to hip clothiers (Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters) to niche sellers (Petsmart, Williams-Sonoma). While the results were not quite celebratory, they were hardly funereal. On average top lines were up five per cent year-on-year, while same-store sales came in around 2 per cent. Operating margins for the 12 companies on average expanded a bit. The biggest stores (Home Depot, Walmart, Target) had a hard fight against market saturation and the law of large numbers, but most managed to produce some kind of growth. Guidance was middling. With a few exceptions (looking at you, Staples) there were no awful surprises.If the retail results this week were so pedestrian, however, why do investors seem to treat the sector like shoppers with unlimited credit? The share prices of the 12 companies trade at an average prospective price-to-earnings ratio of 17 times (excluding Sears, whose lack of earnings inflate the ratio). At that price, same-store sales growth lagging nominal output growth looks decidedly less attractive. For a similar or lower valuation investors can have Apple, which grew 80 per cent last quarter, or SABMiller, whose exposure to emerging markets any American retailer would give their eye teeth for.Still, for those who like growth, there are some dynamic companies in the group. Abercrombie’s naughty ads must be working to generate double-digit same store sales to go along with improved profitability. The firm’s p/e ratio, at 45 times, is less of a turn-on. Investors who insist on retail exposure would do well to shun glamour and look to humble Dollar Tree, which has sales approaching Abercrombie’s level, a sector-average valuation, and a strategy – really, really cheap products – that make sense even if the shopping habit remains subdued.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
153;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target’s credit card profit offsets slow sales;;Target, the discount US retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent rise in first-quarter profit as better-than-expected results in its credit card business offset softer sales at its stores.Profit rose to $689m, or 99 cents a share, in the first three months of the year from $671m, or 90 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2010, beating Wall Street’s expectations of 94 cents a share.“Our first-quarter financial performance was the result of stronger-than-expected profitability in our credit card segment, which offset the impact of weaker-than-anticipated sales in our retail segment,” said Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive.Sales were up 2.8 per cent to $15.6bn, with sales at stores open at least a year rising 2 per cent. Including credit card revenues, total revenues rose 2.2 per cent to $15.9bn.While income from Target’s credit card business fell 18.3 per cent to $355m, expenses were sharply lower as the company wrote off less bad debt, leaving the segment’s profits 74 per cent higher at $194m.Mr Steinhafel said the addition of a fresh grocery section to many stores and Target’s credit card rewards programme “continue to deliver incremental traffic and sales in an environment where our guests remain cautious in their spending”.Target’s shares fell 1.6 per cent to $49.96 in New York on Wednesday.
154;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Energy and materials lift Wall Street;;Strong earnings from Dell buoyed related technology stocks and helped lift sentiment on Wall Street, pulling the wider markets into positive territory for the first time in three sessions.Dell was up 5.4 per cent to $16.75, making the stock one of the best performing on the S&P 500, after the company reported a 177 per cent rise in first-quarter profits.The better than expected jump in earnings came thanks to growth in sales to large businesses, which outweighed the weakness in sales to retail customers.Dell raised its earnings and revenue outlook for the year, in contrast to Hewlett-Packard, which lowered its forecast in the previous session as the weakness in consumer markets ate away at earnings.Shares in HP were down 9.7 per cent this week after falling another 1.1 per cent on Wednesday to $36.49.The results from Dell boosted related stocks in the computer hardware sector. NetApp, a provider of data storage, was up 2.5 per cent to $53.61, while Western Digital added 1.4 per cent to $36.82.Apple, the second most valuable company in the world by market capitalisation, gained 1.1 per cent to $339.87.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,340.68, its best day of trading in nearly a month. The index was helped higher by energy and materials stocks, which benefited from a rise in commodity prices.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, gained 3.8 per cent to $48.62, helping the S&P materials index up 2.1 per cent. Marathon Oil, the energy group, added 3 per cent to $51.53 as the wider S&P energy index put on 2 per cent.The gains helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 0.7 per cent to 12,560.18 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 1.1 per cent to 2,815.The markets saw little reaction to the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting in April which yielded no major surprises.The markets have been in a correctional phase since the beginning of the month, with the S&P 500 falling 1.7 per cent in the past few weeks. Sentiment has been weighed down by commodity price swings, European debt woes and worries about the end of QE2.The concerns have led to a classic “risk off” trade, with investors rotating away from cyclical stocks and into more defensive sectors.The S&P healthcare and utility sectors are up 3.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively this month while the energy and materials sectors are down 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent.The utility sector saw the day’s worst losses as the broader markets ticked up, prompting commentators to suggest this defensive rotation was coming to an end.“The defensive names have been overbought in the past few weeks and the riskier names have been oversold,” said Quincy Krosby, strategist for Prudential Financial.The retail sector was in focus after mixed results.Shares in Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen fashion retailer, were up 3.4 per cent to $75.69 after the company reported a bigger than expected swing in first-quarter profits as margins and international sales improved.The stock is up more than 30 per cent so far this year.Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.7 per cent rise in first-quarter profit thanks to better than expected results in its credit card businessBut the stock was 1.6 per cent lower to $49.96 as investors worried about the softer sales at its stores.Shares in Staples were hit by a strong reaction to the office-supply company’s first-quarter earnings.The stock was down 15.4 per cent to $16.63 after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results and lowered its full-year earnings forecast by 15 cents a share to $1.35-$1.45.Staples posted a profit of 28 cents a share or $198.2m, short of the 32 cents expected.The S&P retail sector was down 0.3 per cent.Shares in Analog Devices were up 5.9 per cent to $42.60 after the chipmaker reported a 45 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings and lifted its forecasts for the current quarter above expectations. The company raised its dividend.John Deere, the top manufacturer of farm equipment by revenue, reported healthy earnings and raised its full-year outlook due to growing demand for tractors from farmers benefiting from the commodity boom. But investors were hoping for more, and the stock was down 0.5 per cent to $86.50.
155;TGT;Target Corp;2011-05-16T21:30:05Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;Shares in NYSE Euronext fell sharply after Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid, while in the wider markets the week kicked off in negative territory after a slew of disappointing economic data and some mixed earnings results.NYSE Euronext dropped 11.1 per cent to $36.36 after a joint bid from Nasdaq and ICE for the exchange was withdrawn. The $11bn offer had been higher than NYSE’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.The two exchanges, which had been threatening to go hostile with their bid after it was rejected by the NYSE board, blamed the move on a failure to secure regulatory approval from US authorities.Shares in Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while ICE was up 3.3 per cent to $122.22.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,329.147 as weak data on housing and manufacturing left investors feeling uneasy.Figures from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing growth in the New York area had fallen to its lowest level in five months.The Empire State manufacturing index fell from 21.7 in April to 11.9 in May, the lowest level since December and well below economists’ expectations of 19.9.Separately, the National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index stayed at low levels, highlighting the weakness of the US housing market.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4 per cent to 12,548.30 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,782.31.This follows a loss of 1.9 per cent on the S&P 500 over the past two weeks as commodity prices tumbled lower and investors worried about the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece.The retail sector lost ground in the session as a week of earnings reports from big industry groups kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from cost reductions and from strong sales in its exclusive brand names.But sentiment in the sector was weighed on by Lowe’s lacklustre results.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as the weak housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company blamed the 1.6 per cent fall in sales on poor weather and the housing market. Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents a share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts.Shares in Lowe’s fell 3.6 per cent to $24.83 while JC Penney fell 3.2 per cent to $37.21, dragged down with the rest of the sector.The S&P retail sector was down 1 per cent, one of the worst performing on Wall Street. Last Monday, Macy’s reported strong results and later this week Home Depot, Walmart and Target will report their first-quarter earnings.The general ‘risk off’ trade hit technology stocks the hardest, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 per cent.These losses were led by Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, was down 8.3 per cent to $14.99 while Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $15.81. Salesforce.com, which provides an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data, lost 4.4 per cent to $128.96.In deal news, Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan for $1.1bn. The news sent Joy Global up 1 per cent to $88.36, but Rowan lost 0.2 per cent to $37.96.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Siga Technologies added 2.3 per cent to $14.52 after the pharmaceutical company said it had won a $433m contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services to deliver 2m courses of its smallpox antiviral.The contract includes options that would raise the total value to approximately $2.8bn.Merck, another drugmaker, was up 0.6 per cent to $37.30 after it won approval to launch a new hepatitis C drug after the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in clinical trials.Iron Mountain, the US information storage company, was up 0.7 per cent to $32.67 after Autonomy, the UK software group, said it had agreed to buy selected assets of the company’s digital arm for $380m in cash.
156;TGT;Target Corp;2011-05-16T16:37:19Z;Mixed start to week of US retail earnings;;A week of earnings reports from major US retailers kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from both cost reductions and strong sales in its exclusive brand names.Net income for the quarter came in at $64m, or 28 cents a share, which was up from 25 cents a share last year and ahead of the 26 cents expected by analysts.The retailer’s plan to differentiate itself from its competitors with unique clothing lines bore some fruit. The 3.8 per cent rise in comparable-store sales in the quarter was driven by its exclusive brands such as Liz Claiborne, Worthington and MNG by Mango.Profits were also aided by cost-cutting measures, including the closure of call centres. The company also saw a helpful 60 per cent reduction in its non-cash qualified pension expenses.JC Penney promised more cost-saving measures over the coming years, saying that it expects to save about $25m to $30m by 2013, with about half of those reductions coming in 2012.“We expect these ongoing actions will result in substantial expense savings, beginning this year, and allow us to significantly accelerate profitability,” said Myron Ullman the chief executive officer.JC Penney also raised its full-year guidance to as much as $2.25 per share, ahead of the $2.10 it had forecast in February and more than the $2.09 expected by analysts. The stock was up 4 per cent to $40 in early trading.But elsewhere in the sector, the first-quarter results released by Lowe’s were less promising.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as a lacklustre housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company said that the 1.6 per cent fall in sales to $12.2bn was due to poor weather and the weak real estate sector.“During the quarter, we faced ongoing economic pressures, unfavourable weather conditions and tough comparisons to last year’s government stimulus programs,” said Robert Niblock, chief executive officer.Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts. The stock was down 2.3 per cent to $25.16.These mixed results follow on from strong earnings from Macy’s last Wednesday, and kick off a busy earnings week in the retail sector.This week will see Home Depot, Walmart and Target report their first-quarter earnings. Investors appeared nervous following the mixed results on Monday, and the S&P retail sector was down 0.4 per cent in early trading.
157;TGT;Target Corp;2011-05-05T18:57:29Z;Easter spending boosts US retail sales;;"US retail sales grew strongly in April as discount promotions and the Easter holiday persuaded consumers to spend more than expected, in spite of rising inflation and a weak labour market.Sales were up 8.7 per cent from a year ago at stores open at least 12 months, equalling the largest monthly gain in the past 11 years, according to Retail Metrics.But against a backdrop of continued economic uncertainty, analysts warned that life for shoppers and retailers would get tougher as the year went on and the pain of adjusting to inflation grew.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said that after June “all bets are off”.Gap, the clothing retailer, said its April sales were 8 per cent higher than a year ago, bouncing back from a 10 per cent decline last month.The best performer was Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, whose sales grew 20 per cent.But department stores other than Macy’s failed to meet expectations.David Bassuk, head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, said many of the better performing retailers had offered aggressive low-price promotions, but at
the cost of narrower profit margins.“We continue to see consumers responding to value and promotions. They want the deal,” he said.“Consumers are not showing any signs of being willing to accept price increases.”Gap, which has offered particularly big discounts, was forced to lower its earnings forecast for the first quarter. It also said its design chief, Patrick Robinson, was leaving the company, as it struggles to revitalise its product range.Among permanent discount retailers, sales at Target stores rose 13 per cent while Costco said its comparable store sales – excluding petrol – rose 6 per cent.Some retailers were boosted by the late timing of Easter, because the traditional pre-holiday shopping surge that took place last year in late March instead came in April this year.Both retailers and consumer goods companies are facing a difficult combination of rising input inflation and consumers who they know may stop buying if prices increase.Sara Lee, the US food company, said on Thursday that its price increases – including a 6 per cent rise in its retail division from a year ago – would hit sales volumes this year. It lowered its earnings outlook.Estée Lauder, the upmarket beauty brand, said that rising fuel prices were not yet affecting its high-end consumers, but acknowledged that more dramatic rises in petrol prices would damp consumer sentiment and eventually be a drag on business.Mr Bassuk said: “Unemployment is rising; consumer confidence is at low levels; gas prices have hit $5 [a gallon] in some cities; food prices are up. Summer is going to be very difficult for retailers focused on the discretionary spend.”"
158;TGT;Target Corp;2011-04-07T21:12:53Z;Wall Street dips on Japan quake news;;The industrial and technology sectors helped lead Wall Street lower after another earthquake hit the already devastated north-east coast of Japan.The industrial sector saw the sharpest falls. The S&P industrial index fell 0.5 per cent, led by General Electric, which was down 1 per cent to $20.35, and 3M, which fell 0.7 per cent to $93.19.General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, lost 6.9 per cent in the days following last month’s Japanese earthquake.“This is another setback for the markets, raising the level on the global uncertainty thermometer just another touch,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Technology stocks, which saw sharp losses after the previous earthquake due to supply worries, were hit by the news.JDS Uniphase lost 3 per cent to $18.99, while Cisco Systems fell 0.9 per cent to $17.91. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.5 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,333.51, recovering from the much sharper losses earlier in the session after a tsunami warning was lifted in Japan and officials at the nuclear agency there said no further troubles had been reported following the earthquake.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,409.49 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,796.14.Before the earthquake, the markets had been hovering in neutral territory as traders reacted warily to the decision by the European Central Bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent, a move that suggested the era of ultra-loose monetary policy was coming to an end.Helping to limit the losses of the session was strong US economic data. Figures from the labour department showed that new applications for unemployment benefits had dropped by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week, in a further sign that the US labour market was continuing to improve.“The downward trend continues, as the pace of lay-offs by small businesses slows further,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Elsewhere on Wall Street, retail stocks were in focus after a number of same-store sales figures from key industry leaders. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 3.8 per cent to $77.82.Elsewhere, Limited Brands rose 1.6 per cent to $35.80 after the clothing retailer, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported same-store sales had climbed 1.4 per cent in March, beating the 1.1 per cent rise that was expected by analysts.Bed Bath & Beyond saw some of the strongest gains in the session, rising 10.5 per cent to $54.55 after the home furnishings retailer forecast annual earnings of $3.38 to $3.53 a share, more than the $3.33 expected by analysts.“The company delivered a high quality beat with better than anticipated sales,” said analysts at Citigroup.But the results from the retail sector were not all positive. Gap, the clothing retailer, reported same-store sales down 10 per cent, while Target reported sales down 5.5 per cent. Shares in Gap lost 1.5 per cent to $22.72 while Target was down 2.6 per cent to $49.62.Overall though, the results were better than expected and so the retail sector was up 0.4 per cent.In corporate news, Newmont Mining, the largest gold miner in the US by market capitalisation, was up 3.3 per cent to $58.29 after announcing plans to increase its annual gold production to approximately 7m ounces by 2017, a 35 per cent increase from current levels.The company also announced a new dividend policy that will link its quarterly dividend payment to its average realised price of gold sales. The price of gold has gone up 65 per cent in the past two years and is now trading around record highs near $1,450 a troy ounce.Among other companies in focus, Rite Aid put on 1.9 per cent to $1.08, reporting that its fiscal fourth quarter loss had narrowed slightly. Pier 1 Imports added 10.5 per cent to $11.65 after the home furnishings retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 48 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate.
159;TGT;Target Corp;2011-04-07T19:08:44Z;Luxury US brands enjoy sales boost;;"Luxury and specialist brands such as Victoria’s Secret enjoyed an uptick in US retail spending in March, while middle-market retailers led by Gap suffered as consumers grew in confidence but shopped selectively.Retail sales grew by about 2 per cent year on year as the impact of high fuel prices and worries over crises in the Arab world and Japan were offset by an improving US labour market.But while Victoria’s Secret, a lingerie chain owned by Limited Brands, reported sales up 19 per cent at stores open a year or more, sales for Gap in North America fell by 9 per cent.“It is not a rising tide that lifts all ships,” said Richard Jaffe, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “The consumer is discerning. The more premium products and brands seem to be faring better; the less-prestigious brands and the lower-priced products are not faring so well.”Gap’s woes were exacerbated by an effort to revamp its product line-up and marketing, which the company acknowledged have been problematic. It shook up its management in February, including the appointment of a new creative director.Luxury department stores also reported strong figures, with sales up 11.1 per cent at Saks and 8.8 per cent higher at Neiman Marcus. Sales at Nordstrom, an upmarket fashion store, rose 5.1 per cent.“The retailers have to be happy with how things shaped up this month. The consumers have been resilient,” said Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics. “What was underestimated was the improving jobs picture over the past several months, which is giving consumers more confidence to spend.”In March, the US economy generated a stronger-than-expected 216,000 jobs, the second consecutive month of growth.But on the divergence in retailers’ fortunes, Mr Perkins said: “Strong performers are gaining strength and the weaker ones not.”Among mid-market and low-end department stores, sales were down 1 per cent at Dillards and 6.5 per cent at Kohl’s. Target, a discount retailer, reported a 5.5 per cent fall.Headline figures from Retail Metrics showed retail sales up 2.2 per cent in March while the International Council of Shopping Centers reported a 2 per cent gain.The growth was down from an expansion of 4 per cent in February, but would have been higher had it not been for distortions stemming from the late timing of Easter this year.Many Americans buy clothes in a new season splurge in the weeks leading up to the Easter break. With Easter Sunday falling on April 4 last year, March caught a large chunk of that shopping. But with the holiday this year on April 24, it had no impact last month.Sherif Mityas, a partner in the retail practice at AT Kearney, a management consultancy, said: “People need to be encouraged but still cautious, because there are a lot of pressures.“Unemployment is better, but there are still a lot of people out of work. Inflationary pressures are rising and at some point those costs are going to need to be passed on.”"
160;TGT;Target Corp;2011-02-25T00:18:57Z;Retailer results show US consumer caution;;Results from US retailers show that consumers remain cautious with their purchases amid a fragile economic recovery and growing signs of inflation.Target, the discount retailer, said on Thursday that its fourth-quarter profits grew on the strength of a successful holiday shopping season and its improving credit card business.Kathy Tesija, head of merchandising, told analysts Target shoppers remain cautious and focused on lower-end products and groceries.“Guests are telling us that they are still risk averse, they’re concerned about losing their jobs and focused on controlling household budgets, leading to increased coupon use and a focus on promotions,” she said.A surge in profits in its credit card business gave Target a boost, as customers took advantage of a new rewards programme. The unit reported $151m in income during the fourth quarter, up from $39m in the same period a year earlier, and Target’s bad debt expenses fell from $284m in the fourth quarter of 2009 to $83m in the latest quarter.Net income rose by 10.5 per cent to $1.035bn, or $1.45 a share, up from $936m, or $1.24, in the same period a year ago. Target’s revenues grew by 2.8 per cent to $20.3bn during the final three months of last year.Comparable store sales, which rose by 2.4 per cent, surpassed those of its larger rival Walmart, which earlier this week reported its seventh consecutive quarterly same-store sales decline. Signs of consumer caution were also evident in Sears’ earnings, as shoppers steered toward lower-end discount products.Profits at Sears fell by 13.4 per cent to $374m, or $3.43 per share, with comparable store sales at the US retailer falling by 1.2 per cent. But at Kmart, its discount branch, sales picked up by 2.5 per cent.At Kohl’s, the department store chain, shoppers over the age of 60 will soon be eligible to receive special discounts in an effort to offset rising clothing prices.“Apparel inflation is clearly real, but we believe we have had the time, the tools and the processes to work through it effectively and have a competitive advantage for both us and our consumer,” said Kevin Mansell, chief executive of Kohl’s, as the company reported a 14 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits.Meanwhile, comparable store sales at Gap, the clothing company, were flat during the final three months of last year. However, fourth-quarter profits rose by 4 per cent to $365m, or 60 cents a share and Gap announced an increase to its 2011 dividend.
161;TGT;Target Corp;2011-02-24T15:22:10Z;Year of ‘foundation building’ takes toll on GM earnings;;General Motors lost ground after quarterly earnings figures disappointed investors, while the wider markets hovered in neutral territory as positive sentiment created by healthy employment data were negated by the continuing unrest in north Africa.The carmaker reported its best yearly earnings figure in more than a decade and the first profitable year since 2004. But fourth-quarter profits came in at $510m, or 31 cents a share, which was below expectations.Daniel Akerson, chief executive of GM, said that 2010 had been a year of “foundation building”. Shares in GM were down 4.5 per cent to $33.02, while rival Ford Motor lost 1.1 per cent to $14.70.In the wider markets, sentiment was lifted by promising weekly unemployment data. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped by 22,000 to 391,000 last week, ahead of the 5,000 fall expected by most economists.The more stable four-week moving average of new claims dropped 16,500 to 402,000 in the week, which is the lowest level since July 2008 and provides hope that the US jobs market is recovering.But investors continued to worry about the violence in Libya and the disruptions that this is causing to oil supply, fearing that sustained high oil prices could slow down the domestic economic recovery.Oil prices fell back slightly late in the day – helped by rumours on the trading floor that Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, had been shot – which took some pressure off equities.This left the S&P 500 down 0.1 per cent to 1,306.10. The index has lost 2.8 per cent this week already on geopolitical concerns. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 12,068.50, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent at 2,737.90.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, fell back 5.1 per cent in the session although it is still up nearly 30 per cent over the week.The retail sector suffered from a mixed batch of earnings reports from key industry players.Sears Holdings tumbled lower after the retailer said that profits had fallen by 13 per cent in the fourth quarter after same-store sales declined during the holiday period. That sent shares down 5.5 per cent to $82.40, the sharpest one-day fall in six months. On Wednesday, the company announced a new chief executive after a three-year search. The stock is down 11.4 per cent over the week.Elsewhere in the sector, Target reported higher same-store sales and fourth-quarter earnings. The discount retailer said that net income had risen 10.5 per cent to $1.035bn, or $1.45 a share, on the strength of a successful holiday shopping season and its improving credit card business.Comparable store sales at Target increased 2.4 per cent, helping shares climb 3.5 per cent to $52.Earlier this week rival discount retailer Walmart reported its seventh consecutive quarterly same-store sales decline.Kohl’s, the department store chain, reported a 14 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profits but gave a 2011 earnings forecast that fell short of expectations. Still, shares were up 3.4 per cent to $53.80.Not all the economic data of the session was as positive as the employment numbers.Durable goods data showed a strong 2.7 per cent increase in orders by businesses, a sign of confidence in the recovery. But most of this was down to a spike in aircraft orders. New orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft, declined 6.9 per cent in January, according to the Commerce Department.Sales of new homes also tumbled last month, damping hopes of a speedy housing market recovery. New single-family home sales fell by 12.6 per cent in January from the previous month, worse than the 8.8 per cent decline predicted by economists.Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific equipment, was up 1.7 per cent to $41.15 after lifting its full-year 2011 earnings forecast to as much as $2.63 a share, exceeding analysts’ average estimate of $2.51 a share.E-Trade Financial, the online bank and brokerage house, was down 4.8 per cent to $15.85 on reports that Citadel Investment Group, a major shareholder in E-Trade, was planning to sell most its shares.Priceline.com, the online travel company, ticked 8.5 per cent higher at $462.34 after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits and a rise in bookings.
162;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US retailers beat bad weather;;US shoppers continued to step up their spending during January, shrugging off extreme winter weather, higher fuel prices and continuing high unemployment levels.Monthly sales data from leading US retailers released on Thursday showed stronger-than-expected gains, with the Retail Metrics’ index of comparable sales growth up 4.4 per cent against the same quarter a year earlier.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said that “with signs the economy may be turning a corner here, retailers carried some of holiday 2010’s sales’ momentum into the new year”. But he warned that “retailers and consumers are still facing some headwinds from a languishing housing market, as well as 9.4 per cent unemployment”.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the sales gain was “encouraging …and suggests relatively healthy underlying consumer demand”.The increasingly buoyant consumer mood was also reflected by SpendingPulse, the monthly survey from MasterCard Advisors, which estimated that clothing sales rose 6.2 per cent during January against a year ago.SpendingPulse, which bases its estimates on MasterCard card spending and estimates of other forms of payment, said luxury spending rose 6.1 per cent, and online sales rose 12 per cent.Store chains reporting better-than-expected numbers included Limited Brands, owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain, which saw sales at stores open at least a year increase by 24 per cent.Same-store sales at Victoria’s Secret rose 35 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, also reported a better-than-expected 1 per cent increase in comparable sales against the same period a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, reported a 2.3 per cent increase in comparable sales, although Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said sales have been “restrained by the series of snowstorms that caused widespread store closures along the east coast and in the south-east”.Its online sales were up 27 per cent.JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, reported sales below Wall Street’s expectations, with JC Penney down 1.2 per cent and Kohl’s up 1.4 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said its comparable sales increase of 1.7 per cent was below its expectations, citing weakness in the north-east and south, regions affected by the bad weather.Costco, the warehouse club, said its same-store sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, rose 4 per cent.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report monthly sales data.
163;TGT;Target Corp;2011-02-03T23:50:53Z;Mastercard posts strong net income;;Mastercard’s fourth-quarter net income jumped 41 per cent, driven by the first positive growth in US consumer credit card spending in nearly three years.US consumers spent $135bn on Mastercard-branded credit cards in the fourth quarter, a 2.2 per cent increase over the prior year, and the first growth in 11 quarters.Ajay Banga, Mastercard’s chief executive, said that spending on both necessities like groceries and non-necessities like restaurants and travel had returned to pre-recessionary levels. But he said he remained cautious on future US growth barring improvement in key economic factors.“It’s hard to see sustained growth until unemployment and the housing market improves,” Mr Banga said.Mastercard’s fourth-quarter net income totalled $415m, or $3.16 a share. Wall Street analysts had been expecting the company to earn $3.04 a share. Revenue climbed 11 per cent to $1.4bn.Worldwide gross dollar volume on Mastercard-branded credit and debit cards grew 11 per cent to $752bn. Cross-border volume increased 18.7 per cent, the strongest growth in 10 quarters, said Martina Hund-Mejean, Mastercard’s chief financial officer.Improvements in Mastercard’s operational results were overshadowed by new regulations that could curtail the fees that banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped. Investors are concerned that banks will try to renegotiate the fees they pay to Visa and Mastercard for use of their networks to help offset declining merchant revenue.Mr. Banga said that the impact of the changes to Mastercard’s debit revenue would be “manageable”. But he added that the consequences for consumers were serious. “Consumers stand to bear these additional costs and in some cases face a loss to banking services,” Mr Banga said.Mastercard, along with larger rival Visa and card-issuing banks have been lobbying Congress to rethink the rule before it takes effect later this year.The fight among the card networks and banks with large merchants like Walmart and Target over these so-called “swipe” fees has been brewing for years. In 2003, Mastercard agreed to pay $1bn over 10 years to settle a class action lawsuit against itself and Visa brought by large merchants.On Thursday, Mastercard said that it had reached an agreement with Visa and card issuing banks who are defendants in another merchant-driven lawsuit that would limit any damages that Mastercard would be required to pay in the event of a settlement to 12 per cent of the total. A trial date for that case had not yet been set.Visa reported similarly strong results and concerns over the regulatory environment when it reported earnings Wednesday evening.
164;TGT;Target Corp;2011-02-03T02:20:51Z;Visa volatility over regulation fears;;Visa’s shares suffered share price volatility in spite of strong results from the first quarter, as investors remained concerned about how new debit card restrictions would affect the company’s revenue.Visa is playing a leading role in an industry-wide effort in the US to delay the implementation of new rules that would limit fees banks collect from merchants each time their debit card is swiped.Joseph Saunders, Visa’s chief executive, said in a conference call late on Wednesday to discuss the company’s first-quarter earnings: “The enactment of this legislation should be delayed and the unintended consequences should be studied.”Following the release of its results on Wednesday, the shares fell $1.09, or 1.51 per cent, to $71 in after-hours trading, before recovering the lost ground on Thursday morning.Banks say the new rules, which the Federal Reserve is in the process of writing, will result in higher costs for consumers. Large merchants such as Wal-mart and Target, which aggressively lobbied for the passage of the rules as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, say banks have overcharged them on debit card purchases for years.The debate over the fees overshadowed Visa’s first-quarter earnings, which increased 16 per cent on a continued rebound in consumer spending.The San Francisco payment processor earned $884m, or $1.23 a share, in the most recent three months, 2 cents more than Wall Street analysts had expected. Spending on Visa cards jumped 15 per cent to $897m compared with the prior year. Total transactions processed were $13bn, also a 15 per cent increase over the year-ago quarter.The new rules may loosen Visa’s and MasterCard’s grip on the debit market by requiring cards to use at least two networks, potentially opening the door to competition from rivals.The draft proposal would limit the fees set by Visa and MasterCard that merchants pay to card-issuing banks to 12 cents a transaction, an 80 per cent cut over current levels.Mr Saunders said: “We believe the government is engaged in price fixing to the benefit of no one”.To offset the lost revenue, banks have said they will start charging a monthly fee for debit cards and limit the size of transactions.J. Craig Shearman, vice-president for governmental affairs for the National Retail Federation, said: “The banks are about to lose a huge revenue stream and they are trying every last ditch effort to continue skimming money out of consumers’ pockets”.Several congressmen recently signalled that they would be open to revisiting the rules, including Barney Frank and his successor as the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Spencer Bachus, who has scheduled a tentative hearing on the matter for February 17.
165;TGT;Target Corp;2011-01-30T19:52:32Z;Visa and MasterCard warn consumers over fees;;Visa and MasterCard are spending tens of thousands of dollars on a soon-to-be-unveiled public awareness campaign designed to educate consumers on the perils of new debit card restrictions, according to people familiar with the plan.Working with major credit card issuers and smaller community banks, Visa and MasterCard are taking advantage of a rare opportunity potentially to delay the implementation of the new restrictions, which would limit the fees that banks charge merchants each time their debit card is swiped.Banks claim the changes could cost them $12bn a year in lost fees, while benefiting large retailers such as Walmart and Target.Several Congressmen recently signalled that they would be open to revisiting the rules, which became law last year as a last-minute amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act.Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was one of the architects of the regulatory overhaul, said he would be willing to work with Republicans now controlling the House of Representatives on redesigning the restrictions.Spencer Bachus, who replaced Mr Frank as the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee following the midterm elections, has scheduled a tentative hearing for February 17.The Federal Reserve is currently accepting comments on a proposal to cap the fees at 12 cents per transaction, roughly a 70 per cent reduction from current rates.If finalised, the restriction would be a victory for large merchants, which have long argued that banks overcharge them for processing debit card transactions.“A debit card is nothing more than a plastic cheque,” said J. Craig Shearman, the vice-president of governmental affairs for the National Retail Federation. “It draws money out of the same account as a paper cheque, yet paper cheques clear at face value.”Banks claim that debit cards carry additional costs, including fraud protection and an instant guarantee of payment. They have warned that the cap being proposed by the Fed would only cover one-fifth of those expenses.To make up for the shortfall, some banks say they could add monthly fees to debit cards or restrict their use – ultimately forcing consumers to pay more for everyday banking services.Other perks are also likely to disappear. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is doing away with a programme that allowed customers to waive current account fees if they used their debit card five times a month.In addition to curtailing bank revenue, the rules would hurt Visa and MasterCard, which set the fees, by potentially opening the debit card networks they run to more competition.
166;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Republican donor trail offers 2012 clues;;A long list of possible Republican presidential candidates have been busy raising millions of dollars over the past two years, although not a single one has officially thrown his – or her – hat in the ring.Campaign finance experts say it is unusual that, even at this early stage of the 2012 presidential contest, Republican candidates have not yet begun to organise campaign committees or raise funds formally at the level necessary to win the Republican nomination to take on Barack Obama.But a review of federal campaign data shows the potential candidates were able to raise a substantial amount of money to promote themselves and back other Republican candidates’ political campaigns.While these funds may not be used for a presidential campaign – a candidate must officially announce their intention to run and create a separate committee for that purpose – the contributions donated to the candidates from 2009 to 2010 offer a picture of the kinds of donors lining up for what is likely to be a tough Republican primary contest.The former Republican speaker of the House, who will announce whether he is running for president in April, has proved to be one of the most adept fundraisers so far. A tax-exempt issue advocacy group chaired by Mr Gingrich, called American Solutions for Winning the Future, raised – and spent – about $24.4m from 2009 to October 2010, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Leading contributors include big coal interests such as Peabody Energy and Arch Coal, a group that is at loggerheads with the Obama administration over a permit that was revoked by environmental regulators.Other big donors include Las Vegas Sands, which gave the group $500,000. It is unclear if the donation came from executives or the company, a resort and gaming group that generates most of its revenue from casinos in Macao and Singapore. Crow Holdings, a Texas-based real estate investment group, gave $350,000.American Solutions, which is advocating a campaign to end the Obama healthcare reforms, has spent $11.7m to create a direct mail fundraising network.According to tax records, American Solutions also paid out $235,000 in “small loans” to a holding company controlled by Mr Gingrich in 2009. A spokesman for the group said it was repaying a loan Gingrich Holdings had made to the political organisation a year earlier “as a precaution to make sure it had cash flow”.Mr Gingrich and his associates have also spent $2.2m in private chartered jet travel since 2009. The former speaker’s political action committee raised more than $700,000, and donated $125,700 to Republican candidates and other political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Ms Palin has proved to be a Republican kingmaker over the past two years, which could give her a boost among influential Tea Party lawmakers.SarahPac, her political action committee, raised $5.4m over the past two years, with about $500,000 going mostly to Tea Party candidates.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, most of the money flowing into SarahPac comes from individuals who work for single-cause organisations, people working in finance or retirees. SarahPac spent more than $1.4m on political and media consultants and fundraising over the past two years.The former Arkansas governor has raised more than $1.7m since 2009, mostly from retirees and healthcare professionals, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donors who have given $10,000 include a theatre group called Celebrity Attractionsand a Memphis gastroenterology group.Ask any Republican on Wall Street and they will tell you that Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who lost the Republican primary against John McCain in 2008, is a natural fundraiser.The former Bain executive raised $8.8m through his political action committee over the last election cycle, with much of the funds coming from the financial industry.Individuals working for Goldman Sachs donated nearly $200,000 to Mr Romney in the 2010 election cycle, followed by $88,500 from those working for Bain, the private equity group, and $40,500 from people living in a huge Florida retirement community known as The Villages.About $1.1m has been directed to Republican candidates.The Pac has spent more than $2m on campaign and fundraising expenses.The former Minnesota governor emerged on the national scene as a potential running-mate for Republican nominee John McCain in 2008. Since then, he has raised $3.3m with the help of corporate donations from Comcast, Enterprise-Rent-A-Car, Target and AT&T and a handful of $10,000 donations from wealthy individuals and retirees.The Florida senator is not considered a presidential contender, but he is almost universally regarded as a likely candidate for vice-president. Mr Rubio would be an attractive choice because he could attract Hispanic voters and is popular in Florida, a battleground state.His campaign to be senator proved he is a formidable fundraiser, having raised and spent $21m on his election. Fundraisers included employees at Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, and employees of Elliott Management, the New York hedge fund founded by Paul Singer.
167;TGT;Target Corp;2011-01-19T18:51:09Z;Starbucks launches US phone payments;;Starbucks, the US coffee retailer, has launched a smartphone-based payment system at more than 7,800 stores in its home market, marking one of the first nationwide deployments of long-awaited phone-based payment technology in the US.The system is aimed at members of the company’s loyalty card programme who maintain a cash balance on their cards for purchases. They will now be able to use BlackBerry or iPhone smartphones to make payments by presenting a barcode on the phone’s screen to a scanner, instead of the card.Brady Brewer, the head of Starbucks’ loyalty programme, said that one out of five Starbucks transactions were paid for using loyalty cards, which are linked to a rewards programme, and that mobile payment “will extend the way our customers experience and use their card”.The national roll-out of the payment system follows pilots in markets including Seattle, California and New York, and at its outlets in more than 1,000 Target discount stores.The company said its customers loaded more than $1.5bn on to Starbucks loyalty cards in 2010, an increase of 21 per cent over 2009, after it launched its first rewards programme. More than one-third of its US customers use smartphones, of whom nearly three-quarters use BlackBerry smartphone or iPhone mobile devices.Mobile phones have been used to make retail payments in Japan and Korea for several years, using near field communications (NFC) technology, based around a short-range radio-frequency identification tag incorporated into mobile devices. But the technology has yet to establish itself in the US and Europe.Starbucks’ move, based around a unique scannable code delivered by a smartphone app, comes as a variety of payments companies are testing NFC in the US and Europe, amid growing interest from retailers and other merchants.Bling Nation, a California based start-up, is running a pilot payments and loyalty system with a number of merchants and local banks in Silicon Valley that is also in use in the cafeteria of Ebay, the online marketplace that owns the PayPal payment system.Since most US mobile phones are not equipped with NFC tags, Bling Nation is relying on stickers applied to regular mobile phones.Telefónica, the Spanish telecoms company, has said it would use its sponsorship role at the 2012 Olympics in London to promote mass use of NFC in the city, in a partnership with La Caixa, the Spanish bank, and Visa.Visa is also involved in pilots of NFC-equipped phone payments in the New York and Los Angeles public transport systems.
168;TGT;Target Corp;2011-01-13T16:12:11Z;Target expands into Canada;;Target, the US discount retailer known for its “cheap chic” image, is to invest more than $2.8bn in opening up to 150 stores in Canada by 2014, in its first international expansion.The retailer, which operates more than 1,750 large format stores in the US says it has agreed to pay C$1.82bn to acquire leases to up to 220 sites currently operated by Zellers, a Canadian discount retailer that is the subsidiary of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC).It is planning to convert the locations into Target stores gradually, investing an estimated C$1bn in store renovations, with the first Target brand stores opening in 2013.Greg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said the transaction represented “an outstanding opportunity” for the retailer to expand beyond the US.While the retailer asserts that it has room to continue growth in the US, its store growth at home has slowed since the 2008 Wall Street crash. It has also been directing capital spending into store remodelling that introduce fresh food and other groceries into its stores, as a way of boosting customer visits.The transaction will extend its competitive battle with Walmart, the largest US retailer, which operates 319 stores, about one third of them large supercentres that sell both fresh food and general merchandise. Walmart entered Canada in 1994 with a similar acquisition of about 120 discount stores operated by Woolco.Zellers was founded in 1931 to be what its founder called “a store for thrifty Canadians”. Its locations average around 100,000 sq ft, compared to 175,000 sq ft for the average Target store in the US.Richard Baker, governor of Hudson’s Bay Company said the deal “provides attractive long-term value and will allow us to invest substantial capital into our department store and speciality store businesses.” Its other store chains include Bay, a department store chain, Home Outfitters, a home furnishings store, and the Fields low-cost stores.HBC, which is owned by NRDC, the US private equity fund, said it plans to continue to run a scaled down portfolio of Zellers stores at the more than 50 remaining locations that are not being sold to Target.Target also said it has begun to pursue the sale of its entire credit card receivables portfolio, which totalled $6.7bn at the end of October last year. It has engaged First Annapolis bank as an adviser. The retailer sold half of its credit card receivables to JPMorgan Chase in early 2008 for $3.6bn, under a five year agreement with an optional sixth year, and the sales would be net of this interest.Last year it withdrew its Target Visa network credit cards, and now only issues cards for use in its own stores, which are linked to a 5 per cent cash-back rewards programme. Target said in a statement that it “intends to execute a transaction in which it would retain operational control of its strategically important financial services business, including its deep integration with Target’s retail operations”.It said it would execute a sale “only if appropriate strategic and financial conditions are met”.Target’s shares were up less than one per cent in New York on Thursday morning, at $55.69.
169;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Best Buy sales fall 5% in December;;Best Buy, the world’s largest consumer electronics retailer by sales, saw comparable sales at its US stores fall 5 per cent during December as it faced lower television prices, slumping sales of gaming software and intense competition from rival discounters.Brian Dunn, chief executive, said in a statement that the sales “were within our expected range of outcomes for the month”. On a worldwide basis, including its stores in Europe and China, comparable sales declined 4 per cent for the month, while total revenues declined 1.6 per cent to $8.4bn.Best Buy saw its shares fall around 10 per cent in December, after it reported third-quarter results that were also hit by reduced revenues from sales of televisions and computers, and by a decline in overall market share.The company again stressed the strength of its rapidly expanding Best Buy Mobile business in December, which continues to benefit from consumers’ enthusiasm for mobile devices and services.US revenues fell 3.2 per cent to $6.5bn in December. Comparable sales in the entertainment software category fell 15.4 per cent, while consumer electronics were down 7.9 per cent, hit by a double-digit percentage decline in television sales. Best Buy also reported a low double-digit increase in sales of mobile phones, supported by increased sales of smartphones, and mid-single-digit percentage growth in mobile computing, which includes sales of Apple’s iPad and other tablet computers.The pressures on the consumer electronics business were also reflected in preliminary third-quarter results released on Thursday by HH Gregg, Best Buy’s smaller rival, which has 173 stores in the eastern and southern US. It reported a 6.2 per cent decline in same-store sales in the three months ending December 31. Like Best Buy, it noted that sales of new 3D and LED televisions had grown less than expected during the period.Target, the discounter, also cited softness in sales of televisions as a factor that led to it reporting a lower-than-expected 0.9 per cent increase in same-store sales in December.Best Buy’s shares were down less than 1 per cent, in line with other retail stocks on Friday morning in New York, trading at $35.14.
170;TGT;Target Corp;2011-01-06T22:01:09Z;Retail sales report weighs on US stocks;;Gap, Target and Macy’s were among the retail stocks that fell after weak festive holiday trading but positive news from the jobs market helped US stocks pare losses.The final verdict on retailers’ holiday shopping season was disappointing as many large chains missed their estimates.Retail Metrics said its index of same-store sales had risen 3.2 per cent against analysts’ forecasts for a 3.5 per cent gain.The S&P 500 retail index fell 1.6 per cent while the wider consumer discretionary sector sank 0.7 per cent. The consumer discretionary index was the biggest riser in 2010 and its retail component surged towards the end of the year in anticipation of a bumper shopping season.“Retail sales were kind of a dampener,” said Randall Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Services. “But the market is not too worried about it, probably because the Christmas season was quite good. It was just the snow in the north-east at the end of December that kept the shoppers away.”Target, the discount retailer, tumbled 6.8 per cent to $54.93 after its sales only edged up 0.9 per cent compared with the average analyst estimate of a 3.9 per cent gain.But TJ Maxx, which offers discount designer clothes, added 5.9 per cent to $45.52 after it unexpectedly reported a rise in same-store sales.Department store Macy’s dropped 4 per cent to $23.97 after it said sales rose 3.9 per cent in December, less than the 4.5 per cent predicted.Rival Saks added 4.6 per cent to $11.50 after it reported a rise of 11.8 per cent, which was better than analysts’ forecasts.Clothing retailer Gap dropped by 6.9 per cent to $20.70.The S&P 500 closed down 0.2 per cent to 1,273.85, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed 0.2 per cent lower at 11,697.31.But the Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.3 per cent to close at 2,709.89. as a decision by Microsoft to use a different processor in the next version of its Windows operating system buoyed some technology stocks.Microsoft climbed 2.9 per cent to $28.82, while the makers of ARM processors also gained. Nvidia soared 13.8 per cent to $19.33, while Qualcomm added 1.2 per cent to $52.67 and Texas Instruments gained 1.4 per cent to $33.25.Intel, which used to dominate the processor market, fell 0.8 per cent to $20.77.Initial jobless claims edged up by 18,000 to a total of 409,000 last week, but the number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits fell. The report was slightly better than average forecasts.“The average level of initial claims in December was the lowest monthly average since July 2008 and this, combined with other labour market readings for the month, leaves us comfortable with our forecast for a 175,000 increase in private payrolls in December,” said John Ryding of RDQ Economics.Telecoms stocks led the fallers, down 2.8 per cent, after Metro PCS announced its fourth-quarter subscriber results, which missed expectations, sending its shares tumbling 6.7 per cent to $13.30.Metro’s rivals also fell, with AT&T down 1.4 per cent to $29.15 and Verizon losing 2.6 per cent to $36.23.US-listed shares in BPdipped 0.6 per cent to $46.23 after rising in the session. The official US inquiry into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill concluded that systemic failures by the management of BP and other companies led to the Macondo well blow-out.Transocean and Halliburton, contractors on the project, were also criticised by the report. Transocean edged down 0.3 per cent to $73.04 but Halliburton lost 3 per cent to $38.22.The S&P 500 energy index, which has suffered this week as the oil price fell, dropped 0.7 per cent.Coal producer Massey Energy sunk 3.1 per cent to $54.65 even though it said fourth-quarter coal shipments were lower than it had previously projected.Moody’s, the credit rating agency, jumped 8.6 per cent to $29.67 after it raised its earnings forecast for 2010 to at least $2.08 per share from a previous maximum of $1.96. It said strong bond market issuances had boosted profit as the agency rates the bonds.
171;TGT;Target Corp;2011-01-06T20:59:24Z;US retail at strongest since 2006;;Sales at leading US retailers failed to meet Wall Street’s heightened expectations in December, but the sector still delivered its strongest performance since 2006 over the two months of the holiday shopping season.The International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks monthly sales data of 32 retailers, said its index of December same-store sales, delivered on Thursday, rose 3.1 per cent against a year ago, but short of the 3.5 per cent rise expected by analysts.However, its index for November and December together was up 4 per cent against last year, the most robust growth in the holiday shopping season in four years.Mike Niemira, chief economist at ICSC, said that while the results missed the “hype”, December’s performance “was good, but uneven” with some retailers indicating that bad winter weather had cut into sales.“The big themes were recovery in the economy, and in the retail industry, and ultimately in consumer spending,” he said.Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s, the country’s largest traditional department store chain, said sales at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale's outlets during November and December rose 4.6 per cent, with December sales “consistent with our high expectations”. This was despite the snow that hit the east coast after Christmas.JC Penney, its lower-cost rival, said it had a “successful” holiday season, with comparable store sales up 5.7 per cent against the previous year.But Gap, the largest speciality retailer, reported a 3 per cent drop in comparable store sales growth during December against last year.Sabrina Simmons, chief financial officer, said that “after a strong start to the holiday season in November, sales and traffic trends for our brands were less consistent in December”.American Eagle and Aero­postale, the youth fashion retailers, reported comparable sales declines of 11 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, in December.Target, the discount chain, saw comparable sales rise just 0.9 per cent against last December. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the month’s sales “were below expectations, as strength in grocery and apparel was offset by softness in electronics, toys and some home categories”.However, there was evidence that more prosperous Americans are spending again on discretionary purchases, and so more upmarket retailers continued to outperform the rest of the sector in December.
172;TGT;Target Corp;2011-01-03T16:38:23Z;Nook e-reader boosts Barnes & Noble;;Barnes & Noble, the largest US bookstore chain, said on Monday that sales of its Nook e-reader had helped it deliver sharply improved holiday sales, lending support to its claims that it is successfully repositioning itself as readers adopt new digital content.The retailer said on Monday that its comparable sales during November and December rose by 9.7 per cent against the previous year, a sharp contrast with the 5.4 per cent decline seen during the 2009 holiday period.In a short statement, the retailer said sales of the Nook product line had helped the bookseller hit a record sales peak on December 23rd. It expects to report further details of its holiday sales on Thursday. Its shares rose almost 9 per cent to close at $15.42 in New York.Barnes & Noble’s digitally-driven gains come as Borders, the second-largest US book chain, is facing looming liquidity issues that it is seeking to resolve by negotiating new financing arrangements. Its shares fell sharply before New Year after it confirmed that it was delaying payments to some of its suppliers.Both retailers have struggled for several years against low-cost competition from Amazon and from discounters including Walmart, Costco and Target, while also facing growing challenges from the emerging market for e-books.But Barnes & Noble has taken a more aggressive approach to investing in establishing itself in the world of digital publishing, underpinned by the Nook, which it introduced in late 2009 as a challenger to Amazon’s successful Kindle reader.During the past year the retailer has substantially expanded its efforts to promote the Nook reader in its stores, creating special areas devoted to the reader with dedicated salespeople on hand to promote the product.It said at the end of December that the Nook had become its best selling product ever, without giving numbers. Amazon said in December that the latest model of the Kindle had also become its best selling item ever.Despite the strong growth of sales of the Nook and of digital books, sales at Barnes & Noble’s physical stores continued to slip last year, declining 3.3 per cent in the quarter ending October 30, while digital and online sales rose 59 per cent.The bookseller has also seen the costs of its digital initiatives weigh on its overall results, and is forecasting losses of between 75 cents and $1.15 per share for its current fiscal year, ending on May 31st. It has said that it expects sales of digital content will be running at a $400m annualised rate.Barnes & Noble is also currently reviewing a possible sale to private equity investors, possibly including its founder and chairman, Leonard Riggio.
173;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Borders shares tumble on payment delays;;Borders, the second largest US bookstore chain, saw its shares fall more than 20 per cent on Friday after it confirmed it had delayed payments to some publishers amid liquidity concerns.The company said earlier in December that it was in talks to refinance its business, as it continues to record losses, and warned that it might violate credit agreements in its first quarter if those talks fail.Its shares fell 25 cents, or 22 percent, to $0.90 at lunchtime in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Borders’ largest shareholder is Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square fund, which owns about 37 per cent of Borders stock. Bennett LeBow, a tobacco billionaire who invested in Borders in May, holds a similar-sized stake, and serves as non-executive chairman.Both Borders and its rival Barnes & Noble have been losing business to Amazon, the online retailer, and to discounters including Walmart, Costco and Target.At the same time, both are seeking to bolster their digital and e-commerce business, with Barnes & Noble promoting its new Nook e-reader.Borders said in December that its quarterly losses almost doubled to $74.4m from the same period last year, while total sales fell 17.6 per cent to $470.9m. Comparable sales at its stores declined by 12.6 per cent, while e-commerce sales fell 8.6 per cent as it overhauled its website.
174;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-27T21:56:14Z;Snow weighs down Wall Street;;US stocks staged a recovery late in the day, shrugging off earlier worries about China’s interest rate rise, while a blizzard in the eastern US pushed the retail sector off a three-year high.Industrial and materials spent the morning in the red, but finished the first trading day after China raised interest rates higher.The materials sector closed flat, with Cliffs Natural Resources higher by 0.2 per cent at $78.15 but aluminium producer Alcoa lost 0.7 per cent at $15.23.The S&P 500 industrials index rose 0.2 per cent, but Caterpillar was down 0.4 per cent at $94.07 and Cummins dropping 1 per cent to $109.82.The industrials and materials sectors have outperformed this year as growth in China and other emerging markets buoy profits.The broader indices were mixed in very light trading volumes.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,257.56 but the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.2 per cent to close at 11,555.03 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,667.27.Collin Monsarrat, Birinyi Associates strategist, said a “Santa Claus” rally – where stocks climb between Christmas and New Year’s day – was likely.“Reviewing the data for the past 60 years suggests they do exist and are fairly likely to occur,” he said.“The market rallies 73 per cent of the time from the close preceding Christmas day to the last close of the year for an average return of 1.34 per cent.”But “whether or not a Santa Claus rally occurs does not give us any significant insight into the subsequent performance of the market”.Retail stocks, which have rallied over the past couple of months in anticipation of a bumper holiday shopping season, suffered after a blizzard in the eastern US.Traders feared that consumers would not venture out to post-Christmas sales, pushing the retail sector down from its three-year high.The S&P 500 retailers index was down 0.3 per cent, with department store Nordstrom losing 1.6 per cent to $42.09, Saks down 0.8 per cent to $10.92 and discount retailer Target nudging down 0.4 per cent to $60.05.But not everyone thought it was the snow that was weighing down retailers.“I think it’s a bit of profit-taking,” Jason Waxler, partner at Fogle Neale Partners, said.“It’s the beginning of transition to new [sector] leadership. We might see technology pick up, as there are elements of a real cyclical recovery here.”But airline stocks were largely unaffected after the snow kept many aircraft grounded, with the S&P 500 airlines index rising 0.4 per cent.AMR Corp, parent of American Airlines, added 1.4 per cent to $7.89, Delta Air Linesgained 1.8 per cent to $12.45 but US Airways nudged down 0.4 per cent to $9.87.Financials, which have risen 10.8 per cent since the start of December on the back of hopes for an improved economy in 2011 and a steepening of the US Treasuries yield curve, edged up further.The S&P 500 financials sector added 1 per cent on Monday with AIG soaring 9.3 per cent to $59.39, the most in the S&P 500.The bailed-out insurer signed $4.3bn worth of credit agreements, seeking to replace government finance with private funds.The shares have gained 42.7 per cent in the past month as the group put together plans for paying back the US government.Goldman Sachs rose 1.3 per cent to $169.83 after the bank adopted a provision in its executive pay scheme that will reward senior staff on their ability to meet long-term performance goals without encouraging “imprudent risk-taking”.Electric carmaker Tesla Motors fell 15.1 per cent to $25.55 after the expiration of a 180-day lock-up period following its initial public offering, but it remained higher than the IPO price of $17 per share.Shares in casual dining chains slipped after a newspaper story suggested that they could fall 20 per cent or more if the expectations for 2011 earnings are not met.Chipotle Mexican Grilllost 2.5 per cent to $222.56 and Panera Bread, a bakery chain, was down 1.2 per cent at $102.86.
175;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-23T19:15:22Z;Collective is striding into new territories;;Chinese consumers have already demonstrated that they will pay more than $100 for a pair of Adidas or Nike sports shoes. Matt Rubel, chief executive of Collective Brands, the US shoe brands company, is hoping they may be prepared to spend about half as much for children’s shoes.“We look at China as an emerging market, but an emerging market of people that have money,” Mr Rubel says of the decision to launch its Stride Rite children’s shoe brand in China.The first Stride Rite store in China opened this month in Hong Kong, run by Li & Fung Retailing, a private entity not linked to the listed sourcing and branded company of the same name, under a partnership that plans to expand across to mainland China.Marketing in the mainland will not focus on price – the shoes sell for about $50 a pair in the US – but on the assumption that Chinese parents will be encouraged to spend on a brand that has built its reputation around safeguarding children’s feet with proper fitting shoes.Collective’s plans come as a flurry of foreign consumer product brands are expanding in the Chinese market, hopeful of benefiting from China’s rising domestic spending. A survey by Boston Consulting Group identified apparel and shoes as one of six product groups on which middle class and affluent Chinese consumers plan to spend more.Bata, the multinational low-cost shoe group, already has a large presence with close to 250 retail outlets around the country.Collective’s China launch is part of a wider drive for international sales growth. This summer, the company, whose other businesses include the Keds, Saucony and Sperry brands, and Payless ShoeSource, the US discount fashion shoe retailer, opened a new European headquarters in Amsterdam, and a new showroom for wholesale customers in London.It is also planning to open at least 700 new franchised Payless stores over the next five years in emerging markets, more than doubling the number of existing international stores.The drive is in part a response to the limits of domestic growth. Christopher Svezia, analyst at Susquehanna Investment, an equity research company, says that the mature state of the Payless business in the US is likely to lead it to remain focused just on remodelling its stores, whilst shuffling and also shrinking its retail properties.But while Payless competes with Walmart, Target and other discounters on both price and its “fashion forward” styles, in many emerging markets it is regarded as an aspirational brand. The performance of its Latin American stores also outstrips the US, with operating margins of 10.5 per cent over the past year, compared to 6 per cent domestically.“For Payless, the theme is to find the emerging market who are moving from a lower income consumer to a middle income consumer economy, where the infrastructure is built, and where the local shoe retail market has not consolidated,” says Mr Rubel. But Collective has decided not to take Payless to China, where its low-cost fashion shoes would be up against intense competition from hundreds of local brands. Instead it will focus there on launching Stride Rite, a more expensive brand.After opening in the Gulf and Middle East in 2009, and in Russia and the Philippines this year, in 2011 new franchised Payless stores will open in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and in Mexico. In Mexico, its plans should result in 41 franchised stores opening in the next three years, with up to 300 in the country in the longer term. In the three south-east Asian countries Collective estimates it could eventually open at least 400 stores, in what it calls its “largest franchise market opportunity to date”.Mr Svezia says that with just a handful of franchised stores open, it is still too early to assess their likely impact on Collective. In the meantime, Wall Street remains focused on the company’s core US business, which has been hit by the impact of the economy on its lower income customers. Its shares are trading at about $21, down just over 5 per cent from the start of the year.
176;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-20T18:59:04Z;US retailers upbeat on holiday sales;;US retailers are this week unleashing last-minute promotional sales offers ahead of the Christmas holiday as they head towards the climax of a shopping season that shows signs of meeting optimistic forecasts.Department stores such as Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s are offering discounts of up to 50 per cent on items such as winter coats and sweaters, as they push to attract last-minute shoppers. But Wall Street analysts say the sector has largely kept to its scheduled promotional plans, with a conservative approach to inventory planning reducing the need for more drastic price cuts.Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group, a retail research firm, said that “even if prices are marked down, [the stores] are managing it better”.“For holiday 2010, there are three words that sum it up: it feels better,” she said after touring stores in several US cities since the start of the season.The positive sentiment was underlined by the most recent survey of sales in major categories by MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which uses card swipe data from MasterCard and estimates of other payment methods. SpendingPulse said that the momentum seen in November continued into the first two weeks of December, with “moderate to strong” sales gains in several sectors.The survey estimated that the overall clothing category was up 9.8 per cent for the period from October 31 to December 11, compared to the same period last year, while e-commerce sales were up 13.5 per cent.The jewellery sector had 2.6 per cent growth over the same period, while luxury sales excluding jewellery rose 2.8 per cent.But consumer electronics sales, which dipped below last year’s levels in the weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday, remain slow, increasing only 0.4 per cent against last year. The sector has been hit in particular by continuing steep falls in the price of televisions, which contributed to weaker-than-expected earnings last week from Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics retailer.The National Retail Federation last week raised its forecast for annual sales growth for November and December by 1 percentage point to 3.3 per cent.
177;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-17T01:25:20Z;Card fee cut hits Visa and MasterCard;;Visa and MasterCard shares plunged after the Federal Reserve proposed rules to eliminate billions of dollars in debit card fees.The new rules, which could still change before they are finalised early next year, are a huge win for large retailers like Walmart and Target, but represent a significant setback for card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan and Bank of America, as well as for Visa and MasterCard, which operate the debit card networks.The fees are fixed by Visa and MasterCard and paid by merchants to card-issuing banks to cover the cost of processing transactions.Under the first of two proposals, card issuers would be required to charge merchants no more than their actual costs, which the Fed estimates at 7 cents a transaction. The second proposal would cap the fees at 12 cents a transaction.That is far less than the 63 cents a transaction that issuers currently charge retailers and represents a reduction in debt-card fees of roughly $10bn, or more than 80 per cent, according to the Merchants Payment Coalition.“Today’s draft rule from the Federal Reserve makes it clear that big bank interchange rules overcharge businesses and consumers,” said Senator Dick Durbin, who authored an amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act that required the Fed to write new rules capping the fees.“The changes we had to enforce by law in the US are being voluntarily implemented by mega-banks and card giants in Europe and other countries,” Mr Durbin added.The European Commission has reached deals with MasterCard and Visa Europe to reduce interchange fees to 0.2 per cent on cross-border debit card transactions in Europe.The Fed proposal may also loosen the grip of Visa and MasterCard on the debit market by requiring that all cards use at least two networks.Visa and MasterCard on Thursday fell 12.7 per cent and 10.3 per cent, respectively, “due to interchange being lowered more than expected”, Adam Frisch, of Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients.Mr Frisch estimated that the fee restrictions will reduce 2012 earnings for Bank of America by 4 cents a share and JPMorgan by 6 cents a share.Banks said any attempt to set rates would lead to higher costs for consumers. Analysts expect banks to react to the new rules by eliminating other services such as reward programmes.“The rules proposed by the Federal Reserve today will have a dramatic impact on the cost of banking services for consumers nationwide,” said Edward Yingling, chief executive of the American Bankers Association.Visa said, “Visa also has concerns that the Federal Reserve’s proposal includes artificial caps on debit interchange that do not realistically reflect the value of card acceptance and do not reflect the actual costs of running a secure, reliable and efficient debit network.”
178;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-14T23:02:07Z;Best Buy suffers effect of tablets;;"Tablet computers such as Apple’s iPad and Samsung’s Galaxy are pushing aside latest television technologies on the holiday wish-lists of electronics enthusiasts, according to Best Buy, the leading US electronics retailer.Mike Vitelli, company president, told investors on Tuesday that he believed the new tablets had “taken mind share and wallet share” among “early adopters” who would have been expected to acquire new 3D and internet-connected televisions that were launched this year.“It’s clear that the tablet concept is very hot in consumer minds. It has extracted a lot of early adopted dollars right now,” Mr Vitelli said. Slow sales of televisions, including of new 3D and internet TV models, and laptop computers contributed to Best Buy reporting disappointing results for its third quarter, leading to its shares dropping in New York.The retailer, whose rivals include Walmart and Target, the mass discounters, and Amazon, the online retailer, said that comparable sales at its US stores fell 5 per cent during the quarter ending November 30, which included the post Thanksgiving “Black Friday” holiday sales.It said it lost sales of basic “entry-level” TVs and of computers to rivals during the heavily promotional start to the holiday shopping season.But it saw continued strength in sales of mobile phones, with comparable sales increasing in the low-double digits, while strong sales of tablet computers contributed to a mid-single digit increase in its mobile computing category.Jim Muehlbauer, chief financial officer, said the strong performance in these categories indicated that consumers were feeling less constrained by broader economic concerns.“Consumers are out spending in those categories,” he said.Mr Vitelli also noted that the limited number of manufacturers offering new tablets meant that it lost customers to rivals, such as Apple’s own stores. “But that is going to rapidly change over the four quarters of next year,” he said, as more products become available. Best Buy’s total revenues fell just over 1 per cent to $11.89bn, while its global same-store sales declined 3.3 per cent.The company reported net earnings of $217m, down 4.4 per cent from $227m in the same quarter last year.The stronger sales of higher margin mobile products and services, which it is pursuing as a strategic business objective, helped improve Best Buy’s operating income margin by 10 basis points to 3.2 per cent.The company lowered its full-year earnings guidance to the range of $3.20 to $3.40 per diluted share from a previous range of $3.55 to $3.70, which it said was a “best view” based on
current trends.Best Buy’s shares closed down $6.18, nearly 15 per cent, at $35.52 on the New York Stock Exchange."
179;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-14T22:31:17Z;US stocks pare gains in late trading;;Depressed earnings from Best Buy overshadowed a strong retail sales report, sending the retail sector lower, while the wider indices pared their gains late in the day.Best Buy dropped 14.8 per cent to $35.52, falling the most in the S&P 500, after the electronics retailer’s profit missed forecasts.Third-quarter profit fell 4.4 per cent as weaker demand for television sets and entertainment products pushed US like-for-like sales down 5 per cent.The chain also lowered its forecast for the full year from $3.55 to $3.70 per share to between $3.20 and $3.40 a share.David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets, said the company was hurt by a focus on wireless over the Big Black Friday shopping weekend, and lost market share in televisions because it did not discount as much as some rivals.But he reiterated his “buy” rating on the stock, saying that the company did have volatile earnings and that the bright spots included strong gross margins and a continuing share buy-back programme.Competitors RadioShack and Gamestop fell 3 per cent to $18.63 and 0.8 per cent to $21.74, respectively.The wider retail sector slipped in spite of data showing sales in November rose more than forecast.The S&P 500 retail index edged lower by 0.5 per cent, even though the report showed purchases rose 0.8 per cent, and the increase in October was revised up to a 1.7 per cent gain. The average forecast for November had been a rise of 0.6 per cent.“It should not go unnoticed that retail sales are just a hair below the November 2007 high,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “[But] the report is not all roses and unicorns. Sales at furniture and electronics stores declined, both falling for the second consecutive month.”Some retail stocks edged up. Discounter Target added 0.5 per cent to $59.08, department store owner Macy’s rose 0.9 per cent to $25.18 and teen fashion chain Abercrombie & Fitch firmed 0.8 per cent to $55.14.Online retailers were mixed with Amazon nudging down 0.2 per cent to $173.94 and Ebay increasing 1.6 per cent to $30.75.US producer prices rose 0.8 per cent in November, above the average estimate of 0.6 per cent. Core prices, excluding food and energy, also rose slightly more than expected.A separate report showed US business inventories rose less than expected in October.The wider indices pared their gains late in the day.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,241.59, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to 11,476.62 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,627.72.The S&P 500 financial index lost 0.9 per cent with regional banks leading the declines, down 1.3 per cent.JPMorgan fell 1.7 per cent to $40.79, Citigroup dropped 2.5 per cent to $4.69 and Wells Fargo was lower by 1.4 per cent to $29.79.In regionals, Marshall & Islely lost 3.4 per cent to $5.73 and Regions Financial sunk 5.2 per cent to $6.21. But AIG bucked the trend, surging 6.7 per cent to $51.77 after Steve Miller, chairman, said the success of the government in selling part of its stakes in Citigroup and General Motors signalled it will be able to divest its majority holding of the bailed-out insurer.Stocks were unchanged after the Federal Open Market Committee report which stuck with previous descriptions of its second round of quantitative easing, keeping the amount and pace of easing the same and maintaining interest rates.The Fed said the economic recovery was continuing but at a rate insufficient to bring down unemployment.“[Bernanke] has adopted a pattern [of communication] which is about as exciting and innovative as moss on a tree,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. “[But] there is the clear idea that until unemployment goes down he’s not going to tighten unless there’s a huge inflationary spike, and maybe not even then.”Economists had widely predicted that the meeting would be uneventful. Jan Hatzius, chief US economist at Goldman Sachs, said it was likely to be “the least interesting of the year”.
180;TGT;Target Corp;2010-12-02T21:59:00Z;US stocks rise on positive housing data;;"Financials surged, leading US stocks higher after a surprisingly strong report on the housing market and a sector upgrade from analysts at Goldman Sachs.The S&P 500 closed up 1.3 per cent to 1,221.52, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1 per cent to close at 11,362.41 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.2 per cent higher at 2,579.35.“It would be tough to point to just one thing today. It’s good reports on pending home sales and yesterday’s ADP employment data, all coming before Friday’s non-farm payrolls,” said Greg Walker, global investment strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank.The S&P 500 financials index led the risers, adding 2.6 per cent, with Bank of America gaining 3.5 per cent to $11.68, Citigroup climbing 2.8 per cent to $4.42 and Wells Fargo rising 4.5 per cent to $28.78.Goldman Sachs’ US portfolio strategy team lifted financials to “overweight” for the first time since the financial crisis began, citing a stronger outlook for the US economy, higher equity prices and a favourable interest rate.Bank stocks extended their gains after a report showed that pending home sales unexpectedly jumped in October, up 10 per cent, after dropping 1.8 per cent the month before.Regional banks did particularly well, with Marshall & Ilsley soaring 12.3 per cent to $5.48, Fifth Third Bancorp gaining 6.4 per cent to $13.05 and Regions Financial adding 6.9 per cent to $6.06.The S&P 500 homebuilders index jumped 4.7 per cent, with Lennar surging 7.2 per cent to $16.88, DR Horton higher by 3.7 per cent to $10.92 and Pulte Groupadding 3.2 per cent to $6.75.Toll Brothers, the luxury homebuilder, had been falling after it reported its quarterly earnings but turned round after the positive housing market data.The builder posted a quarterly profit in its fourth quarter, compared with a loss in the same period last year on the back of cost cuts and an income tax benefit, but sales continued to slide. The shares rose 2.2 per cent to $18.87.Investors shrugged off a larger-than-expected rise in initial jobless claims. The data came after a strong report last week and the less volatile four-week moving average fell to its lowest level since August 2008.“What matters is that the jump in claims this week still leaves them below the bottom of this year’s range, 445,000 to 475,000,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at HFE Economics.He added: “If [this] continues, we should expect
to see better payroll numbers over the next few months”.After a run-up in retail stocks before Black Friday kicked off the holiday shopping season, investors finally got a peek at till receipts as retailers reported same-store sales for November.The first reports showed that shoppers bought more for themselves and promotions were less aggressive. The S&P 500 retail index rose 1.8 per cent.Among retailers beating expectations, teen-retailer Abercrombie & Fitch surged 11.1 per cent to $56.02 after net sales soared 32 per cent compared with the same period last year.Department store chain JC Penney rose 2.3 per cent to $34.47, Victoria’s Secret owner Limited Brands edged up 0.8 per cent to $34.90 and discounter Target was boosted by 2.8 per cent to $59.65.Deals news also boosted investor sentiment after PepsiCo spent $3.8bn on a 66 per cent stake in Russian food and beverage company Wimm-Bill-Dann, valuing it at $5.4bn. Shares in PepsiCo fell 0.7 per cent to $65.20 and US-listed shares in Wimm-Bill-Dann soared 27.9 per cent to $31.34. Elsewhere, AIG added 1.4 per cent to $42.88 after it was reported that it would receive at least three bids for the Taiwanese unit it is trying to sell – from Taiwan’s Fubon Financial, Chinatrust and the chairman of the conglomerate Ruentex, subject to due diligence.Before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures briefly followed global stocks into negative territory when Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, said that the central bank would delay the withdrawal of it emergency liquidity measures, but he did not announce an expansion of its purchases of government bonds."
181;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;US bond yield rise points to improved outlook;;The yield on 10-year US Treasury notes rose above 3 per cent for the first time since July after better economic news prompted a dramatic reassessment of the economic prospects for the US.US asset prices and bond yields rallied on Thursday despite the fears about eurozone sovereign debt that have prompted safe haven buying of US Treasuries in the recent past.The moves suggested that investors had fresh confidence in the US recovery and believed that it can successfully decouple from problems in Europe or any slowdown in China.Higher 10-year yields suggest investors think the Federal Reserve will raise rates or halt its current $600bn programme of asset purchases earlier than they previously thought.“As long as the economic dots connect higher, I reckon that a sub-3 per cent 10-year note will be difficult to sustain,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at RBS Securities.In the latest sign of an improving outlook pending home sales, which reflect transactions signed but not yet closed, surged by 10.4 per cent from September to October. That surpassed the expectations of Wall Street economists, who had predicted a decline, suggesting some stabilisation in the housing market.The steady recovery of confidence among middle-income US consumers was also underlined by monthly sales data from a range of mainstream retailers – including JC Penney, Macy’s, Gap and Target – which delivered stronger than expected sales gains against last year.Weekly jobs data released on Thursday pushed the 10-year yield to a high of 3.03 per cent, before it eased to 2.96 per cent at midday in New York.Bond traders zeroed in on the fact that the four-week moving average of US weekly jobless claims dropped to 431,000 this week, its lowest level since August 2008.Bond traders now await the release of the US employment report for November on Friday. That could spark a further rally if it tops the forecast gain of 145,000 new jobs.“Until we see a meaningful upward surprise in the payroll numbers, the market is still going to treat the durability of the upturn with caution,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.While the Federal Reserve will be encouraged by the better economic data, it will also note that much of the fall in bond yields and the dollar since August, when its new round of asset purchases first became widely anticipated, has now been reversed. That has tightened financial conditions and offset some of the stimulating effect of its asset purchase policy.Reporting by Robin Harding in Washington and Michael MacKenzie, Alan Rappeport and Jonathan Birchall in New York
182;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Return to spending boosts sales at US shops;;Leading US chain retailers recorded a strong start to the holiday shopping season in November, as early promotions and solid sales on the post-Thanksgiving weekend boosted revenues.Monthly sales data from retailers released on Thursday suggested they had benefited from an improvement in discretionary spending. As a result sales rose at department stores and top brands.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of comparable sales growth rose by 5.3 per cent against the same month last year, beating the 3.5 per cent forecast based on Wall Street analysts’ predictions. The increase compared to the 0.7 per cent gain in November 2009.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said he expected a “robust” December, supported by “stock market gains, improving macro data leading to better consumer confidence numbers, and aggressive promotions”.Department stores delivered some of the strongest sales growth, as they benefited from shoppers’ increasing readiness to spend on items such as costume jewellery.JC Penney, the mid-price department store, said comparable sales increased by 9.2 per cent, while its rival Kohl’s reported a 6.1 per cent increase.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, saw its comparable sales rise by 6.1 per cent.Target, the mass discounter, said November sales rose 5.5 per cent on a comparable store basis against last year.Comparable sales at Limited Brands’ Victoria’s Secret stores rose 13 per cent against last year, continuing a run of double digit monthly gains since the summer.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, said its same-store sales rose by 4 per cent compared to last year.Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, surged 22 per cent. But same-store sales at its lower cost rival American Eagle were flat.The strong sales at individual stores came amid broad year-on-year increases in consumer spending in leading categories, according to estimates from MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse. SpendingPulse, which uses data from card spending and projections for other payments, said clothing spending had increased by 9.6 per cent against a year ago.The survey estimated that e-commerce sales rose by 12 per cent in November against last year. ComScore, the online research firm, reported this week that US online sales on the Monday following Thanksgiving rose 16 per cent, giving the US e-commerce sector its first day of sales surpassing $1bn.

The regional bank index rallied 1.1 per cent, with Regions Financial rising 2.3 per cent to $5.37.Wells Fargo jumped 2.1 per cent to $27.20 after analysts at RBC Capital Markets said they would expect the bank to be among the first group of banks allowed to increase their dividends next year.Bank of America surged 1.7 per cent to $11.31. and Citigroup gained 1 per cent to $4.15,Energy stocks added 0.5 per cent as the price of oil rose. Halliburton gained 3.6 per cent to $37.87 and Baker Hughes added 2 per cent to $50.78.Retail stocks were in focus as investors weighed up the success of the Black Friday sales and looked forward to further revenues from the busy online shopping day now dubbed “Cyber Monday”.Early signs showed that sales on the day after Thanksgiving had only been slightly stronger than last year. But the National Retail Federation reported that the average US shopper had spent 6.4 per cent more than last year over the whole weekend.“Unlike the past few years, when Black Friday saved the month, we think a strong start to November will be the key theme when the group reports comps [same-store sales for the period] on Thursday,” said analysts at JPMorgan, adding that they expected almost all of the retail stocks they followed to beat expectations by a wide
margin.But after climbing 3.5 per cent in the past two weeks, the S&P 500 retail index fell 0.7 per cent. Macy’s dropped 2.2 per cent to $25.42, JC Penney gained 0.7 per cent to $32.77 and Target fell 0.9 per cent to $56.33.Walmart and Amazon announced developments in their international expansion plans.“Retail companies are realising that growth is not so much here as overseas,” said Andrew Neale, portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners, who said that the US consumer would recover properly only with the housing market.Walmartbid $2.4bn for a majority stake in Massmart, the South African retailer which has stores in 13 other African countries.Walmart has scaled back its proposal after reticence from leading shareholders. It is now pursuing a 51 per cent stake at $20.80 per share, a 19.2 per cent premium to the average price before it announced its interest in September. The shares edged up 0.2 per cent to $53.85.Amazon added 1.3 per cent to $179.49. The world’s largest online retailer by number of visitors is set to change its international e-commerce platform to make it easier to reach customers in new markets.BP pocketed $7bn by selling its stake in Argentina’s Pan American Energy to Bridas Corp, coming closer to its $30bn target for asset disposals. US-listed shares in the oil company, which is selling assets to help pay for the cost of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, fell

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.9 per cent to close at 11,089.80, falling 1.1 per cent over the week, and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent lower at 2,534.56 but rose 0.4 per cent on the five days.The S&P 500 materials index lost 1.3 per cent, with Alcoa, the aluminium producer, declining by 0.9 per cent to $13.19 and Cliffs Natural Resources, the iron ore producer, also sinking 0.9 per cent to $69.03.Del Monte gained 4.5 per cent to $18.80, and 7 per cent over the week, after the food producer agreed to a buy-out by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity house. The deal values Del Monte at about $5bn, including debt, or $19 per share.KKR edged lower by 0.8 per cent to $12.74 after it made the acquisition.CPI International, the telecoms equipment maker, was bought by an affiliate of Veritas Capital for $19.50 per share in cash, or $525m. The shares jumped 33.5 per cent to $19.31 after the offer, which was made at a 35 per cent premium to Wednesday’s closing price.Retail stocks were mixed even though investors were expecting a bumper start to the holiday shopping season. The S&P 500 retail index dipped 0.4 per cent, after climbing 2.7 per cent during the week.Stores offering large discounts to get customers queueing outside in the middle of the night included Best Buy, Walmart and Target. Best Buy nudged down 0.1 per cent to $44.75 as Brian Dunn, chief executive, said in the mid-morning that the consumer electronics retailer was “pleased with our traffic so far”. But Walmart lost 0.5 per cent to $53.73 and Target was lower by 0.7 per cent to $56.88.Online retailers were not left out of the Black Friday excitement with Amazon.com offering special deals throughout the week. Shares in Amazon added 0.1 per cent to $177.50. Department stores were also mixed. Macy’s gained 0.4 per cent to $26, while Nordstrom fell 0.3 per cent to $43.60 and JC Penney slid by 0.9 per cent to $32.51.SanDisk climbed 11.1 per cent over the week to $44.99.

185;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-26T15:21:24Z;US shoppers defy Black Friday weather;;"US shoppers defied cold weather and rain to flock to traditional post-Thanksgiving sales early on Friday, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that this year’s sales would be boosted by a growing readiness to spend after two years of frugal restraint.Brian Dunn, chief executive officer of Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, said in mid-morning he was “pleased with our traffic so far”.“This is anecdotal, but so far we estimate that our crowds are bigger than last year,” he said, with strong sales of categories including mobile devices, computers and the new Sony Move and Microsoft Kinect video gaming systems.Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of Toys R Us, said the largest US speciality toy store had “been busy from the start”, after it opened its doors two hours earlier this year at 10pm on Thanksgiving Thursday.He said the queue at the retailer’s New York flagship store was longer than last year, with customers chasing must-have toys such as Mattel’s $13 Sing-a-ma-jig harmonising rag dolls, and Squinkies, miniature collectable figures from Blip Toys.“It certainly feels like the consumer is more willing to open up wallets, particularly on larger toys. In the past it might have been something between $25 and $50; now it is $50 to $75, or up to $100,” he said of the season so far.Marshal Cohen, senior retail analyst at NPD Group, said he had seen large crowds at stores as they opened during the early hours of the morning, with Kohl’s, the low price department store, opening its doors at 3am, Target starting at 4am, and Walmart selling its non-electronic bargains earlier than usual at midnight. He said his analysis indicated a 15 per cent improvement from last year in conversion rates – the percentage of shoppers entering a store who complete a purchase, rather than just browsing.At the Target store in the Eastwood Mall in Niles, Ohio, several hundred people were queuing in long lines to check out at 7am, almost three hours after the discount store opened. Target was one of a number of retailers offering extra incentives to customers, with a $10 store gift card for shoppers spending more than $100 before 10am.At the Walmart Supercenter at Howland, a few miles away, staff had started selling at 5am the discounted electronic goods, such as $198 laptops and a $69 Blu-ray DVD player, to customers who had been waiting in line since midnight.Barbara Brunton was one of a number of shoppers at Walmart who said she would not be spending more at Christmas this year. “We are spending $200 on each of the children, and that’s it. You have to spend on the kids, but we’re not spending anything on the adults,” she said, noting that her sister and her brother-in-law had both lost their jobs this year."
186;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-25T18:02:19Z;US retailers look forward to ‘Black Friday’;;An estimated 138m Americans are expected to head to the stores over the course of Friday, Saturday and Sunday, for the annual sales that have become as much a part of the American Thanksgiving experience as turkey and cranberry sauce.The forecast for the post-Thanksgiving weekend sales from the National Retail Federation compares to its 134m forecast last year, reflecting retailers’ hopes that this year will see a return to more discretionary spending, following the previous two seasons of negative and almost flat sales.The NRF has predicted that total sales for November and December will rise by 2.3 per cent against last year, which saw a 0.4 per cent increase. Sales fell 3.4 per cent in 2008 season in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash.Early indications from the first three weeks of November have led to increased optimism, especially from high-end retailers. Tiffany, the luxury jeweller, said on Wednesday that it had seen stronger-than-expected spending so far, while Coach, the upmarket handbag and leather seller, has predicted double digit percentage growth in its holiday sales.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, which tracks retailer’s monthly sales, said there had been signs of increased visits to shopping malls during November before. “The fact that the stock market is up significantly, that the labour market seems to be improving, and improving consumer sentiment …should lead to a pretty strong holiday season,” he said.“I think consumers are feeling a lot better about their ability to make discretionary purchases,” he said. Retail Metrics’ index of comparable sales at leading chain retailers is currently expected to rise 3 per cent in November against a year ago, following a 1.7 per cent increase last year.This year has been marked by an intensification in promotional efforts by retailers in the weeks running up to “Black Friday” – so named because it once marked the day when a surge in sales allowed retailers to write ledger balances in black ink, rather than red.Shari Ballard, head of Best Buy’s North America business, said the consumer electronics retailer had stepped up marketing spending this year, and begun its television advertising 10 days earlier than last year, in the battle for sales.“It did start earlier this year …I think there is a belief that there is fair amount of pent up demand out there,” she said.Best Buy’s stores were to open early at 5am on Friday. But Kohl’s, the mid-price retailer, pushed its opening forward an hour to 3am, while Target, the mass discounter, is opening an hour earlier at 4am. Sears, the department store, also opened its doors on Thanksgiving for the first time in its 85 year history.Ms Ballard noted that in spite of the attention paid to Black Friday by retailers and the public “it does not historically dictate the holiday” for retailers.“We’ve had years when Black Friday has been tremendously successful for us, but the whole holiday was a little disappointing. We’ve also had the opposite,” she said.Richard Hastings, an economist at Global Hunter Securities who focuses on the retail sector, noted that Black Friday sales tend to be dominated by consumer electronics, toys and some apparel, but that it does not provide “an adequate insight” into broader holiday season spending.He says that consumer spending reflects the “extreme bifurcation” in the fortunes of those with jobs and those without. Department stores are likely to continue to benefit as prosperous shoppers supporting demand for discretionary items such as costume jewellery, cosmetics, fragrances and footwear. But less well off Americans who are more directly affected by unemployment focusing their spending around events such as the Black Friday sales.“People will get out to spend during a major seasonal peak. And those that have less spending power pull back right after,” he said.
187;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-23T20:08:11Z;Cut-price retailers take the limelight;;"Dollar stores, hard discount supermarkets and “off price” clothing stores have long lived in the shadow of America’s top retail names.But just as Walmart supercentres and big box “category killers” such as Best Buy rose to national prominence in the 1990s, so stores such as Save-A-Lot, Big Lots and Dollar General are becoming the new stars of a rapidly changing retail environment.“I do believe that there is a new consumerism,” says Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, which operates more than 9,100 small hard discount general stores in 35 US states. “People are conscious about saving money.”At a time when mainstream retailers have slowed growth in the long months of the recession, or stopped it altogether, the value-focused retailers have continued to expand.By the end of this year the three leading “dollar store” chains – Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree – will have opened about 1,000 new locations this year, with an annual square footage growth rate of 5 per cent that exceeds Walmart, Target and Kmart, their far larger rivals whose growth rates are either flat or below 3 per cent.TJX Companies and Ross Stores too, “off-price” stores that sell seasonal leftovers and end of line brands, have maintained their pre-recession annual growth rates, sometimes moving into retail spaces vacated by bankrupted businesses including Circuit City, the electronics business, and Mervyn’s, the west coast department store chain.“Hard discount” grocers, which offer a highly limited selection of foods dominated by their own private label brands, are also far outstripping the rest of the supermarket business.The US unit of Aldi, the hard discount grocer, plans to expand this year at just under 10 per cent a year, adding another 100 stores to its 1,100 strong chain. Save-A-Lot, a US hard discount supermarket owned by Supervalu, is growing at a similar rate, but wants to double its store network to 2,400 stores by 2015. On the West Coast, the UK’s Tesco has continued to open up more locations for its fledgling Fresh & Easy stores, also a hard discount format.Bill Shaner, Save-A-Lot’s chief executive, says his company’s ambitious expansion plans reflect the view that it is “perfectly positioned in today’s economy”, with an Aldi-like high percentage of private label food goods, and stores with low overheads stocking a limited collection of about 1,800 product lines, including fresh items. This compares with a supermarket industry average of 48,750 product lines, according to the Food Marketing Institute.Executives at all three types of store claim they are managing to hold on to customers they acquired during the recession, and are continuing to see sales growth. Both Dollar General and Family Dollar have been remodelling stores and revamping their own label food brands, in a bid to change perceptions of what to expect in their aisles.Mr Shaner says that the Save-A-Lot stores, which are aimed at households earning less than $45,000, “are seeing new faces”.“I think that is really our opportunity, to communicate a great shopping experience …so that we do manage to keep them when the economy does get stronger.”Dollar General’s Mr Dreiling says the recession sales success of the dollar stores has also helped change perceptions among suppliers, who may initially have been loath to see their brands on the shelves of a dollar store. “When we started our journey there were a lot of people who were looking at us and raising an eyebrow,” he says of the days after the company went private in 2007.But that changed as the recession gathered momentum in early 2008, “when we began to seriously start clocking some serious sales growth”.“Tell me another retailer that’s in a mature channel in a mature business that has basically raised their average store sales volume by 25 per cent over 3 years.”US hard discount grocery sales have room for more growth, currently accounting for less than 2 per cent of total national grocery sales; in Europe market penetration for the same segment ranges from the high teens to about 44 per cent in Germany.Todd Hale, head of retail and shopper insights at Nielsen, the consumer research company, includes the growth of low-cost grocery stores as one of his predictions for changes in the retail landscape by 2015. “Consumers have fundamentally changed their habits,” he said recently.Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree chief executive, says that his chain is “positioned squarely in the cross hairs of what consumers are looking for today”, combining both low costs and accessible local stores. “Middle America is seeking value, and we are the destination.”"
188;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-22T20:24:52Z;Amazon keeps shops in check with app;;Amazon, the online retailer, has underlined the increasing threat to US bricks and mortar stores in the run-up to the Christmas period from shoppers armed with smartphones, with the launch of a price comparison application for Apple’s iPhone.The “Price Check” application allows shoppers to use their iPhone to either scan the barcode of a product in a store, or take its picture using the phone’s camera, in order to compare the price with that offered online by Amazon and other online merchants.Shoppers, who may say or type a product name into their phones, can also use the app to complete an online purchase using their account with the retailer.While similar apps are available elsewhere, the timing of the release by the largest online retailer highlights the extent to which a growing number of shoppers will be checking competitors’ prices even as they shop ahead of Christmas.In the US 28 per cent of mobile phone subscribers now own smartphones, according to figures from Nielsen, the market research company.IDC Retail Insights, a technology-focused consultancy, says a survey of 1,000 consumers carried out in September suggested that more than a third will use mobile devices as they shop this Christmas, including using them to compare prices both online and at nearby stores, and to check product availability.Greg Girard of IDC says that retailers needed to prepare their sales staff for customers presenting them with lower-cost online offers, just as mass retailers and supermarkets have in the past matched rivals’ promotional offers.“There are two things that they should be prepared to do: to speak about the advantage of buying here, by offering better service warrantees or discounts on additional purchases, or to negotiate a lower price.”Retailers have been spending heavily all year on a range of initiatives aimed at smartphone-equipped shoppers, with retailers continuing to create or improve their existing mobile websites.A number of leading retailers including Macy’s, the department store chain, Best Buy, the electronics retailer, and Target, the discounter, launching in-store location-based marketing aimed at smartphone users.Shari Ballard, head of Best Buy’s North American business, said the retailer’s mobile site “is the fastest growing of all the channels we have for reaching customers”.“I think we are in the very, very early days of what is going to be a significant trend”.US retail sales are expected to again outstrip sales at physical stores during the holiday shopping season, after increasing by 8 per cent in November and December last year, according to Forrester, the digital data research company, compared with physical store sales growth of just 0.4 per cent.The National Retail Federation expects overall sales to increase by just 2.3 per cent this year.Forrester is forecasting a stronger 16 per cent increase in online sales in November and December, with online sales accounting for 7 per cent of total retail sales over the holiday period.US retailers’ seasonal online marketing efforts this year include offering low-price offers on the Thursday of the Thanksgiving holiday, when most physical stores are closed.There has also been an increased focus on absorbing shipping costs, with Walmart, the largest US retailer by sales, offering free shipping on some 40,000 items, and Amazon offering free two-day shipping around its post-Thanksgiving sales.
189;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
190;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-17T22:13:19Z;Consumer stocks lead the US risers;;More positive forecasts from retailers including Target helped the consumer discretionary sector lead the risers but overall gains were limited as data showed that prices in the US stagnated and housing starts fell.The consumer discretionary sector rose 0.7 per cent buoyed by a 0.8 per cent rise in the S&P 500 retail index.Target, the discount retailer, beat expectations and issued a positive forecast, repeating Walmart’s strong performance on Tuesday.Target said it expects this Christmas season to be the best in three years and it is hoping to lure shoppers with a new credit card, which offers 5 per cent off all purchases.Shares in Target jumped 3.9 per cent to $55.62.BJ’s Wholesale, another discount retailer, beat expectations and raised its earnings forecast for the year. It was reported this month that the warehouse operator had hired Morgan Stanley to run an auction for the company and explore strategic alternatives. It shares, which have risen 45 per cent so far this year, rose 3 per cent to $47.54.Strong retail earnings and upbeat outlooks were overshadowed on Tuesday by concerns about eurozone sovereign debt and potential inflation risk in China.But investors paused for thought after Tuesday’s sell-off and the S&P 500 closed up a fraction at 1,178.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent lower at 11,007.88 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,476.01.The gains were limited by two weak reports on the US economy.Core consumer prices – excluding food and energy prices – rose less than expected in October and the year-on-year increase was the smallest on record. The price of recreation, education and apparel dropped during the month.“While we’ve been on the sceptical side on the Fed’s new asset plan [quantitative easing mark two] these sorts of numbers only help their defence,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.But he added that low inflation that helped retailers issue positive outlooks.“Inflation is pretty tame which is helping real spending power as wage income has been accelerating as the labour market is gradually improving,” he said.Construction began on fewer houses than forecast in October, a separate report showed, pushing the S&P 500 homebuilder index down by 2.4 per cent.Lennar lost 1.7 per cent to $15.50 and DR Horton dropped 3.1 per cent to $10.68.Elsewhere, NetApp declined sharply in the late afternoon when its results were released before the closing bell.The maker of storage equipment sunk 6.5 per cent to $49.25, and was followed lower by other data storage companies, when it said that there had been a slowdown in computer spending by corporations.Financials led the fallers as the Federal Reserve issued guidelines on how it will decide in banks can increase dividends and buybacks. The S&P 500 financials index lost 0.6 per cent with Morgan Stanley down 2.1 per cent at $25.09 and Wells Fargodeclining 1.2 per cent to $26.86.Deals and initial public offering activity continued. Dynegywas up 0.8 per cent to $5.06 after Blackstone raised its bid for the energy company at the last minute.The private equity firm offered $5 a share, valuing the company at $602m, after Dynegy’s two largest shareholders, activist investor Carl Icahn and hedge fund Seneca Capital, were fiercely opposed to the deal.The two shareholders said the new offer still undervalues the company but it was reported that Blackstone felt confident that it had the shareholder support needed for the increased bid.Shares in Dynegy have gained 8.8 per cent in the past five days but are lower by 44 per cent for the year to date.In a busy week for initial public offerings, including the General Motors IPO due on Thursday, Booz Allen Hamilton had its market debut on Wednesday.The consulting firm, majority-owned by private equity firm Carlyle Group, raised $238m selling 14m shares at $17 each. Its shares climbed 13.2 per cent to $19.25.
191;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target predicts strong holiday sales;;Target, the US retailer, said it expects its best sales performance in three years during the crucial holiday shopping season as consumers with pent-up demand head to its stores to take advantage of its new credit card rewards programme and a wider array of merchandise.The discount chain said on Wednesday that its third-quarter net income surged by 22.6 per cent to $535m, or 75 cents a share, up from $436m, or 58 cents, in the same period a year ago. Target benefited from rising retail sales, which increased by 3 per cent to $15.2bn, along with a healthier credit card unit.Target’s bad debt expenses declined by 64 per cent to $110m, helping to more than double profits in its credit card division to $130m. The company said it expects its new REDcard reward scheme, which offers 5 per cent discounts on purchases made with the Target’s credit card, to help drive holiday sales.The Minnesota-based company has also worked to diversify its offerings this year, remodelling many of its stores and selling fresh food and groceries.“We’ve built our holiday season plans to create excitement and provide our guests unbeatable value,” said Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive. “We are well-positioned for the fourth quarter.”Target’s comparable store sales - the metric most closely watched by retailers - rose by 1.6 per cent in the quarter, beating Walmart, which said earlier this week that its US same store sales fell by 1.3 per cent. Target tends to benefit from wealthier customer base with more flexible discretionary spending habits.“The Target shopper that traded down to Walmart in 2009 has gone back to Target,” said Brian Sozzi, a retail analyst at Wall Street Strategies. “The consumer has the means to spend and they are showing the willingness to do it.”Kathryn Tesija, Target’s vice president of merchandising, told analysts that customers are still cautious but are showing more willingness to make impulse purchases than they were last year. Sales have been rising for electronics, including televisions and video game consoles, as prices decline on those products.Although Target was optimistic about the end of the year, the company said that it is closely watching bubbling inflation trends that are looming for the beginning of next year. Ms Tesija noted that cotton prices are up 80 per cent and prices for synthetic fibres are up by 50 per cent, making it possible that some of those costs will need to be passed onto customers shopping for apparel.Shares of Target rose 4.22 per cent to $55.80 in mid-morning trading on Wednesday.
192;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-12T18:43:39Z;Mid-priced US retailers ring up rising sales;;Three of the largest US department stores have provided further evidence that middle-income consumers are spending more, in spite of high unemployment and depressed house prices.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said on Friday that the mid-price retailer had seen “clear signs of strength in key businesses” during its third-quarter as it reported earnings ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.JC Penney said it expected to see comparable sales rise by 3-4 per cent during the quarter ending January 31, which would continue a slow but steady recovery in spending by its core mid-income shoppers.The department store sector’s monthly sales this year have regularly outperformed both Walmart and Target, the largest mass discounters, who serve a predominantly lower-income customer base.Macy’s, the largest US department store by sales, this week forecast holiday quarter sales growth in the same range, while Kohl’s, JC Penney’s main rival in the mid and lower-price range, gave a 2-4 per cent target.Macy’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.9 per cent in its third quarter, highlighted the particular strength of its upmarket Bloomingdale’s chain.Kohl’s reported that sales of its more expensive “Simply Vera” line by designer Vera Wang had grown more than 15 per cent during the quarter.JC Penney said it had seen “clear signs of strength” in sales of cosmetics and fragrances at its 231 store-within-a-store Sephora locations.Similar signs of sales strength during the third quarter have been reported by several retailers whose sales slumped after the 2008 financial crisis, including Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural supermarket, Starbucks, the coffee business, and Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie retailer.Estee Lauder, the upmarket beauty brand business, also said recently that beauty sales at “prestige” department store counters and at Sephora stores, owned by LVMH, had outstripped growth at lower price drug stores and discounters during the third quarter.Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney are all still taking a strongly promotional marketing approach to the holiday shopping season, launching a series of special weekend sales offers in the run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday.But Kevin Mansell, chief financial officer of Kohl’s, said its marketing message this year had moved away from stressing just low prices to a broader focus on value for money.“A lot of the incremental marketing we are doing . . . is around convincing and communicating to consumers why what we give them for the price is of better overall total value,” he said.JC Penney reported third-quarter earnings of $44m, or 19 cents per diluted share, up 63 per cent on the same period last year.Total revenues were almost unchanged at $4.19bn, reflecting a decision to end distribution of its mail-order catalogue on the rise of online shopping.
193;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-09T00:48:20Z;Amazon aims to woo women with Quidsi buy;;Jeff Bezos confirmed Amazon’s company’s $545m deal to acquire Quidsi, the largest US online retailer of diapers, or nappies, and other baby products.But while the Amazon founder and chief executive praised the speed and low costs of Quidsi’s Diapers.com website, he did not mention that the deal also delivered what Amazon itself needs more of – young female customers.Quidsi has said that about 80 per cent of Diapers.com’s almost 500,000 customers are women, an audience it has sought to develop with two new, linked sites – Soap.com and Beautybar.com – that sell household essentials and premium beauty products.“The mom is the cornerstone of the audience we try to serve,” says Marc Lore, co-founder of Quidsi.Women are responsible for 72 per cent of consumer purchasing in the US, according to Boston Consulting Group. But they have been less dominant online and make up only 48.8 per cent of Amazon’s customers, according to data from comScore, the market research company.For women aged 25 to 34 – which would include the bulk of customers of Diapers.com – the percentage drops to 46.4 per cent.Fiona Dias, head of strategy at GSI Commerce, a web-services company that competes with Amazon, says research suggests that women were less eager to embrace Amazon Prime, the $79 annual subscription shipping model that Amazon uses to persuade customers to buy more from its site.She says: “Thanks to its electronics business, Amazon has done terrifically well with male customers.“But they have struggled with apparel, and they have struggled with consumables . . . they really need to get more women into the mix.”Amazon’s recent efforts to woo women have included launching a “Mom’s Club” for young parents this summer that offers steep discounts to customers who place regular subscription-style orders for nappies, wipes and other basics.Quidsi, in contrast, has focused on building sales by allowing orders from all three of its sites to be combined for free delivery, in many areas of the US on the following day.The Quidsi deal also comes a year after the world’s largest online retailer closed its $1.1bn acquisition of Zappos, the online shoes, handbags and fashion retailer, which like Diapers.com promises free delivery and returns. Some 62 per cent of Zappos customers are women, according to comScore data.Winning more women customers from both sites could help Amazon’s efforts to strengthen its broader position in online clothing sales, which overtook computers and software as the largest online category in the US three years ago.In the US, its efforts have included launching the separate Endless shoe and accessory site, and acquiring Shopbop, an online fashion retailer, four years ago.It has also been overhauling how it sells clothing online, importing some of the more advanced merchandising techniques developed by its Endless site. This summer it also acquired BuyVIP, a European “flash sales” fashion web retailer.The Quidsi acquisition also intensifies Amazon’s online battle with Walmart, the largest US retailer, as both seek to use sales of low-priced household essentials to drive repeat visits to their sites, and additional, higher margin sales.Walmart is already involved in an online battle over nappies, the only category where it is currently offering free delivery on all orders. This summer it also launched online sales of household and beauty goods, and it is slowly expanding into sales of online packaged foods, which Amazon launched four years ago.Sucharita Mulpuru, online retail analyst at Forrester, says the developing online business is also a potential threat to sales at physical stores, because purchasing nappies is one of the main drivers bringing young parents into Walmart, Target and other general retailers.She says: “If you give parents a reason to buy online, then that ends that store visit, and it’s not just diapers that they buy when they get to the store.”
194;TGT;Target Corp;2010-11-04T20:54:32Z;Financials lead sector gains in US stocks;;Financials, materials and energy shares led US stocks to their highest levels in two years as investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s decision to extend quantitative easing.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rose with nine up more than 1 per cent.The S&P 500 closed up 1.9 per cent to 1,221.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 2 per cent to close at 11,434.77 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.5 per cent higher at 2,577.34.The dollar weakened and commodity and oil prices rose, helping the energy sector to add 3 per cent and the materials sector to advance 3.3 per cent.ExxonMobil soared 2.1 per cent to $69.38 and Chevron climbed 3 per cent to $85.14. Cliffs Natural Resources jumped 4.7 per cent to $70.00 and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold surged 7 per cent to $103.89.Stephen Wood, chief market strategist for North America at Russell Investment, said stocks could rally into the end of the year as diminished uncertainty after quantitative easing, the midterms and stabilising jobs and housing data helped investor confidence.“Cyclicals like energy and materials are very good suspects for leading markets [where as] financials have a lot of question marks like Basel III and Dodd-Frank,” he said.He added that natural resources stocks were soaring partly due to quantitative easing but also because of expectations that China would end its tightening cycle in the first half of next year.The financials rallied later in the session, up 3.4 per cent, after it was reported that the Federal Reserve might allow banks with strong capital levels to increase dividends. The two biggest banks by assets led the risers. Bank of America jumped 5.2 per cent to $12.12 and JPMorgan Chase shot up 5.5 per cent to $39.80.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 retailers index rose 1.7 per cent, lifting the wider consumer discretionary sector by 1.6 per cent as retailers reported their October same-store sales.Gap, Target and Macy’s all beat expectations. Gap jumped 6.1 per cent to $20.43, Target climbed 1.5 per cent to $54.76 and Macy’s gained 6.6 per cent to $25.56.Even shares in Kohl’s, where same-store sales fell and the retailer lowered its third-quarter outlook, rose 2.3 per cent to $51.92.Some retailers also reported their quarterly earnings. Limited Brands, which owns the Victoria’s Secret chain, advanced 5.3 per cent to $31.43 after it beat estimates. Shares in Limited Brands have risen 68.2 per cent this year.In food retail stores, Whole Foods rocketed 15.1 per cent to $47.27 after the upmarket grocer raised its 2011 profit forecast and beat expectations in its fourth quarter. Same-store sales rose 8.7 per cent as customers dipped into their pockets for more organic and gourmet foods.At the other end of the spectrum, Costco, the warehouse club operator, said its same-store sales rose 6 per cent in October. Its shares were higher by 3.7 per cent to $65.48.News Corp, the owner of Fox News and newspapers around the world, beat expectations as advertising recovered. Revenue grew 17 per cent at Fox News after it led the cable news ratings, helping to increase operating income at the division by 23 per cent. But its shares edged down 0.6 per cent to $14.75.Cable operators also beat expectations with their quarterly earnings as they added more internet and phone subscribers.Time Warner Cable said it added more internet customers even though the number of basic video subscribers fell. Revenue and profit rose and the company said it would launch a $4bn share buy-back programme. Its shares advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.33.Cablevision Systems also reported better-than-expected results. Its shares jumped 2.6 per cent to $28.36.US-listed shares in PotashCorp dropped 2.4 per cent to $141.97 after the Canadian government rejected BHP Billiton’s $39bn bid. Potash shares have risen 29.2 per cent this year as the Australian miner has pursued the company. BHP Billiton, which added 6 per cent to $91.20, has 30 days to appeal.
195;TGT;Target Corp;2010-10-18T15:20:32Z;JC Penney adopts ‘poison pill’ shareholder plan;;JC Penney, the US department store chain, on Monday adopted a “poison pill” shareholders rights plan, following the acquisition of more than 25 per cent of its shares by Pershing Square, the activist hedge fund, and Vornado, the real estate investment company.The company said it had adopted the agreement, which has a one-year term, “to promote fair and equal treatment of …stockholders in connection with any initiative to acquire control of the company, and in light of recent rapid accumulations of a significant percentage of the company’s outstanding common stock.”Pershing Square, headed by William Ackman, and Vonado have said they plan to cooperate with each other in discussions with JC Penney’s management, and that they invested in the company because they considered its shares undervalued.Neither has yet made public any strategy proposals, although Mr Ackman remarked at an investors’ presentation this month that the retailer had a strong brand, and held a real estate portfolio that was better than its competitors.In 2008, Mr Ackman used a stake in Target, the mass discounter, to argue that the retailer should spin off its real estate holdings into a separate business, and use the money to buyback shares. He eventually launched a proxy battle, but failed to secure seats on Target’s board.JC Penney’s poison pill would dilute the holdings of Pershing if it were to add to 16.5 per cent stake in the company it already holds. It would also be triggered if any other party acquires more than 10 per cent of the stock. Vornado’s stake is currently 9.9 per cent.If triggered, existing shareholders would in effect have the right to buy half price shares, while the acquiring party that triggered the agreement would not.JC Penney’s shares were trading at mid-morning on Monday in New York at $32.98, down just over 2 per cent. The shares were trading below $20 in late September, before Pershing Square and Vornado began their buying spree.JC Penney is being advised by Barclays Capital and Goldman Sachs.
196;TGT;Target Corp;2010-10-14T21:59:47Z;Verizon and AT&T stores to sell iPad tablets;;Verizon Wireless and AT&T stores in the US will begin selling Apple’s popular iPad later this month in a move that is expected to fuel demand for the iPad just as rivals including Samsung, Toshiba and others prepare to launch their own tablet devices.“The combination of these two new agreements, along with the iPad launch at Target on October 3 and Walmart’s plans to begin selling iPads on October 15 will continue to drive better-than-expected demand for iPad, “ said Brian White, an analyst with Ticonderoga Securities.Mr While told clients in a report published on Thursday that he also believes China Unicom will begin offering the iPad before the year is finished.“We believe these announcements are significant in Apple’s push to expand the adoption of iPad before competitors begin offering tablet-like devices in early 2011,” he said. “Additionally, this aggressive sales channel expansion by Apple supports our field check last week with a Taiwan supplier that is expecting up to 45m iPad unit sales this year - more than double our 21.8m forecast.”AT&T, which is also the exclusive network provider for the iPhone in the US, already provides the 3G wireless service for the iPad, but consumers will now be able to purchase both the WiFi-only and cellular-enabled iPad models in AT&T stores.Rival Verizon Wireless will sell only the WiFi-enabled iPad models bundled with the Verizon MiFi 2200 Intelligent Mobile Hotspot – a small portable WiFi device that provides wireless internet access for up to five connected devices over a cellular network.The arrangement with Verizon Wireless could indicate a warming in relations between Apple and Verizon Wireless amid unconfirmed reports that Apple will begin to offer a version of the iPad that will run on Verizon’s cellular network early next year.Verizon Wireless, the largest US wireless network operator and a joint venture between Verizon Communications and Britain’s Vodafone group, is about to begin the roll-out of a new 4G high-speed data network based on a technology called LTE. However some analysts have suggested that a Verizon version of Apple’s iPhone would run on the company’s existing 3G CDMA network.Verizon Wireless has made no secret of its desire to be able to offer Apple’s iPhone, however both companies have declined to comment on the latest speculation.Apple currently sells three WiFi models of its popular tablet computer with prices ranging from $500 for a 16GB WiFi-only device to $830 for the largest capacity 64GB 3G cellular-enabled model.

The California-based bank, the US’s fourth largest by deposits, has not yet suspended foreclosures as Bank of America and others have.JPMorgan Chase, which reported expectations-beating earnings on Wednesday, warned that it could face legal charges associated with its mortgages. Its shares fell again, by 3.2 per cent to $38.56.Analysts at FBR Capital Markets warned that the industry could see losses of $6bn-$10bn, including litigation and delayed foreclosure costs, though it said most of those losses would not affect banks’ capital ratios.“The real cost to the industry is going to be the drag on the foreclosure process, which could delay any recovery in the housing market that might be on the horizon,” said Paul Miller, FBR analyst.Bank of America shares dropped 5.2 per cent to $12.60 and Citigroup fell 4.5 per cent to $4.06. PNC Financial Services lost 2.2 per cent to $51.75.H&R Block, the tax preparer, fell 10 per cent to $12.31. It had originated mortgages until 2008. Analysts warned it could be more vulnerable than much larger banks to lawsuits.Mortgage guarantors, however, gained on the prospect of fewer foreclosures. MBIA added 16 per cent, to $13.00 a share, and Assured Guaranty gained 9.1 per cent to $21.89.Financials, which fell 1.8 per cent, led a broader market decline.The S&P 500 index was down 0.4 per cent at 1,173.81, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2 per cent to 2,435.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 11,094.57.Shares in Apollo Group, the private education company, plunged 23 per cent to $38.00 after it withdrew its 2011 forecast, citing a possible 40 per cent decline in the number of students asregulators scrutinise potentially misleading student loan practices.Its shares are down more than 37 per cent since the beginning of the year.Analysts across the Street, however, reiterated their recommendation of the shares at such low prices, suggesting that new rules could improve Apollo’s business by reducing defaults.Citigroup analyst Ariel Sokol also said this week that the US midterm elections could be a catalyst for gains if Republicans take a large majority in Congress, as they intend to rein in scrutiny of the sector.Rival DeVry fell 17 per cent to $42.06 a share, and Corinthian Colleges fell 20 per cent to $4.79. The Washington Post Co, which owns the Kaplan education group, fell 9 per cent to $390.25 a share.Also holding back shares was a report that producer prices were growing faster than consumer prices.The PPI grew 4 per cent in September year-over-year, versus 1.1 per cent for the CPI as of August. The September CPI is reported tomorrow.“We’ve had this great margin expansion story helping earnings and now it looks like the next move is down,” said Jim Grefenstette, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.Margin-sensitive groups were vulnerable. Walmart, the US’s largest retailer, fell 1.1 per cent to $53.25 a share. Rival Target dropped 0.6 per cent to $54.07.Yahoo gained 4.5 per cent to $15.93 on reports that it had engaged Goldman Sachs in order to defend the company from private equity groups. In 2008, Yahoo turned down a $31-a -share offer by Microsoft.Shares in Verizon rose 0.7 per cent to $32.44 after confirming that it would begin selling the iPad on October 28. Apple shares rose 0.7 per cent to $302.31.Telecoms were the only sector to gain, adding 0.2 per cent.

198;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Pershing and Vornado reveal JC Penney stake;;"Pershing Square, the activist investor fund run by Bill Ackman, and Vornado, the real estate investment trust, have acquired control of a combined 26.7 per cent of JC Penney, in a challenge to the management of the mid-range US department store.Pershing Square said on Friday it had control of 16.8 per cent of the department stores shares, making it the retailer’s largest shareholder, while Vornado said in separate regulatory filing that it had acquired a 9.9 per cent stake. Both said they planned to cooperate and would hold talks with management on issues including finances and strategy.Wall Street analysts said the combined move is likely to focus attention on JC Penney’s real estate assets.Mr Ackman fought an unsuccessful proxy battle with the management of Target three years ago, after proposing spinning off the discount retailer’s extensive real estate holdings into a separate real estate investment trust.Vornado’s significant retail moves have included taking part in the private equity buy-out of Toys R Us in 2006, and supporting the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart by Eddie Lampert, the hedge fund billionaire.JC Penney, founded in 1902, operates more than 1,000 department stores that are mainly based in regional shopping malls and are aimed at middle-income customers.Under Mike Ullman, chief executive since 2004, the retailer has focused on differentiating itself from competition from lower price retailers such as Target and
Walmart by evolving a successful private label strategy.It has also faced intense rivalry from Kohl’s, a rapidly expanding chain that has successfully developed off-mall locations, while JC Penney’s stores have been hit by overall declines in traffic levels at regional malls.The retailer is set to unveil a new partnership with Mango, the European fast fashion brand, and is expanding a network of Sephora-branded beauty and cosmetic store-within-a-store units.In the filing, Pershing said it had begun building its JC Penney stake in mid-August, took a break in early September and then resumed buying at the end of the month before finishing on Thursday. Vornado started building its stake at the end of September, and also finished on Thursday.Most of Pershing’s shares were accumulated when the retailer’s stock was trading around $20. Its shares have risen sharply this month, and closed on Friday up over 2 per cent at $32.49.Mr Ackman’s recent investments have included General Growth Properties, one of the largest owners of US shopping malls, where he backed an $8.5bn recapitalisation plan to help the company emerge from bankruptcy. He is also a significant shareholder in Borders, the second largest US bookstore.Pershing manages about $7bn. It also said on Friday it had acquired an 11 per cent stake in Fortune Brands, a company whose brand portfolio includes the Jim Beam bourbon, home security, kitchen cabinets, and gold products."
199;TGT;Target Corp;2010-10-07T14:42:15Z;Late back-to-school buying lifts retail sales;;US chain retailers reported broadly better-than-expected store sales during September, supported by last minute back-to-school and college shopping that boosted teen and youth retailers in particular.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2.7 per cent in September. He cited strong back-to-school selling “coupled with attractive fall fashions, aggressive promotions and a near-record September stock market rise” as factors supporting the performance.Limited Brands, whose store brands include Victoria’s Secret, Pink and Bath & Body Works, reported a 12 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, with margins up “significantly” as the company avoided the price-cutting promotions seen last year.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, said same store sales rose 4.8 per cent. Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the back-to-school period was “one of our most successful in years”. He highlighted the performance of its Material Girl teen clothing collection, a joint venture with Madonna, and its American Rag clothing for teen boys.JC Penney said its sales rose 5.1 per cent, ahead of expectations. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales up 3 per cent. Kohl’s said on Wednesday that it would increase its temporary holiday staff hiring this year by 20 per cent, reflecting new store additions and increasing confidence in holiday demand.Luxury and high-end stores also performed well, with Neiman Marcus reporting same store sales up 4.7 per cent, Nordstrom up 7.5 per cent and Saks up 6.5 per cent.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the strong performance of higher-end spenders was “especially encouraging for the economy and the upcoming holiday-shopping season because the top 20 per cent of households by income account for nearly 40 per cent of total consumption”.Several teen and youth fashion retailers who have struggled over the past year with sluggish discretionary spending also fared better than expected. Abercrombie & Fitch reported a 13 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. Zumiez, a teen retailer, said its same store sales rose 17 per cent, and raised its earnings guidance for the quarter. Buckle and Aeropostale both saw comparable sales up 3 per cent.But Target, the discount retailer, said its 1.3 per cent increase in comparable sales was lower than it had expected, despite being pleased with its back-to-school performance. Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gap, the largest US clothing retailer, reported a 1 per cent drop in same store sales, saying that September had been more challenging that it had expected.Sales at its Gap stores in North America fell 1 per cent, despite efforts to draw sales with a large marketing focus on black denim pants that the company said would increase inventory levels. Gap’s lower-price Old Navy stores reported a 5 per cent drop.Costco, the warehouse club, said on Wednesday that its same store sales rose 5 per cent, also slightly above Wall Street’s expectations, although US store sales excluding fuel were slightly below forecasts, at 2 per cent.
200;TGT;Target Corp;2010-10-06T04:10:59Z;US retailers’ group predicts holiday rebound;;"The National Retail Federation, the largest US retail industry group, has said it expects to see a 2.3 per cent increase in holiday sales this year, with retailers battling to lure shoppers still sharply focused on stretching their dollars.The forecast increase, to $447.1bn in November and December, is lower than the average 2.5 per cent rise seen in the holiday periods over the past 10 years. It contrasts with the 0.4 per cent rise seen at the end of last year and the 3.9 per cent drop seen at the end of 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the NRF, said US consumers had shown they were again willing to spend on things they wanted. But “they will still be very conscientious about what they buy and how much they buy”, he said. “Retailers will have to convince shoppers the recession is over.”A number of retailers have already unveiled moves aimed at driving sales during the holidays.Toys R Us, the largest US toy retailer; Sears, the department store; and Kmart, the discounter, have all launched Christmas savings clubs, offering customers a 3 per cent bonus on money they set aside for holiday spending. Target, the mass discounter, is preparing to launch a 5 per cent discount offer for all purchases on its store credit and debit cards, which it predicts will boost fourth-quarter sales by 1 percentage point.Best Buy, the largest consumer electronics retailer, is launching new financing arrangements for bundles of purchases.Gerald Storch, chief executive of Toys R Us, has said he expects the toy category to again outperform the rest of the retail industry, following the 3.9 per cent increase in comparable sales that his US stores reported during last year’s nine-week holiday sales period. “People will spend for hot toys …The last thing they cut back on is toys for kids,” he said.Toys R Us has begun opening 600 small, temporary “pop-up” stores in shopping precincts and plazas.Brian Dunn, chief executive of Best Buy, has said that while “we know it’s a tough environment out there”, the retailer would deliver extra value with services such as a free 24-hour holiday helpline.Separately, the International Council of Shopping Centers said it expected to see its index of comparable sales at leading chain stores increase by 3 to 3.5 per cent, the strongest growth since 2006. The index rose 2.3 per cent last year.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the ICSC, said the group expected stronger holiday hiring and overall employment growth to support increased spending."
201;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Retail: Digital-savvy shoppers drive change;;Best Buy, the largest US electronics retailer, is testing a system that sends messages about special offers to customers’ mobile phones when they enter its stores.Kohl’s, the mid-price department store, is rolling out in-store touch screen kiosks that will allow customers to order online items that are not available in the store.JCPenney, its rival, is moving towards the launch of a mobile e-commerce platform, and has just upgraded its website search system.Walmart, the international retail group, is creating a global e-commerce platform.Customer demand may still be sluggish after the recession of the past two years, but US retailers have been continuing to spend money on technology aimed at their customers.“Retailers have maintained as spending priorities anything that may enhance the customer relationship or experience,” says Nikki Baird, of Retail Systems Research, a consultancy that specialises in retailers’ information systems. “Everything else has struggled.”The current spending on customer-facing technology is supported by the need, in a slow-growth economy, to deliver increased sales by luring shoppers away from rivals, says Ms Baird. But it also reflects a significant shift in the traditional world of retail technology.Instead of introducing customers to technology aimed at increasing operational efficiency, such as bar codes, or electronic payments, retailers are now struggling to stay abreast of the technology at the fingertips of their customers.Shoppers equipped with smartphones can now use tools from the online world in-store. They can check prices at rival stores and look for independent product reviews. They can use their phones to receive digital offers, and increasingly to access payment systems and complete transactions.But dealing with the digitally equipped “multichannel” shopper is presenting challenges for the industry that go well beyond what the customer sees in the store.“It may start with the customer,” says Ms Baird. “But as soon as we go down that path, there are questions to do with business models, supply chain design, how you compensate stores for online sales that happen at an [in-store] kiosk. These are big issues for a retailer.”“It’s not just about integrating channels, it is about changing your business model, and no one wants to hear that.”For retailers, the challenges of creating a single customer experience both online and in stores can encompass basic considerations such as ensuring the prices or offers are the same whether the customer is buying in a shop or via the internet.In one of the most radical responses to the challenge, Moosejaw, a small outdoor equipment retail chain based in Michigan, has done away with a separate computer system for its point-of-sale devices.Instead, the in-store machines connect to the same IBM Websphere Commerce database as its e-commerce site, which is also used by its call-centre sales staff. The system also operates a loyalty reward scheme – the customer’s purchase history is accessible in all channels. “All the channels are updated in real time and can each offer the exact same features,” says Gary Wohlfeill, Moosejaw’s creative director.With just seven stores, Moosejaw’s multichannel transformation was relatively straightforward.At the other end of the scale, Tom Nealon, chief information officer at JCPenney since 2006, is overseeing the creation of a digital platform for the retailer, which has more than 1,000 stores and sales of $17bn last year. The platform, he says, will eventually encompass “all the main pro­cesses you need to run any business”.“Traditionally, a digital platform is certainly customer-experience kind of stuff,” he says. “But even there, we take it deeper into order management, fulfilment, enterprise planned allocation, customer analytics. It is really quite comprehensive.”Initially, JCPenney’s online business – worth more than $1bn annually – was largely built on its “big book” catalogue business, which presented customers with more conservative products than its stores.The shift to a single buying system and fully-aligned merchandise meant that some sales were lost in the trans­ition, with the old big book catalogue finally discontinued this year.Mr Nealon says the introduction of the new technology has largely followed rather than led those organisational changes, which he said were “a huge first step”.Once the new teams started working together, “that’s when you started to see what the process needs were, and how you were going to build the technology out.”The first part of the e-commerce platform to be launched will, however, be its mobile e-commerce capability – an area that is gaining attention from a range of leading retailers, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Sears Holdings.But, while most now have mobile phone applications that allow customers to browse their website or locate stores, they provide “brand-building” and information, rather than mobile transactions, which require a full digital platform.“Mobile has become a huge priority just in the past eight or nine months,” says RSR’s Ms Baird. “The CIOs I’ve talked to say that, while they are throwing out customer-facing applications, they are frantically working on the back-end to be able to support them in an efficient, sustainable and leverageable way.”Smartphone apps, says Mr Nealon, raise the question “to what degree do you intend to transact business through that application?”“That’s where the new digital platform comes in. You actually have to have the order management, fulfilment and the pricing capability [to support mobile transactions]. That’s what we’re building out right now.”
202;TGT;Target Corp;2010-09-09T19:09:25Z;Barnes & Noble in fresh spat with Burkle;;Barnes & Noble, the US bookseller, has hit back at attempts by Ron Burkle, the billionaire investor, to turn a battle over board seats at the retailer into a referendum on the record of its founder, Leonard Riggio.In its letter to shareholders ahead of its annual meeting on September 28, the retailer defended last year’s $514m purchase of a college bookstore business, then owned by Mr Riggio and his wife, arguing that the business “was delivering compelling shareholder value” and offered long-term strategic benefits.It also argued that Barnes & Noble’s 1999 purchase for $209m of a video game retailer owned by Mr Riggio, eventually led to the successful spin-off of the GameStop business, delivering several billion dollars in shareholder value.Mr Burkle, who is seeking seats on the Barnes & Noble board for himself and two others, has made the college bookstore transaction central to his campaign, arguing this week that the board “has been a rubber stamp for transactions benefiting the Riggio family”.Mr Burkle’s Yucaipa investment group holds almost 20 per cent of Barnes & Noble’s shares and wants to overturn a poison-pill provision that prevents any further rise in its stake. Mr Riggio and his brother Stephen together hold more than a third of the bookseller’s shares.Barnes & Noble has focused its campaign against Mr Burkle on the claim that he is seeking to gain control of the company through an informal alliance with Aletheia, a Los Angeles investment fund. It accuses him of a “thinly veiled attempt” to gain control without paying a takeover premium.Aletheia has invested alongside Yucaipa in other companies, including A&P supermarkets and Wild Oats, the natural and organic grocer now owned by Whole Foods.Aletheia holds about 15 per cent of the bookseller’s shares.The battle pits Mr Burkle, who made his name in the consolidation of the US supermarket business in the late 1990s, against the Bronx-born Mr Riggio, a self-made entrepreneur whose bookstores transformed the US industry in the 1980s and 1990s.Barnes & Noble, which operates slightly more than 700 stores, has accused Mr Burkle of lacking a strategic plan for the company.Mr Burkle has questioned Barnes & Noble’s costly investments in the emerging digital book business, which have included launching its own e-reader, the Nook, to challenge Amazon’s Kindle reader.The fundamental challenges facing the bookseller’s physical business were underlined on Thursday by news that Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, is to start selling Amazon’s Kindle.The Kindle is also to be sold at Target, the discounter, and at Staples, the office supply company.Barnes & Noble cited continued declines in sales of physical books as one of the factors behind a $62.5m loss in its most recent quarter to July 31, with a 0.9 per cent decline in comparable sales at its stores.Borders, its smaller rival, reported a $46.7m loss for its most recent quarter, with same-store sales down 6.8 per cent.
203;TGT;Target Corp;2010-09-01T17:39:59Z;Twist in the tale for digital reading;;When I’d Know You Anywhere, the new thriller by author Laura Lippman went on sale two weeks ago, HarperCollins Publishers had high hopes for the book, promoting it aggressively in stores and online.But even the publisher was surprised by one measure of its success. In its first two weeks on sale, I’d Know You Anywhere sold more e-books than hardcovers.With about 11,250 electronic copies of the book sold compared with 9,300 or so hardcovers, Ms Lippman’s novel is the first significant new release to be more popular as an e-book than as a physical book.“It is a very encouraging story,” said Ana Maria Allessi, vice-president and publisher at HarperMedia.As digital reading continues to gain in popularity, this minor milestone adds to the growing body of evidence of e-books’ fast-growing level of importance to the publishing industry.Thanks to falling e-reader prices, a growing digital inventory and changing consumer habits, publishers are reporting strong e-book sales. Meanwhile, device makers such as Amazon, Sony and Barnes & Noble are selling e-readers by the truckload, with as many as 10m expected to be in use in the US this year according to Forrester Research.Sony revealed its latest generation of e-readers on Wednesday. The Pocket Edition, Touch Edition and Daily Edition will go head to head against the Barnes & Noble Nook, the Amazon Kindle and Apple’s iPad.“The pace of change here is surprising,” said Dominic Field, partner at the Boston Consulting Group. “Consumers appear willing to pay for the convenience of electronic publishing.”The Association of American Publishers said e-book sales grew 119 per cent year-on-year in June with sales of $30m, and that year-to-date e-book sales are up 204 per cent on the first seven months of 2009. Though e-books only make up about 2.7 per cent of the overall US book market, the segment is a bright spot.Random House on Tuesday said e-book sales surged 300 per cent in the first six months of the year, with comparable gains in Germany and the UK. “This additional e-book revenue and readership opportunity is just one of the many reasons we are so excited about our robust digital-publishing momentum,” wrote Markus Dohle, Random House chief executive, in a letter to the company.Stieg Larsson, the late author of the Millennium trilogy, is the first to sell 1m e-books on the Kindle, while other authors, including Nora Roberts, have sold more than 500,000 e-books.Hachette Livre, the French publisher, has sold more e-books in the first half of this year than it did in all of 2009. Pearson, the educational publisher which also owns the Financial Times, says e-book sales at Penguin during July grew threefold on the same month last year.One factor driving the brisk sales is the broader awareness about tablets and e-readers among the general public. A tipping point came early in the year, when Apple introduced the iPad.Though it is a multifunction device, Steve Jobs, Apple chief executive, highlighted its book reading functions when he revealed it in April, and five of the six major publishers now sell e-books in Apple’s iBookstore.“You have to credit the power of the Apple marketing and publicity machine,” said Mr Field. “They’ve taken a new category and turbocharged it.”While some feared the iPad might kill dedicated reader devices, this buzz has boosted sales across the industry. Amazon’s Kindle is now the online retailer’s best-selling product, while big US retailers such as Staples and Target are selling e-readers in their stores.Rapid adoption of e-readers and e-books is giving companies new insights into contemporary reading habits, and upending some assumptions.“When this industry came about it was built on the premise of travelling. But that’s not the case,” said Steve Haber, Sony’s head of digital reading. “The majority of people are reading at home.”“People are comfortable having multiple devices in their lives,” said Forrester analyst James McQuivey, pointing to the ongoing success of digital cameras and MP3 players.While it is early days for the segment, these insights are encouraging device makers and publishers to believe that digital reading, and profitability, may be here to stay.“This industry was looking for a panacea,” said Mr Field. “And they are very excited about this.”
204;TGT;Target Corp;2010-08-19T20:45:32Z;US stocks fall on jobless data;;US stocks fell today after surprisingly weak manufacturing and jobless figures shook investor confidence, overshadowing a deal between Intel and McAfee.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,075.63, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.4 per cent to close at 10,271.21 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 1.7 per cent lower at 2,178.95.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 fell more than 1 per cent with three falling more than 2 per cent.Concerns about the pace of economic recovery particularly hit industrial stocks, down 2.1 per cent, and the financial sector, which fell 2.4 per cent.The Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing index plummeted to minus 7.7 in August, showing that factories in the region slowed production for the first time in a year. Economists had forecast the figure would rise to plus 7 points.The Conference Board’s index of leading indicators, a compendium of forward-looking economic data, was also released. It rose 0.1 per cent in July, in line with expectations.In deals news, Intel agreed to buy antivirus software maker McAfee in a deal worth $7.68bn in cash.The chipmaker will pay $48 a share, a 60 per cent premium to McAfee’s closing price on Wednesday.Intel shares fell 3.5 per cent to $18.90 as it said the deal may slightly dilute earnings in the first year but McAfee surged 57.1 per cent to $47.01.Symantec, a competitor of McAfee, jumped 6.2 per cent to $13.37.Retailers, buoyed on Wednesday by a positive outlook from discounter Target, reported mixed results. Among the fallers, Sears, the largest US department store chain, reported a worse-than-expected loss and revenues missed estimates.The retailer’s net loss narrowed to 36 cents a share excluding exceptionals, compared with analysts’ forecast of 18 cents per share. Sales fell to $10.5bn, just below projections of $10.6bn, as its Kmart discount chain suffered from weak food sales and its Sears-branded chain saw reduced demand for some home improvement products and consumer electronics. Its shares slumped 9.2 per cent to $61.03.Staples also fell, down 3.6 per cent to $18.94, after revenues missed expectations and the office supply retailer reduced the top end of its forecast for the third quarter because of a higher tax rate. Adjusted earnings of 20 cents a share were in line with estimates.PetSmart, the pet shop chain, joined the list of retailers reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Sales at stores open more than a year also beat expectations and it raised its full-year forecast. Shares rose 8.9 per cent to $32.82

The FTSE Asia-Pacific index is up 0.7 per cent as Japanese shares move away from their lows for the year, following reports that Naoto Kan, Japan’s prime minister, will outline further stimulus plans as early as next month. The Nikkei 225 average gains 1.1 per cent, led by tech companies and automakers which have been weighed down in recent weeks by the yen’s recent surge to a 15-year high against the dollar.Among the exporters, Tokyo Electron rises by 4.5 per cent, Sony gains 1.2 per cent to Y2,590 and Toyota Motor is up 1.7 per cent at Y3,075.The South Korean market is also supported by exporters. Hynix Semiconductor is up 2.5 per cent, Hyundai Motor advances by 1.9 per cent and Ssangyong Motor adds 1.7 per cent. The Kospi index is up 0.8 per cent by midday.Analysts say investors are weighing whether recent declines present a buying opportunity for Asian shares while they remain unconvinced about the global economic recovery.

Markets’ fickle August continues, as a brief rally in risky assets is snuffed out and “haven” assets such as the Japanese yen and US Treasuries are once again in demand.US stock investors are as nervous as ever about their investments, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey. They are even more bearish on Japanese shares, though actually turning positive on Europe. Volumes in US trading are averaging their lowest since February 2009.Shares have been supported largely by corporate news, not a change in outlook: a spate of results for retailers, like Walmart and today Target, which said it would meet forecasts for second-half profits.Confidence in the US mortgage market is also on thin ice. Spreads on mortgage-backed securities have been widening on Wednesday as investors worry about strains in the government’s willingness to fund such low rates. Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, said during a congressional inquiry that the US will continue to guarantee loans at Fannie and Freddie, even amid rising political furore.Gauges of economic activity continue to show weakness. On the heels of upbeat US housing starts on Tuesday – with the caveat that it was only in multi-family units, which are in demand as more people seek to rent – there was bad news in commodity consumption. Oil saw record-high inventories last week, according to the US Department of Energy.“The second-quarter jump in residential investment was the classic ‘dead cat bounce’. More pain is likely ahead in the third quarter,” said Tom Porcelli, US market economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.• Europe. The UK’s FTSE 100 index was down 0.9 per cent, ending a four-day streak, with banks and energy firms leading the decline. Vestas, the Danish wind energy leader, was down 23 per cent after missing its earnings targets and reducing its forecast. Germany’s Dax index was down 0.6 per cent, tumbling further from the 2010 high it reached earlier in the month.• Debt. European interbank markets are still an anxious place, contrary to the tightening among spreads on “peripheral” sovereign bonds. The Euribor rate, measuring the rate that banks pay to lend to each other, has ticked up again – rising for six days after more than 40 days of falling. The turnround comes just as the European Central Bank said banks were borrowing from it the most in three months.Government benchmarks are in demand. German 10-year Bunds are lower by 5 basis points, to 2.31 per cent, a fresh record for them as well.A 10-year Bund auction saw the lowest-ever yield of 2.37 per cent, and in post trading, yields fell to 2.31, a new record.However, spreads against “peripheral” debts are still relatively narrow as fears in debt markets ease. Portugal sold more bonds than it anticipated at an auction of short-term debt. Three-month bills commanded just half the yield versus a previous auction, while 12-month bills saw yields rise slightly.That adds to well-received Spanish and Irish bond auctions. The Irish auction went well enough that Bank of Ireland, one of the country’s biggest banks, is considering coming to market with a €1.5bn offering. And Spain felt empowered to announce it would restore some spending in its budget, after pledging austerity to improve its fiscal balance.Ten-year US Treasuries are flat at 2.63 per cent, with further flattening in the curve between 30-year and 2-year bonds – now at its narrowest since October 2009.• Commodities.

206;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Wall Street boosted by Target’s outlook;;US stocks nudged up on Wednesday after a positive outlook from Target buoyed retail stocks, outweighing weaker-than-expected sales figures from many retailers.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,094.16, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,415.54 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.3 per cent higher at 2,215.70.Trading was choppy. “The market is pretty data-dependant right now – it’s been stuck in this trading range for a while as nothing has put the tug of war between the bulls and the bears to bed,” said Wasif Latif, vice-president of equity investments at USAA. “We’re searching for clarity from tomorrow’s data – leading indicators, the Philly Fed index and jobless claims – it’s a pretty busy calendar that will have a pretty big impact.”The S&P 500 retail sector was up 1.7 per cent after Target said that third quarter earnings would match analyst estimates. Its shares rose 2.5 per cent to $51.95 even though the group joined the list of retailers beating expectations on earnings but not on sales.The discount retailer reported earnings per share of 92 cents, in line with analysts’ expectations. The results were boosted by profit from its card unit, which more than doubled to $149m, as well as sales of higher margin products such as clothing.Sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1.7 per cent with revenue coming in at $15.5bn, slightly short of expectations.Chico’s rose after reporting its results, up 10 per cent to $9.25. The clothing retailer’s net income more than doubled to 17 cents a share and beat analysts’ forecast of 16 cents a share.But the chain also suffered from below-expectation sales, coming in at $465.4m compared with estimates of $468.1m.The company also approved a $200m share buy-back, which will be carried out until January 2013.In contrast, BJ’s Wholesale Club, the operator of warehouse stores, fell 2.7 per cent to $42.14 after it lowered its full-year forecast to $2.40-$2.50 per share, compared with the consensus estimate of $2.68.Profit for its second quarter missed analysts’ expectations at 67 cents a share compared with projections of 73 cents a share.Energy stocks fell as the oil prices continued to drop with the S&P 500 energy sector losing 1.1 per cent.ExxonMobil was down 1.1 per cent to $60.15, Conoco Phillips declined 0.8 per cent to $55.42 and Chevron slid 0.9 per cent to $77.04.In other earnings news, the world’s largest maker of farm machinery, Deere & Co, announced better-than-expected results. In the third quarter, profit per share was $1.44 against analyst forecasts of $1.14.Sales also beat expectations, rising 16 per cent to $6.84bn compared with an average projection of $6.52bn as demand rose in the US but was “down sharply” in Europe.Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $65.98 after the company said demand for its products was rebounding but sales were still far below normal level.BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner, launched a hostile bid for PotashCorp after the fertiliser producer rejected its $130-a-share offer on Tuesday.US-listed shares of BHP Billiton fell 2.9 per cent to $68.18 and PotashCorp, which soared 27.7 per cent on Tuesday, rose 3.3 per cent to $147.93.In other deal news, Windstream, a phone company that provides service to rural areas, agreed to acquire Q-Comm for about $782m. Windstream shares fell 0.8 per cent to $11.40.Life Technologies rose 0.3 per cent to $45.08 after the provider of gene analysis tools for medical research said it had agreed to buy Ion Torrent for $375m in cash and shares. Ion Torrent has made a DNA-sequencing system that translates chemical signals into digital information.BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which makes treatments for rare genetic conditions, was up 0.2 per cent to $20.55 after it bought ZyStor Therapeutics, a biotechnology company, for about $115m.Washington Post advanced 3.3 per cent to $338.40 after its Kaplan education unit signed a five-year contract with Cambridge University Press to collaborate on producing teaching materials.
207;TGT;Target Corp;2010-08-18T16:57:52Z;Cost cutting and credit cards help lift Target;;Target, the US discount retailer, shrugged off weaker-than-expected sales in the second quarter and lifted its profits through aggressive cost cutting and the strength of its credit card business.The Minneapolis-based company said its net income rose by 14.3 per cent to $679m, or 93 cents a share, up from $594m, or 79 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.The results were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. Target’s shares had risen by nearly 2 per cent to $51.68 in midday trading.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said that clothing sales and customer numbers were “robust” during the quarter and that the company was in a strong position to remain profitable “regardless of the pace of recovery”.Sales at Target rose by 3.8 per cent to $15.1bn, but comparable store sales, the metric favoured by retailers, were up by just 1.7 per cent.The company said that it expected same-store sales to rise by between 1 and 3 per cent in the third quarter and accelerate further in the last three months of the yearCustomers continued to focus on essentials in the second three months of the year, concentrating their purchases on healthcare products and food, an offering which the company has begun promoting aggressively since last year.Discretionary items such as electronics and video games were less in demand, as consumers pulled back and focused on basic needs. “Consumers have gained confidence and are willing to spend more than a year ago, but they remain cautious about the future and very thoughtful about how they spend their money,” said Kathryn Tesija, Target’s vice-president of merchandising.The biggest improvement at Target was in its credit card unit, where profits more than doubled to $149m.The company sharply reduced its bad debt expenses and took a more conservative approach to underwriting.Target had warned in June that it expected the outstanding balances on its customers’ store-branded credit cards to drop to levels not seen since 2005, as the supply of consumer credit has fallen rapidly in the wake of the financial crisis.

The company named its chief financial officer, Cathie Lesjak, as interim chief executive.Competitors IBM and Cisco rose, with IBM up 1.4 per cent to $132.00 and Cisco climbing 2.9 per cent to $24.77. In other technology news, Research in Motion gained 3.5 per cent to $54.96 after a Saudi official said the BlackBerry maker and Saudi mobile groups were testing methods that might address the Saudi government’s concerns over security.Homebuilders rose after Deusche Bank upgraded DR Horton and said the housing market was finally near the point where it could sustainably recover. The S&P 500 homebuilder index was up 3.1 per cent, with DR Horton gaining 4.3 per cent to $11.06 and Pulte Group advancing 2.1 per cent to $8.85.Some consumer stocks advanced on positive news. McDonald’s rose 1.6 per cent to $72.92 after it reported a 7 per cent jump in global sales in July at restaurants open for more than a year. Sales were buoyed by a strong performance in Asia.Target , the discount retailer, was up 2 per cent to $53.35. Visa climbed 3.6 per cent to $74.74 after it was reported that growth in the use of credit and debit cards could offset tighter fee regulation.In contrast, Sara Lee fell 0.1 per cent to $14.82 after Brenda Barnes, chairman and chief executive, said she would resign because of her health, following a stroke in May. Marcel Smits will continue as interim chief executive and James S. Crown will remain chairman.Rising metal prices pushed up shares in metals companies, with Alcoa, aluminium producer, gaining 0.6 per cent to $11.66, Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore producer, advancing 4.1 per cent to $62.46 and speciality metal manufacturer Allegheny Technologies rising 2.1 per cent to $49.42.American International Group rose 1.7 per cent to $41.64 in spite of saying that US financial reform may force it to raise capital, undergo stress tests and limit investment in private equity and hedge funds.Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance company, said it would need another $1.8bn in aid from taxpayers, bringing its total request for government money to more than $64bn. It fell 5.2 per cent to 40 cents.In earnings news, Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 0.3 per cent to $80.70 in spite of announcing on Friday that second-quarter profit dropped 40 per cent .Tyson Foods, the meat producer, reported better-than-expected earnings as it benefited from higher beef and pork prices on top of cost savings. But the shares fell 4.9 per cent to $16.30, after climbing 34 per cent so far this year.In deal news, Ebay rose 2.5 per cent to $21.98 after Skype, the low-cost internet calls company, proposed an initial public offering at $100m. Ebay sold a 70 per cent stake in Skype for $2bn in November.Superior Well Services, the oilfield services company, surged 21.1 per cent to $22.08 after Nabors Industries, the world’s largest land rig contractor, agreed to buy the company for about $900m in cash, a 21 per cent premium to Superior Well Services’ price at Friday’s close. Shares in Nabors Industries rose 1.9 per cent to $18.32.
209;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Barnes & Noble considers selling company;;Barnes & Noble, the largest US bookstore chain, said on Tuesday that it was considering a sale because its board believed its shares were “significantly undervalued”.The retailer said it would review options that might include a bid from Len Riggio, its chairman and founder, whose family controls the publicly traded company.The company’s shares jumped more than 25 per cent to $16.04 in after-hours trading after the news.Five years ago, its stock traded above $45 but shares in both Barnes & Noble and its rival, Borders, have steadily declined in recent years amid growing competition from Amazon, the online bookseller, and Walmart and Target, the mass discounters.Its prospects have been further clouded by the upheaval in the book industry caused by the emergence of digital books and e-readers, where it is scrabbling to secure a position in a market dominated by Amazon and Apple.The board said in a statement that it was setting up a committee of four independent directors to “consider all alternatives to increase stockholder value and …recommend a course of action”.It said Barnes & Noble had “an iconic brand and unique competitive advantages we believe will position the company to succeed over time in a rapidly changing market”, and cited “our compelling digital opportunities”.It said Mr Riggio, whose brother Stephen is chief executive, had said that he “intends to consider the possibility of participating in an investor group to acquire the company”.Mr Riggio said that he would be “willing and eager” to remain with the bookseller whether or not he was involved in any group that bought it. The Riggio family controls about 34 per cent of Barnes & Noble, and has used a poison pill provision that prevents outside investors having a similar stake.Tuesday’s move comes amid a battle between the Riggio family and Ron Burkle, a billionaire retail investor, who has acquired a 19 per cent stake in the book seller.He has indicated that he might launch a proxy battle with the board at the company’s September annual meeting, and has taken legal action in an effort to overturn the poison pill.Aletheia Research and Management, a California-based fund founded by Peter Eichler, has a 16 per cent stake in the bookseller, having built a holding alongside Mr Burkle since last year.Barnes & Noble has stepped up investment in its digital business significantly over the past few years, launching an e-reader, the Nook, late last year. It operates 720 book stores in the US and 637 college bookstores.
210;TGT;Target Corp;2010-08-01T19:14:56Z;Opposition fades to big US land projects;;"The economic slowdown in the US has increased potential local support for new superstores, hospitals and even power plants, according to an annual survey of public attitudes towards big local land projects.Sixty-eight per cent of 1,000 adults surveyed in June by Saint Consulting, which specialises in land use approval politics, said they were more likely to support projects in their home towns because of the economy – up from 59 per cent last year.The fifth annual Saint Index found levels of potential support increased both for more popular local projects such as grocery stores and hospitals and the most unpopular, such as quarries, landfill sites and casinos.Patrick Fox, president of Saint, said that “over the past two years we are
seeing Americans more ready to accept development for economic reasons. We are looking at a good time for developers to start projects; they are going to have a better time enlisting support than they did before”.In a sign of the impact of the economy on planning decisions, Chicago’s city council last month ended several years of opposition to attempts by Walmart, the mass discounter, to open stores in its city.The decision was largely influenced by support from building unions and local community leaders who argued that proposed new stores would create more local jobs.Saint advises its clients both on how to win political support for new local projects in “site fights” before planning committees, and how to organise political opposition to
similar applications by rivals.Its latest survey again demonstrated Walmart’s success in reducing public opposition provoked by new stores, with 54 per cent of respondents saying they would oppose a new local store, down from 78 per cent in 2007, at the peak of an anti-Walmart campaign by the UFCW grocery workers’ union.But the 2010 survey found that a large Walmart is still likely to face more resistance than some of its main retail rivals, such as Target and Kmart, the discount stores, or Home Depot and Lowes, the home improvement retailers.In spite of the general declines in opposition levels, the index again found strong levels of nimbyism – or “not in my backyard” opposition to new developments – with 74 per cent saying they were opposed to any new projects in their community, unchanged from last year."
211;TGT;Target Corp;2010-07-29T20:06:09Z;Radio Shack plans Target store kiosks;;Radio Shack, one of the largest US retailers of mobile phones, said on Thursday it planned to open kiosks in most of Target’s 1,700 discount stores, as it faces a drive by rivals Best Buy and Walmart into the rapidly expanding wireless business.Radio Shack, which operates over 4,400 small stores across the US, said it planned to start expanding its presence at Target this summer after initially testing “Bullseye Mobile” kiosks at 100 stores.The effort, which is not under the Radio Shack brand, will significantly expand a business model developed with Walmart’s Sam’s Club warehouse stores, for whom it has operated more than 400 in-store wireless kiosks since 2004.The move also reflects the drive by both Radio Shack and Best Buy to establish a broad, accessible network of outlets to service the surging demand for wireless devices and smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone and Android-based phones.Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, is currently rolling out new small format Best Buy mobile stores, and expects to have between 150 and 175 locations open by the end of the year in the kind of shopping mall locations traditionally favoured by Radio Shack.Brian Dunn, chief executive of Best Buy, told the Financial Times this year that the retailer could open up to 1,000 Best Buy mobile locations. Walmart, the largest US retailer, has also stepped up its wireless phone sales efforts, including the launch late last year of a new low price pre-paid service with TracFone, a subsidiary of Mexico’s América Móvil.Radio Shack’s second-quarter results on Thursday underlined consumers’ continued enthusiasm for wireless technology, with the dollar value of sales of wireless products and payment plans at its US stores up by just over 60 per cent.The growth, which led to a 6.7 per cent increase in comparable sales against a year ago, was driven in part by the addition of T-Mobile to its existing carrier partnerships with Sprint Nextel and AT&T.Best Buy said this week that it saw an almost 29 per cent increase in the number of US wireless connections it sold during the three months ending July 3, to 1.4m connections.Radio Shack’s overall revenues increased 4.7 per cent to $1bn against the second quarter last year, while earnings rose 8.6 per cent to $53m, or 41 cents per diluted share. Comparable store sales for company-operated stores and kiosks increased 6.7 per cent during the 2010 second quarter, compared with the 2009 second quarter.Radio Shack’s shares, which rose less than one per cent to $20.37, have risen more than 30 per cent over the past 12 months amid reports that the retailer is considering the possibility of a sale to private equity investors.
212;TGT;Target Corp;2010-07-26T21:15:41Z;Wanted: a new approach to inventiveness;;The economic crisis has forced many companies to rethink their innovation strategy. On the one hand, they have maturing products that can only be enhanced incrementally. At the same time, their customers have both more information on which to base buying decisions and less money to spend. Add to that aggressive copycat competitors, particularly in emerging markets such as China, that drastically shorten the lifespan of new products. Taken together, the marketplace is tough, with some companies facing plummeting returns on their research and development spending.There is, apparently, a dilemma: squeeze the R&D budget or bet the company’s future on finding the next market-disrupting “big” product.Both approaches are wrong. Innovative companies adapt their strategy to allow them to continue innovating in even the most adverse conditions and to do so without betting everything on big innovations alone. They see both a challenge and an opportunity: to become more efficient – to learn to do more with the same levels of R&D spending – but also to improve efficacy, making the process function better so that you come up with more relevant innovations.A recent study conducted with my colleagues Nitin Nohria and Franz Wohlgezogen, published in the Harvard Business Review, found companies that break away from their competition during recessions typically maintain their R&D spending while most of their peers scale it down. However, it is not just the level of investments these companies make but also how they allocate scarce resources.For starters, businesses become more efficient and effective with their investments by redefining how they conceive of innovation. But redefining innovation entails breaking out of the engineer-led obsession with the technical details of a product and thinking closely about the customer experience. This means thinking not just about how well the product functions but about ancillary innovations that improve the customer experience. This can include packaging, delivery, post-sale service or how you market the product.Consider two examples: bagged salad and resealable crisp bags. Packaging vegetables in a single bag requires limited technical innovation but solves an everyday problem for busy people who want their families to eat healthy food. No wonder, then, that bagged salad has become a billion-dollar industry. Similarly, Target, the retailer, broke no new high-tech ground when it offered its own-brand crisps in resealable bags – the idea is decades-old but Target successfully addressed a nagging problem for its customers (keeping crisps fresh) and the company has been rewarded financially.In order to redefine innovation more broadly than before, companies must involve more voices in the innovation process. This includes functions within the organisation, such as customer service, marketing and sales, that may have played a limited role in the past. Equally important, as companies shift more activities to external partners, is to increasingly engage them in the process, too.Apple, for example, used to be a straightforward computer company that outsourced very little. But today most of its hardware comes from suppliers, while its hugely successful App Store is populated by applications developed by others. A simple idea? In a way, yes. But the company would have never made it work if it had not had the courage to rethink how and where its innovations came from.Even in boom times, innovation is too important to be left to a single unit in an organisation. It must be the responsibility of everyone in the business and its scope must be broadened to include not just different parts of the enterprise but suppliers outside the company as well.Today, that need is even greater, but so is the opportunity. The challenge is not just to work harder but to work smarter – to do more with less and not settle for treading water by doing more of the same. That is innovation at the highest level.rgulati@hbs.eduThe writer is a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School and author of ‘Reorganize for Resilience’
213;TGT;Target Corp;2010-07-08T22:11:43Z;Patchy spending paints mixed US retail picture;;Consumer spending at large department stores in June was relatively strong, but sales at other store chains in the US remained patchy and uncertain, according to monthly sales data from a variety of retailers compiled by Retail Metrics.In June, which benefited from a late Memorial Day weekend, same-store sales at large department stores were up 6.1 per cent on the year before, paced by strong volume at Nordstrom, and better-than-expected sales at Macy’s, Dillards, Saks and JC Penney.Still, the relatively strong performance in one sector was undercut by the low bar set by last year’s results. For department stores in general, June 2009 saw double-digit sales declines compared with the previous year.In other retail sectors, sales of teen apparel outperformed estimates, while sales at large discount chains, such as Costco, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Target, inched up over last year’s totals, disappointed observers who thought discount sales would be robust.Ken Perkins, Retail Metrics president, said the aggregate June sales, like the results from April and May, fell short of expectations. “It was supposed to be a significant improvement from the soft results in April and May,” he said. “We had a later Memorial Day holiday in June, which boosted sales, but by the middle of the month things tailed off and sales were not particularly strong.”Consumers are still recovering from a shopping “binge” in the first quarter of the year, said Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup. Strong sales in March, which suggested that consumers might be ready for a return to their free-spending ways, turned out to have been a false indicator, she said.“The feeling is that you had this binge where consumers starved themselves in 2008 and 2009, and they started to spend a little bit more,” she said. “But sales for June are probably going to be a little weaker than anticipated. Now we’re getting questions about a double dip.”The June results are important, Ms Weinswig said, because for many retailers, June is the middle month of the quarter and its results will determine whether earnings will be strong, or whether they will have to resort to significant discounting to offload inventory in July.A swoon in the stock market seems to have affected luxury sales in June, according to SpendingPulse, a forecasting unit of MasterCard which combines transactional data from the credit card company with survey-based estimates for other forms of payments.For the most part, luxury purchases have outperformed general retail sales, said Michael McNamara, vice-president of research and analysis for SpendingPulse.“In June, for the first time in 2010, there was a decline in year-over-year sales in the luxury sector,” he said. “This was the first decline since November 2009. The performance of the luxury sector is closely tied to the performance of the capital markets.”
214;TGT;Target Corp;2010-07-08T14:33:48Z;Wall Street gains on positive data;;US stocks held on to the previous day’s gains on Thursday as a positive jobs report and decent retail sales data helped ease worries about a potential double-dip recession.Jobless claims were 454,000 last week, modestly better than the 460,000 expected. However, continuing claims dropped to 4.41m from 4.63m last week, significantly better than the 4.6m consensus estimate.“We’re getting a lot of mixed signals at the moment,” said Andrew Neale, partner and portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Partners. “The data are still not looking great. Earnings estimates have been cut so I am not surprised if companies are beating the reduced forecasts.”Volumes were relatively low, suggesting a lack of broad investor conviction.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent to 1,070.25, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.2 per cent to 10,138.99 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.7 per cent to 2,175.40.Same-store sales for the past month from the big retail chains came in mixed on Thursday, helped by warm weather and promotions around the Memorial day holiday. June is traditionally a clearance month for retailers.Macy’s, Nordstrom, JC Penney, Abercrombie & Fitch and Limited Brandsall beat analysts’ average estimates.Macy’s rose 3 per cent to $18.44, Limited Brands rose 2.2 per cent to $24.21, JC Penney advanced 6.7 per cent to $23.24 and Abercrombie was up 7.8 per cent to $35.45. Nordstrom fell 0.2 per cent to $33.69.However, Costco, Target and Gap came in below expectations.Target dropped 0.8 per cent to $50.02 and Gap was down 7.6 per cent at $18.22. Costco still rose 2.6 per cent to $55.71.“June [figures] were lacklustre at best,” said Robert Samuels, senior retail analyst at Phoenix Equities. “Given that retail has significantly underperformed the market over the past month, we think a lot of the bad news is already in most of these names. However, we think a round of earnings cuts is in store for the back half and 2011 as spending remains choppy.”Wells Fargo was down 0.1 per cent to $26.64 as the fourth-largest US bank by assets said it would cut about 3,800 jobs and close its consumer finance business. The bank said it would take a related charge of $185m, including $137m in the second quarter.Citigroup was up 1.8 per cent to $3.97 after the bank was reported to have agreed to sell about $900m of its private equity portfolio to Lexington Partners as part of an ongoing plan announced last year to reduce its balance sheet.Walt Disney added 0.6 per cent to $33.34 as it said it planned to appeal against a judgment on Wednesday against the media company.A jury in a California court awarded damages of $270m to UK-based Celador Entertainment after a dispute over profits from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?H&R Block was one of the session’s biggest fallers as the stock sank 8.2 per cent to $14.22. The leading tax preparer said Russell P. Smyth resigned as chief executive. Alan Bennett, a director, will take his role.The company recently reported a 2.3 per cent decline in earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, which usually accounts for most of its annual profit.Technology stocks were some of the session’s worst performers.Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors, dropped 2.3 per cent to $8.69, Nvidia Corp, a visual computing technologies group, was down 3 per cent to $10.31 and Juniper Networks, a network infrastructure company, erased 0.2 per cent to $25.43.Apple retreated 0.2 per cent to $258.09 even as the computer device maker elaborated on its Asia expansion plans. It said its Shanghai store, which is opening this weekend, is one of “many” it plans in the country.“The Chinese consumer’s love of luxury goods is an enticing opportunity for Apple,” said Mike Abramsky, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Xcel Energy, an owner of utilities assets that operate in eight US states, gained 1.1 per cent to $21.60 as the company restated its earnings guidance for the full year of $1.55 to $1.65 per share.
215;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-27T17:52:25Z;Shining a light on energy costs;;"If you were to tell an MBA student that their summer internship would be spent changing light bulbs, they would no doubt be horrified. However, assessing the potential for energy efficiency gains in lighting systems is among the challenges facing students on this year’s EDF Climate Corps internship – and the organisation running the programme has had students queuing up for places on it.Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a New York-based non-profit organisation, launched the Climate Corps internship programme in 2008 after working with Walmart on an energy efficiency project that delivered substantial financial gains for the retailer from energy savings.“We wondered why companies weren’t all over this,” says Victoria Mills, EDF Climate Corps programme director. “We figured it must be because of some organisational barriers that prevented them acting on this opportunity.”Seeing this as a business problem rather than an environmental one, EDF had the idea of placing MBAs within corporations and giving them a specific mission to cut the companies’ energy costs. Since the first internship programme – with seven MBAs in seven companies – the scheme has expanded rapidly. This year 51 students will be going into 47 companies.EDF works with Net Impact – a corporate responsibility network of MBA students and young professionals – to identify prospective interns. It then matches them with an appropriate company.Before embarking on their internships, students undergo a training workshop run by EDF. “They cover a lot of energy basics and financial modelling of energy-related topics,” says Koji Kitazume, a joint degree MBA student at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business who is spending the summer working in McDonalds’ Chicago offices.The preliminary training also covers organisational management issues and some of the barriers that students may encounter during their internship. “Often, [managing energy
efficiency] is no one person’s job, responsibility is spread across departments and there can be split incentives,” says Ms Mills. “So the MBAs work across the organisation and get people talking to each other.”After the internships, EDF maintains links with the company to see if the interns’ recommendations are being followed. So far, it has tracked implementation rates of more than 80 per cent.Students find that the internships hone their technical, organisational and communications skills and also expose them to new industries.For Jamie Mikkelsen, an MBA student at University of Michigan’s Erb Institute who is spending the summer with the retailer Target in Minneapolis, the internship will help her move from economic consulting into a career that marries her interests in business and the environment. Ms Mikkelsen points out that the Climate Corps students can have a longer lasting impact on a company than they might during an internship at an investment bank or consultancy.“One of the most important things for us is that the recommendations have a series of steps and suggest procedures for the company to use to continue with the work,” she says. “So the fellows know their work will last beyond the internship.”Collectively, the interns have had a big impact. The 2008 and 2009 fellows identified almost $90m in energy savings, cutting the equivalent of 280m kilowatt hours of energy use annually – enough to power 24,000 homes – and avoiding a total of 157,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.Sarah Shapiro, a University of Michigan MBA/MS student, interned at Cisco Systems and, after analysing temperatures in the data labs, found that reducing the intensity of cooling of the centres by a fraction could save the company $1.8m a year without harming the IT equipment.“That’s the nature of energy efficiency,” says Ms Mills. “The losses are small and diffuse so they often dribble out of companies’ pockets like change – but that means you could be losing millions.”Stemming these losses is what excites the students. “McDonald’s has tens of thousands of restaurants worldwide,” says Mr Kitazume. “So if I could identify a small savings potential that could be applied across all restaurants, the impact could be significant – that scale is fascinating.”"
216;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-22T17:56:45Z;Walmart strikes deal with unions in Chicago;;Walmart has agreed to use only unionised construction workers in Chicago in an effort to overcome political opposition that has repeatedly blocked its plans to expand in the city.The world’s largest retailer said it had signed a project labour agreement with the Chicago & Cook County Building Trades Council, which requires it to use union members on future projects, in a break with the company’s traditionally anti-union stance.The move is part of a series of measures announced by Walmart to win support ahead of a meeting of a Chicago city zoning committee tomorrow that is due to consider an application to build a store at Pullman on the city’s south side.On Monday it said it hoped to open “several dozen stores of varying size and format” in Chicago over the next five years as part of what it said was a long-term initiative called the Chicago Community Investment Partnership.The plan would include opening grocery stores in “food deserts” – poor inner city areas that have been largely abandoned by supermarket chains.Walmart said it and its Walmart Foundation would also provide $20m of funding over the next five years to groups in the city aimed at combating hunger, reducing youth violence and other objectives.The retailer said it would create 12,000 retail and construction jobs and yield more than $500m in local taxes. It also said it would pay “competitive wages”. Local news reports said it had committed to pay a starting wage of $8.75 per hour – 50 cents above the state’s minimum wage.Walmart has only one store in Chicago, and attempts to win approval for more have been blocked by pro-union members of the city council. Target, Walmart’s discount rival, has eight stores in Chicago.The UFCW grocery workers’ union sees Walmart’s grocery-selling Supercenter stores as a threat to the superior wage and health benefit packages paid by the city’s traditional unionised supermarkets.In 2006, the council passed a “living wage” bill aimed at large format stores that was vetoed by Richard Daley, the city’s mayor, who supports Walmart’s plans for the city.As part of its current campaign in Chicago, Walmart has held discussions with union representatives, including two meetings with the city’s main union body, the Chicago Federation of Labor.If its proposals for Chicago advance, it would set a precedent for progress in cities including New York and Los Angeles where the retailer has faced similar union-led opposition.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s US stores, has said urban areas represent a growth opportunity for Walmart, which has been developing small grocery formats, such as Marketside and a Hispanic Supermercado de Walmart, in response.Walmart has also signed a “community benefits agreement” for its proposed Pullman store that includes targets for the use of minority-owned construction companies, and a commitment to encourage neighbourhood small businesses.
217;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-11T20:41:42Z;Wall St rallies in spite of retail sales dip;;US stocks closed higher on the day and on the week on Friday in spite of weaker-than-expected retail sales figures that cast doubt on the strength of the domestic recovery.Many economists said the decline would affect their projections for future economic growth.“The sharp 1.2 per cent month-on-month decline in US retail sales in May dramatically weakens the outlook for consumption growth in the second quarter,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “[It is] a reminder that households are not going to be the engine of growth for some time.”However, consumer sentiment figures did not reflect the weak sales data. These came in higher than expected, up to 75.5 in the mid-June reading compared with 73.6 at the end of last month.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent to 1,091.60 and 2.5 per cent higher on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to 10,211.07 and advanced 2.8 per cent over the week. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.1 per cent to 2,243.60 and added 1.1 per cent since the start of the week.BP was in focus during the week as the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continued. US-listed shares in the oil giant rallied 3.6 per cent to $33.97 on Friday but remained 8.6 per cent lower on the week.Reports in the British press said BP plans to defer its dividend to shareholders by placing the money in an escrow account. The company said it had not yet made a decision on dividends.The company also faces about 160 class action lawsuits over the Gulf oil spill and the number is widely expected to rise.However, the stock was raised to “hold” from “sell” at Independent Research.Anadarko, a Texas oil company that owns a 25 per cent stake in the damaged oil rig, was one of the week’s worst performers in the S&P 500 index, ending 7.4 per cent lower to $41.79.Anadarko would be responsible for a commensurate part of the final clean-up bill, said BP, which expected costs of the oil spill to be between $3bn and $6bn, according to an analyst briefed by the company.Retail stocks were lower across the board on Friday, with department stores among the worst performers. Macy’s fell 0.2 per cent to $21.24, JC Penney declined 1.1 per cent to $25.99 and Saks was 1.8 per cent lower to $8.30.Talbots, a retailer of women’s apparel, fell 0.6 per cent to $12.25 even as the stock’s target price was raised to $14 per share from $12.30 at Credit Suisse.Discount retailers performed moderately better, with Walmart slipping 0.7 per cent to $50.86, Costco Wholesale inching down 0.2 per cent to $57.52 while Target was up 0.2 per cent to $53.71.Dell, the world’s third- largest personal computer maker by market value, was 0.6 per cent higher to $13.15 on Friday. It said it had delayed filing its latest quarterly report as it revises financial results to book a $100m liability.The company also said Michael Dell, chief executive, is in settlement discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations related to Dell’s relationship with Intel, the maker of computer chips. Shares added 0.4 per cent to $20.64.Goldman Sachs was one of the week’s worst performing stocks in the S&P 500 index. It declined 4.6 per cent to $135.64 as the SEC announced a second probe into the bank. On Thursday, the stock fell to its 52-week low.Other financial stocks fared better during the week. Bank of America rose 1.6 per cent to $15.60, and Citigroup rallied 2.4 per cent to $3.88.Wendy’s Arby’s Group rose 7.1 per cent on Friday to $4.65 a day after Nelson Peltz, its chairman, said an unnamed party expressed interest in a potential deal involving the fast food company.The Vix index, a measure of market volatility, fell 6.2 per cent on Friday to 28.68 and declined 19.2 per cent over the week.Motorola, a maker of telecommunications equipment, gained 4 per cent to $7.11 on Friday after the company announced a settlement and licensing agreement with Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry device.
218;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-08T23:18:43Z;Dollar General poses threat to Walmart;;Dollar General, the US hard discount retailer, on Tuesday demonstrated a growing competitive threat to Walmart, the largest US retailer, as its almost 9,000 small local stores reported robust sales that outstripped its far larger rival.The retailer, which like Walmart aims primarily at low income customers, reported a 6.7 per cent increase in comparable store sales during its first quarter. Walmart, in contrast, saw a 1.4 per cent fall in its same store sales during the same quarter.Dollar General’s quarterly sales of $3.3bn were only a fraction of Walmart’s $62.32bn for the quarter but its stronger growth suggested it is winning low income customers away from Walmart.Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, argued that during the quarter customers shopped “on a more regular basis”, with higher spending per visit and more visits.“We also believe that we are continuing to attract new customers. It is evident that consumers continue to make significant behavioural changes in their spending habits …I think it’s fair to say that consumers have reset their spending norms.”Dollar General’s small stores sell a highly targeted selection of 10,000-12,000 items of packaged food, health and beauty products, with most items priced at less than $10.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s US stores, said last week that Walmart was losing some business to more convenient rivals, as high fuel prices discouraged customers from driving to its stores for “fill up” shopping trips.Mr Dreiling on Tuesday echoed Mr Castro-Wright in expressing concern about the impact of unemployment and noted his customers’ continued caution over discretionary spending.In contrast, US department stores and Target, the more upmarket discounter, reported continued signs of a recovery of spending by their more middle class customers during the first quarter.Dollar General has been controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, since 2007. Under Mr Dreiling it has overhauled its operations, while moving to increase sales by expanding its grocery business and remodelling stores.It plans to add 600 new stores to its network this year.Dollar General raised its full-year earnings forecast to $1.62 to $1.69 per share before one-time items, up from its previous forecast of $1.55 to $1.63.
219;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-07T02:06:07Z;Target gloomy on storecards;;Target, the US discount retailer, says it expects the outstanding balances on its customers’ store-branded credit cards to drop to levels not seen since 2005, highlighting the rapid fall in the supply of consumer credit in the wake of the financial crisis.In a sign of the reshaping of the US credit landscape, Target says it expects its credit card receivables to drop to an annual average of $5bn-$6bn over the next few years - compared to a peak of $9.1bn seen at the end of 2008.But as its credit card portfolio shrinks, Target is also refocusing its strategy in a way that reflects the changing dynamics of a business that handles more than $55bn in consumer debt on cards issued by more than 165 retailers.Gwenn Bézard, a consultant at Aite Group, said Target was “trying to refocus on using their credit card to lift sales, rather than making money from it”.“Before they were saying ‘this is a big business’ - now it is: ‘we need to cut down our risk profile and go back to the original objective of the product’.”Retailer-branded credit cards, which have higher penalty charges than bank cards, were among the first obligations to be abandoned by consumers as the recession deepened last year.Their performance was worse than bank cards, with “charge-off rates” for bad debts - that is the write-offs linked to payment defaults - running at 13.23 per cent in February, according to Fitch Ratings.This compared with 11.1 per cent for its index of bank-issued cards. Retail card charge-offs before the recession ran in the 5 to 6 per cent range.Two of the largest retail card operators - Citigroup and GE Money - have both sought unsuccessfully to sell off their consumer card businesses, which include cards for Home Depot and Lowe’s.Kohl’s, the discount department store, is building up cash holdings to cover the possibility of buying back its credit card receivables when a $1.6bn agreement with JPMorgan Chase expires next March.Citigroup also terminated a credit card agreement with ZTargetales, the jewellers, this year.With sales of $63bn last year, Target is a significant issuer of credit cards through its Target National Bank. Like rivals, it tightened credit conditions on its cards in the recession.In April, it stopped offering Visa cards that could be used anywhere, restricting new applications to ones that can be used only at its own stores.
220;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-04T01:00:57Z;US store recovery slows in May;;The gradual recovery in US shoppers’ discretionary spending showed signs of slowing in May, according to monthly sales data from leading chain retailers released on Thursday.But several leading retailers suggested that bad weather in the first part of the month, and a shift in the timing of Memorial Day holiday shopping, may have affected spending more than continuing macroeconomic concerns.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly data, said its index of same-store sales rose 2.7 per cent against the same period last year, 130 basis points below initial expectations.Mr Perkins said the data suggested that consumers had “pulled back the reins on what looked like a fledgling spending recovery in the first quarter”.But the monthly figures were also affected by the timing of the Memorial Day holiday, which pushed sales from the last Sunday and Monday of the month into the retailers’ June reporting period.Sales of summer clothing were also affected by unseasonably wet and cool weather during the first half of the month.Frank Badillo, senior economist at Kantar Retail, argued that the “results provide some sign that the retail recovery will persist” in spite of wealth declines and economic uncertainties.Monthly sales at Target, the discounter whose performance has become a bellwether of broad consumer sentiment, increased 1.3 per cent against a year ago.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said in a statement that the retailer’s “recent experience reinforces our belief that we will continue to experience volatility in the pace of economic recovery”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain by sales, which reported a 1.4 per cent increase in comparable sales, cited the impact of the weather, saying its “business trend strengthened toward the end of the month as the weather turned warmer”.Kohl’s, the lower price department store, noted that business improved during the last week of the month, with its comparable sales up 3.5 per cent, better than it had expected.Neiman Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom, the luxury and high-end department stores also continued to provide evidence of the recovery in spending by better off consumers.Neiman Marcus said same store sales rose 7.8 per cent, and noted that its store sales growth was led by its locations in New York City and Texas. Saks comparable sales were up 5.8 per cent, and Nordstrom’s were up 3.7 per cent, with slower growth due to the later start of an annual half-year sale.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent, with only its North America Gap brand stores seeing a sales decline, by 2 per cent.Discount retailers also continued to outperform their full price competition, with TJX and Ross Stores, which sell remaindered and excess branded goods, reporting same store sales growth of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.Despite the continued sales growth seen by most retailers, their overall sales remain below levels seen in 2007 and the first part of 2008.
221;TGT;Target Corp;2010-06-02T21:12:37Z;Energy shares lead rally on Wall Street;;"US stocks reversed course on Wednesday to rally strongly, led by gains in the energy and financial sectors as positive macro-economic news bolstered the bulls.However, concerns about the eurozone economy continued to weigh on investor sentiment.US pending home sales beat economists’ consensus estimates, boosting hopes that government tax credits had succeeded in helping steady the housing market.This is giving the markets a good excuse to climb higher, said Joe Heider, principal at Ohio-based Rehmann Financial, which manages more than $2.5bn in assets.“Despite a miserable May, the fundamentals remain strong and continue to improve,” he said. “The eurozone problems were overblown and now the market is looking more inward, focusing on domestic issues.”By the close, the S&P 500 had gained 2.6 per cent to 1,098.39, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced 2.3 per cent to 10,249.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.6 per cent to 2,281.07.The energy sector, which was heavily hit on Tuesday, spearheaded the day’s rally. Range Resources added 9.7 per cent to $47.92, Consol Energy gained 8.4 per cent to $37.10 and Peabody Energy rallied 7.7 per cent to $39.26.US-listed shares in BP were 3.1 per cent higher at $37.66, in spite of the US’s announcement late on Tuesday that it was opening a criminal probe into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Schlumberger rose 8.8 per cent to $56.30 and Halliburton gained 12 per cent to $23.68 as the leading oilfield contractors were added to Morgan Stanley’s short-term buy list.JPMorgan rallied 2.6 per cent to $39.55 as the second-biggest US bank by assets was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at UBS, with a target price of $50 per share.“We believe that the current share price is an attractive entry point that more than reflects the earnings-at-risk and partially overlooks potential offsets and better footing JPM has now versus mid-2008,” wrote the analysts, led by Glenn Schorr.Financials stocks were higher across the board. Bank of America rose 3 per cent to $15.89, Citigroup rallied 1.8 per cent to $3.92 and Goldman Sachs was 2.1 per cent up at $144.83.Industrial stocks benefited from a number of analyst upgrades. Mining equipment maker Joy Global was 8.7 per cent higher to $52.45 as it was upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.Deere & Co, a maker of farm equipment, increased 5.2 per cent to $60.07 and was raised to “buy” from “hold” at Morgan Joseph with a target price of $75 per share.Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology group by market value, rallied 10.5 per cent to $56.09 after it received approval from US regulators for Prolia, its osteoporosis treatment, two months earlier than expected. Several analysts have cited it as Amgen’s single most important future growth driver. The drug is expected to generate peak sales of $750m to $1bn.Futures and options broker MF Global fell 3.6 per cent to $7.32 after it said it planned to sell up to $150m in shares to raise funds in an effort to restructure its capital base and reduce pressure it faces from rating agencies.The move, however, will negatively impact its earnings per share ratio.Interactive Brokers, a global electronic market maker and broker, added 2 per cent to $16.97 after it posted record brokerage activity last month.Chris Allen, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, said: “We do expect some moderation in June but given the strength in May and our positive view on the environment for the market making business, we foresee upside potential for our second-quarter
estimates.”Advanced Micro Devices climbed 4.9 per cent to $8.54. The second-biggest maker of computer processors said it was set to launch the first working versions of its Fusion chips, which it says offer superior graphics features.Target, a value retail chain, gained 0.9 per cent to $54.37 as it confirmed it would begin selling Amazon’s Kindle e-reader in all its stores from Sunday. It is the only bricks-and-mortar retailer to sell the device. Amazon was up 2.5 per cent to $126.31."
222;TGT;Target Corp;2010-05-21T21:14:01Z;Financial sector leads Wall St rally;;US stock markets found their floor following three sessions of losses, as the financial sector rallied after the US Senate finished its work on the regulatory reform bill.Bank shares advanced 3.6 per cent. JPMorgan Chase led the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 5.9 per cent, to $40.05. Bank of America followed, adding 4.5 per cent to $15.99.Some of the most controversial measures were not included in the final bill, including a stronger ban on banks trading for their own accounts. A final version of the bill will be hashed out with the House of Representatives next week.Goldman Sachs was also 3.3 per cent higher, to $140.62, and Citigroup added 3.3 per cent to $3.75. The sector was still 3.9 per cent lower on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly fell below the key psychological level of 10,000 after the session opened but rallied to stand 1.3 per cent higher at 10,193.39. It was down 4 per cent for the five-day period.“The inmates are running the asylum, this is purely a traders’ market,” said Phil Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Wealth Management, adding that any rebound would first be technical.The S&P 500 indexalso briefly dipped to 1,055, below the trough reached on May 6, when shares made a sudden 5 per cent drop. It then rallied to 1,087.69, 1.5 per cent higher – but still 12 per cent off its 2010 peak.“A 10 per cent correction, even in a bull market, is pretty normal,” said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff. “The European debt crisis is certainly the catalyst for this renewed round of risk aversion but is not out of line with market patterns over the past century.”The Nasdaq composite was down 5 per cent for the week, but 1.1 per cent higher on Friday at 2,229.04.Counter-cylical shares reversed their pattern for the week and were among the underperformers. Dollar Tree, the discount retailer, fell 1 per cent to $61.04 after Jefferies raised its recommendation from “hold” to “buy”, calling it a “defensive” play on the overleveraged consumer.Walmart was 1.8 per cent lower on the week and AT&T fell 2.2 per cent, both relatively better than the broader indexes.On Tuesday Walmart reported a 10 per cent rise in quarterly earnings. Shares in Target, which also reported earnings, including a rise in same-store sales, were off 1.4 per cent for the five days.Gap raised its full-year profit outlook. The apparel retailer reported a 4 per cent gain in same-store sales in its first quarter. Shares were 1.9 per cent higher at $22.15.According to Thomson Reuters, company earnings for the quarter are up 57 per cent this quarter among the S&P 500 year over year, versus 37 per cent in the previous quarter.Larry Hatheway, economist at UBS, said that, given the continued growth in earnings, “for now, [it] is not evident” that recent weeks are the beginning of a bear market, rather than a correction.Dell, the PC maker, said its margins had fallen nearly 20 per cent and warned of slower demand in the next two quarters, though it blamed seasonal patterns. Its shares fell 6.8 per cent to $13.35.Cyclicals tied to the broader economy gained on Friday, with Alcoa jumping 2.5 per cent to $11.35 and Boeing adding 2.5 per cent to $64.56.But the group was down sharply for the five days. Caterpillar lost 7.4 per cent for the week to $60.09, matching the broader decline. Industrials suffered after a weak Empire State manufacturing survey and a drop in core inflation.Shares of US companies that generate a majority of their revenues in Europe were higher on Friday, but still got hammered over the week. Audio equipment maker Harman International fell 12 per cent, and solar-panel manufacturer First Solar fell 5.6 per cent.
223;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Billionaire backs Borders with $25m;;Borders, the struggling US book retailer, said on Friday that it has received a $25m cash injection from Bennett LeBow, the billionaire chairman of Vector, the tobacco holding company, who will become its largest shareholder.The agreement would give Mr LeBow 15.5 per cent of Borders shares, purchased at $2.25 in a private transaction. But it also includes a provision under which Borders shareholders will be asked to approve issuing an additional 35.1m warrants which could raise a further $79m, that would enable Mr LeBow’s stake to be increased to 35 per cent.Borders’ largest shareholder before the transaction has been Pershing Square, the activist hedge fund group run by Bill Ackman, which owned around 17 per cent of its shares.Pershing’s stake will drop to 14.8 per cent after the initial $25m equity issue, excluding warrants. Should the full transaction be approved and assuming all current and future warrants, Pershing Square would control 31.1 per cent of Borders’ shares.Under the agreement, Richard McGuire, a Pershing partner, will step down as chairman of the retailer’s board and leave the board, with Mr LeBow taking over as chairman. Howard Lorber, CEO of Vector, will also join the board.Mr LeBow is the latest high profile investor to enter the fray over the future of conventional bookstores. Ron Burkle, the California-based billionaire, has taken an 18 per cent stake in Barnes & Noble, Border’s largest rival, where he is involved in a dispute with the founding Riggio family over a poison pill provision.Both retailers have been struggling to adjust to the emergence of new digital media, and increasingly aggressive competition from Amazon, the online book seller, and discounters including Walmart and Target.Mike Edwards, Borders’ interim CEO, said the investment “will improve the company’s capital position, and provide greater stability as we execute strategies to transform the [Borders] brand”, and praised Mr LeBow’s experience of supporting turnarounds and his understanding of technology.At the end of March, Borders improved its liquidity position with a new $700m revolving credit facility arranged by Bank of America, and a $90m term loan credit facility, which will mature in March 2014. The credit agreements enabled the retailer to repay a $42.5m loan previously provided by Pershing Square.
224;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target benefits from strong rise in spending;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Wednesday reported the strongest growth in same-store sales for more than two years but warned the recovery in US consumer spending was “somewhat unstable and fragile”.Same-store sales at the retailer’s 1,700 stores increased by 2.8 per cent during its first quarter, supported by renewed spending by its customers on discretionary items.Kathy Tesija, head of merchandising, said that, while some customers were still under economic stress, “a much larger proportion” were becoming more confident about their position after cutting back on spending last year.Those customers, she said, “paid off debt, created and stuck with budgets and now they are feeling optimistic enough to begin putting well-considered discretionary items back in their baskets”.Target’s customers have a median household income of $60,000, with 51 per cent of its customers having a university-level education.Its performance contrasted with the 1.8 per cent drop in comparable store sales reported on Monday by Walmart, its larger rival, which serves a lower-income customer base.Target reported a 28 per cent increase in net earnings to $671m, or 90 cents per diluted share, while its net revenues, including its credit care business, increased 5.1 per cent to $15.6bn.Its retail earnings before interest expense and income taxes increased 15.2 per cent to $1.1bn.Target’s performance was boosted by improvements in its credit card business. Its Target card receivables, which are jointly owned by JPMorgan Chase, decreased by 13.2 per cent to $7.5bn, reflecting tighter controls on card issuance.But bad debt expenses fell 33 per cent to $197m, contributing to card profits doubling to $111m.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, said Target expected to see further declines in its credit card receivables over the remainder of the year and further improvements in write-offs. During the quarter, Target stopped issuing its branded Visa credit cards, restricting new credit customers to in-store cards only.Mr Scovanner has argued that the demands of the US Credit Act, passed in 2009, are leading retailers to cut credit availability to lower-income customers.“The quite direct impact of the Card Act is to significantly reduce the availabilty of credit to American households,” he said.Mr Scovanner said Target expected new federal limits on card late fees that will be introduced later this year to reduce the contribution of late fees to its profits by about half. In the first quarter late fees contributed $59m to the retailer’s income.
225;TGT;Target Corp;2010-05-19T20:51:27Z;Wall Street lower on Europe growth worries;;US stock markets reversed opening gains as traders sold shares tied to the global economy, ignoring the usually bullish signal of a stronger euro.“What’s interesting is that we’re still seeing the same risk-off trade,” said Jeremy Zirin, US equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management. “We’re shifting from structural concerns about the eurozone to worries about European growth rates and the global recovery.”After opening higher, the S&P 500 index was down 0.5 per cent to 1,115.05 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 10,444.37. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent to 2,298.37.Shares with significant European exposure were hit hard. Harman International, a maker of audio equipment, receives more than two-thirds of its revenues from Europe. Harman led S&P 500 decliners, falling 7.7 per cent to $31.73.Also weighing on sentiment was a weaker-than-expected consumer price index April report. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was just 0.9 per cent higher than this time last year – the smallest annual rise since 1966 – indicating a very mild uptick in economic activity.Industrial companies broadly declined. Caterpillar, maker of construction equipment, led the Dow decliners, losing 2.8 per cent to $61.44. Aerospace group Boeing fell 2.2 per cent to $66.21 and 3M, the diversified industrial, lost 1.1 per cent to $82.54.“Fundamentally, things are not changing yet but, since the market went up prior to the fundamentals improving, the market can also begin to discount a slight pullback prior to actually getting the data,” said John Schlitz, chief US market technician at Instinet, an agency brokerage.Losses were pared later in the afternoon once the S&P 500 neared 1,100, its 200-day moving average, but bounced higher soon after hitting it. “When sentiment is deteriorating, technical levels have outsized significance,” said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies.Support also came from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting notes, in which policy makers raised their 2010 growth forecast and reiterated their dovish stance.Quarterly net income at Deere & Co, manufacturer of agricultural equipment, jumped from $472m to $547m year on year. Shares reversed and were up 3 per cent to $58.87.Financial stocks took a breather amid encouraging signs on regulatory reform. They were the only S&P 500 economic sector to rise, adding 0.2 per cent.Opponents were fighting an effort to bring the bill to an up-or-down vote, and a push to include a provision authorising states to regulate credit-card interest rates looked to have failed.Visa added 4.1 per cent to $72.97, and MasterCard was flat at $202.45. Shares are still down 15 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, since an amendment to regulate debit card fees was added to the bill on Friday.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at UBS, reiterated his “buy” ratings on Visa and MasterCard, saying markets were pricing in “unrealistic bear case regulatory scenarios”.Capital One Financial, the consumer credit card lender, added 2 per cent to $42.38. American Express added 0.8 per cent to $40.17.Leading banks were stronger, in spite of pressure from Germany’s decision to limit naked short selling, which led to a drop in shares of European banks.

European sales worries, however, led shares down 0.4 per cent to $54.03. Walmart dipped 1.2 per cent to $53.04.Hewlett-Packard added 0.5 per cent to $47.00, after first-quarter income beat consensus estimates.Healthcare was also a source of some support.

226;TGT;Target Corp;2010-05-19T17:47:08Z;P&G goes online to compete for sales;;Procter & Gamble has started to sell brands direct to US consumers online for the first time, in a sign of how digital commerce is shaking up relations between retailers and their suppliers.The launch of P&G’s “eStore” site is part of the company’s drive to increase its total online sales. Such sales through retailers accounted last year for less than 1 per cent of its revenues of $79bn. The site will sell Pantene shampoo, Pampers baby products, Gillette razors and other brands.The eStore, which will also offer CoverGirl cosmetics, Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, brings P&G into direct competition with e-commerce sites run by its retailer customers, including Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens.It will compete as well with a growing number of online-only retailers that show consumers are happy to buy items such as nappies and washing up liquid online, including Amazon, Drugstore.com and Diapers.com.P&G, the world’s largest consumer goods company, argues that the initiative represents a direct challenge for retailers, describing it as a “living learning lab” that will “help us listen, learn and collaborate with online shoppers”.Kirk Perry, vice-president of its North America operations, said the site “will help deliver new tools, services and features that can ultimately be shared with retailers” to the benefit of shoppers.However, Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief executive, has been more explicit than his predecessor, AG Lafley, in focusing on online sales, telling the Financial Times in an interview late last year: “I don’t feel the need to have every sale go through a retailer.“We want to maximise our sales through retailers but we also want to be where the consumer wants to shop,” he said.P&G said the site would also support online brand building through social networks, such as Facebook. The Facebook page of Pantene is currently using the eStore site to offer its more than 300,000 fans the opportunity to buy promotional bundles of its products.A number of other leading US consumer brands have also begun setting up e-commerce operations with Alice.com, which allows customers to amalgamate shopping for household and personal-care brands.Mark McGuire, president of Alice, said the company had more than 30 brand “store front” sites already running, with another 50 or so under development. “ We are seeing a huge wave of these in the last few months, of consumer companies saying they want to go direct to consumers, and a lot of that is about what P&G is doing.”

228;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Stores tackle physical and virtual realities;;JC Penney, the mid-price US department store chain, cut back on expenses last year, as the recession hit its core middle-class shoppers.But it did not stop spending on everything.“We invested heavily in our digital initiatives,” Mike Ullman, chief executive, told investors recently. “During the downturn, under the covers, there was a lot of heavy investment in building muscle to make sure we got a headstart in this.”JC Penney, with more than 1,000 stores, is at the leading edge of digital retailing. In February, for example, it held its monthly board meeting at Facebook’s headquarters in California, to give its board members a crash course in the potential of social networking.Elsewhere, Target, the US discount retailer, is preparing to launch a fully independent digital platform by late 2011, ending its dependence on Amazon, the online marketplace which currently runs its website. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is accelerating work on a new global e-commerce platform. Gap, the clothing retailer, is preparing to launch e-commerce businesses in western Europe, Canada and China.In part, the enthusiasm reflects the lure of online sales growth – which continues to outstrip conventional sales – at a time when few retailers are investing in new store growth.But retailers are also responding to the second stage of the online revolution that began a decade ago.In the first stage, many retailers ran their online e-commerce businesses as separate units.Walmart based its online operation in San Francisco, rather than at its headquarters in Arkansas. Macy’s, the department store, Borders, the bookseller, and Toys R Us, the toy retailer, all initially relied, like Target, on Amazon to run their sites.But three years after Apple launched its first iPhone, the advent of what retailers call “mobile connectivity” is profoundly shaking up the way retailers do business, not only online, but in their stores.“People are going to be making decisions on what to buy in the store with their mobile phones,” says Scott Silverman, executive director of the National Retail Federation’s Shop.org industry group. “What’s going on will affect the mothership – the store – and all of a sudden the store experience is going to completely change.”“I’ve never seen a time like this in retail,” says Andy Murray, head of Saatchi X, the in-store marketing agency that works with customers including Walmart and Procter & Gamble. “I think mobile is changing everything in retail.”Much of the initial attention has been focused on retailers embracing new digital marketing techniques aimed at mobile users, such as sending text messages, and using digital money-off coupons, and on steps to make their existing websites function on mobile browsers. But retailers are also facing a world that is more profoundly altered by the fact that shoppers will now increasingly be online, via their phones, even as they visit a physical store. They will expect a unified shopping experience.“Consumers don’t think of themselves as ‘multi-channel’ shoppers,” says Brett Hurt, chief executive of BazaarVoice, a provider of online reviews and other content. “They just care about the efficiency of the medium.”Customers will expect to see the store merchandise also available online, at the same prices, and merchandised in similar ways. For many retailers, that will require technology systems to co-ordinate prices, inventory and other elements, and changes in their traditional ways of doing things.“Retailers are asking ‘how do I manage my brand across all the channels that affect the consumer?’ ” says Janet Hoffman, of Accenture’s retail consultancy.Tom Nealon, JC Penney’s chief information officer, says its digital platform is seeking “alignment” of the physical and digital experience. “We are not just building a new web page, or dot.com page,” he says, “this is a digital infrastructure that supports every customer touch point …at home, in your car, in the store”.JC Penney is also projecting that its enhanced online presence will lift its e-commerce sales from $1.5bn last year to $2.5bn by 2015, accounting for one fifth of its planned sales growth in the next five years.“That much of our focus on digital is …because we think the survivors in the industry are going to lead in this category,” says Mr Ullman.
229;TGT;Target Corp;2010-05-08T00:41:16Z;Alliance Boots and P&G seal skincare tie-up;;Alliance Boots has struck a deal with Procter & Gamble, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, to help expand its nascent skincare business in Europe.In an unusual tie-up, P&G has agreed to market and distribute Alliance Boot’s Laboratories Serum 7 skincare range to Italian pharmacy chains.It puts the firepower of P&G’s distribution network and marketing expertise behind Alliance Boots’ products while giving the maker of Olay a more exclusive skincare brand to sell through its established Italian network.“On the continent, we needed a portfolio brand,” said Gianni Ciserani, president of P&G Western Europe. “It doesn’t work to sell mass market brands in pharmacies. We have capacity and know-how but what was missing was the brand.”Neither party would comment on the financial details of the deal, which will be announced on Saturday. The brand will remain wholly owned by Alliance Boots.Stefano Pessina, Alliance Boot’s chairman and co-owner alongside Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, has made no secret of his desire to develop a “third leg” to Alliance Boots’ business. With a £7.15bn ($10.6bn) retail business and a £11.3bn wholesale arm, Mr Pessina’s final piece of the triumvirate is to elevate Boots’ brands – Laboratories skincare range, Soltan suncare, Botanics – into a substantial business of its own.“We will do this joint venture to facilitate the expansion of our brand,” said Mr Pessina, declining to say whether he would roll-out the tie-up to other markets in Europe or beyond.“In other markets we could go with a retail chain or pharmacy chain in the US or a local distributer. It is very difficult to tell you what we do in the next three to four years, we want to go global with skincare and we will use all different opportunities that we can find.”Alliance Boots has been striking up similar deals in recent years. In the US, Target, the mass discounter, and CVS, one of the country’s biggest drugstore chains, also have deals in place to sell Boots’ cosmetics and skincare lines.P&G, meanwhile, is increasingly looking for these sorts of deals as part of its “connect and develop” strategy designed to find new ideas and business opportunities. It has already set up a joint venture with the Swiss owners of the Clearblue brand to distribute its pregnancy tests globally. It also entered a partnership with an Italian professor to access technology to enable it to print text and images on Pringles potato crisps.Alliance Boots, which will deliver annual results on May 17, is already selling the Boots Laboratories skincare range in France and Portugal with plans for a Spanish roll-out this year.The retailer and drug distributor, taken private in Europe’s biggest buy-out three years ago, is poised to report another year of double-digit profit growth driven by a strong performance in its wholesale business.Alliance Boots is expected to make a profit of more than £1bn (£953m) in the year to March.
230;TGT;Target Corp;2010-05-06T16:47:47Z;US same-store sales disappoint;;US retailers on Thursday reported April same-store sales below expectations, but which overall confirmed an ongoing rebound in consumer spending.Sales rose 0.5 per cent in April at stores open for more than a year, according to a Thomson Reuters compilation of figures, short of the estimate of 1.7 per cent growth.The disappointment was not a surprise, due to poor weather in April and a shift of spending toward March because of an early Easter holiday.Discount general retailer Costco reported an 11 per cent gain, due in part to higher fuel prices, but missed expectations of a 11.2 per cent rise.“The bounce in the business that began last summer seems to be cooling as demand is satiated for televisions, and consumers ever so lightly migrate back to the likes of Target and specialty retailers given improved economic conditions,” said Brian Sozzi, of forecasting firm Wall Street Strategies.Target sales dropped 5.9 per cent in April, versus a forecast of a 2.3 per cent drop. But it also reported that a combined March-April rise of 3 per cent was its best sales jump in two years.Speciality were hit hard. Gap sales fell 3 per cent, while they had been expected to grow 1 per cent. Abercrombie & Fitch sales fell 8 per cent in April, well past its 2 per cent forecasted decline.Off-price clothing stores reported higher sales, though they also missed forecasts. Ross Stores reported a 3 per cent jump, and TJX rose 4 per cent.A few stores did exceed expectations, notably higher-end retailers. Nordstrom jumped 7.5 per cent, versus a 6.5 per cent forecast. Limited Brands reported a 4 per cent rise against expected flat growth.The rise in sales matches an uptick in consumption generally. First quarter US consumer spending rose 0.6 per cent, and personal consumption represented 2.6 percentage points of the first-quarter GDP growth figure of 3.2 per cent.“The trend is still upwards, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride,” said Julia Coronado, senior US economist at BNP Paribas. “There will be less government support for incomes going forward, but we are starting to see the labour market turn the corner.”The US is expected to have added jobs again in April, which would provide support for shoppers. The forecast is that Friday’s non-farm payroll figures will show growth of 189,000 jobs.
231;TGT;Target Corp;2010-04-22T22:15:11Z;Amazon sales double in first quarter;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, reported on Thursday that its first-quarter sales almost doubled, increasing 46 per cent to $7.12bn.Resilient demand for online goods supported by sales of its Kindle e-reader and last year’s $850m acquisition of Zappos, the web-based shoe store, fuelled the rise.The sales growth contributed to a 68 per cent increase in net income against the same quarter last year, to $299m, or 66 cents per diluted share.North American sales increased 47 per cent from the first quarter last year to $3.78bn.International sales from the UK, German, Japanese, French and Chinese sites, were $3.35bn, up 45 per cent from a year ago. Excluding foreign exchange gains, sales grew 37 per cent. Its international sites, excluding Canada, accounted for 47 per cent of total sales.Amazon continued to record more than 20 per cent year-on-year quarterly sales growth throughout the recession, reflecting its prosperous customers and low pricing.Tom Szkutak, chief financial officer, said that, even without the Zappos acquisition, underlying sales growth against the same period a year earlier in the US was stronger in the first quarter than in the fourth.The company declined to break out sales of its Kindle device, saying only that “sales remain very strong”.Target, the discount retailer, announced this week that it would start selling Kindles at some of its stores at the end of this month, the first time the e-reader has been on sale in a physical store. Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, sells rival e-readers by Barnes & Noble, the bookseller, and Sony.Mr Szkutak said that Amazon saw the Target stores as “a great way for even more customers to see Kindle”.Amazon’s sales of non-media products – which would include the Kindle device and Zappos’ sales – rose 72 per cent to $3.51bn, while media sales rose 26 per cent to $3.43bn. Excluding foreign exchange gains, the categories rose 68 per cent and 22 per cent respectively.The shares, which have risen steeply in the past year, fell more than 6 per cent in after-hours trade to $141m, as Amazon predicted a second-quarter earnings range of $220m to $320m, slightly below Wall Street’s expectations.
232;TGT;Target Corp;2010-04-08T21:01:13Z;US retailers enjoy spring sales rebound;;US retailers reported their best year-on-year monthly sales gains for several years on Thursday as Easter holiday purchases and renewed discretionary spending helped sales bounce back from last year’s slump.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its same store sales index rose 8.7 per cent for March, the largest monthly increase since it began tracking the data in 2000.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that the strong performance was supported both by the early Easter and the easy comparisons with last year, when the index fell 4.8 per cent. But he also saw signs of improving consumer confidence.“Consumers are generally feeling better about their plight and are finally making discretionary purchases and beginning to trade back up a bit,” he said.The strong monthly sales led a handful of large retailers, including Target, the discounter, and Kohl’s and JC Penney, the mid-price department stores, to raise their quarterly earnings guidance.At the top end of the retail market, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported strong increases in comparable sales from last year’s lows, of 12.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively. Their rival Nordstrom reported a 16.8 per cent increase.Meanwhile, Macy’s, the largest department store, saw a 10.8 per cent lift, while JC Penney reported a 5.4 per cent increase and Kohl’s reported a 22.5 per cent increase in same store sales.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, continued its sales recovery, with an 11 per cent increase in comparable sales, with double digit increases across its US Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores. Teen retailers American Eagle, Aeropostale and Zumiez also reported double digit comparable sales gains, although Abercrombie & Fitch delivered a more subdued 5 per cent rise.Target, the mass discounter, also reported a strong recovery in sales, which were up 10.3 per cent on a comparable basis. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said the performance “exceeded our expectations, driven by particular strength in our apparel business”.Target’s larger rival Walmart does not report monthly sales numbers.At the lower end of the spectrum, TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on selling remaindered clothing brands, continued the sales growth that saw them outperform full-price rivals over the past year, with 12 and 14 per cent comparable sales increases.John Long, retail analyst at Kurt Salmon Associates, cautioned that, in spite of the strong March performance, consumers were still facing challenges. “We have already seen an uptick in consumer confidence but it is not necessarily something that we believe may be able to be sustained, given the macro-economic story,” he said.
233;TGT;Target Corp;2010-03-25T00:47:33Z;GMAC unit sold to Wells Fargo;;Wells Fargo said on Wednesday that it had agreed to buy a division that provides financing to small businesses from GMAC, the troubled car and home lender, cementing its position as a leader in the field.The division provides working capital to about 150 small and medium-sized businesses, mainly suppliers of consumer products to large retailers such as Walmart and Target.Because these suppliers cannot always get a bank loan, they rely heavily on so-called asset-based lending, which allows them to borrow money against their invoices and inventory.The companies that provide these types of loans, called factors, play a crucial role in keeping the flow of goods moving, especially at the moment when traditional bank credit is scarce.Wells Fargo’s push into factoring comes as one of the biggest participants, CIT Group, struggles to regain its footing after a push into mortgage lending forced it to file for bankruptcy protection last year.CIT emerged from bankruptcy in December under control of its primary creditors, and its new chief executive John Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, has set out to rebuild the company.“We’re helping to support medium-sized businesses in this country,” said Stuart Brister, a former GMAC executive, who is president of Wells Fargo trade capital division.“As the market has tightened up for traditional bank loans, many people are seeking the services of asset based lenders.”GMAC has been selling divisions as it focuses on its core automotive lending business, after losses in its residential mortgage division, called ResCap, forced the company to seek $17bn from taxpayers last year through the troubled asset relief programme.In the fourth quarter, GMAC took a $30m pre-tax writedown of its select commercial finance operations that it had earmarked for sale, most of which consists of the factoring business.The operations had assets, including loans and receivables, of $203m after the writedown.The disposal leaves GMAC with only a speciality unit focused on structured finance within its commercial lending operations, as well as a European portfolio, which it is winding down.
234;TGT;Target Corp;2010-03-04T22:39:26Z;US consumers show readiness to spend;;US chain stores saw more evidence during February of a cautious readiness by US consumers to spend, as a broad range of retailers reported comparable sales gains in spite of severe winter weather that swept the US east coast.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales data, said its index rose 4.1 per cent year-on-year in February, against a forecast 3 per cent increase, the biggest monthly gain in the index since November 2007.“Consumers seem to be coming out of hibernation,” said Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics. “We need to see more of this to really feel the consumer is coming back.”February is a transition month for US clothing retailers, as they bring in spring styles and clear out winter merchandise. But the stronger-than-expected sales across all sectors except drug stores painted a picture of a US consumer increasingly ready to spend on more discretionary items.Macy’s, the mainstream department store chain, reported a 3.7 per cent increase on Thursday in same-store sales over February 2008, supported by a 38 per cent jump in its online business.Terry Lundgren, chief executive, said the retailer estimated that comparable sales would have risen by 5 per cent but for the impact of the winter storms on the eastern seaboard states.JC Penney, the department store, said its February comparable store sales rose 1.2 per cent, while its rival Kohl’s reported a 3.7 per cent increase. Target, the discount retailer, reported a 2.4 per cent increase and said the number of customers visiting its stores was continuing to rise year-on-year.Walmart, the largest US retailer, does not report its monthly same-store sales numbers.Gap, the largest US clothing store chain, continued its sales recovery, reporting a 3 per cent gain in comparable sales across its business.Youth clothing retailers also performed more strongly. Abercrombie & Fitch, which experienced monthly sales declines of up to 30 per cent last year, reported a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales, after its sales turned positive last month.Its shares jumped about 10 per cent. Aeropostale’s monthly comparable sales increased 7 per cent, and American Eagle’s rose 6 per cent.Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 2 per cent increase in same-store sales, after seeing a double-digit decline in February last year as luxury demand slumped.The comparative strength of February’s sales came in spite of a sharp fall in the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index during the month.However, a survey of consumer confidence in March, released on Thursday by RBC, reported a recovery in confidence levels.RBC’s Consumer Attitudes and Spending by Household index bounced back to 58.2, it said, after falling to 18.8 in February.
235;TGT;Target Corp;2010-03-04T00:17:16Z;Starbucks to sell instant coffee across UK;;Starbucks will roll out Via, its instant coffee mix, across the UK starting next week and launch the product in Japan next month, signalling the company’s belief that soluble coffee will be a platform for international growth.Starting on Monday, Via will be available in the UK’s 700 plus stores.The decision to introduce the product in Britain comes after a test marketing programme in 32 Starbucks stores in London’s West End last year delivered positive results.“This almost took us by surprise, the extent to which Via exceeded its targets last year,” Brian Waring, the company’s marketing director in the UK, said.Mr Waring said that initial sales showed customers buying triple packs instead of 12-packs, presumably for the purposes of trial.By the end of the year, sales of 12-packs accounted for 80 per cent of unit purchases.“That demonstrated to us that the consumer response and satisfaction was driving demand and repeat purchase,” he said.The Seattle-based coffee group tested Via in select North American markets last year before rolling it out across the US in October.Via sales accounted for about half of the group’s 4 per cent jump in same-store sales for the most recent quarter, or about $35m.In the US, Via is sold at more than 25,000 sites including Costco and Target as well as Starbucks stores.In Japan, Starbucks is skipping the test marketing programme and going straight to launch on April 14 across the country’s 875 stores.Japan is considered a strong market for instant coffee since it accounts for approximately $2.9bn of the category’s $21bn in annual sales.“This is a category that hasn’t had a significant innovation in half a century,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said in an interview.When the product was first tested in the US last year, critics declared that Starbucks’ introduction of instant coffee was a sign of desperation from a company that had stumbled by opening too many stores.Mr Schultz, who returned from retirement two years ago to right the company, said he was satisfied that Starbucks had solved the challenge of how to create an instant coffee that tasted good.“I knew intuitively that Via would be a winner,” he said.Taking a page out of the US playbook, Mr Waring said Starbucks would use a taste test to promote trial of Via across the UK between March 12 and 15.A similar challenge in the US last year is credited with boosting sales of Via in the quarter ended December 31 2009.Traditionally, Starbucks has not spent much on advertising, but Mr Waring said the company planned to promote the UK launch of Via with advertisements in newspapers, on radio and in digital media.
236;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Booming sales spur TJX into expansion;;TJX Companies, the low-price US retailer whose sales have boomed during the recession, said on Wednesday that it planned to accelerate stores growth, citing a “paradigm shift” in US consumers’ spending habits.TJX operates more than 2,700 “off-price” stores in North America and Europe, including the TJ Maxx, Marshalls and TK Maxx chains, selling excess branded clothing lines sourced from manufacturers and other retailers.Carol Meyrowitz, chief executive, said TJX planned to add 130 new stores in 2010, on top of 91 new stores last year, saying she was confident the company could hold on to the new customers it attracted last year. “We believe that there has been a paradigm shift among customers to value,” she said. “Regardless of whether the economy is weak or strong, value is not going out of fashion. If some of our newly-acquired customers go back to shopping at their favourite high-end department stores …that does not mean they’ll stop shopping with us.”TJX’s upbeat view of the new value-conscious consumer was supported by a survey from Booz & Co, the retail consultant, that says the recession has shaped consumption patterns “in ways that will persist even as the economy rebounds”.The survey of 2,000 US consumers found that nearly two-thirds said they would shop at different stores with lower prices even if it was less convenient for them. Only 18 per cent said they intended to spend at pre-recession levels on clothing and shoes.Bob Sasser, chief executive of Dollar Tree, whose local ultra-low-cost stores have also gained customers during the recession, said on Wednesday he too expected to retain new customers as the economy revives.“We believe that as the economy recovers that we’re going to have stickiness,” he said, as the retailer reported a 6.6 per cent increase in fourth quarter same store sales.TJX reported a 58 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to $395m, or 94 cents per share, on Wednesday, on a 12 per cent increase in same-store sales.Total revenues increased 7 per cent to $20bn in 2009, as its sales growth outperformed mainstream stores and discounters including Walmart and Target.TJX plans to increase capital spending to $750m in 2010, including investment in store remodelling. It also plans to open a new store concept in the US that it expects to expand into a 90-100 chain.The expansion underlines the surging fortunes of value-focused retailers. Dollar Tree is adding 245 new stores this year, while Dollar General, its rival, plans to open 600 new stores.Ms Meyrowitz said TJX, which has also expanded into Germany and Poland, could eventually double in size.
237;TGT;Target Corp;2010-02-23T23:27:20Z;Optimism dip fails to sink US retail hopes;Shoppers shift away from the bare necessities;"Some of the largest US retailers expressed growing confidence on Tuesday in the revival of discretionary spending by middle-class consumers, even as survey data showed a sharp decline in consumer confidence in February.Kathy Tesija, a senior executive at Target, the mass discounter with more than 1,700 stores, said the retailer’s customers were shifting away from a focus on necessities seen in the depths of the recession and “beginning to show signs of conscious optimism”.“Once hesitant and even fearful, they are now taking price in their new-found financial discipline, and their confidence is leading them to add a few more apparel and home items to their [shopping] basket,” she said.Karen Hoguet, chief financial officer of Macy’s, which runs 850 department stores, said the retailer was feeling “cautiously optimistic” about 2010, after a fourth quarter that saw improved spending on clothing and home goods.“We are seeing more balance in the business, with customers ready to buy brands that are better,” as long as they are appropriately priced, she said.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, reported improvements in its fourth quarter sales of expensive items such as kitchen cabinets, mirroring results on Monday at rival Lowe’s. Like Lowe’s, it forecast a return to same store sales growth in the year ahead, after almost four years of declines.The comments reinforced the picture of the US consumer that has emerged from other retailers and consumer goods companies in recent weeks of a split between those with jobs and the estimated 16.5 per cent of the workforce that is unemployed or obliged to work part time.Macy’s said its 40 upmarket Bloomingdale’s department stores had a “terrific” fourth quarter, following a 6.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales reported by its rival Nordstrom late on Monday. At Home Depot, transactions above $900, which account for about 20 per cent of sales at its US stores, declined less than
1 per cent during the quarter, against the double digit declines seen in the first three quarters of the year.Retailers reporting on Tuesday stressed their continuing concerns over unemployment and tight credit, concerns underlined by consumer confidence figures for February from the Conference Board, whose index fell to its lowest level in 10 months on short -term job worries.Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Macy’s, said the stores would continue to take a conservative approach to clothing inventory, while possibly taking a more aggressive approach in areas such as cosmetics.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer of Target, said the pessimistic consumer confidence reading reflected his view that there would be sometimes contradictory signs on the state of the broad consumer economy.”I think we’re going to be in the kind of environment where there’s going to be a lot of mixed signals,” he said."
238;TGT;Target Corp;2010-02-23T22:10:43Z;Strong earnings fail to lift Wall Street;;Weak US macro data dragged Wall Street stocks lower Tuesday, in spite of positive earnings surprises from a number of big retailing groups.The consumer confidence index dropped sharply to 46.0 in February versus 56.5 in January, the lowest level since April and significantly more than average economist estimates.“The drop in confidence may take the wind out of the sails of consumer spending briefly, but we do not see it as a major game-changer in terms of the progress of the recovery,” said Brian Bethune, chief US financial economist at IHS Global Insight. “Consumer spending is not expected to energise the recovery in 2010, but rather plod along at relatively subdued rates. [Tuesday’s] report simply reinforces that view.”The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index showed that US house prices fell 0.2 per cent in December, but the annual rate of decline slowed down. House prices fell 3.1 per cent last year.At the close, the S&P 500 was 1.2 per cent lower at 1,094.60 – down to its 100-day moving average, a closely watched technical level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,282.41 and the Nasdaq was 1.3 per cent lower at 2,213.44.It was one of the busiest days of the reporting season for retail companies.Pulling the Dow Jones higher was Home Depot, a leading home-improvement chain, that closed 1.4 per cent up to $30.75 following the release of fourth-quarter earnings. It recorded a profit, versus a loss a year ago, and comfortably beat expectations.Shares in Macy’s, the department store chain, gained 1.1 per cent to $18.67 after its fourth-quarter results. Cost control and a favourable tax settlement contributed. The company said it expected sales to rise by 2 per cent at established stores this year.Target was down 1.2 per cent to $50.06 in spite of the value retailer reporting solid quarterly results. It saw a 54 per cent rise on last year’s quarterly profits.Customers bought more food, health and beauty goods as they cut back on discretionary purchases, Target said.Sears, the department store chain that owns Kmart, declined 1.9 per cent to $93.80 in spite of quarterly result showing that profitability improved, sales declines slowed and fourth quarter sales exceeded estimates.RadioShackwas one of the session’s biggest fallers, losing 7.4 per cent to $19.11, as the operator of one of the biggest retail networks in the US posted results on Monday after the market’s close that failed to impress investors. The stock, however, was upgraded by S&P Equity analysts to “hold” from “sell”.In the clothing sector, Liz Claiborne, a fashion clothing company that owns the Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand and Kate Spade brands declined 0.5 per cent to $6.37 as its latest quarterly figures disappointed investors and it forecast a sharper than expected loss in the current quarter. US sales fell 3 per cent, while international sales were 22 per cent lower than the previous year.Office Depot, the office supplies retailer, gained 3.5 per cent to $6.88 as its latest quarterly results were not as bad as some analysts had expected.The company said that sales trends were improving in the current quarter and it expected to post an annual profit this year, albeit a smaller one than a year ago.Brocade Communications, a maker of networking equipment, dived 23 per cent to $5.36 as its quarterly results missed analysts’ average estimates and its forecasts for the full year disappointed. The stock was downgraded by Goldman Sachs.Smartphone maker Palm Inc declined 10 per cent to $8.20, touching an 11-month low, after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock on concerns that its products are struggling to compete with Google’s iPhones and Research in Motion Ltd’s BlackBerry phones, and that the window of opportunity may be closing.The energy sector posted sharp declines as investors pulled back following a fall in crude oil prices.Chevron fell 1.3 per cent to $72.04 while ExxonMobil lost 0.7 per cent to $64.94.
239;TGT;Target Corp;2010-02-23T13:36:55Z;Home Depot swings to profit on DIY demand;;Home Depot, the world’s biggest home improvement retailer, swung to a profit in the fourth quarter from a year-ago loss, as customers turned increasingly to “do it yourself” renovation projects as they gained confidence in the value of their homes.The company, whose results beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts, announced its first dividend increase in three years and raised its outlook for 2010.Net income at Home Depot was $342m, or 20 cents a share, during the final three months of the year. That was a marked improvement from the same quarter a year earlier when the company reported a loss of $54m, or 3 cents.The Atlanta-based company has worked hard to slash costs during the last year and turned a profit in spite of slipping sales, which fell by 0.3 per cent to $14.6bn. However, its closely watched comparable store sales rose by 1.2 per cent, fuelled by international demand. Same-store sales in the US were off by 1.1 per cent.”In the face of a very tough selling environment, our associates did an amazing job in 2009,” Frank Blake, Home Depot’s chief executive, said in a statement.Home Depot said that its quarterly sales were fuelled by purchases of paint, flooring, plumbing and kitchen and bath materials.Home Depot’s results followed a strong performance from smaller rival Lowe’s on Monday. Lowe’s, which said it expected to see its first rise in comparable store sales since 2006 this year, reported net earnings of $205m, a 26.5 per cent increase against the same period last year, with diluted earnings per share of 14 cents. Sales for the quarter increased 1.8 per cent to $10.2bn, up from $10bn in the fourth quarter of 2008.“We think what you are seeing in the numbers from Home Depot and Lowe’s is spend by those people in their homes feeling more confident from when median home values troughed in January 2009,” said Brian Sozzi, an analyst at Wall Street Securities.Shares of Home Depot rose over 1 per cent to $30.60 in morning trading on Tuesday.In other retail earnings news:Sears, the third largest US retailer, said its profits more than doubled in the fourth quarter to $430m. However, that was largely due to sharp cost-cutting, as sales fell by 0.2 per cent to $13.2bn. Comparable store sales in the US were off by 2.5 per cent.Sears shares were up by 4.59 per cent to $100.05 in pre-market trading on Tuesday.Target, the mass discounter, also reported a stronger than expeceted fourth quarter, with net earnings up 53 per cent at $936m, or 81 cents per diluted share, on a 3.7 per cent increase in sales to $19.7bn. The retailer reported improved profit margins as it saw a significant 20 per cent drop in the value of post-holiday clearance sales of excess inventory.Gregg Steinhafel, CEO said the retailer expected continued improvements in customer traffic and discetionary spending along with “a continued modest recovery in the economy.”Target’s shares were 1.6 per cent down in morning trading, at $49.48.Macy’s, the traditional department store, said underlined the renewed readiness to spend among more prosperous customers, saying a rebound at its upmarket Bloomingdale’s chain and a 26.2 per cent increase in online sales contributed to fourth quarter earnings that exceeded its most recent forecast.Macy’s said it was expecting its comparable store sales to increase by between 1 and 2 per cent in the current fiscal year. It reported a fourth quarter net income in the fourth quarter of $466m, or $1.10 a share, including $186m of charges linked to restructuring and store closures. Comparable sales in the fourth quarter rose 0.6 per cent, while total sales lost 1.1 per cent to $7.85bn.Macy’s shares were down 0.4 per cent at $18.41 in morning trade.
240;TGT;Target Corp;2010-02-19T18:53:18Z;JC Penney confident on growth;;JC Penney, the mid-price department store chain, said on Friday it expected to see a return to sales growth in the coming year, as consumers felt more confident about the economy.Mike Ullman, chief executive, said that while the retailer expected the economic environment to remain challenging “we are focusing our attention in 2010 on pursing profitable top-line sales growth”.After two years of sales declines, the retailer said it expected to see comparable store sales growth in the low single digits in the coming year at its 1,100 locations. JC Penney’s sales have tracked the decline in US consumer spending, turning negative during 2007 as the economy started to slow, then falling 8.5 per cent in 2007 and 6.3 per cent in 2009.Mr Ullman said JC Penney would seek sales growth from initiatives including the introduction of the Liz Claiborne brand into its stores on an exclusive basis in the second half of the year and the introduction of a new youth fashion brand, MNG by Mango, as well as its recently introduced rewards programme.With the majority of its stores located in regional shopping malls, which depend on discretionary spending, JC Penney has been particularly exposed during the recession as customers opted to focus on shopping closer to home at discounters such as Walmart and Target.It responded by cutting back sales inventories, and focusing on reducing costs, rather than lowering its prices, resulting in an overall decline in top-line sales but increased sales profitability. “We chose not to chase sales at any cost,” Mr Ullman said, arguing that the company was now positioned to take advantage of a gradual recovery in consumer spending.“I think you can see there’s some return to more normal behaviour and that the upscale stores are seeing a better trend,” he said.“I would expect as the customer feels better about the employment picture, as the political climate starts to become less volatile, and the dialogue is more positive about people’s future family income, I think that will be reflected in mall traffic.”The retailer ended the year with a cash pile of $3bn, an increase of $659m over the end of 2008, supported by $806m of free cash flow during the year.Net profit in the fourth quarter fell 5.2 per cent to $200m, or 84 cents per share, beating Wall Street’s consensus forecast of 82 cent. Sales fell 3.6 per cent to $5.55bn.
241;TGT;Target Corp;2010-02-07T19:40:42Z;Investors trust in happy end to US book drama;;Barnes & Noble and Borders, the two US national bookstore chains, have both been struggling to attract customers amid changes in book-buying habits. However, they have had more luck with activist investors.In the middle of uncertainties about the future of the sector, Ron Burkle, the California billionaire, announced last month that his Yucaipa funds held a 19 per cent stake in B&N. Another California fund, Aletheia, which is headed by Peter Eichler, has simultaneously expanded its stake over the past year to 15 per cent.At smaller rival Borders, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square has held a controlling 34 per cent for more than a year, a stake steadily built since late 2006.Mr Ackman has continued to argue that Borders has a future, even as it suffers losses and a fall in its shares to about $1 from more than $20 when he first invested in the company.Mr Burkle indicated last week that he wanted to own even more of B&N, and to challenge its management, which is headed by Len Riggio, the founder and chairman who in the 1980s and 1990s led the superstore revolution in US bookselling.The developing bookstore drama is “the clash of the Titans, in terms of the actors and the personalities”, according to David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. And it is unfolding as the wider industry is focused on a dispute between online bookseller Amazon and publisher Macmillan over the pricing of e-books.Mr Schick says that the e-books challenge is just a small part of the “massive, massive problems” the two established booksellers have been facing.Poor holiday sales continued a decline that reflects intense competition not just from Amazon but also from Walmart, Target and Costco’s discount stores, which have taken a large slice out of bestseller sales.The presence of the big-name investors reflects the drastic nature of the investment proposition in physical bookstores. The stores still deliver cashflow in spite of their falling sales but risk following music store chains such as Tower Records, Virgin Megastores and Sam Goody on the road to oblivion.“These are big questions,” says Mr Schick. “And you get these big players around who are prepared to make big $500m bets.”Mr Burkle has in the past targeted his investment on consolidating retail sectors, as with his stake in Wild Oats, the natural and organic supermarket chain, before it was bought by Whole Foods in 2007, and also in Pathmark, a regional supermarket that was bought by A&P supermarkets in 2007.Mr Ackman has suggested that Borders could end up acquired by B&N, or even by Amazon to add a bricks-and-mortar store component to its online business.However, when Borders indicated in 2008 that it was prepared to consider a sale of its business, Mr Riggio at B&N did not respond.If Mr Riggio hopes B&N can profit from Border’s eventual demise, Mr Ackman insisted this week that, in spite of continuing losses at Borders, a bankruptcy was unlikely.“Ultimately, this industry may consolidate – the two companies may become one, or [Borders] may stay on its own,” he told CNBC, also leaving in a third possibility: that the entire bookstore model could collapse.
242;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US retailers boosted by strong January;;Spending by US shoppers continued to bounce back from last year’s post-crash lows, with retailers ranging from luxury department stores to teen fashion boutiques on Thursday reporting stronger sales in January.Retail Metrics said its index of chain retailers’ same-store sales figures rose 3.3 per cent, higher than the 2.4 per cent forecast, the fifth successive month of positive year-on-year sales growth shown by the index.Retailers including Gap, Kohl’s and Macy’s, saw their shares rise as they raised expectations for their fourth-quarter earnings.The monthly sales numbers offered further indications of returning demand for prestige and luxury goods, with Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion department stores, reporting increases of 6.8 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, saw its comparable sales jump 14 per cent.Macy’s, the largest traditional department store chain, highlighted a strong performance from its luxury Bloomingdales stores, as it reported a 3.4 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month and raised its earnings guidance.The performance of the prestige stores fits with recent comments from Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing brand company, and from Estée Lauder, the cosmetics maker, which have both reported stronger demand for their higher-priced products.The more mainstream retailers also enjoyed sales that were stronger than had been expected.Comparable sales at Kohl’s, the discount department store, rose 6.5 per cent, although Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said customers “remain conservative in their discretionary spending”.Kohl’s rival JC Penney reported a 4.6 per cent decline in comparable sales, but said this was better than the forecast decline of 5 to 8 per cent.Speciality clothing retailers also fared significantly better than last year, with Aéropostale’s same-store sales up 6 per cent, American Eagle up 10 per cent and Abercrombie & Fitch up 8 per cent.The Limited, which owns the Victoria’s Secret lingerie stores, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales while Gap, the largest US speciality clothing seller, reported a 5 per cent gain, led by a 10 per cent increase at its low-cost Old Navy chain in the US and positive sales at its Gap and Banana Republic brands.Comparable sales at Target, the discounter, rose 0.5 per cent, lower than Wall Street had expected. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports its same-store sales on a monthly basis.January is traditionally a month of transition for retailers, as they dispose of excess holiday inventory and prepare to bring in the spring ranges.
243;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Target goes wild for salmon;;Target, the US mass discounter, has become the first leading US food retailer to stop selling farmed salmon in its stores, citing the negative impact of salmon farming on the environment.The retailer said on Tuesday that its own brand fresh, frozen and smoked salmon will now be wild-caught from Alaskan fisheries, “to ensure that its salmon offerings are sourced in a sustainable way that helps to preserve abundance, species health and doesn’t harm local habitats”.The move reflects concern among environmentalists over the impact of intensive salmon farming, which has expanded dramatically over the past 30 years to provide about three quarters of all fresh and frozen salmon consumed in the US.The availability of low cost farmed salmon has also undermined wild salmon fishing, with the value of last year’s catch in Alaska of $230m being worth less than half of the value of annual catches in the late 1980s.Target’s move was welcomed by Greenpeace USA, the environmental group. Greenpeace launched a campaign in 2008 to pressure US retailers to adopt more sustainable seafood buying practices.The group argues that the salmon farming industry causes an unacceptable level of environmental contamination and other damage.Casson Trenor, the Greenpeace campaigner who was part of discussions with Target, said retailers have generally argued that they need to use farmed salmon to meet demand for affordable fish that is available all year round.“They are aiming at pricepoints around $6.99 and $7.99 a pound. So for them to do it, it is a huge gauntlet thrown down to other retailers.”Salmon of the Americas, an industry group representing salmon farmers in the US, Canada and Chile, has in the past accused Greenpeace of misrepresenting the environmental impact of salmon farming. Last year it dismissed Greenpeace’s campaign efforts as being “geared towards misleading the public away from healthy protein alternatives:”Target does not say how much salmon it sells, but frozen or fresh salmon products are available in around 1,500 of its 1,700 stores.Mr Trenor acknowledged it would not be possible to meet current levels of demand for salmon exclusively from wild fisheries, but argues that an increase in demand for wild-caught salmon would support the development of fisheries, while higher prices would eventually pushing down demand to sustainable levels.Leading US retailers including Target’s rival Wal-mart and Whole Foods, the natural and organic supermarket, have started paying more attention to sustainability of sea-food purchasing over the past few years. Walmart plans to continue selling farmed fish, but has said it will eventually source all of its wild-caught sea food from fisheries certified as being “sustainable” by the Marine Stewardship Council.
244;TGT;Target Corp;2010-01-26T05:43:21Z;Retail body forecasts 2.5% US sales rise;;Retail sales in the US are set to rebound this year, according to the National Retail Federation industry group.The NRF said it expected “positive signs” from the housing market and employment levels to strengthen consumer confidence throughout the year.It forecast a 2.5 per cent rise in retail sales for 2010, excluding spending on cars, petrol and restaurants, compared with a 2.5 per cent fall last year. Rosalind Wells, chief economist, said shoppers were expected “to continue to be frugal with discretionary spending” but retailers would start to benefit from “leaner, smarter inventories” and 18 months of “pent up consumer demand”.“As we continue to see signs of improvement throughout the US economy in 2010, overall sentiment will begin to lift, making way for slight increases in consumer spending,” she said.Other positive contributions will come from trade, especially strong exports, a turnround in the inventory cycle, and federal government spending.The NRF also expected consumer spending to continue to lag behind overall growth, as households pay down debt levels.Sales in the November to December holiday season were at the high end of conservative expectations, up 1.1 per cent according to the NRF against its forecast of a 1 per cent fall.Most leading US retailers say they are maintaining a conservative approach to inventory levels, and expansion plans, focusing investment on improving returns from existing stores.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, the discounter, told investors last week that consumers “are still …considering each purchase more carefully than they once did”.But Target believed improving customer confidence meant the retailer was now being more aggressive in seeking to gain market share in discretionary categories, he said.Reflecting the subdued mood, the roster of national retailers with significant new store opening plans for the year includes Dollar General and Family Dollar, the hard discounters, which plan to open 600 and 200 small stores respectively.In contrast, Target plans to add 10, and Walmart, the largest US retailer, is halving square footage growth from pre-crash levels. Both are focusing capital spending on store remodels.Target also said last week it expects its store-brand credit card business to continue to contract during the coming year, reflecting tighter credit policies by issuers in response to changes in card legislation.The retailer predicted that its total gross credit card receivables could drop to about $7bn, from about $8bn currently, after falling from $9bn in early 2009.
245;TGT;Target Corp;2010-01-24T22:44:44Z;Amazon to expand online trade-in range;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, is planning to start buying more goods back, as well as selling them, by setting up its own online trade-in platform for used consumer electronics.The retailer is recruiting software engineers to work on a service to allow consumers to trade in used consumer electronics gadgets in exchange for Amazon gift cards.The move highlights the surge in interest in trade-in services, spurred in part by the newly frugal mood of US consumers, with leading retailers including Walmart, Target and Costco starting partnerships last year with a variety of online services.“As people upgrade to the latest and greatest there is a plethora of valuable, perfectly good products that need a new home,” an Amazon job advert states. “We help facilitate the pairing of new owner with device, while also creating an open marketplace.”This month Amazon also launched an initial trade-in and recycling partnership for consumer electronics with CExchange, one of a number of US web-based services that buy back used electronics in partnership with retailers, which have grown up in recent years.Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, was one of the first national retailers to set up a trade-in service for laptops, mobile phones and other devices through its Dealtree subsidiary, a web-based service it acquired in 2008.All these services offer consumers an estimated trade-in value on products, and then send them a retailer’s gift card for that value once the goods are received by mail. Some also encourage customers to send in items for recycling that it assesses as having no resale value by providing free shipping labels.Dealtree resells refurbished products on a separate web auction site, Cowboom.com, while Gazelle, which works with Walmart and Sears, says it uses a range of retail and wholesale outlets to resell returned products.Amazon entered the trade-in market in March last year, with the launch of its own online trade-in service for used video games.Similar video-game buy-back ventures had previously been launched by Best Buy and Walmart, which were in turn following the early success in the second-hand business of GameStop, the computer video game store chain.Amazon subsequently extended the service to include DVDs, and in December started buying back and reselling college text books.Amazon reports its fourth-quarter results on Thursday, with analysts expecting it to report its sales to have surged more than 30 per cent to about $9bn.
246;TGT;Target Corp;2010-01-21T21:03:08Z;Target sets sights on ventures outside US;;Target, the US discount retailer that competes with Walmart, says that it will explore expanding into Canada, Mexico or South America in the coming three to five years, in what would be its first venture outside the US.The retailer also said it will test a new smaller format store aimed at more dense urban areas in the next few years. This is a strategy also being developed by Walmart, which has more than twice as many US stores as Target.But the retailer said on Thursday that the bulk of its investment over the coming year will be directed towards continuing a remodelling programme at its existing stores, with $1bn to be invested in about 340 renovations.Most leading retailers have slowed or stopped new store openings since the start of the recession, focusing instead on increasing returns from their existing store networks.Target’s renovation programme includes expanding the stores’ grocery offering to include fresh fruit and vegetables in a move aimed at attracting more customer traffic.Target, which has more than 1,700 stores, said that it expected to open only about 10 new stores on a net basis in 2010 in its existing markets, although it suggested that this could increase in 2011.“The exact number and pace of these new store openings beyond this year will depend on a number of factors, including the economic and real estate environment, as well as internal operational performance,” the company said on Thursday.Since the start of the recession, Target’s store sales growth has fallen behind Walmart, as consumers cut spending on fashion and household items that are a central part of its “cheap chic” brand.Its stores have also struggled to compete against Walmart’s 2,400 Supercenters, which have seen sales rise, supported by their low-price grocery business.Target has responded by shifting its marketing and merchandising to stress its own low prices.In a sign of the shift in emphasis, it is currently devoting part of its stores to a seasonal “great sale event”, with bulk packages of toilet paper, detergent, nappies and other basics being sold at prices compatible with discount warehouse club stores such as Costco and Walmart’s Sam’s Club.In previous years, it devoted seasonal sales space to a “global bazaar” sales event featuring home furnishings.• Blockbuster, the home video rental chain, saw its shares fall more than 30 per cent on Thursday, after it significantly lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance late on Wednesday, citing a poor holiday season performance. The retailer said it now expected to lose between $183m and $193m, after increased investments in stock and advertising failed to pay off. The shares stood at 50 cents at lunchtime in New York.
247;TGT;Target Corp;2010-01-14T18:58:48Z;US stocks struggle following retail data;;"US stocks struggled to push higher on Thursday after an unexpected drop in retail sales gave investors reason for caution.The benchmark index has closed higher in seven out of eight sessions so far this year, lingering around a 15-month high.But after dipping in and out of the red on Thursday, the S&P 500 was flat at 1,145.47 by midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,690.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was also 0.1 per cent higher at 2,310.58.The market had opened lower after the latest commerce department figures showed retail sales, excluding cars, had fallen 0.2 per cent in December. Analysts had forecast an increase of 0.3 per cent.“The data sets came in a little bit on the soft side but didn’t necessarily take us into panic territory,” said Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global.He added that uncertainty about demand for the government’s rush of Treasury auctions this week was also making the market nervous. Investors have speculated that the surprising demand for notes in the past few days has been fuelled by one big mystery bidder, whose intentions are still unclear.The disappointing retail data weighed on the market and also overshadowed positive corporate results from the sector itself.Target resumed its share buy-back plan following an improvement to the discount chain’s cash flow.In November 2008, the group halted further purchases halfway through the $10bn plan because of concerns over liquidity.However, revenue growth from its retail and credit card operations left Target confident that it could complete the buy-backs within three years. Its shares rose 0.8 per cent to $49.75.Encouraging sales in the holiday period prompted Williams-Sonoma to give a higher forecast for the fourth quarter than analysts had expected. But shares in the upmarket home goods retailer still fell 3.3 per cent to $21.99.Walgreen, the retail pharmacy chain, announced that it was buying 25 Snyder’s drug stores but its shares were flat at $37.06.Tyson Foods helped to lift the market after analysts at Credit Suisse raised the world’s largest meat processor to “outperform” from “neutral”.“While we clearly missed the bottom on Tyson stock, it is still under-owned, unloved and in the early stages of a cyclical rebound in protein processing,” wrote analyst Robert Mos­kow. Tyson’s shares showed the largest gains on the S&P 500, rising 4.4 per cent to $13.90.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Cryolife, which distributes human tissue for transplants, bought a stake in Medafor and became the largest single shareholder of the group. The company said it hoped to acquire the remainder of Medafor’s common stock. Cryolife gained 1.1 per cent to $6.68.The technology sector also helped to lift the market higher from the opening bell. Oracle gained 2.1 per cent to $25.27 after Morgan Stanley increased its price target on the stock to $31 from $29, citing the benefits of its imminent acquisition of Sun Microsystems.An analyst at UBS said the software maker could halve the number of Sun employees when it finally closed the deal. The $7bn takeover has been under scrutiny for months as a result of concerns about competition.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, came under renewed scrutiny from the Department of Justice. The government requested more information on the company’s soyabean business following complaints that farmers had been forced to pay for
more expensive products. Monsanto’s shares lost 1.2 per cent to $82.91.Financial stocks were in focus as details emerged about the government’s $90bn levy on the sector. Bank of America was up 0.4 per cent to $16.69, while Morgan Stanley lost 2.2 per cent to $30.56.LaBranche surged some 44.2 per cent to $4.01 after Barclays announced that it had bought the company’s designated market-maker business for $25m in cash.The S&P 500 financial sector, which had helped to lead the market higher in early trading, was flat by midday."
248;TGT;Target Corp;2010-01-07T16:07:39Z;US retailers report stronger Christmas sales;;Many of the largest US retail chains reported sales that were at the high end of their forecasts for the important holiday shopping month of December, although sales for most remained below pre-crash levels of two years ago.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of comparable store sales rose 3 per cent, the strongest increase in the index since April 2008.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said “retailers handily exceeded very modest expectations”, supported by “a last minute sales surge that saved the day prior to and immediately following Christmas”.A range of retailers, including Macy’s, the department store, TJX, the discount clothing chain, Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret, and Aeropostale, the youth fashion retailer, raised their quarterly earnings guidance on their stronger than expected performances.Mr Perkins said the positive earnings guidance “came from retailers that were able to keep promotions in check and maintain all-important margins”.Kohl’s, which has picked up business from the bankruptcy of its rival Mervyn’s, saw its same-store sales rise 4.7 per cent, while JC Penney reported a 3.8 per cent decline. Macy’s reported a one per cent increase in comparable sales, while Target, the discounter, said comparable sales had increased 1.8 per cent.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported continued strength at its lower cost Old Navy US stores, where comparable sales rose 7 per cent, and saw its Gap stores in North America report a 1 per cent increase. Comparable sales at its more upmarket Banana Republic stores fell 3 per cent. Overall, the company reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales.Sears Holdings, owner of Sears and Kmart stores, saw its shares surge after it forecast stronger than expected earnings. It said same-store sales for the month rose 5.3 per cent at Kmart, the discount store, but fell 4.3 percent at its Sears department stores. Overall, it said same-store sales rose 0.4 per cent in December, but had fallen 2 per cent in November and December combined.Toys R Us, the privately held toy retailer, also reported a 4.6 per cent increase in its comparable sales at its US stores, which reported a 3.9 per cent increase for the nine week holiday season.Saks, the luxury retailer, reported that its comparable sales had fallen by 7.3 per cent over November and December, despite a 9 per cent increase in comparable sales in December that was supported by a shift in a major sales promotion. Neiman Marcus reported a 4.5 per cent same store sales increase in December, after a 9.7 per cent fall in November.Barnes & Noble, the largest US speciality bookseller, said its sales for the nine week holiday period fell 5.4 per cent, and reduced its quarterly earnings guidance.
249;TGT;Target Corp;2009-12-18T19:09:32Z;Wages of sin bring higher returns;Socially responsible investing proves sophisticated;We live in a material world. The ringing of the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange is broadcast worldwide each weekday, while church bells largely fall on deaf ears. But the pecuniary and ecumenical will intersect briefly on Monday as the management of FaithShares takes the podium at the NYSE to kick off the session.Their launch of the first religiously based exchange-traded funds is the latest development in an investment phenomenon. Broadly defined, a whopping $2,700bn, or more than one-10th of all US managed funds are now deployed according to socially responsible criteria of some kind, according to the Social Investment Forum. Socially responsible investing (SRI) can be far more sophisticated than starkly dividing companies that are naughty or nice.For example, the leading index provider in the field, RiskMetrics, ranks companies on their environmental, labour and societal impact, doling out scores akin to credit ratings. Global warming baddie ExxonMobil gets a poor double C while fellow energy producer Chesapeake Energy scores BB for its more benign, natural gas focus. Retailer Walmart gets a triple C, even as labour-friendly Target gets a double B.But some investors see things in black and white. Islamic funds, such as the Amana Growth Trust, eschew banks or purveyors of alcohol while the Ave Maria Catholic Values Fund bans healthcare concerns that promote contraception or the use embryonic stem cells.Booze is a differentiator among Christian funds, with FaithShares’ Baptist fund having zero tolerance while its Lutheran ETF bans only spirits. Its Catholic fund approves of alcohol. And, although the battle for souls continues to rage, Islam has at least temporarily gained the upper hand in the battle for returns. Islamic funds have outperformed Christian ones recently, largely because of their distaste for financial stocks.But morality does not come cheap. It is slightly more profitable to be amoral, but even more so to be immoral. Great returns from guns, booze, gambling and pornography are counter-intuitive since they are so heavily regulated, limiting new entrants. Academic studies, most recently by Yale University’s Frank Fabozzi and colleagues, are compelling. His study spanning 37 years and 21 national stock markets shows a total return for a “sin portfolio” of 19.02 per cent versus a market return of only 7.87 per cent. Thus, a $10,000 investment in sin stocks would have become $6.3m versus just $164,000 in standard equities.Exploiting this trend and turning it into an impressive historic return is The Vice Fund. Manager Charles Norton says he benefits indirectly from others’ distaste for these sectors. “Therein lies the opportunity,” he says. “Whether or not a company makes you feel warm and fuzzy is not our concern.”Of course many SRI funds outperform and deny they face any handicap.“It’s another investment strategy and, like any strategy, it depends on the skill of the portfolio manager,” says Eric Frenald, a researcher at RiskMetrics.But, as a group, Professor Fabozzi points out that restricting investment choices on non-economic grounds has a cost according to financial theory.Market returns are finite, hence sin stocks’ good record comes at the expense of everything else, at the margin.If it really affects performance though, this raises the question of whether fund managers’ fiduciary duty should override ethical concerns. Calpers, America’s largest public pension fund, acknowledged the conflict when it decided to eschew investments in some developing countries even if it cost up to three percentage points of performance in certain portfolios.Individual investors face no such quandary as they can decide for themselves to possibly sacrifice returns for their values. But they must understand that refusing to buy a cigarette maker or defence contractor will actually deprive these industries of capital.Mr Norton counters: “We’re of the opinion that you can make much more in the market and then donate to charity if you want. But mixing the two isn’t wise.”
250;TGT;Target Corp;2009-12-16T23:09:17Z;Investment: Turks take advantage of perks and proximity;;Endless rows of fully automated machines twist polyester yarn in the factory of KCG, a Turkish company that produces net curtains in Egypt for export to Europe and the US. “This is the largest twisting capacity in the Middle East,” says Olcay Kinalikaya, the Turkish general manager. “Here, there are 40,000 spindles.”Few employees seem to be tending the machines in this part of the plant where the initial stage of production takes place. Twisting yarn to make it ready for weaving is an energy intensive process, which does not require much labour.In the later stages, however, large numbers of workers are needed, not only to operate machinery, but also to finish the product, inspect its quality and to package it ready for shipping to big importers in the west such as Ikea, JC Penney and Target. The company employs 1,000 people.KCG, which invested $40m in its Egyptian plant, is one of 270 Turkish companies attracted to Egypt by its subsidised energy and cheap labour costs, and by its trade agreements with Europe and parts of Africa and the Arab world.Turkish investments in Egypt total $2bn, most of which came after a free trade agreement was signed between the two countries. The FTA came into force in March 2007, boosting investment and raising trade between the two countries from $1.1bn in 2006 to $2.36bn in 2008. Some of the expanded trade reflects the output of Turkish manufacturers based in Egypt and exporting back home.More than 80 per cent of the Turkish companies operating in Egypt have arrived in the past five years, according to the investment ministry.Turkish textile and ready-to-wear companies have been particularly attracted by the “qualifying industrial zones” or QIZ system under which products made in Egypt, and include an Israeli component to the value of 10.5 per cent, gain duty-free access to the US market.“Turkish investors are important to us because they are vertically integrated,” says Ali Awni, head of the QIZ unit at the ministry of trade and industry. “If you bring a ready-to-wear manufacturer here, five or six years later he may bring the upstream over. He may start a denim mill. For us this is strategic, because it has more impact.”Mr Awni also says that Turkish garment companies have good relations with more upscale buyers in Europe, so their presence in Egypt places the country on the radar screen of more importers and investors.Sixty Turkish companies in Egypt work in textiles.“Turkey in the last two or three years lost a lot of competitiveness regarding energy prices and labour,” says Mr Olcay. “In Turkey, our company exports $150m a year on a turnover of $200m. We have customers around the world, but some of their price requirements we cannot cover from Turkey.”He says that, in Turkey, electricity is three times the cost in Egypt, natural gas seven times the cost, while labour is between three and five times more expensive.There are, however, differences in skills. “Of course you cannot compare the skills one to one,” he says. “In Turkey maybe it is 15 per cent more. But for the managerial level, this country has good human resources. For the workers, though, you need to train and this continues because turnover is high. We do our own training, but the Egyptian government subsidises it.”The Turkish textile industry is more advanced than its Egyptian counterpart, and according to Mr Awni, the more complicated upmarket products are not yet being made in Egypt. But he believes the Turks will raise standards in the country. “They teach better work methods and eventually they raise the workers’ potential for hire by other companies,” says Mr Awni. “Knowledge diffuses, and already they have raised salaries and the skilled labour market is tight.”Mr Olcay says the company has plans to add extra capacity that should create 200 jobs. Monthly turnover from its Egypt plant has reached $2m, and the target for 2010 is $40m.“Turkish investments in Egypt reached a new level after the free trade agreement, which opened the way,” says Rustu Berktin, general manager of Nile Kordsa, a Turkish-Egyptian joint venture. “This sort of thing coupled with the fact that Egypt is close to Turkey – the flight between Istanbul and Cairo is under two hours – makes it obviously an advantage.”Nile Kordsa, a subsidiary of Kordsa Global, makes cord fabrics for tyre reinforcements and exports 97 per cent of its products to tyre producers in Europe, Asia and Africa. Established in 1993, it is one of the first Turkish investments in EgyptBoth Egypt and Turkey are expecting an acceleration of Turkish interest after a lull this year imposed by the international crisis.A 2m square metre special Turkish industrial park is under construction in 6th October City just outside Cairo.The concern developing the project, a joint venture partially owned by the Turkish company, Polaris Textiles, will own and operate the park which, when completed, should be able to accommodate 150 Turkish companies working in a range of sectors including textiles and clothing, home appliances, construction materials and foodstuffs.
251;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US retailers report tough November;;Leading US retailers reported November sales that were broadly lower than expected, as a post-Thanksgiving rush failed to offset earlier weak demand.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly comparable sales figures, said its index for the month rose just 0.7 per cent from last year, when sales slumped. Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the “the bottom line is that comp store sales were very disappointing ahead of the critical December holiday shopping season”.“The standard line from many retailers was a stronger year-on-year Black Friday [post-Thanksgiving] weekend was not enough to offset very weak sales throughout most of the month.”JC Penney, the low price department store, reported a 5.9 per cent fall in its comparable sales, in line with its forecast of a drop of 4 to 7 per cent, but on top of last November’s 11.9 per cent decline.“Strong sales for the Black Friday weekend offset slightly weaker sales beginning mid-month and leading up to Thanksgiving,” the company said.Kohl’s reported a 3 per cent increase in comparable sales, while Macy’s, the largest US traditional department store chain, reported a 6.1 per cent fall in comparable sales. Macy’s said its post Thanksgiving sales had been “below expectations”, which it attributed to competing sales promotions, and also highlighted the impact of the unseasonably warm weather on winter clothes sales.Target, the second largest discounter, said its comparable November sales were down 1.5 per cent against last November, with softer sales in the first three weeks “substantially offset by better-than-expected sales during our post-Thanksgiving Two-Day sale”.The retailer said it has seen strong sales of consumer electronics, toys and apparel, as well as household goods, small appliances and beauty. It also said that while overall sales levels had decreased, the number of transactions had increased.Walmart, the largest US retailer and Target’s rival, does not report monthly same store sales.Costco, the discount warehouse club that has been one of the beneficiaries of households seeking to cut spending, reported flat comparable sales at its US stores. The company noted that its top line sales were affected by lower food prices and by continuing deflation in flat screen TV pricing, where unit sales were up 15 per cent, while dollar sales saw a mid single digit percentage declines.Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen retailer, reported a 17 per cent fall in comparable sales, far worse than analysts’ expected. Aeropostale sales were slightly worse than expected, with a 7 percent rise, and its shares fell over 10 per cent in New York after its quarterly earnings forecast disappointed market analysts.Low price and discount retailers continued to outperform full price rivals, with both Ross Stores and TJX Companies reporting comparable sales up 8 per cent.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported overall comparable sales that were flat, but saw a 6 per cent increase at its low price Old Navy stores, offsetting comparable 4 per cent declines at its US Gap and Banana Republic stores, and a 5 per cent decline in its international business.Luxury retailers Neiman Marcus and Saks reported comparable sales declines of 7.5 per cent and 26.1 per cent, on top of the declines of around 30 per cent seen in November and December last year in the aftermath of the Wall Street crash. Saks said it still expected comparable store sales for the fourth quarter to be down in the high-single digits.
252;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-27T20:44:47Z;US consumers aim to dispel ‘frugal fatigue’;;Just after 4am on Friday morning in the Sears department store in the Newport Center mall in Jersey City, a middle-aged shop assistant was discreetly lamenting her lot.“Last year we opened at 5am,” she said. “This year it was 4. Next year, it will be 3 probably. And after that, the whole night.”Behind her, a crowd of shoppers seethed around the check-out desks in the store’s electronics department in pursuit of “early bird” post-Thanksgiving bargains.On “Black Friday” – the day that US pre-Christmas shopping begins in earnest – opening the store even earlier than usual has proved a popular gambit for US retailers, as they slog their way through the slump in consumer spending that hit when Wall Street crashed a little over a year ago.At the other end of the Newport mall, the JC Penney department store had already upped the ante on Sears and its rival Kohl’s.Penney’s was one of the first to move to a 4am post-Thanksgiving opening two years ago, but on Friday the Jersey City store opened at 3.30am – half an hour earlier than advertised.Elsewhere, Gap’s Old Navy clothing chain opened at 3am, when a queue of 150 people was already lined up outside its mid-Manhattan store in New York.Toys R Us moved its opening to midnight, drawing more than a thousand people to its Times Square location. But while shoppers were out in force, it was hard to find anyone planning to spend more this Christmas than last year.Jazz Alexander, a young student standing in a queue of more than 1,500 people outside Best Buy in Jersey City, said she expected her spending this year to be “lower than last year”, while her friend Kiki Jenkins said she was “definitely on a budget”.In an even longer line outside the local Target discount store, Shanae Felder said she was looking for “a little bit of everything”. “I want the vacuum cleaner, the microwave, a GPS system and the TV,” she said, listing four of the discounter’s “door-buster bargains”. But she still expected her spending to remain “about the same” as last year.Although sales data for the period will not come out until next week, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, said his annual morning visits to stores in Manhattan and the New York area suggested the numbers of people turning out to shop this year were similar to last.In 2008, the industry saw a 3.4 per cent drop in sales in the November and December period against the previous year, according to the National Retail Federation. In September the NRF predicted that this year retail sales over the two holiday months would fall 1 per cent.But Mr Cohen said consumers this year seemed more focused on their purchases. “The big difference this year is that the consumer is coming in with intent to buy,” he said.“This year anyone coming out has a mission: they know what they want, where they want to buy it and how much to pay for it. It is more planned.”He also cited anecdotal evidence from shoppers turning out on Friday that suggested consumers who had been holding back on discretionary spending were now prepared to spend on holiday-related promotions, to dispel “frugal fatigue”.Mr Cohen said: “A glaring majority said clearly, yes, they have been waiting to spend, that this is the time, and that they haven’t purchased anything for themselves all year.”Retailers acknowledge there is no guaranteed link between their performance during the holiday season, and the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales.If sales on the day turn out to be up on last year, retailers will need to see steady spending in the weeks up to Christmas and they will hope consumers do not keep their wallets closed in anticipation of price-cuts in the final days before Christmas.
253;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-27T12:52:58Z;US retailers turn to social media on ‘Black Friday’;;US retailers were on Friday unleashing a traditional barrage of post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping promotions, with the National Retail Federation expecting 134m Americans to head for the stores.This year, however, the retailers have reinforced their traditional efforts with an array of social-networking weapons including Twitter, the micro-blogging website.Retailers including discounters Target and Walmart, and department store groups Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney have used Facebook pages to publish the “doorbuster” and “early bird” deals traditionally announced in newspaper advertising inserts on Thanksgiving, the day before “Black Friday” – so called because it was once the day on which retailers’ ledgers for the year moved out of the red and into the black.Brad Smith, head of social networking at Best Buy, said the electronics retailer had targeted its more than 1m Facebook fans when it decided this year to publish its Black Friday deals early for the first time.“We released the deals at 2am last Sunday, and even at that time of night we had literally 1,000 responses within an hour or two,” said Mr Smith.Best Buy is also using Twitter for the first time to publicise its “deal of the day” running on the shopping days leading up to Christmas. “This is the first year in which social media is playing such an important role for all of our marketing,” said Mr Smith.Other stores planning to use Twitter to pull in shoppers include Target, JC Penney, American Eagle and Nordstrom.Further, more than a dozen top retailers are launching customised mobile e-commerce sites ahead of the holidays.Alongside traditional buy-one-get-one-free deals, more conventional strategies have included stores opening early, with Toys R Us joining a handful of retailers that planned to open at midnight for the first time. Some stores, such as Old Navy and Gap, were even opening at midday on Thanksgiving itself.Other retailers including Target, the discounter, and Abercrombie & Fitch, the clothing chain, are for the first time offering money-back gift cards on sales.Toys R Us is also seeking to woo shoppers by guaranteeing the first 100 people in queues outside its stores the chance to buy a $10 Zhu Zhu Pet robotic hamster – the season’s hottest toy.But the retailers’ promotional activity this year will also reflect less desperation than last year, when the slump in spending after September’s Wall Street slide forced drastic price cuts to clear stock. Clothing retailers in particular have entered the two-month holiday season with inventory levels that are more than 10 per cent below last year.In spite of the marketing hullabaloo, retail analysts point out that the day is not necessarily an indicator of how retailers will perform over the entire holiday shopping season.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the day was “typically is not a precursor of the entire holiday season’s sales picture”.Follow Jonathan Birchall’s Black Friday at http://twitter.com/Birchall_Jon
254;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US shoppers wait for sales;;US shopping patterns for early November suggest budget-conscious consumers are holding back their Christmas spending, while waiting to be enticed by special events such as this weekend’s post-Thanksgiving sales.Sales data for the first two weeks of November compiled by MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse report showed a weakening of clothing and luxury goods sales that had shown signs of year-on-year improvement in October.Speciality clothing store sales, for instance, fell 5 per cent against the same period last year, when they saw a double-digit percentage drop. Last month, clothing sales rose 3.4 per cent, against similarly poor numbers from last year.Luxury goods sales fell 9.2 per cent during the first two weeks of the month, in spite of tracking the collapse in luxury selling of a year ago. In October, luxury sales were up 6.6 per cent against the previous year.SpendingPulse estimates are based on aggregate spending data from MasterCard credit and debit cards, and projections of other forms of spending, including other cards, cash and cheques.Kamelesh Rao, director of economic research at SpendingPulse, said the overall data suggested that “the consumer is still somewhat cautious about spending”.“The consumer spending environment has essentially been on a plateau since the summer,” he said.But the data also lent support to the theory that shoppers are this year playing a waiting game with retailers, holding out in expectation of the kind of extreme promotional price cutting that characterised last year’s post-crash Christmas.Robert Drbul, retail analyst at Barclay’s Capital, said in a note to clients on Monday that stores had seen a slow early November, which he attributed to “event shopping” - with consumers holding out for promotional offers ahead of events such as the annual post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales.Mr Drbul predicted “very heavy traffic and discounting” during the Thanksgiving sales, followed by another lull as shoppers wait again for pre-Christmas price cuts.“Consumers will again likely wait for additional aggressive discounting and promotional activity during the last 7-10 days leading up to Christmas, as a search for deals and values continues,” he said.A survey of 3,400 consumers for retail consultants at AlixPartners, conducted in the first week of November, also found that 55 per cent of those surveyed intended “to wait for sales and specials” before buying.The National Retail Federation said on Monday that a survey of more than 8,000 shoppers indicated that the number of customers planning to visit stores for Friday’s post-Thanksgiving sales would climb 4.6 per cent from last year to 134m. One in 10 respondents said they planned to visit stores between midnight and 3am in search of early bargains.In an indication of the intensely competitive mood, Target, the mass discounter, announced on Monday that it would offer customes $10 store gift cards for every $100 they spend this Friday morning – an unprecedented move for the retailer.
255;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-19T21:56:39Z;US retailers turn to power of the app;;Leading US retailers are this year expanding their Christmas sales drive by targeting smartphone users through the new generation of mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone, the Palm Pre and BlackBerry’s Storm.Retailers that have started selling online via smartphones this year include mass discounters Walmart and Kmart, lingerie retailer Victoria’s Secret, home goods store Crate & Barrel, and youth clothing chains American Eagle and Urban Outfitters.Others, including JC Penney, Target, Gap and Toys R Us have launched smartphone applications, or apps, that promote deals alongside services such as helping customers locate physical stores or check the availability of items.Raul Vazquez, chief executive of Walmart.com, said the group’s new iPhone app, which was released in November and is linked to its home electronics sales, had so far been downloaded more than 300,000 times.“We expect by the end of the year to get that number up to 1m,” he said of the app, which includes a feature that allows shoppers to fit a profile of a proposed TV purchase on to a photo of a wall or room.Jason Taylor, head of mobile products at Usablenet, which adapts websites to make them easily navigable by mobile devices, said his company had this month launched “around a dozen” new mobile sites for leading retailers, including office-supplies retailer Staples and cosmetics company Aveda. Outdoor goods store REI, and OfficeMax, another office supplies retailer, are also planning to open mobile commerce sites.“I see a real rush by retailers to have proper mobile channels,” said Mr Taylor.The growing US demand for mobile commerce was underlined last month by Ebay, the online auction site, which announced that about $400m of merchandise had been sold through its iPhone app so far this year. Ebay said some 4.6m people had downloaded the app.
256;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-18T21:34:16Z;Wall Street slumps after disappointing data;;"A rally among bond insurers was not enough to lift Wall Street out of the red on Wednesday after the release of disappointing housing figures.The recovery of the housing market in the US was shown to be more fragile than previously thought when data revealed that the number of new houses built last month had fallen for the first time since April.The technology sector also led the market lower after Autodesk, the world’s biggest maker of design software, forecast fourth-quarter profits below estimates. The group said its recovery could be hindered by continued job losses, sending its shares down 10.4 per cent to $24.20.However, the financial sector was buoyed by Ambac Financial, which eased market concerns over its balance sheet.The second-largest US bond insurer said the statutory capital of its main unit was well above a regulatory minimum at the end of the third quarter.Last week, the group said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection if it could not solve its liquidity problems, sending its shares down more than
30 per cent.But Ambac shares soared 44.3 per cent to $1.01 on Wednesday and MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, jumped 10.1 per cent to $3.82.After brief gains in the morning, the S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,109.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 10,426.31 and the Nasdaq was down 0.5 per cent to 2,193.14.Todd Colvin, vice-president of MF Global, the financial derivatives brokerage, said: “The housing starts [data] was not expected to be that weak, but there is a lot of complacency in the market and that is being interpreted through implied volatility, which is nearing year-to-date lows.”The Vix, an index that gauges market volatility and investor anxiety, surged over the 80 points level in November last year but has fallen steadily since. The index dropped a further 3.4 per cent to 21.64 on Wednesday.The market was also torn between a series of deals, which helped to lift sentiment, and continued pessimism in the consumer discretionary sector.Hershey and Ferrero International said they might enter the bidding for Cadbury, the British confectionery group that is the subject of a hostile bid from Kraft Foods. Hershey fell 2 per cent to $37.63 and Kraft 1.4 per cent to $27.26.American Express also announced that it had bought Revolution Money, an internet-based payment platform, for $300m.The company was set up in 2007 by Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL. American Express shares edged 0.5 per cent higher to $41.57.Shares in Delta Air Lines dropped 1.8 per cent to $7.76 after the airline and its partners offered a $1bn aid package to Japan Airlines, which is facing possible bankruptcy.The deal is intended to lure Asia’s biggest carrier out of a potential alliance with American Airlines.Shares in AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, lost 3.7 per cent to $5.77.But discount retailers weighed on the market.Shares in Target, the second-largest discounter in the US, slipped 1.5 per cent to $47.87 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the company to “neutral” from “buy”. The company’s shares lost more than 3 per cent on Tuesday after the retailer gave a cautious outlook for the upcoming holiday season.BJ’s Wholesale Club reported lower sales from its third quarter than had been expected, pushing its shares down 2 per cent to $35.63.The retailer remains popular with shoppers seeking to save money by buying in bulk. But BJ’s and its rivals are facing tough comparisons given that last year’s sales were boosted by high petrol prices and food price inflation.But the retailer Perry Ellis International reported third-quarter profit above expectations due to its aggressive cost-cutting. Its shares gained 0.7 per cent to $14.99 as it raised forecasts for next year.Chico’s, the women’s casual clothing chain, also beat estimates for the third quarter, sending its shares up 8.8 per cent to $14.67.General Growth Properties, the bankrupt shopping mall owner, surged 36.3 per cent to $5.82 after reports that rival Simon Property Group was considering buying assets of the company.Simon also gained after the announcement, rising 4.7 per cent to $75.58."
257;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-17T21:49:47Z;Late rally lifts US stocks;;"Wall Street clung on to its gains from the previous session’s rally in spite of a downbeat statement from Home Depot on Tuesday.After spending most of the day in the red, the S&P 500 pushed higher in the last hour of trading and closed up 0.1 per cent at a new 13-month high of 1,110.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 10,437.42 and the Nasdaq also edged 0.3 per cent higher to 2,203.78.Soaring oil prices lifted US stocks on Monday to close at their highest level since October last year.But the consumer discretionary sector weighed on the market on Tuesday after retailers remained cautious about the upcoming holiday season.Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain in the US, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook on Tuesday after fighting to cut costs in the face of weaker demand. The shares fell 2.4 per cent to $26.99 after the retailer warned the housing market was still under pressure. The sector has been badly hit in the recession because homeowners have spent less on their existing properties and the frozen housing market has reduced the need for renovation projects.On Monday, Lowe’s, the second-largest player in the sector, had posted a 30 per cent decline in profits and said it did not expect a market recovery to start until the middle of next year.“The numbers were pretty decent but the problem for the market is that there are a lot of high expectations,” said Brett Hawkins, portfolio manager at Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley.“The underlying problem is that total credit is still contracting and we’re recovering off a really low base. To get people to really drive the market higher from here there has to
be some evidence that
we’re really reflating as an economy.”Target, the second-largest discount retailer in the US, also reported third-quarter results that beat analysts’ expectations. However, the shares fell 3 per cent to $48.77 after the group said it remained cautious about the upcoming few months.At the other end of the consumer market, Saks, the upmarket department store chain, swung to a net profit after analysts had been expecting continuing losses.While cost-cutting was the main reason for the reversal in the retailer’s fortunes, the company said it had also seen customers starting to spend more in the jewellery and women’s designer sportswear departments. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $6.67.Dillard’s, the department store chain based in Texas and Florida, also returned to the black in the third quarter thanks to a tax benefit and cost cutting. Analysts had forecast worse results and the shares rose 8.9 per cent at $14.51.Jacobs Engineering the country’s second-largest publicly traded engineering company, reported a bigger drop in quarterly profit than expected.The group said it had suffered from the cancellation of one big oil and gas project. Its shares fell 14.5 per cent to $38.88.Jacobs’ results added to the pessimism in the sector after data showed industrial production in October was lower than expected.Smith International, the oilfield contractor, lost 12.7 per cent to $26.89 after offering 28m shares in an effort to pay back debt and fund acquisitions. The company has suffered from a sharp decline in the US natural gas market, prompting it to cut almost one fifth of its workforce. Profits during the third quarter fell
97 per cent, the group said last month.Playboy shareholders suffered some of the biggest losses. Shares in the magazine publisher slid 14.2 per cent to $4.10 after Linda Havard, the company’s chief financial officer, resigned late on Monday.Applied Materials, the world’s biggest tool provider for the semiconductor industry, agreed to buy Semitool for $364m in cash.It said the acquisition would allow it to produce smaller and more powerful chips for use in smartphones and notebook computers. Semitool shares rose 31.2 per cent to $11.02 but Applied Materials slipped 0.9 per cent to $12.94.Shares in Palm, which produces smartphones, rose 5.8 per cent to $12.54 after Kaufman Bros upgraded the stock to “buy” from “hold”."
258;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-17T18:02:48Z;US retailers see signs of stabilisation;;"Three of the largest US retailers saw signs of improvement on Tuesday over the outlook for consumer spending amid signs of a stabilising housing market.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, said sales in 36 of its top 40 markets showed sequential improvements at the end of its third quarter but cautioned that sales were in “less bad” rather than positive territory.The second-largest US retailer by sales also said it was continuing to see
signs of stabilisation in sales in California, Florida and Arizona, the states worst hit by the housing slump.Frank Blake, chief executive, also welcomed the fact that the percentage of US GDP devoted to private fixed residential investment (PFRI) also remained flat, rather than falling during the third quarter – data the company have used as an indicator of overall health of its customers.“It is positive news that the PFRI data seems to have bottomed,” he said, while cautioning that demand from the company’s professional trade customers, who handle major projects, was continuing to underperform more casual do-it-yourself sales.The retailer reported that third-quarter earnings per share fell 8.9 per cent to $689m, or 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street’s consensus forecast of
36 cents. Revenues fell 8 per cent to $16.36bn, while comparable US store sales were down 7.1 per cent.The retailer raised its full- year earnings per share guidance to $1.55, a 13 per cent decline on the previous year. It had previously expected a drop of 15-20 per cent in full-year earnings.Lowe’s, Home Depot’s smaller rival, said on Monday that it had begun to see improvements in the housing market in some of the hardest hit regions such as California and Florida.The home improvement retailers’ cautious view of the US consumer was also reflected on Tuesday by Saks, the luxury retailer, and Target, the discounter.Saks has seen its sales drop 20 per cent since the economic crisis was sparked in September last year, but Steven Sadove, its chief executive, said on Tuesday he believed “there is more stability and predictability in our business compared to 12 or even six months ago”, while cautioning that “the overall environment remains challenging”.The retailer said that towards the end of its third quarter it had seen “relative strength” in areas such as women’s designer sportswear, outerwear, jewellery and some accessories.Saks also said it expected to see further modest falls in sales during the spring
of 2010, and remained focused on controlling its expenses.Target, which focuses on middle to low-income customers, said it had seen profits “well above” expectations during its third quarter. But it said it remained “cautious about fourth-quarter performance and is planning conservatively in both business segments”.Saks posted net profit of $1.9m or one cent per share, compared to a $43m loss in the same quarter last year. Its sales fell 8.5 per cent to $631.4m.Target reported an 18 per cent increase in net profit to $436m, or 58 cents per diluted share on a 1.4 per cent increase in retail sales to $14.8bn.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport in New York"
259;TGT;Target Corp;2009-11-05T16:26:28Z;US shoppers still cautious in October;;US chain retailers’ October sales figures on Thursday underlined shoppers’ cautious mood, with many mainstream retailers still seeing flat or declining sales against the lows seen a year ago.Macy’s, the largest US department store, reported comparable sales at stores open at least a year that were only slightly down from October 2008, decreasing 0.8 per cent. Target, the discounter, also reported sales slightly down at 0.1 per cent, with Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, describing the performance as “slightly better than our expectation”.But sales at JC Penney, the mid-range department store with around 1,000 locations, decreased 4.5 per cent. The company said it had seen better-than-expected sales during the first half of the month, but that sales “turned softer and were below expectations in the final week”. Its rival Kohl’s reported a 1.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, missing Wall Street’s forecast of a gain of almost 5 per cent.Teen retailers also continued to struggle. Abercrombie & Fitch saw its comparable sales fall 15 per cent, and American Apparel saw a 6 per cent drop. Aeropostale reported a positive 3 per cent, but far below the 14 per cent gain expected by Wall Street.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, delivered a positive surprise, reporting a 4 per cent increase that marked its first company-wide comparable-sales increase for two-and-a-half years.Gap’s improvement came against the 16 per cent fall in same-store sales it saw last October, underlining the fact that most full-price retailers are still seeing sales subsantially below pre-crash levels.More well-heeled customers also showed some readiness to spend. Nordstrom, the fashion department store, reported a 6 per cent increase in same-store sales, while Saks saw a 0.7 per cent increase - against last October’s 16.6 per cent fall.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales data, said its index of comparable-store sales rose 2.2 per cent, a second consecutive monthly increase.The index was boosted by continuing stength of off-price retailers TJ Maxx and Ross Stores, which reported same-store sales gains of 10 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, continuing to benefit from consumers’ frugal focus.A monthly survey of consumer confidence released on Thursday by RBC also highlighted a mood of continuing caution. RBC’s consumer attitudes and spending by household index fell to 30.5, down 21.6 points from October’s 51.8 reading. The group described the fall as “the sharpest one-month drop in consumer sentiment since last autumn’s financial crisis”, and cited factors including unemployment concerns.“Although we have pulled back from the abyss, consumer attitudes remain susceptible to negative news,” said Ira Jersey, head of US interest rate strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
260;TGT;Target Corp;2009-10-19T22:30:48Z;Toys R Us launches a ‘layaway’ service;;Toys R Us, the largest US speciality toy seller, has stepped up the battle for budget conscious holiday shoppers by launching a new “layaway” payment – or pay by instalments – service for gifts such as children’s bikes, dolls houses and musical instruments.The retailer, which operates more than 848 stores in the US, said the service provided customers with “another option for budgeting their holiday spending and allowing them to make smaller payments over time”. Layaway allows customers to have an item set aside for them, which they pay for in regular instalments, and was a feature of retailing in the 1940s and 1950s. However, its popularity faded as credit cards and credit accounts became widely available. Walmart, the low-cost discounter, closed its layaway programme in 2006.But the recession, and growing pressure on customers’ credit card spending limits, has seen the return of the concept at some retailers, including Sears, which reintroduced layaway across its department stores last year. Kmart, the discounter, cited its layaway programme as a factor supporting its holiday sales last year.Toys R Us, which is making a $10 charge for the service, is also offering the service at its Babies R Us stores for items such as car seats and pushchairs.The big three US toy retailers – Toys R Us, Walmart and Target – are in the middle of a bitter battle for customers.Walmart announced at the end of September that it would cut prices on 100 popular toys to $10, while Target has retaliated with price cuts of up to 50 per cent on toys including Barbie dolls and GI Joe action figures.As it battles for sales, Toys R Us has also started opening 80 smaller temporary stores, called “Toys R Us Holiday Express”, to supplement its large “big box” stores. Most of the new small stores are in shopping mall sites previously occupied by KB Toys, which went bankrupt last year. It is also expanding the area devoted to toys at its more than 260 Babies R Us locations.Hasbro, the second-largest US toy company by sales after Mattel, said on Monday it expected “a challenging global retail environment” for the rest of the year but that it was encouraged by initial fourth quarter demand.Brian Goldner, chief executive, said: “We believe we can grow revenues in 2009 if our consumer retail takeaway continues to improve in line with recent …trends.”The company has lowered some prices and eliminated some of its most expensive toys for the coming season.Hasbro’s shares fell more than 4 per cent in New York, after it reported a 1.7 per cent decline in third quarter revenues to $1.28bn. Net earnings rose over 8 per cent to $150.4m against a year ago.
261;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US board directors need to forge a new alliance;;"Board directors in the US are breathing a sigh of relief following the announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission has deferred its proposal to allow shareholders to nominate their own board directors. This will not happen before the 2011 proxy season.Those directors should take a deep breath because they are still facing a fundamental shake-up in corporate governance. The SEC has already approved the elimination of broker discretionary voting on the election of directors at annual meetings.The impact of that change, while not as obvious, could nonetheless alter boards of US corporations. How?First, so-called “broker non-votes” represented up to 20 per cent of a company’s shares and were most often cast in favour of the status quo. With the elimination of these votes, a director who used to enjoy 69 per cent of the vote in elections may only be able to count on 49 per cent.Now, combine that change with the increase in majority, rather than plurality voting for directors. The same director who triumphed with 69 per cent of the vote last year, just got voted off the board.In this context, directors are also starting to worry that an immense amount of power has been transferred to the proxy advisory firms who are said to influence between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the institutional investors’ votes in any board election. Directors are suspicious that these proxy advisory firms put their most esoteric corporate governance policies before the need to drive long-term sustainable corporate performance.Indeed, US board directors now face a world where hedge funds with a focus on short-term results could prevail over those investors who take a long-term view of a company’s performance – and where the winners are picked at the Maryland offices of the most powerful proxy advisor, RiskMetrics.An early skirmish occurred this year when US retailer Target was subject to a proxy fight led by Pershing Square IV, a hedge fund set up by Bill Ackman and supported by RiskMetrics and other proxy advisers. The Target directors under siege were re-elected at a reported total cost of over $20m. One director commented, “I fear there are more of those to come.”Yet, the Target example also provides board directors with a solution. If they can form an alliance with many of the long-term investors then the long-termers can beat the short-termers. One institutional shareholder recently noted, “If boards are smart, they would reach out directly to long-term investors – effectively stitching in an automatic vote in their favour.”The SEC itself is aware of the concerns that, in seeking to empower the long-term investors that tend to populate its own advisory board and those of other regulatory bodies, they have, in fact, created the conditions for short-term investors to flourish. The delay to the proxy access proposal will buy time for the SEC to figure out how to empower investors without letting loose the asset strippers.The SEC’s recently published strategic plan for the next five years also commits it to “conduct a comprehensive review of the issues related to the mechanics of proxy voting and shareholder-company communications, including the role of proxy advisory firms”. The CEO of a Fortune 50 company has said, “I have grave concerns about [the proxy advisory firms] – they are a disaster waiting to happen.”The proxy advisory firms have already been investigated once this decade. In 2007, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on the industry and essentially gave it a clean bill of health. The report noted that the SEC conducted examinations of three proxy advisory firms that are registered as investment advisers and had not identified any major violations.However, there are barriers in the way of board directors trying to counter the influence of the proxy advisers and hedge funds by building direct relationships with long-term investors.How many of these conversations can large institutional investors conduct? Investors could be overwhelmed if every corporate board starts contacting them. The first movers will likely have advantage over those that arrive fashionable late.And, it is often unclear who to build a relationship with and in what forum – the investor’s corporate governance people have demonstrated little power and their fund managers often show little interest. The regulatory framework, including the SEC’s Regulation FD, limits the information that can be shared in any interaction.Additionally, many of the largest long-term investors such as the public employees’ retirement funds are perceived as having an anti-business, pro-trade union political agenda. Ironically, one of them owns a proxy advisory firm and many have investments with hedge funds.An early sign of the emerging grand alliance of long-termers came with September’s publication of the Aspen Institute report on “Overcoming Short-termism: A Call for a More Responsible Approach to Investment and Business Management”. The 28 signatories included retirement funds and trade union bodies like Calstrs, TIAA-CREF, and the AFL-CIO, as well as board directors and other luminaries.The report warned: “In the absence of real changes in the focus of institutional investors and related intermediaries, the various corporate governance reforms currently being discussed are unlikely to reduce the likelihood of boards and managers responding to short-term pressures.”Faced with the might of the proxy advisers and predatory hedge funds, board directors need to build better relationships with those who share their long-term outlook and who can be persuaded to support both their strategy for the business and a slate of directors committed to oversee its execution.They would be wise to start now ahead of what promises to be a critical 2010 proxy season, even with proxy access delayed a year.The writer is a partner at Tapestry Networks

262;TGT;Target Corp;2009-10-08T19:36:47Z;US retailers in first gain since 2008 crisis;;Leading US retailers on Thursday reported their first monthly sales gain since the financial collapse of September 2008, although most still saw lower sales than a year ago as shoppers remained focused on bargain hunting.The 1.1 per cent rise in Retail Metrics’ September comparable sales index emerged as the Department of Labor reported that the number of workers claiming jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level this year.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, attributed the comparable sales gain in September – the first increase since August 2008 – to stronger autumn fashions and promotions, and comparisons with a year ago when sales plunged. But he warned: “We would not interpret this month’s results as a sign the consumer is back.”The monthly sales figures were supported by a later Labor Day weekend, which shifted some back-to-school sales into September from August.The figures showed shoppers continuing to favour lower-price retailers as they face uncertainties over unemployment and tighter credit. For example, Gap’s Old Navy low-price chain reported a 13 per cent surge in comparable sales, while overall same-store sales fell 8 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, at its more upscale Gap and Banana Republic stores.Comparable sales also rose 5.5 per cent at Kohl’s, the low-price department store, and by 7 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively, at TJX and Ross Stores, which focus on remaindered brands.By contrast, Saks and Neiman Marcus, the upmarket department stores, underlined the comparative weakness of US luxury demand, with comparable sales down 11.6 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively.Sales at Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, fell 2.4 per cent, while Target, the mass discounter, reported a 1.2 per cent decline. Walmart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports comparable sales on a monthly basis.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said the retailer “remained cautious” about the fourth quarter, despite the stronger-than-expected September. The National Retail Federation has warned that total US retail sales excluding gasoline and restaurants in November and December will fall by 1 per cent to the levels last seen four years ago.
263;TGT;Target Corp;2009-10-06T04:07:17Z;Holiday sales set to fall as buyers hang back;;"US retail sales over November and December will fall to the levels of four years ago as shoppers continue to keep a tight grip on their wallets, the largest US retailers’ group has warned.National Retail Federation, whose combined membership represents most retailers, or 1.6m retail locations, predicted that sales in the holiday season would fall 1 per cent from $441bn last year to $437bn.In 2005, total holiday sales were $433.4bn.In 2008, sales slumped 3.4 per cent compared with 2007, following the financial collapse of September 2008, the first decline in holiday sales since the
NRF started tracking data in 1992.The NRF said that “continued consumer uncertainty over job security and housing values will take a toll on spending”, while deflationary pressures in important categories such as consumer electronics and clothing could add to the pressure on sales.The forecast reflects the cautious mood of most leading retailers, which have seen their like-for-like sales start to bottom out at lower levels in recent months but not yet begin to rise.Archstone, a US management consultancy, is also predicting a 1 per cent decline in holiday sales compared with last year. Todd Lavieri, its chief executive, said that the main factor likely to weigh on sales was unemployment, now at 9.8 per cent.“Compared to last holiday season, there are 3m to 4m more people out of work, and 3m to 4m underemployed with their hours cut back,” he said.Nielsen, the consumer research company, said its recent research showed that 85 per cent of US shoppers would spend the same or less than last year, and that spending would be focused on “essential” gifts, such as food and drink.Fewer foreign tourists, who flocked to the US last Christmas to take advantage of the weak dollar, and continuing efforts by households to reduce credit card debt will also hurt sales.Target, the second-largest US discounter, has said it expects its customers to have cut their overall debt on its credit cards by as much as $1bn by the end of the year, a reduction of more than 10 per cent on last year’s $9.1bn.Over the past year, retailers and their banks have also tightened the terms on which they are making credit available to customers.Unlike last year, when the drop-off in spending forced clothing retailers in parti-
cular to slash prices, most leading retailers will be entering the holiday shopping season with sharply lower inventory levels.However, Peter Brown, a consultant at Kurt Salmon Associates, warned that the new year could still see a new outbreak of bankruptcies among stores unable to sustain further losses."
264;TGT;Target Corp;2009-10-04T20:39:14Z;Walmart cuts toy prices early;;Walmart, the largest US retailer, has launched its earliest Christmas marketing campaign, announcing last week that it would cut prices on 100 popular toys to less than $10.The reductions on items such as a Barbie Rapunzel doll, Tonka toys and Play-Doh follow a similar promotion on a list of 10 toys last year, after what the retailer called “a year that has been increasingly tough on consumer wallets”.The move reflected toy industry expectations that US shoppers will extend to Christmas toys the new focus on value-for-money that has characterised spending habits over the past year. “There’s a smart and savvy consumer that’s learning how to survive and work their budgets in today’s environment,” said Tim Wills, a sales executive with Bandai America, at a pre-Christmas industry event last week.Mr Wills said 90 per cent of Bandai’s toy range this year will be priced below $20, which he said remained a limit for many families’ toy purchases. “We’re working hard to keep within that level.”Mattel, the largest US toy company, will be selling about 70 per cent of its toys this year for less than $30 compared with about 80 per cent last year.But Søren Torp Lauresen, head of Lego’s US business, said Lego was benefiting from a increased interest in the longer term value of toys rather than just low prices.Lego said it had increased its US sales by 30 per cent over the past year and expanded its market share of the toy business from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent. “When you have discretionary money to spend, you might be OK to buy a fad of some time that might be a success with the child,” Mr Lauresen said. “When money is tight, you want to buy something you know your child will enjoy and that will last a long time.”Neil Friedman, head of Mattel Brands, which includes Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels, said that the industry had still fared less badly than other consumer categories during the recession, supported by parents willingness to cut back on spending elsewhere.“They will pass spending on themselves to make sure their children have fun holiday season,” he said, saying the industry was “cautiously optimistic”.US retail toy sales are down 2 per cent for the year up to August, compared with the year before, said research group NPD.The fortunes of US toy brands are largely determined by three national retailers – Walmart, Target and Toys R Us.Harold Chizick, a spokesman for Spin Master, whose brands include Bakugan boy’s action toys, said the retailers were “being more selective” in choosing the toy line ups, which they use to attract customer traffic to their stores.“Product they know is selling, they want to really get behind, and build up inventory becasue they want to use it as a way to gain more market share.”Mr Wills said retailers were creating an increasingly “focused” market with support for fewer top brands. “If you are one of those top brands you’re in good shape. If you are not, you are in trouble.”Mr Lauresen at Lego disputed the notion that it was “a $10 toy market” this year, saying that 80 per cent of Lego’s year-on-year growth in the US had been driven by sales of Lego kits priced above $50.“We went into the year with a portfolio that was geared more towards the low price points …but we are seeing the momentum more around the $50 price point,” he said.
265;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
266;TGT;Target Corp;2009-09-14T03:49:15Z;Smart shopping set to change retail landscape;;"The new JC Penney department store in Manhattan, which opened this summer on 33rd Street and 6th Avenue, was attracting a steady flow of customers last Friday night. Amid the continuing slump in US consumer demand, a “door buster” special was offering 50 per cent off clothing after 3pm on Friday until 1pm on Saturday, drawing most of the attention.But in the costume jewellery department the handful of browsing customers barely outnumbered the staff. The bedding and kitchenware aisles were deserted.The shopping patterns at JC Penney, whose 1,050 stores target the archetypal middle American family, have been mirrored across the US since the financial crash of last year, with consumers cutting back on non-essential discretionary purchases and buying – when they do buy – with an eye for low prices.“Consumers are acting rationally,” Mike Ullman, JC Penney’s chief executive, told investors last week. “They are paying down their debt, they are spending for things they need. And for the more discretionary thing, they are being more cautious.”Some believe this change could be permanent. Mike Duke, chief executive of Wal-Mart, the US retail chain, is among those who say spending patterns, including deferring purchases that might otherwise have been bought with credit cards, have been fundamentally changed by the crisis, to create a “new normal”.“The ‘smart’ shopping, the customer that really looks at price and value and quality, the deferral of purchases …this is something that will be with us for a long, long time,” he says.US retailers have all reported a sharp shift away from credit cards to debit cards and cash over the past year, underlining the extent to which the end of easy consumer credit is likely to delay a return to the levels of spending seen before last September. Target, the discount retailer with more than 1,700 stores, noted recently the total owed by customers on its cards – amounting to just over $8bn in January – could drop $1bn by the end of this year.Chris Strollo, a sound technician in Pittsburgh, is among those consumers paying off credit card debts. He says that when the crisis hit, “we made a conscious decision to stop using credit cards and to deal with our existing debt”.Jamie Owen, a technology expert at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Cleveland, Ohio, says he and his wife have also cut credit card debt and cut back on discretionary purchases, even though both have ­relatively secure jobs: “It would be easy for us to get a new flat-screen TV …or engage in some house renovations. But right now we’re paying down our credit card debt.”The economic crisis has hit Mr Owen in other ways; he says the new house he bought a few years ago has now lost 20 per cent of its value – a blow felt by many consumers.Mr Ullman, who is also a member of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, says: “The balance sheet of most consumers has been deeply damaged by home equity declines, and volatility and changes in their 401K [retirement savings accounts] and the stock market.”Mr Ullman does not expect any sudden increase in consumer demand, particularly given the continuing high unemployment rate, which hit 9.7 per cent – excluding those not looking for work – in August. “Probably what’s weighing most on consumers at the moment is jobs,” he says.Mr Duke said last week that Wal-Mart research showed concern over jobs was the top concern of the primarily lower-income shoppers at the company’s 4,000-plus US stores.“There is a psychological impact from rising unemployment …if I were looking for bellwethers for the future, the unemployment data would be the one that I think would be most important overall,” he says.……………Struggling borrowers raise risk of credit card lendingThe risk of borrowers defaulting on credit card debt has risen even as overall consumer debt has fallen in recent months, Moody's, the ratings agency, says, writes Saskia Scholtes in New York .Recent data tracking credit card borrowings from the leading issuers show average outstanding debt on individual accounts has risen, while credit scores and payment rates have fallen, suggesting credit card loans have become riskier, according to Moody's.""In times of economic stress, borrowers with the means pay off their card debts, leaving behind a pool of borrowers with less financial flexibility and more debt,"" said Will Black, Moody's managing director.Total US consumer debt outstanding has shrunk this year as banks have tried to reduce exposure to losses by cutting credit lines, slowing new lending and writing down bad credit card balances. Consumers are also increasingly using debit instead of credit cards.In February, total US credit card debt began to contract year-on-year for the first time since records began 40 years ago, Federal Reserve data show. This year-on-year decline continued each month through July.However, several of the largest credit card issuers, including Bank of America, Citigroup and Capital One, reported that in the first half of 2009, the amount owed on some individual customer accounts swelled. Credit card borrowers also made smaller repayments.Most credit card issuers also reported the proportion of borrowers who had fallen into the subprime category had risen as struggling borrowers' credit scores had been eroded by late payments and high debts."
267;TGT;Target Corp;2009-09-03T20:43:27Z;Wall Street rally breaks losing streak;;"US stocks crept up on Thursday to break a four-day losing streak, as investors braced themselves ahead of Friday’s jobs data.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,003.24, while the Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 1,983.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended the day 0.7 per cent higher at 9344.61.The major indices initially climbed on strong gains in China, helping the market to stabilise after this week’s falls.Positive news from the retail sector on August sales, and data from the services industry helped to lift the market but uncertainty lingered throughout the day. A weekly jobless claims report was also worse than expected, leaving investors jittery.“No one wants to take any real position ahead of tomorrow’s number,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. The US economy is expected to lose 230,000 jobs in August, while the unemployment rate is forecast to have risen to 9.5 per cent from 9.4 per cent.After suffering some of the steepest declines over the past few sessions, financial shares led the market’s gains throughout the day.Bank of America was up 3.5 per cent at $16.84, Citigroup rose 4.6 per cent to $4.77, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 3.1 per cent to $42.11.Investors in the materials sector also looked towards China. While the gold price, which hovered around a three-month high, helped boost mining stocks, Alcoa also lifted the mood in the sector. America’s largest aluminium producer raised its forecast for global demand, citing stimulus spending in China. Its shares climbed 4 per cent to $12.Retailers also performed well because even though many posted sales declines, the results were better than had been expected. According to Thomson Reuters, the same-store sales index for August fell 2.9 per cent, better than an expected decline of 3.9 per cent. However, of the 30 retailers
surveyed, 15 missed their sales targets.Costco, the wholesaler that posted its numbers before the bell, was up 8.6 per cent at $54.99 after it beat expectations by a wide margin. The group saw a 2 per cent decline in same-store sales after analysts had forecast a 5.7 per cent drop.Target, another discount retailer, also reported strong numbers from the back-to-school season and was up 1.7 per cent at $47.1.Although Wal-Mart no longer contributes monthly sales figures to the index, its shares climbed 1.6 per cent to $51.74 as the retailer was also expected to have been popular with frugal back-to-school shoppers.There were more surprises for analysts from the consumer sector. Del Monte Foods rose 7.5 per cent to $11.14 after clocking up its biggest intra-day gain since February. The company, which makes canned fruit and pet food, reported
better-than-expected profit from its first quarter.The group attributed its improved performance to the rising popularity of pet snacks and to price increases it implemented last year in order to compensate for higher commodity costs.Meanwhile, deals activity continued to pick up.Sepracor was up 0.2 per cent at $22.85 after Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma agreed to buy the drugmaker for $2.6bn. The deal is the second-biggest overseas acquisition made by a Japanese company so far this year.Shares in Pilgrim’s Pride, the maker of prepared chicken products, rose 5.4 per cent to $5.43 following reports that JBS SA, the world’s largest beef exporter, was in talks to buy the company. Analysts said the Brazilian company could pay more than $2bn for Pilgrim’s Pride.Credit rating agencies were hit by a ruling late on Wednesday by a judge in Manhattan which allowed an investor lawsuit to proceed against them.With numerous investor lawsuits looming in the aftermath of billions of
dollars of losses on triple A rated securities which proved to be riskier than investors had thought, rating agencies remain in the spotlight. Moody’s Corp shares fell 7.05 per cent to $24.26, with McGraw Hill, owner of Standard and Poor’s, down 10.21 per cent to $29.01."
268;TGT;Target Corp;2009-09-03T17:56:15Z;US retailers battle through August;;"US retailers on Thursday reported increasing signs of steadying consumer demand, tentatively signalling the end to the steep year-on-year sales declines that have forced waves of store closures and cost-cutting since last September.August’s comparable sales numbers from leading retail chains again declined during the month but by significantly less than in the preceding months.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of the monthly sales numbers showed a 2.3 per cent decline compared with the 4-5 per cent falls seen in recent months, the best performance for the index since September last year.Several retailers, including Costco, Gap, Target and Kohl’s, delivered better than expected sales numbers, despite the absence of a boost from pre-Labour Day holiday sales.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said the numbers suggested the decline in US retail sales may have “bottomed out” in July when the index fell 4.7 per cent.Mid-price and discount retailers also reported anecdotal evidence of renewed interest in discretionary spending – such as strong television sales at Costco, the warehouse club; and stronger women’s clothing sales at JC Penney and Kohl’s, the department stores; and stronger accessory sales at Target, the mass discounter.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said he believed the monthly sales reports showed a shift in the fundamental mood, and “may indeed be the start of a recovery for the industry”.“I think there is a turning point of sorts that will only get better as we look ahead.”Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount stores, reported a 0.2 per cent increase in same-store sales for the month, while Old Navy reported a 4 per cent rise.Target, with more than 1,700 large discount stores, reported a 2.9 per cent fall in comparable sales, against Wall Street’s expectations of a drop of more than 5 per cent. Costco, the largest US warehouse club, said comparable sales in the US, excluding petrol sales, were flat, again better than analysts expected.Retailers’ year-on-year comparable sales figures will improve from September as they contrast with the sharp monthly declines seen after last year’s financial crash. However, overall sales volumes will remain at levels significantly below last year, and most retailers have cut back on inventories for the autumn and holiday seasons.Luxury spending remains depressed. Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, again reported sales sharply down from last year, with comparable declines respectively of 16.6 and 19.6 per cent.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports same store sales on a monthly basis."
269;TGT;Target Corp;2009-09-02T19:03:45Z;Thrifty US shoppers embrace coupons;;"Budget-focused US shoppers have increased their use of money-off coupons this year by almost 20 per cent, amid a deluge of money-saving offers from manufacturers and retailers fighting to woo consumers.The Promotion Marketing Association’s Coupon Council, a marketing industry group, says a double-digit surge in coupon use that began as the economic crisis hit has shown no signs of abating.NCH Marketing, the largest US coupon clearing house, reported a 23 per cent increase in the volume of coupons redeemed during the second quarter of this year against the same period last year. Redemptions rose 15 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter, following a 17 per cent increase in the last three months of 2008.The council’s mid-year survey of coupon usage by 1,000 nationally representative consumers also found that 94 per cent said they had used coupons for grocery, household and healthcare items, up from 89 per cent a year ago.The average face-value per coupon also increased to $1.35, from $1.25 last year, as manufacturers and retailers seek to make coupons more accessible.“The consumer goods marketers have increased the quantity of coupons they have in distribution, and made them more attractive,” said Charles Brown, co-chair of the council.Alan Schultz, chief executive of Valassis Communications, which owns NCH, told investors this summer that consumer goods companies were using coupons to fight off competition from private label brands.“They turn to coupons and discounting to help keep their customers loyal by lowering the price differential between branded products and private label alternatives,” he said.The consumer slump has seen some new entrants to the coupon business.Whole Foods Market, the upscale natural and organic supermarket, has also launched coupons in an in-store newspaper, as part of efforts to fight its high-cost image. Whole Foods said last month it was seeing redemption rates on its coupons of about 4 per cent – compared to the less than 1 per cent usual for paper coupons.Target, the discount retailer, has started offering coupons on its own-label grocery items and on online purchases, while Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, recently introduced digital coupon offers for premium members of its Sam’s Club warehouse stores.Hain Celestial, whose natural and organic food brands include Celestial Seasoning Teas, told investors last week it had invested 64 per cent more on coupons in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, and it was seeing sharp rises in redemption rates.“We’re seeing redemptions doubling, tripling out there; and it is tremendous what’s going on with couponing,” said chief executive Irwin Simon."
270;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Activist funds find going tough;;Activist funds have failed to shake off many of the troubles of 2008 in spite of record performances and large inflows of new capital for the hedge fund industry as a whole this year.Events over the past month have underscored the difficulties many large activist funds are facing.Cerberus Capital, a leading investor in the collapsed US car industry, last week saw its $7.7bn activist hedge fund portfolio receive redemption requests from investors for about $5.5bn, according to people with knowledge of the situation.But outflows are far from being the only issue troubling the sector.Atticus, the fund of which Rothschild banking scion Nat Rothschild is co-chair, said two weeks ago that it was shutting its flagship fund.Having fallen 27 per cent in value in 2008, it has continued to fall in 2009.The management was set not to earn performance fees from the fund until previous highs were regained.Warren Lichtenstein’s Steel Partners is fighting tooth and claw with investors to convert itself from a fund to a listed industrial holding company.Carl Icahn, the doyen of hedge fund activists, is being sued – by a hedge fund – for allegedly harming shareholders’ interests.In Europe, the picture is the same, even for the biggest and most prominent funds.The Children’s Investment Fund, run by Chris Hohn, is reported to be allowing investors to withdraw some of their money ahead of the lock-up period previously agreed.Activist managers see many opportunities but the frailty of markets continues to inhibit investment.Whereas other hedge fund strategies are more nimble, activists tend to operate on longer time horizons.“Until we manage to see a substantial market recovery, it’s very difficult to know how over or under- valued companies are,” said one large US activist fund manager.Encouraging equity issuance in target companies has been a popular tactic, say other managers, and in most cases it hasn’t required high-profile or public disagreements or campaigns. Other strategies and bolder bets are constrained, however, by a “lack of firepower”.According to a survey last month, although the number of activist battles waged is up, year-on-year, the size of the target companies is significantly smaller.Scarcity of capital is not the only factor that has diminished activist options.In May this year, Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square launched one of the biggest proxy fights ever against US discount retailer Target.Mr Ackman’s well-resourced fight failed, however, because fellow investors could not be brought on board in sufficient numbers.“Conservatism is a big problem,” said an investor with knowledge of the Target proxy battle. “Big long-only investors don’t want to know about unlocking value right now. They’re still just concentrated on preserving it.”
271;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-19T01:14:01Z;Cost and inventory cuts boost US retailers;;US retailers reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Tuesday, but their outperformance was driven largely by cost cuts and inventory reductions, rather than a sustained recovery in consumer confidence.Home Depot said net income in the three months to August 2 fell to $1.1bn from $1.2bn in the same period a year earlier. But the world’s biggest DIY retailer said it was seeing some recovery in demand in the hard-hit areas of California and Florida.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, attributed the improvement in California to recent good weather, together with efforts to spruce up repossessed houses in order to sell them on.This “churn” drove demand for products such as paint and carpets.But he expected rising repossessions to continue to damp demand for basic building materials.There was some evidence of consumers being more willing to make smaller purchases. However, cash-strapped consumers remain reluctant to splash out on bigger ticket items and demand from trade buyers also remained subdued.Mr Blake said it could be the second quarter or the second half of 2010 before Home Depot saw a rise in like-for-like sales.Sales fell 9.1 per cent in the second quarter to $19.1bn, while sales from stores open for more than a year fell by 8.5 per cent. US like-for-like sales were 6.9 per cent weaker. But operating costs fell 7.5 per cent to $4.56bn.The second quarter figure included a $20m operating charge related to the closure of about 40 home project planning stores. It also included a $50m benefit to net income from a favourable foreign tax settlement.Diluted earnings per share was 66 cents, compared with 71 cents per share in the second quarter of 2008. Excluding the charge for closing the unit, and the tax benefit, earnings per share totalled 64 cents, ahead of analysts’ expectations of 59 cents.Target, the discount retailer, also said its second-quarter profits were stronger than it expected, as efficiencies helped it to cut costs.Net income fell 6.4 per cent to $594m, while earnings per share slipped from 82 cents in the same period a year earlier to 79 cents.The allowance for bad debts in Target’s credit card business was stable at $1bn the end of the second quarter.Sales fell 2.7 per cent to $14.6bn, as like-for-like sales fell 6.2 per cent.Saks Fifth Avenue, the US department store chain, said its like-for-like sales fell 15.5 per cent in the second quarter, as the retailer continued to “experience weakness across all merchandise categories and geographies”.Saks made a net loss of $54.5m, or 39 cents a share, in the three months to August 1, compared with a deficit of $32.7m, or 24 cents a share, in the year earlier period. Excluding one-off items, the net loss was 40 cents per share, less than analysts had feared.
272;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-18T23:25:35Z;Germany offers hope of global recovery;;Europe’s biggest economy offered renewed hopes for a global recovery on Tuesday as the International Monetary Fund identified a “nascent” but fragile upturn.Separately, the ZEW institute in Mannheim said that its closely watched survey of German investor confidence had jumped by 16.6 points to 56.1 points in August, the highest in three years.Also, Germany’s IAB labour market institute said that the country was likely to emerge from this year’s brutal downturn without suffering a large-scale increase in unemployment thanks to the government’s policy of subsidising wages.Olivier Blanchard, IMF chief economist, wrote in a paper due to be published on Wednesday that a global recovery is under way but warned that US policymakers are walking a tightrope in timing the end of their fiscal stimulus.In New York, retail stocks including Home Depot, Target and Saks rose sharply as the S&P 500 recovered some of Monday’s losses, gaining 1 per cent. However, it was cost-cutting rather than a resurgent consumer that helped the retailers.Mr Blanchard said that the US consumer was unlikely to step in to help growth when the fiscal stimulus was removed. He indicated that increased US exports to surplus countries in Asia were needed.But he said “it is clear” that the rebalancing may not take place, “at least not on the scale needed”.Marty Regalia, chief economist at the US Chamber of Commerce, forecast a recovery “in fits and starts” as consumers gradually regained confidence. However, he cautioned: “The consumer is not in total freefall but investment is still pathetic: who wants to put inventory on shelves when you’re not going to have customers coming through the door?”He also expressed doubt about any near-term rebalancing in global trade. “Yes, you’d like to see them go like gangbusters over there and spend like Americans. But the idea that China is going to be the saviour? I just don’t see it.”Mr Blanchard said that without a pick-up in external demand to the US – “central to any world recovery” – the stimulus could be maintained too long, adding an undesirable amount to the country’s debt burden, or choked off too soon, putting the recovery at risk.If fiscal deficits were maintained for too long, he wrote, there could be “worries about US government bonds and the dollar. . . causing large capital flows from the United States. Dollar depreciation may take place, but in a disorderly fashion, leading to another episode of instability and high uncertainty, which could itself derail the recovery.”Japan as well as Germany and Francereturned to growth in the second quarter, according to economic data published in the past few days, while most economists think that the US recession has ended or is coming to an end.“The turnround will not be simple,” said Mr Blanchard. “The crisis has left deep scars, which will affect both supply and demand for many years to come.”He noted that the recovery would be too slow to check the rise in the unemployment rate in many countries, which is at 9.4 per cent in last US data and above 10 per cent in parts of Europe.In Germany, Eugen Spitznagel, co-author of the IAB study, the first attempt to put a price tag on Berlin’s short-shift working scheme, said that the decision to cover part of the labour costs of companies that hold on to otherwise redundant workers would cost businesses €5bn this year, with the government putting up €6bn.But despite the high cost to business, he said, the scheme, described by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, as a “bridge to the next recovery”, looked likely to avert massive job losses in Germany next year as business sentiment turned more positive.The IAB’s conclusions challenge the widely held view – including at the European Central Bank – that government-sponsored short-time working schemes risk creating the wrong incentives, thereby delaying the economic recovery.“Our latest surveys of companies for the fourth quarter show hiring and firing intentions pretty much balancing each other over the next 12 months,” Mr Spitznagel said.Private sector economists said that the findings of the IAB, part of the Federal Labour Agency, which runs the unemployment insurance scheme, vindicated Berlin’s strategy.“If you thought the downturn would be a short-term event, which we did, then it makes sense to try and preserve jobs, both at a micro and macro level,” said Dirk Schumacher, economist at Goldman Sachs.Mr Spitznagel said that the €5bn cost to companies was roughly equivalent to the cost of rehiring qualified workers in the next upturn.Mr Schumacher still expected unemployment to rise next year. “We expect to breach the 4m mark, with a jobless rate of 9.7 per cent, by the middle of next year,” he said. “By comparison, unemployment peaked at more than 5m, or 12.1 per cent, in March 2005, in what was a much shallower downturn.”
273;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-18T20:33:56Z;Wall Street stages modest rebound;;"US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after the steepest decline in more than a month during the previous session.Financial stocks, retailers and materials companies, which led the market lower on Monday, all did well as buyers were tempted back into the market.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 1 per cent at 989.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.9 per cent to 9,217.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1.3 per cent to 1,955.92.“A lot of people missed the rally in March and again in July,” said Chris Verrone, investment strategist at Strategas Partners. “Therefore any pull-back will be viewed as a buying opportunity.”Investors continued to focus on retailers as earnings season for the sector kicked up a gear with results from Home Depot, Target and Saks. For all three the pattern during the quarter was similar, with strict cost controls mitigating ongoing sales weakness.Home Depot recovered all of Monday’s losses, which were triggered by disappointing results from rival Lowe’s, after lower costs than expected helped it raise its full-year outlook. Its shares picked up 3.1 per cent to $26.93.Budget retailer Target also beat analysts’ estimates with revenues in line with expectations but profit margins improving. The stock climbed 7.6 per cent to $44.32.Upmarket chain Saks reported a similar story as carefully managed expenses kept costs low and helped it beat earnings estimates. Its shares gained 6.9 per cent to $5.72.“Only 43 per cent of companies that have reported their earnings have beat expectations on both the top and the bottom line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential. “We need to see revenue growth in the next quarter,”Financial stocks led the way, however, helped in part by improving credit card losses. Citigroup climbed 3.5 per cent to $4.14 and Bank of America gained 2.1 per cent to $16.90.Goldman Sachs was upgraded to “buy” at Pali Research, which predicted continued strength in its fixed-income business, and the stock rose 2.1 per cent to $160.48.American Express, meanwhile, was upgraded by KBW after credit losses improved last month. Its shares picked up 4.3 per cent to $31.69.CIT was one of the strongest financial companies, up 2.9 per cent to $1.40 after the commercial lender announced a narrower loss than in the same quarter last year.On Monday the group announced that it had bought more time to fight off bankruptcy by completing a $1bn debt tender.But the rally in financial stocks was not replicated everywhere and economic data limited the bullish mood. Figures showed that deflation continued to
hamper producer prices.There was weakness among health insurers, which bucked Monday’s
losing trend on signs that the Obama administration could abandon the public insurer element of its healthcare reforms.Such a plan has been
criticised as undermining the private sector and, after campaigners hit back at suggestions that it might
be dropped, insurers gave back much of the previous session’s gains.Humana lost 1.5 per cent to $35 and Coventry Health Care fell 2.6 per cent to $22.98.Homebuilders recovered from early losses, which were triggered by data showing that builders started work on fewer homes last month than expected. But economists said the rise in the number of new single-family homes was good for the sector. Lennar and DR Horton both finished the day 2.8 per cent higher, at $13.19 and $12.22, respectively.Technology stocks also showed strength after a bruising previous session. Smartphone makers were particularly strong after RBC described the market as “the next wave of
computing” and raised its price targets on the three leaders in the sector.Apple, which makes the iPhone, climbed 2.8 per cent to $164. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, picked up 4.6 per cent to $73.99. Palm, which recently launched the Pre, gained 4.9 per cent to $13.88."
274;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Li & Fung prepares to unlock $1bn war chest;;Li & Fung, the world’s largest trade sourcing company, on Thursday reported a rise in interim profits and said it had accumulated a war chest of $1bn in preparation for potential acquisitions this year or early next.William Fung, managing director, said Li & Fung hoped to take advantage of the economic downturn by snapping up companies that had fallen in market value.The Hong Kong-based company, which supplies goods to retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, said it was looking at businesses in the US and Europe. It is also considering expanding its medicines and cosmetics business. Li & Fung aims to boost revenue from this arm of the business to $1bn by 2010.The group had considered making a purchase last year after it raised $500m through a share placement but delayed the process after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it said. It has since raised a further $350m through a share placement this May and has a $200m line of bank credit to fund its war chest.Bruce Rockowitz, president of Li & Fung, said the group’s “firing power” could be bigger than $1bn because acquisitions would be paid for over three to five years.Revenue in the first half of the year fell 2 per cent from HK$47.4bn ($6.1bn) to HK$46.3bn year on year, reflecting a drop in demand in some markets and customer insolvencies.However, the company reported a 13 per cent rise in net profit to HK$1.4bn in the six months to the end of June compared with the same period last year, thanks to cost cuts.The company expects second-half results to be stronger than those in the first half, as orders increase with year-end holiday seasons and as the global economy improves.It is in the middle of a three-year plan to achieve an annual turn­over of $20bn and a core operating profit of $1bn by 2010.A “major acquisition or outsourcing deal” would be required to meet the targets, Mr Rockowitz said this year.Li & Fung has made a number of small acquisitions this year. It spent $15m to acquire Shubiz, a UK wholesaler of clothing and accessories, in March and purchased a sourcing operation from Liz Claiborne for $83m in February.Li & Fung shares – which are trading near a one-year high after gaining about 80 per cent since the beginning of the year – closed up 3.5 per cent at HK$25.45.
275;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-11T20:33:26Z;Wall Street sell-off led by financials;;Financial stocks led US equities to their worst day in more than a month on Tuesday amid signs that the effects of the financial crisis are still being felt.Banks suffered after the Congressional Oversight Panel, the body that runs the Troubled Asset Relief Program, warned the US Treasury had not done enough to relieve them of toxic assets.JPMorgan fell 3.4 per cent to $41.24 while Citigroup snapped a seven-session winning streak, giving up 6.4 per cent to $3.69.Meanwhile two of the companies worst affected by the crisis also fell sharply on fresh worries about their finances.CIT, the commercial lender that narrowly staved off bankruptcy last month, sank 18.9 per cent to $1.20 after the company delayed its second-quarter report, warning it might still go bankrupt if it cannot complete its debt tender or raise money in another way.Struggling bond insurer MBIA suffered a downgrade from JPMorgan, which said the company may be overwhelmed by losses from risky mortgage securities, leaving little value for shareholders. The stock fell 12.6 per cent to $5.39.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.3 per cent down at 994.35, on a day when trading in certain shares, including those in Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway, was halted for almost four hours after a computer problem,.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 9.241.45 and the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,969.73.“After a near-50 per cent rally off the lows this pull back is both normal and expected,” said Jordan Smyth, managing director of Edgemoor Investment Advisors. “It is not necessarily the start of a steep decline.”The falls came in spite of figures showing productivity among non-farm workers in the second quarter rose more than economists had expected while the costs of that labour fell.But experts warned such savings may not inflate profit margins.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: “Are companies really going to put these cost savings into margins? My conclusion would be that they are going to use them instead as a tool to cut prices.”There was further pessimism from data showing companies cut inventories much more sharply than expected last month, apparently holding out little hope for a bounce in demand.Wall Street was also waiting for the statement from the Federal Reserve, whose Open Market Committee (FOMC) began its two-day meeting on Tuesday to discuss interest rates and the future of quantitative easing.With many on Wall Street predicting little change in policy, investors were waiting to see what tone the committee would strike on the health of the economy.Meanwhile companies sensitive to the US consumer suffered on a second bearish day for cyclicals.Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone operator, lost 4.3 per cent to $3.55 after Piper Jaffray downgraded the stock, warning of continued loss of customers.That came after Sprint announced on Monday night that it would increase a current debt offer to $1.3bn, which would take its debt load to $21bn.Yum Brands, which owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, also saw its shares downgraded, with UBS warning about sluggish sales in the US. The stock fell 3.8 per cent to $35.13.But investors were happier about signs that the battle over Target, the value retailer, may be cooling after Pershing Square, whose manager Bill Ackman lost a proxy contest to elect new directors earlier this year, cut its stake to 4.4 per cent. Target picked up 0.5 per cent to $42.20.The ongoing delays to President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms meant health insurers, which stand to see government subsidies cut under the proposals, were one of the few sectors to show strength.UnitedHealth rose 2.8 per cent to $27.82 while Coventry Health Care climbed 1.6 per cent to $22.52.Shares in Fluor, the engineering company, fell after it announced lower revenues than expected. Even though it made better profits than forecast and maintained its outlook, the stock lost 6.1 per cent to $53.96.
276;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-10T22:41:08Z;Soros donates $35m to ‘back to school’ fund;;New York families on public assistance or food stamps are set to receive an additional $200 per child as part of a public-private partnership between the charitable foundations of George Soros, the state of New York, and the US Department of Health and Human Services.The one-time payments of $200 will benefit families of more than 850,000 children. The total programme will cost $175m, a combination of federal stimulus money and a $35m donation by Mr Soros to the the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.The programme, dubbed “Back to School New York”, is set to be announced on Tuesday by Mr Soros and David Paterson, New York’s governor.The funds come with no strings attached, and outlays are not monitored, but they are meant to pay for back-to-school supplies for students.“The kids will get a direct benefit: clothing and school equipment. It’s a very efficient way to help a very large number of needy people,” Mr Soros told the Financial Times.“This programme puts recipients on a level playing field with families that can afford to buy those things for the kids.”The programme has partnered with retailers including Wal-Mart, Princeton Review, Target and Staples, to encourage parents to spend the funds on their children. The stores will display in-store advertisements that give tips on “shopping wisely” and hotlines to put families in touch with other state services.Recipients will also receive a letter from New York state, and advocacy groups will be involved in the effort.No application is necessary. Families who qualify will automatically receive payments on the electronics benefit transfer card where they receive other public assistance payments on August 11.Mr Soros, who himself received a no-strings-attached donation of £40 from the Quakers when he was a struggling student at London School of Economics, said the match federal funds and additional discounts negotiated with partnering retailers, made it particularly appealing. “It gets additional leverage – leverage these days is a bad word, but I like it in this case.”The $35m donation comes three months after Mr Soros pledged an additional $50m to New York City residents living in poverty. His charitable foundations have donated almost $7bn world wide to social causes over the past quarter century.
277;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-06T21:33:40Z;Wall Street falls on economic jitters;;For the first time this week the S&P 500 closed below the 1,000-point threshold on Thursday, as healthcare, retail, energy and telecoms stocks weighed on sentiment ahead of today’s US monthly jobs report.The S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent to 997.08, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3 per cent to 9,256.26. The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent lower at 1,973.16.Shares in Cisco recovered from early losses and rose 0.6 per cent to $22.31. John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits. The shares rose 8.2 per cent to $18.14.Macy’s was also able to increase its outlook for second-quarter earnings, bringing them far above analysts’ expectations in spite of seeing weaker sales than had been predicted. Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices. The shares gave up 3.2 per cent to $31.24.Within the healthcare sector, which was lowered to underweight by JP Morgan, shares in Gilead Sciences fell 3 per cent to $45.45, while Amgen lost 2.6 per cent to $60.69.In the energy sector, ExxonMobil fell 0.4 per cent to $69.73 while Chevron lost 0.8 per cent to $69.25.Telecoms were hurt as shares in MetroPCS, the low-cost mobile telephone operator, slumped 29.2 per cent to $8.99. The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges. The shares fell 3.6 per cent to $24.84.The first day of trading for CDC Software saw its shares close at $9.99, after being offered at a price of $12.
278;TGT;Target Corp;2009-08-06T19:04:37Z;US stores suffer gloomy July;;Leading US retailers had another month of year-on-year comparable sales declines in July, and several said they managed to maintain or improve profit margins on leaner inventory levels and reduced price markdowns.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly same-store sales, said on Thursday its index for July was down 4.7 per cent against the period last year. The index excludes Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.Consumer concern over rising unemployment and the economy hit sales, but other factors were the later start to the back-to-school shopping season than last year and the fact that several states moved annual sales-tax-free shopping days to August.Only a handful of retailers reported comparable sales gains, including the “off-price” stores TJX and Ross. Off-price stores, which buy excess stock from other brands, have performed well throughout the recession.Kohl’s, which operates more than 1,000 discount-style department stores, also reported a 0.4 per cent increase in same-store sales, its first gain since April last year. Its rival JC Penney said its comparable sales fell 12.3 per cent, while Target, the discounter, reported a 6.5 per cent drop, and Macy’s was down 10.7 per cent.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent fall in comparable sales at its US stores, excluding petrol, as lower prices for food and large electronics items including televisions offset continued gains in transactions. Costco’s unit sales of TVs were up 30 per cent on July last year.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks department stores reporting comparable sales down 27 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.Several retailers reported strongest sales in the southwest and north-east of the US but continued weakness in Florida, the south-east and in the Midwest. Kohl’s said its stores in the south-west had recorded double-digit sales gains in comparable stores.In spite of the overall sluggishness, several retailers raised conservative earnings estimates, including Gap, Macy’s, JC Penney and Kohl’s.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said retailers’ attention was focused on the back-to-school selling surge, from the end of August and to the first week of September.“I think inventories are going to be lean, and they could leave some sales on the table as a result …But if I were them, I would take that bet,” he said, noting that in July sales “remained in a rut”.
279;TGT;Target Corp;2009-07-23T17:39:02Z;Activist investors eye smaller prey;;Activist investors may have waged more battles this year than ever before, but the size of the companies they are taking on is vastly smaller, according to new research.So far this year, there has been a 27 per cent increase in proxy battles, according to RiskMetrics, a leading shareholder consultancy. The average market capitalisation of companies being targeted by activists, however, has fallen.In the US, the median ­target company market ­capitalisation has fallen from a high of $275m in 2008 to just $75m in 2009. In Europe, the story is the same.“The size of targets has decreased and even adjusted for the market decline, but the amount of activity in the US has been surprising,” said Chris Young, director of mergers and acquisitions research at RiskMetrics.In spite of their increased activity, shareholder activists still face several obstacles when it comes to taking companies on.“On the face of things, it might seem like it’s never been easier to be an activist investor,” said one London-based hedge fund manager who did not want to be named. “But, in fact, it’s never been harder.”Banks are cutting leverage, markets remain dislocated and even for those funds that have cash, a lack of viable “exit strategies” is proving challenging.“In any deal you do, you’re always going to be looking for multiple exit strategies – those are ­limited in the current ­market. Markets are just too uncertain,” one US activist said.The biggest proxy fight on record – Bill Ackman’s campaign to force the US retailer Target to securitise its property portfolio – has been the most notable flop of 2009. Pershing Square IV, the fund set up by Ackman to invest in Target, has seen the value of its holdings fall 90 per cent.In Europe, after a successful 2008, The Children’s Investment Fund, run by Chris Hohn, has also had a difficult start to 2009. The fund has been forced into a number of messy exits from high-profile proxy fights in Europe and Asia.For some activists though, there are more promising changes in the market. Long-only institutional investors, who are traditionally known to be quite cautious, are beginning to take a more active role towards investments.Peter Chambers, investment management chief at Legal & General, last month publicly backed a campaign by activist investor Erik Knight against HSBC, the bank.Evidence of greater investor collaboration among larger institutions was seen recently when miner Rio Tinto scrapped its contentious deal with Chinalco in favour of a joint venture with BHP Billiton and a capital raising.In the wake of the deal, the UK’s Institutional Shareholders Committee – whose members collectively hold more than £1,500bn in assets – was persuaded to urge regulators to clarify rules on acting in concert to enable more investors to combine forces so that they can collectively drive change in companies.Shareholders in Cintra, the Spanish toll-road operator, are also agitating against a possible merger with its sister company ­Ferrovial, the construction and services group.“For now, activism seems to be driven by ‘vanilla’ investor engagement instead of hedge fund campaigning,” Mr Young said.Leverage and short-term investments of less than a year are no longer viable. Barriers to entry have been raised, according to the big activists that remain in the game.“In 2005-2006 all you needed really was two ­pennies, a liking for theatre and a megaphone,” said one well-known European activist. “Anyone, to put it bluntly, could be an activist then.”
280;TGT;Target Corp;2009-07-09T20:41:08Z;Wall Street starts earnings season with rally;;US stocks staged a modest rally on Thursday as a positive start to earnings season and better-than-expected economic data failed to lift the caution that has dominated Wall Street since last week’s jobs report.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, started earnings season by announcing on Wednesday evening a smaller loss than expected on better revenues than had been predicted.Alcoa’s results and rising metals prices lifted other metals producers, including Freeport McMoRan the copper miner, which advanced 3.5 per cent to $46.69 and Nucor, the steelmaker, which gained 2.6 per cent to $41.44.But with Alcoa not having made a profit for a year its shares remained under pressure, falling 2.4 per cent to $9.23.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher at 882.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent up at 8,183.17 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.3 per cent to 1,752.55.“People are looking for a reason not to sell stocks right now, rather than to buy them,” said Eric Ross, director of research at Cannacord Adams.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, wrote: “The overall rebound appears to be somewhat muted, suggesting this bounce may be more of a pause in selling for now rather than the start of a new upswing,”Merck exerted significant pressure on the Dow amid speculation its cholesterol medicine fared poorly in a clinical trial comparing it with a rival drug from Abbott. Its shares lost 3.7 per cent to $27.01.But there was support from financial stocks after the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week was shown to be much lower than expected.Banks were particularly strong gainers, supported by the economic data and by signs of progress with the government’s latest plan to clear balance sheets of toxic assets.The Treasury announced on Wednesday evening the nine fund managers with which it will work to purchase those securities under the Public-Private Investment Plan, and committed up to $30bn to it.Citigroup rose 2.7 per cent to $2.69, while Bank of Americaclimbed 1.1 per cent to $11.97.Goldman Sachs climbed after BofA recommended buying the shares, saying second-quarter earnings would be better than previous estimates as trading and investment banking delivered strong revenues. Shares in Goldman gained 3.4 per cent to $143.21.The economic optimism was tempered however by renewed talk of a second stimulus plan, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett added his voice to those calling for the government to consider such a move.But George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers, said this should be a bullish sign for stocks. “The first stimulus hasn’t begun to work yet, so the impact will be impressive if lawmakers vote in a second,” he said.Retailers were mixed as they reported their same-store sales for June.Target, the discount retailer, reported a steeper drop than predicted but the shares jumped 3 per cent to $38.39 after the company said its second-quarter profits would meet or exceed analysts’ estimates.But there was worse news for other retailers, including Limited Brands, whose shares fell 4 per cent to $10.89 after sales at its flagship Victoria’s Secret chain fell 14 per cent.Elsewhere, investors were betting that the possible sale of American Life Insurance Company by AIGto Metlife, its rival insurer, reported in the Financial Times, could be a better deal for Metlife than its competitor. The unit is regarded as one of the jewels in AIG’s crown, and the news sent Metlife’s shares up 2.7 per cent to $27.63 while AIG tumbled 27.6 per cent to $9.48.In the technology sector, NetApprose 3.4 per cent to $19.01 after it pulled out of the bidding for Data Domain, its rival data storage company, saying it could not match an increased bid made by competitor EMCthis week.Analysts said NetApp could now become an acquisition target itself. EMC’s shares gained 1.9 per cent to $12.76 but Data Domain fell 1.4 per cent to $33.44.
281;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US chain stores continue to struggle;;"US retailers continued their slog through the recession in June, with only a handful of the more than 35 leading chains that reported monthly sales numbers on Thursday announcing gains.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same-store sales fell 4.3 per cent for the month, slightly better than Wall Street investors had expected.June had been “setting up to be particularly disastrous”, said Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics. “It actually turned out to be weak, but not as bad as expected.”In addition to economic pressures, retailers were hit by the outbreak of rain and cold weather in the north-east of the US. Year-on-year comparisons were further skewed by last June’s boost to consumer spending from a federal tax stimulus scheme.Only two non-discount retailers reported positive comparable sales gains – Aeropostale, up 12 per cent, and Buckle, up 9.6 per cent. Both are youth fashion chains that have managed to ride trends and outperform their rivals since the downturn began.Most speciality clothing stores struggled. Comparable sales at Gap were down
10 per cent, at Bebe down 29 per cent, at American Eagle 11 per cent, and at Abercrombie & Fitch they were 32 per cent lower.Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, continued to struggle during the month.Neiman said its comparable-store sales had fallen 20.8 per cent with weakness across all categories.Saks’s June comparable-store sales fell only 4.4 per cent as it benefited from
the shift of a spring sales event that fell in May the year before. But comparable sales for May and June were down 15.2 per cent, it said.Target, the discounter, reported a 6.2 per cent fall in comparable sales.Greg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said the performance “continued to reflect a very challenging economic environment”.However, the retailer raised its earnings guidance for its second quarter,
citing improved profit margins, better expense management, and modest improvements in the risk trends in its credit card business.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, no longer reports monthly sales numbers.JC Penney, the mainstream department store, also raised its earnings guidance after sales fell less heavily that expected.Peter Brown, vice-chairman of Kurt Salmon, a retail consultants, said the June figures represented a continuation of consumers “doing what they’ve been forced to do: saving more and spending less”.Retailers, he said, had become focused on the autumn shopping season, which they would enter with inventory levels sig­nificantly reduced from last year, when the downturn hit."
282;TGT;Target Corp;2009-06-25T20:43:58Z;Retail sector leads Wall Street rally;;"US stocks staged an impressive broad-based rally on Thursday with retail stocks leading the way.Home furnishings retailers fared especially well after Bed Bath & Beyond reported an unexpected rise in profits with cost cuts and new store openings making up for a fall in same-store sales. Its shares climbed 9.5 per cent to $31.08.That lifted rival retailers, with Home Depot rising 3.9 per cent to $23.57 and
Target gaining 4.2 per cent to $40.31. Lowe’spicked up 3.8 per cent to $18.87.Office Depot, meanwhile, jumped 7.8 per cent to $4.42 after Goldman Sachs said the $350m cash injection from BC Partners earlier this week could enable the retailer to merge with another company.An apparent stabilisation in sales of homewares also encouraged JPMorgan to upgrade shares in JC Penney, which gained 6 per cent to $28.20, lifting rival department stores with it.Kohl’s picked up 2.3 per cent to $44.43 and Macyâ€™s climbed 3.9 per cent to $11.83.But there was bad news elsewhere in the consumer sector as Nike reported quarterly earnings that missed consensus estimates once restructuring costs had been factored in.Investors were also disappointed by the news that forward orders had fallen 12 per cent and Nike shares lost 3.3 per cent to $51.28.Economic data showed that the US economy contracted 5.5 per cent in the first three months of the year, slightly less than had previously been estimated.But investors focused on the fact that more people claimed jobless benefits last week than expected.The data saw the markets open in negative territory but they then rose as Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress on last year’s takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America.Mr Bernanke was accused on Wednesday by a senior Republican of being part of a “cover-up” concerning what disclosures should be made about the deal.That knocked the market’s faith in the Fed on the day it decided to keep interest rates low, but some of that confidence returned on Thursday as Mr Bernanke defended his position.Mr Bernanke was also supported by President Barack Obama, who said he had confidence in the job he had done.“Mr Bernanke’s comments seemed fairly justifiable, and that probably held up the market a little bit,” said Nick Kalivas.“People seemed pretty nervous about the testimony but I am not sure there was anything there that constituted the smoking gun that might quicken his demise.”The benchmark S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite index all rose 2.1 per cent to 920.26, 8,472.40 and 1,829.54, respectively.“It has been very difficult to push this market down,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “There has been a continual flow of investor money as the awareness grows that recovery is coming.”Bank of America fell during the morning, with many on Wall Street saying the investigation into the Merrill purchase could make Ken Lewis, chief executive, more vulnerable than Mr Bernanke.It was also hit by analysis from Citi, which warned that BofA could have a
difficult quarter as it builds capital in case of further loan losses.But the shares picked up ground during the day as nervousness about Mr Bernanke’s testimony abated. They closed flat at $12.35.There was a glimmer of hope on US housing as Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, the homebuilder, said he sensed some pent-up demand from potential home buyers. This helped the company’s shares climb 17.5 per cent to $9.19, even though it reported a bigger loss than expected as falling house prices continued to take their toll.Other homebuilders were also lifted. Centex advanced 5.8 per cent to $8.58 while KB Homeclimbed 8.3 per cent to $14.77.There were encouraging signs on investor appetite as Medidata, a clinical technology company, made an impressive debut on the Nasdaq, jumping 21.4 per cent to $17 on the day of its initial public offering. The shares had initially been priced at $14."
283;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Alice.com site to take on supermarkets;;Top US household goods brands are backing the launch of an e-commerce website this week that could further shake up the already fraught relations between large retailers and their main suppliers.The site, Alice.com, sells leading name goods such as Tide laundry detergent and Huggies baby products at prices that are in line with mass discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target, and about 20 per cent below online rivals.Brian Wiegand and Mark McGuire, the founders of Alice, say about half of the 6,000 items on the site – which also provides free shipping – are covered by a potentially revolutionary direct-from-the-supplier sales model that they intend to extend to all participating suppliers.Unlike retail sites such as Amazon or Drugstore.com, the site’s revenues will be dependent on advertising rather than the conventional retailer’s mark-up on the cost of goods.While it will charge suppliers a service fee on each sale to cover costs, it will not own the inventory itself.High-value brands such as Nike or Estée Lauder already sell direct to consumers from their own company websites. But the approach has not made economic sense for manufacturers of low-margin items such as soap and toothpaste.Mr Wiegand argues that the single online platform provided by Alice will allow consumer goods companies “to get in touch with the consumer in a way that doesn’t work if they do it on their own”.Mr McGuire says the site could “rebalance” manufacturers’ relations with retailers, which have increasingly been developing their own lower-cost private-label goods that they promote alongside national brands.Consumer-goods companies have become increasingly interested in the potential of internet sales, and there has been a steady although slow increase in sales of items such as baby products from online retailers such as Amazon.com, Drugstore.com and Diapers.com.But manufacturers have also been been wary of exploring the potential of direct sales because of fears of antagonising the large retailers they depend on for the bulk of their business.In an indication of the sensitivity of the direct sales issue, Alice is not saying which manufacturers are already using its direct model but says all those on the site – which include Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, SC Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive – have expressed an interest in its business potential.“If they can figure out a way to make money, that’s wonderful,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, e-commerce analyst at Forrester Research.“But a lot of smart people have been trying to crack this nut for a while and have lost their shirts doing so.”
284;TGT;Target Corp;2009-06-23T04:02:00Z;Consumer goods companies eye online sales;;Target, the leading US discounter, recently provided a stark illustration of why consumer goods companies are interested in a new e-commerce site that offers the chance to sell – and speak – directly to their customers.Under the slogan “favour the brands priced right”, one of the retailer’s weekly newspaper insert ads displayed its own private label kitchen bags, headache pills and cleaners directly alongside more expensive brand name products from SC Johnson, Clorox and Wyeth.Mike McGuire, co-founder of Alice.com, noted on the start-up website’s blog that the Target ad “represents a battle for market share worth $100’s of billions” – a battle that has intensified as the recession has pushed shoppers towards cheaper alternatives.He and his co-founder Brian Wiegand argue that their start-up will help consumer goods companies adjust a balance of power that has been leaning increasingly in favour of retailers – because of factors including decline in ability of leading brands to dominate marketing messages via television and newspapers.Consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies such as Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark have all stepped up spending on the internet in an effort to establish new direct links to their customers.But unlike the makers of higher cost items such as Hermes ties or Body Shop cosmetics, it has not made economic sense for them to try to sell their low-margin items directly to consumers online. That has left them dependent on conventional retailers for both sales and data, as well as for access to in-store marketing opportunities.US online retailers such as Diapers.com and Drugstore.com have sought to tap online demand for CPG products, but at prices that are above bricks and mortar store rivals. Amazon has focused on selling bulk packages of goods, offering discounts on a subscription service that automatically repeats orders.The higher online costs mean sales of low margin household goods have lagged far behind other categories, at less than one per cent, compared to an overall figure for US retail of around 6 per cent.But CPG companies have still showed increasing interest in online sales, with P&G’s main sites now linked to “where to buy” list of online retailers. P&G has also acquired a small stake in Ocado, the UK online retailer, showing a particular interest in the customer data yielded by online sales, according to a source familiar with the relationship.If Alice.com can indeed deliver toothpaste and soap online for the same price as a mass retailer, and with free shipping, it would be addressing what one of the main blocks to greater online sales.If it works, that would also provide more of shopper data direct to the CPG companies, together with the opportunity to direct online coupons and promotions to new and existing customers with far more specifity than conventional “pay and spray” promotions.Success will ultimately depend on whether its advertising-based revenue model will work, and whether it can cover the costs of delivery that have bedevilled efforts to develop online sales of toilet paper, household towels and laundry detergent.
285;TGT;Target Corp;2009-06-16T20:29:29Z;Wall Street slides on consumer spending fears;;US stocks lost early gains on Tuesday as they headed towards a second consecutive session of losses.Investors worried about the health of consumer spending after Best Buy reported weaker sales than expected and falling profits.The company was expected to benefit from the demise of Circuit City, one of its main competitors, but instead it saw revenues fall as customers cut back on spending. The shares lost 7.3 per cent to $35.84.There was some positive news on the sector from Tyco Electronics, which makes electronic connectors. The company said sales had improved in consumer-related markets and profits may be almost three times higher than forecast. Its shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $19.98.But this could not prevent Best Buy’s weak sales from encouraging investors to sell shares in other retailers. Targetfell 3.7 per cent to $38.62 while Home Depot lost 2.7 per cent to $23.20.Stocks had been supported during the morning by rising commodity prices, but these fell again during the afternoon, extending the trend of the previous two sessions, dragging metal producers with them.Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, dropped 5 per cent to $52.39 and Alcoa, which produces aluminium, declined 2.8 per cent to $10.90.Steelmakers, which have moved from stellar gains to sharp losses in the past few sessions, intially picked up ground after Nucor said orders had improved over recent weeks, helping it to project a narrower quarterly loss than expected.But Nucor was the only one to hold onto gains amid the sell-off and the shares closed 2.4 per cent up at $46.86.The benchmark S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed 1.3 per cent down at 911.97, and 8,504.67 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index lost 1.1 per cent to 1,796.18.“The market is rtrying to figure out right now whether this is some sort of correction that is building or if it is just a break in an extended recovery,” said Larry Coates, chief executive of Oak Value Capital Management.The rising price of commodities, and especially oil, was shown to have pushed inflation up in May as the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 per cent from April.But this was much more moderate than analysts had predicted, easing fears that inflation could hamper stocks later in the year.There was also a boost from figures showing that builders started work on many more homes in May than expected.But some analysts warned the headline figures on housing starts hid worrying trends.“Inventories remain high, and builders seem to be building to compete with cheap foreclosed houses, which will keep the pressure on prices,” said Brett Hryb, portfolio manager with MFC Global Investment Management.The positive effect of the economic data was further tempered by figures showing industrial production in May fell more than analysts had predicted.Healthcare was one of the few sectors to enjoy a positive day as investors bet President Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms would have to be scaled back after the Congressional Budget Office said the current plan would leave 30m Americans uninsured.Health insurers have suffered on the White House plans, which include scaling back subsidies for those companies. But as the proposals came under attack, major insurers gained.Aetna rose 4.7 per cent to $23.58 and Coventry Health climbed 3.5 per cent to $16.71.The sector was further boosted by Amgen, the biotechnology company, whose shares climbed 3.6 per cent to $51.21 after they were upgraded by Sanford Bernstein. The broker said revenues and earnings should re-accelerate over the year.Citigroup dropped 3.6 per cent to $3.25 after Vikram Pandit, the chief executive, said companies would have to look elsewhere than American consumption for growth drivers as the US adjusts to slower growth and less credit.AT&T dropped 1.7 per cent to $24.22 meanwhile after its shares were downgraded by Barclays Capital, which said continuing high unemployment would make growth difficult.
286;TGT;Target Corp;2009-06-11T20:37:57Z;Wall St adds to gains as oil prices surge;;US stocks closed at their highest level of the year on Thursday as the surging price of oil boosted energy stocks, which added to the impetus created by fresh data suggesting that the recession is abating.The figures showed that, since January, the fewest number of people claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, well below what analysts had forecast.Meanwhile, the climbing price of oil drove energy companies higher. Chevron gained 2.4 per cent to $71.90 while Schlumberger rose 4.9 per cent to $62.18.This helped markets open higher, and they extended the gains after an auction of 30-year Treasury notes was well received, easing fears that rising interest rates could start to hurt the US consumer.They dipped shortly before the close, but the benchmark S&P 500 index was still able to finish 0.6 per cent higher at 944.89, the highest closing price since November last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.4 per cent to 8,770.92 and the Nasdaq Composite index also rose 0.5 per cent to 1,862.37.“Jobless claims are moving in the right direction, although we don’t know if we’ve seen the effect of the automotive plant shutdowns yet,” said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial.Consumer staples received a boost from indications that retail sales rebounded in May following April’s surprise fall.Defensive stocks in household name consumer companies did well. Philip Morris gained 0.8 per cent to $43.88, while Coca-Cola climbed 1.2 per cent to $48.58.But economists warned the numbers were not as good as the headline figures suggested, with much of the rise coming on the back of escalating fuel prices.“Given the government’s large fiscal stimulus we would have hoped that maybe sales would have been even higher,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “But they have been kept lower by the sharp rise in the price of gasoline.” Retail stocks remained suppressed on the back of similar analysis from a number of experts. Target fell 2 per cent to $39.55 while Kohl’s declined 1.9 per cent to $45.92.Bank of America was one of the strongest performers in the financial sector after it was upgraded by analysts at KBW, who said the bank’s balance sheet was much stronger after its recent capital raising.Shares in the bank, whose chief executive Ken Lewis addressed Congress on Thursday morning on the details of the takeover of Merrill Lynch last year, advanced 8.3 per cent to $12.97.Two of the country’s largest regional banks also did well after being upgraded by Goldman Sachs, which saw relative value in the shares of Regions Financial and Fifth Third. Regions jumped 9.3 per cent to $4.37, while Fifth Third gained 5.9 per cent to $7.77.Elsewhere in the financial sector, BlackRock confirmed its $13bn purchase of Barclays Global Investors to create the world’s biggest money manager. Early reports of the deal have sent BlackRock’s shares up nearly 10 per cent this week, and they rose 2.3 per cent on Thursday to $182.60.Homebuilders suffered after news that the number of foreclosures in May was the third highest on record, dousing hopes that the housing market could be set for a swift recovery.Three of the largest US homebuilders fell sharply. Centex lost 5.4 per cent to $8.52, KB Home dropped 2.9 per cent to $14.45 and Pulte Homes gave up 5.7 per cent to $8.87.But steelmakers built on the week’s stellar gains as the price of steel continued to rise and the dollar continued to fall. US Steel picked up 4.2 per cent to $41.83 and AK Steel rose 5.2 per cent to $21.14.The battle for supremacy in the smartphone market took a new turn as Palm, which launched its Pre phone last weekend, appointed Jim Rubinstein, who helped develop the iMac and iPod at Apple, as chief executive. Palm’s shares climbed 12 per cent to $13.43 on the news.UnitedHealth was one of the S&P’s heaviest fallers, however, after Oppenheimer warned that the health insurer’s aggressive bids for Medicare contracts could hurt profit margins in 2010. Its shares lost 6.5 per cent to $24.05.
287;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-26T20:45:08Z;Wall St recovers on boost in confidence;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as figures showed that consumer confidence improved much more than expected in May.That erased early concerns about the impact of North Korean nuclear tests and a record fall in house prices.The rise in consumer sentiment, which was the biggest since 2003, saw consumer discretionary stocks jump 2 per cent almost immediately.Home improvement retailers Lowe’s and Home Depot performed strongly, gaining 3.5 per cent to $20.04 and 4.1 per cent to $23.80 respectively. Best Buy, the electronic goods retailer, also saw impressive gains, picking up 5.3 per cent to $37.05.That helped the benchmark S&P 500 index gain 2.6 per cent to 910.33, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.4 per cent to 8,473.49 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 3.5 per cent to 1,750.43.Some economists, however, warned that the rise in confidence might not translate into a rise in spending.“Part of the rebound in confidence is a result of the rebound in equities, so there may be some circularity there,” warned Paul Dales, USA economist at Capital Economics.“Also, we may be seeing a step change here where spending does not necessarily increase with confidence. Job losses and falling house prices may mean people simply don’t have the money.”Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, agreed. “A lot of investors’ ambitions are going to be dashed pretty soon, but for now the market wants to go higher. It seems to be setting itself up for a fall though,” he said.But in the immediate aftermath of the figures, investors were enthused.The figures also helped the technology sector, providing a particular boost to consumer-focused companies. Apple was the strongest riser, having been given an earlier fillip after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company, saying the iPhone will see its profits beat estimates for the next two years. The shares picked up 6.8 per cent to $130.78.Its rival Microsoft climbed 3 per cent to $20.34, while Google, which is also exposed to the consumer because of its reliance on advertisers for revenue, rose 2.8 per cent to $404.36.The gains came in spite of geo-political concerns over the repercussions of North Korea’s missile test, which took their toll on oil prices in early trade. That in turn knocked shares in energy companies.But both oil and energy stocks rebounded amid the economic optimism. Chevron advanced 1.9 per cent to $65.66 while Exxon Mobil rose 1.4 per cent to $69.81.Meanwhile figures showed that US house prices dropped at a record pace during the first quarter of this year, and fell nearly 20 per cent in March from the same period last year. That kept financials down during the morning, but they too felt the effect of the consumer confidence data.Citigroup closed 2.7 per cent up at $3.77 while JPMorgan gained 6.2 per cent to $36.54.Telecommunications companies also saw gains after QWest was raised to “overweight” by JPMorgan, which said the company had seen relatively strong sales with business clients. The shares rose 8 per cent to $4.33.Target edged higher as the battle between its board and William Ackman, the activist investor, continued. Barron’s, the investment magazine, questioned Mr Ackman’s plan to place the retailer’s properties into a trust and lease them back, and the shares gained 0.6 per cent to $41.General Motors saw a turbulent day’s trade ahead of the midnight deadline the company has set for its debt holders to accept the terms of its proposed debt-for-equity swap.The bondholders are widely expected to reject the deal, which caused the stock to fall in early trade.But they spiked over 40 per cent in the afternoon on the news that the United Auto Workers union has agreed to cut the payment of stock to a UAW healthcare trust by 55 per cent, giving GM more to spread among creditors.They then fell back again as investors realised there would almost certainly be no agreement between the bondholders and the company. They finally closed 0.7 per cent higher at $1.44.“It’s a peculiar trade now,” said Mr Wilkinson. “If GM files for bankruptcy the shares are worthless.”
288;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-21T02:37:21Z;BofA capital raising lifts mood on Wall Street;;US stocks rebounded on Wednesday morning following moderate losses during the previous session as investors welcomed the news that Bank of America has successfully raised $13.5bn in recent days through issuing new stock.The bank’s shares fell overnight on reports that it was offering an extra 825m shares at $10 each, but rose again in early trade after the company said it had been successful in selling a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last Friday. This will go towards making up the $33.9bn in extra capital the government has asked the company to raise following the stress tests on bank balance sheets. After half an hour of trade, the stock was up 8 per cent at $12.15.Other banking stocks also performed well. Citigroup climbed 4 per cent to $3.92 while JPMorgan advanced 1.7 per cent to $36.40.PNC, meanwhile, rose 0.4 per cent to $43.44 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money, but would do so “over the next couple of years”. This came in contrast to moves from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days to pay back the government as soon as possible.But Wall Street was less encouraged by the news that Regions Financial wanted to raise $1.25bn through offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s tests. Investors worried about stock dilution and the shares fell 3.8 per cent to $5.04.Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global warned the stellar rises seen in financial stocks since the rally began in March might not last. “The bank shares have lost a catalyst to rally near term as news on TARP repayment may not be known until June 8, and the credit card bill of rights is likely to become law and create a headwind to profits,” he wrote.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.6 per cent to 92251 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,576.56 points and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.5 per cent to 1,760.7 points.The markets were also supported by energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel. In early trade, US crude was $1.61 higher at $61.26 per barrel. Shares in Chevron gained 1.4 per cent to $66.80 while Exxon Mobil picked up 0.9 per cent to $71.12.Hewlett Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after it reported earnings that were in line with analysts’ estimates. Its shares fell in early trade, losing 3.7 per cent to $35.22 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below what Wall Street is currently expecting.Its rival Dell also suffered the effect of the negative outlook for the computer sales industry, and its shares fell 0.4 per cent to $11.51.But chip manufacturers lent strength to technology stocks after Analog Devices beat Wall Street’s estimates with its quarterly profits, and said it would also make more profit for the full year than currently predicted. The company said there had been strength in sales to telecoms infrastructure customers, and its shares jumped 13.5 per cent to $23.35.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 9.2 per cent to $13.55 and 7.9 per cent to $4.74 respectively.Wall Street was also watching for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJ’s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits.Target’s shares gained 4.6 per cent to $43.85 after it made $0.69 in earnings per share on the back of tight cost controls and a profitabkle credit card business. Consensus estimates were for $0.60.BJ’s beat analysts’ predictions with its profits and raised its full-year profit outlook as consumers looked to cut costs by buying staples at wholesale prices. But the shares slipped 1 per cent to $37.70 as the company said it expected second quarter sales to fall.Procter & Gamble added to confidence over future consumer behaviour after Barclays upgraded the company, saying its sales stood to recover as and when the economy improved. The shares rose 2.4 per cent to $54.23.This gave some relief to the sector after figures released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell last week.Meanwhile Deere & Co, which makes agricultural equipment, lost ground despite beating analysts’ expectations with its second quarter profits, after the company was forced to lower its full-year profit outlook as construction sales continue to drop. The shares were 4.9 per cent down at $45.96.European stocks were up early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was edged 0.1 per cent higher to 872.63 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, as the FTSE Asia-Pacific index gained 0.5 per cent to 189.19 points.Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 0.867 per cent while that on the 10-year Treasury note was flat at 2.243 per cent.The dollar continued to fall against major currencies early in New York, losing 1 per cent against the euro to $1.3766.Gold was trading $1.43 higher at $938.24 per troy ounce.
289;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-20T22:58:35Z;Target misses the mark;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Wednesday underlined how far it has slipped behind its larger rival Wal-Mart in the recessionary economy, which has fuelled its fierce proxy battle over board seats with Bill Ackman, the activist investor.The retailer said comparable sales at its 1,700 US stores fell by 3.7 per cent during the first quarter, compared with the 3.6 per cent increase reported by Wal-Mart’s 3,600 US stores last week.The results mark the fifth consecutive quarter in which Target’s sales growth has trailed Wal-Mart, starting in the winter of 2007 as the economy weakened. For the previous four years, Target’s sales growth regularly outperformed its rival.In another sign of the reversal of fortunes, Target also reported flat gross profit margins, as the mix of products its customers bought included a greater proportion of less profitable food, beauty and pharmacy items.Wal-Mart, in contrast, reported an improvement of 52 basis points in its profit margins as a result of selling more discretionary goods, such as clothing, electronics and home furnishings – categories in which Target outperformed Wal-Mart before the recession.Target argued on Wednesday that it was not losing customers to Wal-Mart or anyone else. Kathy Tesija, head of merchandising, said most of the declines in its business came from its most prosperous customers, who were making fewer discretionary spending trips, rather than spending money elsewhere.She said the company was continuing to focus on expanding food offerings – one of the areas highlighted in the campaign waged by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management – including introducing small fresh-food selections at up to 100 stores by the end of the year.Target’s net quarterly income fell 13 per cent to $522m, or 69 cents a share, a smaller decline than expected, sending its shares up more than 3 per cent.Its revenues were flat at about $14.8bn.It also said its credit card portfolio made a profit during the quarter and had outperformed larger credit card businesses – another area where its strategy has been criticised by Pershing.Mr Ackman is challenging the re-election of four Target directors at the annual meeting on May 28. On Tuesday, Risk­Metrics, the leading US proxy advisory service, recommended voting for two of Pershing’s candidates – Mr Ackman and Jim Donald, the ex-chief of Starbucks.
290;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-20T21:31:11Z;Target;;"Tactics without strategy, however clever, are merely the noise before defeat. So old Sun Tzu would not favour William Ackman’s approach to his battle with retailer Target. The activist investor’s hedge fund, Pershing Square, may succeed in getting some of the five independent directors it supports elected in next week’s shareholder vote. But while moderate improvements to corporate governance would be welcome, it is hard to see great gains from such a victory.Pershing – which owns 3 per cent of Target outright and has the right to buy another 5 per cent via $280m worth of long-dated call options – initially proposed a novel property transaction last year. Like peers, Target owns 85 per cent of its stores, and the land underneath them could be spun out separately into a tax-efficient real estate investment trust. However, the value of a big-box retail portfolio is intrinsically bound up with the health of its occupier, and a solid capital structure aids expansion. Equity investors should treat schemes to extract “hidden” value with scepticism.Changing course, Pershing has now decided that the composition of the board requires improvement. Here it is on firmer ground. Target’s independent board members average nine years tenure each, and could perhaps own more stock. Risk Metrics and Proxy Governance, two advisers to institutional shareholders, partially support the injection of new blood.But directors should not be swapped around for the sake of it when Target’s executives and strategy are generally respected. Sure, it has performed less well in the downturn than competitor Wal-Mart, but two years ago Target was applauded for its skill in persuading consumers to buy higher-margin products. And Pershing itself is not advocating strategic change. If successful in merely destabilising the boardroom, a victory for Pershing next week will be pyrrhic indeed.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

292;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-20T20:30:06Z;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."
293;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-20T18:58:24Z;Ackman sets his critical sights on Target;;Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has made unfavourable comparisons between discount retailer Target and its larger rival Wal-Mart a central plank of his campaign to win board seats at the former.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square fund has nominated five candidates for the board of Target, which he has blamed for losing ground to Wal-Mart.But before the economy began to weaken in the winter of 2007, the comparisons were reversed – with Target, rather than Wal-Mart, hailed as the favourite of analysts and investors, and sales that consistently outperformed its larger rival.Target’s stores were neat and clean, and it offered “cheap chic” fashion from Isaac Mizrahi and homeware designer Michael Graves. Its “expect more, pay less” motto contrasted with Wal-Mart’s dated “always low prices” mantra. Its advertising, and sponsorship of education and arts events, made its red and white bull’s-eye symbol – and its mascot white bull terrier – one of the best known corporate logos in American.Wal-Mart was then struggling to persuade more affluent shoppers to buy more than just low cost groceries and other basics.But as the economic climate deteriorated in late 2007, Target’s comparable sales growth fell below those of Wal-Mart, as customers sought out Wal-Mart’s low-cost basics, and shifted their spending away from discretionary purchases. Profits from its credit card business declined, and delinquencies increased.But while he has highlighted the reversal of the two retailers’ roles, Mr Ackman has consistently avoided criticising Target’s management. RiskMetrics, the proxy advisory service that on Tuesday recommended that Target shareholders vote for Mr Ackman and his ally Jim Donald, noted that Target’s management “appears to be universally respected”.Even in the recession, Target’s sales have also fared better than other rivals, including Sears Holdings, JC Penney and Kohl’s, the low price department stores. Over the past five years its shares have marginally outperformed Wal-Mart, while both are well ahead of the S&P 500 index.Given what RiskMetrics called the “atypical” attack on functioning company, some of Target’s supporters express surprise at the support Mr Ackman has garnered. John Pound, an activist retail investor who has publicly lent his support to Target’s management in the proxy fight, says he is “frankly astonished that [the campaign] has got the traction that it has”.But Target may also be paying the price of what Mr Ackman and others have suggested is “arrogance” and a degree of insularity. Bob Ulrich, the CEO who handed over to Gregg Steinhafel last year after 14 years at the top, was a reserved character who shunned contacts with the media and investors in favour of focusing on his customers. The company rarely attends the investor conferences. Meanwhile Wal-Mart has increasingly recruited top executives from outside the company, Target’s top managers are all company veterans.Whatever the result of the proxy battle, Target’s biggest challenge will be regarding ground lost to Wal-Mart, which boasted this month of picking up more customers earning more than $50,000 a year – Target’s core demographic. Wal-Mart has also been modernising its merchandising and marketing, under its new “save money, live better” slogan.
294;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Fresh support for Ackman in Target battle;;"Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has scored another victory in his battle to win seats on the board of Target, the discount retailer, after winning support from RiskMetrics, the leading US proxy adviser.RiskMetrics recommended on Tuesday that clients vote for Mr Ackman and Jim Donald, the former chief executive of the coffee chain Starbucks, in board elections at Target’s annual meeting on May 28, where four members are up for re-election.But Glass Lewis, another leading proxy adviser, said it was endorsing Target’s four nominees.Target said it was “disappointed” with RiskMetrics’ opinion. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said in a statement: “We believe RiskMetrics reached the wrong conclusion …We urge Target shareholders not to cast their votes solely on the basis of RiskMetrics’ report and to undertake their own analysis.”D. F. King, the proxy solicitor working for Pershing Square, estimated that more than 40 per cent of Target’s institutional shareholders vote their shares with reference to RiskMetrics.RiskMetrics called the proxy battle “atypical”, given the experience of both sets of board nominees, and the fact its management “appears to be universally respected”. “Unlike the majority of other contests, the object of the dissident’s campaign is not a ‘broken’ company,” it said. But it argued Target’s board would “benefit from new blood and incentives to ensure the company is able to quickly capitalise on future opportunities”.It also highlighted Mr Ackman’s criticism of the low level of Target shares held by its board, and lengthening board tenures.It cited Mr Donald’s food retailing experience and Mr Ackman’s track record as an investor in endorsing them, but did not support the other three candidates nominated by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square fund.In backing Target’s slate, Glass Lewis said it believed Mr Ackman remained focused on proposed real estate transactions that the board had rejected.It also raised Mr Donald’s troubles at Starbucks and questioned whether he was more suited to the board than Target’s nominee, Mary Dillon, McDonald’s global chief marketing officer.Other board members up for re-election are: Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo; George Tamke, a private equity investor; and Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of Telstra.Proxy Governance, a third adviser, last week recommended shareholders vote for two of Mr Ackman’s candidates: Mr Donald and Michael Ashner, a real estate executive."
295;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-14T23:05:08Z;Target’s rebel investors win proxy support;;"Target, the US discount retailer, has suffered a setback in its efforts to stave off a challenge to its board by activist investor Bill Ackman, after a leading proxy advisory services endorsed two of the dissident candidates.Proxy Governance recommended that its clients vote for two of the five nominees supported by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square funds – Jim Donald, the former chief executive of Starbucks, and Michael Ashner, a real estate executive.It also advocated voting against Target’s proposal to reduce the size of its board from 13 to 12 members. Since shareholders have to choose between two competing proxy ballot cards, it argued that they should only return the Pershing Square card, in effect withholding votes from Target’s four nominees for re-election.Target has proposed the re-election of Mary Dillon, chief global marketing officer of McDonald’s; Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo; Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of Telstra; and George Tamke, a private equity executive.Target has accused Mr Ackman of launching a proxy campaign for board seats in order to advance what it calls his “risky” real estate restructuring proposals that the Target board rejected last year.Mr Ackman’s proxy battle has unusually focused not on the performance of Target’s management, which he has repeatedly commended, but on the make-up of the board, accusing it of being “isolated” and insufficiently independent.Proxy Governance’s recommendations suggest that Mr Ackman’s focus on the composition, expertise and length of incumbency of the existing board has been effective.“The real strength in the dissident campaign…lies in the nominees,” the firm said, arguing that their professional experience “seem to be under-represented in the board as currently composed”.“We believe that Jim Donald, with retail grocery experience, and Michael Ashner, with commercial real estate experience, would add meaningfully to the board’s ability to assess and meet emerging strategic challenges in these two aspects of the company’s operations,” it added.Target said it was disappointed by the recommendation but highlighted positive comments made by Proxy Governance about its existing board. It also drew attention to the recommendation of a smaller proxy advisory firm, Egan-Jones, that had recommended supporting two of the four sitting board members up for re-election, and none of Pershing’s candidates.“We are pleased that ProxyGovernance recognises the vision and nerve of the Target board of directors in its report and we welcome the support of Egan-Jones,” a spokesman said.RiskMetrics, another leading US proxy advisory firm, has yet to give its opinion on the contest and held an open forum for the two sides on Thursday. During the event, Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, repeated the retailer’s view that a change in the board was not necessary, “nor in the best interest of our shareholders”.Target’s shareholders are due to vote on the board at the company’s annual meeting on May 28."
296;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-14T03:55:31Z;Poor retail data fuel Wall St mood;;US equities tumbled on Wednesday morning as figures showing retail sales unexpectedly fell in April dented hopes that the economy had stopped its decline.Sales fell 0.4 per cent for the month, against expectations that they would remain flat. The non-essential consumer sector, which has fallen over the week as investors position themselves more defensively, continued to drop, losing ??? per cent in early trade.This spoiled what might otherwise have been a good morning for consumer stocks after two major companies reported better than expected earnings.Macy’s, the department store chain, made a first quarter loss, but it was narrower than estimates had suggested. Its shares were up in early pre-market trade, but fell back after the release of the retail sales data. After half an hour of trading, its shares were 5.7 per cent lower at $11.65.Fellow retail giants Target and Loweâ€™s also fell, losing 3.6 per cent to $41.01 and 2.8 per cent to $18.70 respectively.Dr Pepper Snapple managed to hold on to early gains however after it made much more than the market had expected, despite net sales falling. It also raised its outlook for 2009 earnings, helping to send its shares up 5.3 per cent to $22.38.The economic gloom weighed on the market as a whole. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent to 892.05 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.7 per cent to 8322.56 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1.8 per cent to 1684.63 points.“April’s US retail sales figures are yet another illustration that, although the worst is now over, there is still no evidence of an actual recovery. The 0.4 per cent month-on-month fall in sales confirms our view that the rises in January and February were due to the one-off boost to incomes that has now run its course,” wrote Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.The banking sector was another early faller after BB&T became the latest company to complete a stock sale following the results of the government’s stress tests on bank balance sheets.The bank sold 75m shares at $20 each, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of $22.50. It was not one of those named as needing more capital by the government, but followed several of its rivals in going to the market to take advantage of the relatively bullish mood on Wall Street. Its shares lost 8.4 per cent to $20.61.Other banks also slipped in early trade as investors continued to take profits following their recent run up. Fifth Third lost 8.4 per cent to $7.54 while Bank of America gave up 4.8 per cent to $11.67.The financial sector also felt the impact of figures showing that mortgage applications fell more than 8 per cent during the week ending May 8. There were some encouraging signs however in the rising number of new mortgage applications as compared with refinancing activity, as well as in words from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secrtary, who said he saw “welcome signs” in the housing market.Chip manufacturers rose overnight after Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said that orders and billing patterns were “slightly better than expected” so far during the second quarter. The company’s shares picked up 0.2 per cent to $15.24.This helped the company’s shares overcome the effect of a record $1.5bn fine imposed by the EU on the company for abusing its dominant market position. Advanced Micro Devices, the company Intel was accused of squeezing out of the market, gained 2.5 per cent to $4.46.But other rivals lost the ground initially gained on the back of Mr Otellini’s words after the retail data showed sales of electronic goods and appliances fared worse than most sectors, falling 2.8 per cent lat month.Applied Materials had seen gains despite reporting a heavier first quarter loss than expected as sales dropped to their lowest levels in seven years, with one unnamed buyer had slashed its order from $1.9bn to $250m. But after the data, the shares fell in pre-market trade, and continued to do so after the opening bell, dropping 4.1 per cent to $11.01.Healthcare stocks were rare winners during the morning, continuing recent gains as investors positioned themselves more defensively, reflecting the likelihood that the recession will continue for some time. Pfizer rose 3.4 per cent to $15.44 while Merck and Schering-Plough, prospective merger partners, gained 4.4 per cent to $26.08 and 2.5 per cent to $23.63 respectively.Frontier Communications, which specialises in delivering telephone services to rural communities, fell after agreeing to buy a chunk of Verizon’s wireline business for $8.6bn, which would triple its business. Its shares fell 0.3 per cent to $7.55, while Verizon climbed 0.5 per cent to $30.54.MGM, the casino operator, became the latest company to go to the equity markets for funding as it seeks to restructure $14bn worth of debt. The company said it would sell $2.5bn in stocks and bonds, and its shares slumped 17.9 per cent to $10.18.But Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global said the recent equity raising activity was actually a good sign for the market. “Corporate issuance is heavy which is favourable for balance sheet health and the investment grade and high yield markets are holding firm,” he wrote.European stocks were lower early on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 100 index was down 2 per cent to 835.55 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by the Shanghai Composite index, which rose 1.7 per cent to a nine-month high of 2,663.766 points.Bond yields were down, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling 1 basis point to 0.875 per cent and that on the 10-year note dropping 5bp to 3.125 per cent.The dollar was firmer against major currencies early in New York, gaining 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.51.Gold was trading $0.44 higher at $927.34 per troy ounce.Oil prices were up early in New York. US crude prices were $0.34 lower at $58.51 a barrel.
297;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-13T20:42:29Z;Wall Street falls 3% on weak retail data;;US equities tumbled on Wednesday as figures showing retail sales unexpectedly fell in April dented hopes that the economy had stopped its decline.The “non-essential” consumer sector, which has fallen over the week as investors position themselves more defensively, continued to drop, losing 3.2 per cent overall.This spoiled what might otherwise have been a good day for consumer stocks after two leading companies reported better-than-expected earnings.Macy’s, the department store chain, posted a first-quarter loss, but it was narrower than estimates had suggested.Its shares were up in pre-market trade but retreated after the release of the retail sales data. They closed 6.7 per cent lower at $11.52.Fellow retail giants Target and Lowe’s also dropped, losing 4.8 per cent to $40.47 and 1.6 per cent to $18.92 respectively.Office Depot was a particularly heavy faller, affected also by a downgrade of its debt by Moody’s. The shares slumped 15 per cent to $3.06.Dr Pepper Snapple held on to early gains after it made much more than the market had expected, in spite of net sales falling.The company also raised its outlook for 2009 earnings, helping to send its shares up 3.8 per cent to $22.07.The economic gloom weighed on the market as a whole. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 2.7 per cent to 883.92 points. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.2 per cent to 8,284.89 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 3 per cent to 1,664.19 points.“January and February’s good consumer figures came after a boost from the one-off rises in income from Social Security rebates,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics.“The downward pressure on consumers is enough to make retail sales continue to fall in the next few months, although not as sharply as at the end of last year.”The banking sector was another faller after BB&T became the latest bank to complete a stock sale following the results of the US government’s stress tests.The bank sold 75m shares at $20 each, a discount to Tuesday’s closing price of $22.50. Its shares lost 4.4 per cent to $21.50.Other banks also fell as investors continued to take profits following their recent run higher. Fifth Third lost 14.7 per cent to $7.02 while Bank of America gave up 10.2 per cent to $11.01.“I can’t see any reason to hold financial stocks right now,” said Harry Rady, chief executive of Rady Asset Management. “There’s no way to know what is on the banks’ balance sheets yet.”The financial sector also felt the impact of figures showing that mortgage applications fell more than 8 per cent during the week ending May 8.There were some encouraging signs, however, in the rising number of new mortgage applications as compared with refinancing activity, as well as in comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, who said he saw “welcome signs” in the housing market.Chip manufacturers rose overnight after Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said that orders and billing patterns were “slightly better than expected” so far during the second quarter.This helped the company overcome the effect of being given a record $1.5bn fine by the European Union for abusing its dominant market position, and its shares avoided the worst of the selling, falling a relatively modest 0.5 per cent to $15.13.Advanced Micro Devices, the company Intel was accused of squeezing out of the market, gained 0.7 per cent to $4.38.Rival chip manufacturer Applied Materials had seen overnight gains on Mr Otellini’s comments despite reporting a heavier first-quarter loss than expected as sales dropped to their lowest levels in seven years. But the shares fell 4.3 per cent to $10.99 after the retail data, which showed that sales of electronic goods and appliances fared worse than most sectors, falling 2.8 per cent last month.Healthcare stocks were rare winners, maintaining recent momentum as investors positioned themselves defensively on signs the recession would continue for some time.Pfizer gained 2.3 per cent to $15.27, while Merckand Schering-Plough, which are due to merge, rose 2.8 per cent to $25.67 and 1.5 per cent to $23.40 respectively.
298;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-11T15:30:23Z;Wall Street set to open lower;;US stocks opened lower on Monday, giving back some of the gains made during last week, which took the benchmark S&P 500 close to its high for the year.Investors remained focused on financial stocks after three companies said they would look to raise capital in order to pay off government bailout funds.The results of last week’s stress tests had revealed that Capital One, BB&T and US Bancorp would not need new capital to survive the government’s adverse economic scenario. But the companies announced on Monday they would offer $1.5bn or more in stock to free themselves from government restrictions.All three fell in early trade on the prospect of unexpected shareholder dilution. Capital One gave up 9.4 per cent to $28.39, while BB&T lost 4.3 per cent to $25.19 and US Bancorp dropped 4.2 per cent to $19.68.Other banking stocks also lost ground after last week’s impressive gains, even though reports over the weekend showed the banks may need even less capital than announced by the government if their earnings remain strong.Wells Fargo said it could fill its remaining $13.7bn deficit by earnings alone by November, having taken $7.5bn from a public offering on Friday, which was more than expected. But its shares fell amid the wider profit-taking, losing 2.6 per cent to $27.45.Even Morgan Stanley, which also successfully raised capital from a stock offering on Friday, and which was upgraded by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Monday, lost ground. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent to $26.91 even as Bank of America said the company’s shares would do well on “long-term earnings power”.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported its worst quarterly loss in at least two decades as the company looked to regain losses after buying shares in energy producer ConocoPhillips shortly before the price of oil crashed. Its shares lost 2.1 per cent to $93,300.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 1.8 per cent to 912.39 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.4 per cent to 8,451.35 points. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1 per cent to 1,721.08 points.“The rally in the financials is stretched, but players are gaining exposure believing the banks are solvent and capital needs will be met. We believe the market is ahead of itself,” wrote Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global Research.CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services company, was the S&P’s biggest faller in early trade after the company was downgraded by Goldman Sachs to “sell”. Its shares slumped 12.1 per cent to $8.24.General Motors was another heavy faller after Swedish news agency TT said the company was currently considering two bidders for its Saab unit. This followed reports last week from Reuters that the struggling car maker was running due diligence on 10 bidders. Its shares gave up 5.6 per cent to $1.52.Energy producers lost ground as the price of oil fell back following its recent rally, during which it reached new highs for the year. Oil was trading $0.96 lower at $57.67 per barrel of US crude early on Wall Street, while Chevron lost 2.9 per cent to $68.36 and Exxon Mobil dropped 1.7 per cent to $69.18.Intel rose ahead of the European Union’s decision on whether to approve action against the company after a decade-long investigation into allegations that it abused its dominant market position to force out its main competitor from the market. Lawyers predicted any potential fine could be one of the heaviest ever implemented in Europe, but the stock edged 0.6 per cent upwards to $15.38.Elsewhere in the sector Microsoft slid 0.6 per cent to $19.31 after the company that it would sell debt in order to take advantage of its rare triple-AAA credit rating. The company has resisted taking on debt for years.Target slipped slightly ahead of an impending shareholder meeting at which Bill Ackman, the billionaire activist investor, was due to call for the replacement of several board members, saying they do not have relevant expertise to compete with rival retailer Wal-Mart. Its shares declined 2.4 per cent to $42.76.Investors responded negatively to News Corp’s plan to charge users of the Wall Street Journal’s website by the article. The “micro-payments” system would mark a change from current subscription models, but investors avoided the stock on Monday, sending it 2.4 per cent lower to $9.43.European stocks were down early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index faling 1.6 per cent to 852.17 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 0.2 per cent rise in the Nikkei to a on a six-month closing high of 9,451.98 points.Bond yields were down. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell 6 basis points to 0.923 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note slid 8bp to 3.206 per cent.The dollar rebounded from a four-month low against major currencies early in New York. It rose 0.8 per cent against the pound to $1.51.Gold was trading $0.38 lower at $913.28 per troy ounce.
299;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Tough talking is order of the day;;Bill Ackman, the activist hedge fund investor, is not known for specialising in the art of subtlety. If his unsuccessful attempts to wrangle Target into submission can be used as a gauge, that will continue to be the case.Mr Ackman’s struggles with Target, the stylish discount US retailer and Wal-Mart competitor, started in 2007 with an effort to convince Target to sell its credit card business.Nine months of talks with Target management prompted a sale of less than half of Target’s credit card receivables, which Mr Ackman found only half-satisfying.“We’re usually pretty convincing,” he says in an interview with the Financial Times.“The mistake we made is that we didn’t go public with our views on the credit card business. We made a presentation and then kept quiet. By the time they announced their deal it was too late.”Not wanting to make that mistake twice, Mr Ackman began to agitate publicly for Target to spin off its real estate assets. Now, two years after his initial investment, he is trying to elect five nominees – including himself – to Target’s board of directors.Activist investors tend to avoid proxy battles with America’s largest companies due to the sheer cost of printing and mailing millions of pieces of paper to a giant shareholder base.Mr Ackman says his sizeable position in Target helps justify the $15m he expects to spend on the effort.His Pershing Square hedge fund owns roughly $1bn in Target common stock and options on another $280m, making Target its largest single investment. Pershing Square IV, a co-investment fund, consists entirely of call options on Target stock and was down 93 per cent at its lowest point.Mr Ackman would like to improve that record and do well by his investors – but that is not his only goal.“The other agenda I have here is fixing corporate elections,” he said. “It’s an embarrassment. You get a slate – it’s hand-picked by the existing board, and you can vote for them or not.”Mr Ackman believes Target’s board lacks retailing and credit card experts, and is positioning his nominees like a force of superheroes, each with their own special knack. There’s a credit card expert, a real estate magnate, a food retailing expert and a corporate governance academic. Mr Ackman, for his part, represents “shareholder rights”.The Target board members up for re-election are hardly inexperienced, however. They include Richard Kovacevich, the chairman of Wells Fargo, and Mary Dillon, chief marketing officer at McDonald’s.The likelihood of success for both parties could come down to the opinions of proxy advisory firms, which are preparing to weigh in on the issue within the next week or two.“I guarantee you that every S&P 500 company, after this proxy contest, is going to take a look at their board,” Mr Ackman predicts. “If they’ve got people who have been there for 15 years without relevant business experience, flying in from Australia, they’re going to ask whether those people should continue to serve.“It’s going to lead to better boards – no question in my mind.”Activist shareholders have taken a pummelling recently, as hedge funds have dried up and the tactics they most commonly employ – requesting stock buybacks, dividend issuances and asset sales – have grown irrational in the current markets.But Mr Ackman questions the notion that his timing is bad.“It’s sort of like President Bush saying ‘I know my second term is up, but I think it’s really inappropriate for anyone to run against me because there’s a lot going on’.”
300;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-10T21:30:33Z;Ackman steps up Target seat battle;;"Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund investor, will on Monday step up his campaign to win seats on the board of Target, the discount retailer, in one of the largest and most expensive proxy battles in US corporate history.Unusually, the battle over one of America’s best-known store chains is focused on the quality and composition of the incumbent board, rather than management performance.At an open meeting for investors in New York, Mr Ackman will argue that a lack of relevant expertise among independent board members has contributed to Target’s underperforming its larger rival Wal-Mart during the current recession.“This is not a poorly managed company,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “This is really just about improving the board.”Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square funds control 7.8 per cent of Target shares, is also highlighting the length of the incumbency of board members. Three of the four Target directors are up for re-election, having served a decade or more. Solomon TrujIllo, outgoing chief executive of Telstra, has been on Target’s board for 15 years.“Is he the single best person that should be renewed for another three years? But they put him up anyway because they’ve been friends for years and they don’t want to say, ‘It’s time for you to step off’,” Mr Ackman said.Target has about 1,700 stores across the US and is roughly three times the size by market capitalisation of Heinz, the food group at which Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, won a bitter proxy contest in 2006.Mr Ackman says he expects his contest to cost Pershing Square about $15m. Each time information has been sent out to shareholders it has cost $1.6m.Pershing Square is pressing shareholders to elect to Target’s board Mr Ackman and four others: Jim Donald, former Starbucks chief; Richard Vague, co-founder of First USA bank; Michael Ashner, a real estate executive; and Ron Gilson, an academic who specialises in corporate governance.Mr Ackman, who has waged shareholder campaigns at McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and at Ceridian, the payroll processing group, took a stake in Target two years ago. Last year the company rejected his proposals to restructure its real estate holdings.Target has told its shareholders it believes Pershing Square is attacking its board “in an effort to divert attention from [its] risky real estate agenda”."
301;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-08T00:02:08Z;US retailers have cause to raise earnings call;;More than a dozen US retailers raised their earnings guidance on Thursday, after releasing April sales data that showed battered US shoppers displaying renewed interest in purchases of clothing and other discretionary items, while continuing to frequent low-cost stores.Companies raising guidance included the three largest US department store chains – JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s – as well as Target, the mass discounter.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said its overall index for April showed a 1.5 per cent increase, supported in part by sales around Easter, which fell in March last year.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics said the figures were better than expected and had been “aided by rising consumer confidence from improving market performance” as well as extra cash from lower tax payments and mortgage refinancing.Janet Hoffman, managing partner of Accenture’s North American retail practice, said “the overall picture is for a baby step towards [a] positive [environment]”.“I think we are definitely on the path towards moving out of the depth of the underperformance in consumer-facing retail,” she said.In a sign of resilience in the middle of the market, JC Penney said its strongest performing divisions had been women’s and children’s clothing, although overall comparable sales, against last April, were still down 6.6 per cent. Kohl’s, with comparable sales down 6.2 per cent, also reported strong children’s clothing sales as it raised its earnings guidance by over 10 cents a share.Target said its same-store sales increased by 0.3 per cent, adding that it had been able to avoid price-cutting and had seen better-than-expected profit margins. The retailer said it expected its first-quarter earnings to be “well above” the current $0.52 per share forecast by Wall Street.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, continued to benefit from budget-focused shoppers, reporting a stronger-than-expected 5 per cent increase in comparable store sales and gains in customer traffic. The company, which also announced that it would no longer issue monthly comparable sales data, said last week it had seen renewed strength in discretionary spending.Other low price retailers continued to fare well, including Dollar Tree, Ross and TJX. But luxury department stores Saks and Neiman Marcus continued to struggle.
302;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-07T21:46:19Z;Wall Street welcomes test results;;Investors welcomed the results of the government’s stress tests on banks on Thursday afternoon in post-market trading as ten out of the 19 banks tested were shown not to need additional capital.Citigroup rose 9.5 per cent to $4.17 as the company said it would account for its shortfall of $5.5bn by expanding its current programme to convert preference shares into common stock.Bank of America also continued to rise after it announced it needed an extra $33.9bn, exactly in line with previous reports. This built on its gains of the last week, during which its shares have jumped more than 50 per cent. The stock rose 1.5 per cent after the bell to $13.71.John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global said: “The market is getting more and more confident. People think this will be the last round of capital raising.”Regional banks were also major gainers, with Fifth Third surging 21.5 per cent to $6.50 in post-market trade as it said it would sell its processing unit to boost its balance sheet by $1.1bn.Mr Brady said: “Investors are looking beyond the immediate capital needs, but if the regional banks go back to the market in the third or fourth quarter the recourse will be rather dramatic.”Wells Fargo was one of the few fallers, as investors worried about how dilution following the banks’ announcement it would issue $6bn in common equity to pass the test. Its shares fell 0.2 per cent to $24.70.Timothy Geithner, US Treasury secretary, told PBS, the broadcaster, that the results would be “reassuring” and that none of the tested banks was insolvent.But Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, knocked investors’ confidence when he when he suggested the tests might pave the way to a more interventionist attitude from government towards the banking sector.“Investors don’t know what role the government will play in who should and shouldn’t be CEO or board member at certain companies,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Asset Management.During normal trading hours, the market had given up some of their recent gains following a strong week as investors reacted to the first indications of how banks had fared in the test.There was also support for the sector from Prudential, the life assurer, which reported higher operating earnings than had been expected. Its shares leapt 20.5 per cent to $42.87.The sector took confidence from figures showing that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time last week was much lower than estimated, falling to 601,000.Meanwhile, those continuing to claim such benefits reached a record.But AT&T and Verizon, the telecommunications giants, weighed on the indices after they were downgraded by JPMorgan, which said it was more cautious about the companies’ wireless businesses.AT&T lost 4.7 per cent to $25.45 while Verizon fell 2.9 per cent to $29.86.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.3 per cent lower at 907.39 while the Dow Jones fell 1.2 per cent to 8,409.85.Cisco proved a drag on the Nasdaq Composite as it reported falling profit. Its shares fell 3.4 per cent to $18.95, even though its earnings beat estimates.The Nasdaq, which has started to slip following outperformance in the first quarter, lost 2.4 per cent to 1,716.24.The index was lowered by Symantec, which makes security software. The group fell 14.8 per cent to $14.99 after it said its first-quarter sales would miss analysts’ estimates, with customer orders remaining low.“The market seems to have rallied because people were covering short positions rather than conviction buying,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. “But this is a traders’ market and traders know it is prudent to lock in profits, which is why we’re seeing falls today.”General Motors fell 3.6 per cent to $1.60 after it saw revenues slump and burned through more than $10bn in cash during the first quarter.Retailers performed well after more than a dozen companies raised their earnings guidance following stronger than expected sales in April.Target, the budget retailer, also found gains after the company said its first-quarter earnings would be much higher than estimates. Its shares rose 2.9 per cent to $42.67.Sara Lee added to the optimism over consumer behaviour after the household goods maker saw strength in the US, helping it offset weakness in its European businesses and outstrip analysts’ estimates with its first- quarter earnings. Its shares gained 4.4 per cent to $9.35.There was evidence that consumer activity was not as strong everywhere. JC Penney’s sales fell more than expected during April and its shares lost 5.7 per cent to $30.07.News Corp saw gains in spite of disappointing the market as it reported lower- than-expected profit, hit by steep falls in advertising across the company’s businesses.Investors took comfort from Rupert Murdoch, chairman, who said the worst was over for the economy. The group’s shares rose 1.1 per cent to $10.77.
303;TGT;Target Corp;2009-05-04T20:52:26Z;S&P tops 900 as investors return to banks;;US stocks surged on Monday, taking the benchmark S&P 500 above 900 points and into positive territory for the year, in a day dominated by rumour surrounding the government’s stress tests on banks.Citigroup and Bank of America are both believed to working on plans to raise $10bn of capital, while they, and at least two other lenders, are still contesting the government’s findings on the strength of their balance sheets. Bank of America denied that it was working on a $10bn plan.But banking stocks extended early rallies after Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the Obama administration, said banks would be expected to raise money needed to pass the tests privately rather than go to the government.With many analysts saying further government involvement would come with heavier regulation, investors took confidence from the news.Citigroup’s shares rose 7.7 per cent to $3.20, while Bank of America jumped 19.3 per cent to $10.38 and JPMorgan climbed 10.2 per cent to $35.79.Wells Fargo leapt 23.7 per cent to $24.25 after Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, called it a “fabulous” bank, even though Associated Press reported the government wanted it to boost its capital reserves.Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams, said that if banks needed to raise capital to pass the government’s tests, it would be bad news for existing shareholders no matter how it is done.“People are living in a dream world right now,” he said. “Shareholders are going to be so diluted. There is no way I would buy American banks at this level.”The gains were extended by figures showing that sales of existing homes had risen unexpectedly in March, providing signs that the housing market could be nearing a bottom.The S&P rose 3.4 per cent to 907.24, the first time it has closed above 900 since early January, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.6 per cent to 8,426.74 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6 per cent to 1,763.56 points.China’s manufacturing expanded in April for the first time in nine months, helping push up metals prices and shares in US metal producers.Freeport McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, rose 9.4 per cent to $48.64, while Alcoa gained 6.9 per cent to $10.36.This added to optimism from Sprint Nextel the mobile network operator. The group reported a surprise profit on Monday as cost-cutting efforts added to stronger-than-expected revenues, driven by customers joining its cheaper plans. The company’s shares rose 7.1 per cent to $5.General Motors advanced in the morning after Sergio Marchionne, Fiat chief executive, said he wanted to purchase GM’s European operations by the end of May to create a European supergroup. But its shares later drifted and closed flat for the session at $1.81.There was good news for retailers, as Barclays raised its price target on both JC Penneyand Target on which it also raised its earnings outlook for 2009 and 2010. JC Penney, which Barclays said should recover its margins on the back of lean inventories, gained 5.1 per cent to $32.59.Even though Target was downgraded by Bank of America, which said the group might struggle to keep sale numbers and prices at current levels, it managed to rise 1.3 per cent to $40.55.Pepsi Bottling Group rejected a bid of $29.50 a share from Pepsico to buy up the remaining shares in the group, calling it “grossly inadequate”.Pepsi fell 1.4 per cent to $49.10 on the news, but Pepsi Bottling Group per cent gained 0.3 per cent to $31.50.There was a mixed picture for technology. Adobe, the software maker, was downgraded by Citi and UBS, which both said the stock was unlikely to move higher after the recent rally. It fell 2.8 per cent to $26.69.Intel, the chipmaker, rose after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “overweight” from “equal weight”, saying orders would improve. It rose 5.4 per cent to $16.66.“The rally is being overdone,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim.“If we continue higher, we will have to sell off before Thursday or the results of the stress test could work against us.”
304;TGT;Target Corp;2009-04-13T21:22:01Z;Chorion’s plans make for interesting reading;;The life of Lord Waheed Alli seems dominated by timetables.The timing of pushing children’s characters through the development pipeline of Chorion, the intellectual rights company of which he is executive chairman, is the long-term pre-occupation.But for the moment, he is more taken up with the 4.50pm from Paddington.“Agatha Christie was the reason I joined Chorion in the first place and 4.50 from Paddington is my favourite book,” the Labour peer says in his office overlooking Aldwych.Now, the privately held Chorion is involved in negotiations over the sale of its portfolio of crime writers’ copyrights, including those of Mrs Christie, to Coolabi, an Aim-listed rights business run by former colleagues of Lord Alli.“You want to make sure it goes to a good home, assuming the price is right, and the people we are talking to will certainly love the portfolio,” he says.There is no doubting what he will do with the money – £30m to £50m – likely to result from any sale of the crime collection: give it to the kids.For the real profit-generators for the company are the likes of Noddy, the Mr Men and its new star, a young pig called Olivia.“We are always looking to invest in the children’s characters and in fact it is a process of permanent investment,” Lord Alli says.“The development pipeline is quite long: for instance it would take four years to complete from the time of commissioning a new series of Paddington Bear. You have to be on air in the UK for at least a year before getting into the supermarkets and toy shops.”The same process has to be undertaken on both sides of the Atlantic. Without the scale of the US market, Lord Alli believes, there can be no proper return on all that investment.This year, Chorion, which is controlled by 3i, decided to be more transparent about its performance, publishing figures showing gross profits up 13.6 per cent to £28.4m last year, with 35 per cent annual growth on revenues in its children’s division. Sales were up 23.6 per cent at £46.1m.The company went private in 2005 with Lord Alli, formerly a non-executive chairman, in charge.“In the past year or so, Mr Men has been a breakout hit in both the US and the UK. Book sales around the world were 8.5m, double the previous year and in 2009 it will have a huge drive in Wal-Mart and another massive expansion in 2010,” he says, with his trademark diamond ear stud glinting in his lobe.The importance of US retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart cannot be underestimated, Lord Alli says. “We spend more time in Bentonville [Wal-Mart’s Arkansas headquarters] than you can possibly imagine.”The real risk for the business is moving from these established brands to new ones, such as Olivia the pig, which has this year begun the conquest of her native US.“We made the show for Nick Jr [the pre-school version of Nickelodeon, an arm of Viacom] last year, it launched in February and in her first month, she was the number one pre-school girls’ show on the network.“We were nervous, but I think it’s turned out to be our Bob the Builder moment,” Lord Alli says.Olivia’s full marketing expansion in the US will be next year. Which leads to Lord Alli’s other timetable pre- occupation.“At some time, I intend to be running this company on a public market,” he says. “But not yet. The timing is obviously important. I could grow Chorion 35 per cent year-on-year, but if it went public too soon, I would run the risk that some git would come along with a cash offer with a 25 per cent premium and then bag all the hard work, taking the upside after a year. That’s my upside.”The timing of any initial public offering is up to 3i, he says, but Chorion is on a schedule to return to the markets before many more 4.50s roll out of Paddington.
305;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US retailers see some signs of demand;;March sales figures from leading US retailers provided some shimmers of light amid the prevailing gloom, with a number of store chains reporting signs of an increased readiness to spend by still-cautious consumers.The months comparable sales figures were affected by the shift in the timing of Easter, which drives gift and clothing sales, from March to April this year. The monthly data from store chains can also reflect specific marketing and merchandising, rather than broader economic trends.But the March sales data offered some signs that middle-class shoppers, who snapped their wallets shut in the fourth quarter of last year, may be starting to resume cautious spending.JC Penney, the US department store focused on middle class consumers, said it had seen “a positive response” in women’s clothing and in its home business” as it reported a better-than-expected 7.6 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. The retailer had forecast a low-double digit to mid-teen drop.The retailer raised its forecast for first quarter earnings, which will include a 23 cent pension costs non-cash charge, seeing a loss of 5 to 10 cents against a previous estimate of a 20 to 30 cent loss.Its rival Kohls reported a 4.3 per cent fall in same store sales. Kevin Mansell, chief executive, said the results “exceeded our expectations” and that home furnishing sales had also been its strongest business.Target, the discounter that is also heavily dependent on clothing and home sales, said it had “begun to see encouraging signs” in the operating results of both its stores and its credit card business. The retailer reported a 6 per cent drop in comparable March sales, but said it expected April sales to be essentially flat, due to the Easter shift.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that comparable sales at its Supercenters and discount stores increased just 0.6 per cent, below Wall Street’s expectations. Including its Sam’s Club warehouses, which saw a 6 per cent increase, the retailer’s overall US same store sales rose by 1.4 per cent.But it said it expected its first quarter earnings to come in at the higher end of the 72 to 77 cents per share it forecast in February.Wal-Mart also reported the sixth consecutive month of increases in customer traffic. It said average transactions were lower, which it attributed to the Easter shift, and to moderating price rises in its grocery sales.The retailer said sales were again driven by grocery and pharmacy sales, but said that its home and “do-it-yourself” categories had seen mid-single digit comparable store sales gains.Luxury retailers continued to struggle during the month, with Neiman Marcus and Saks reporting comparables sales falls of 29.9 per cent and 23.6 per cent. Both reported weakness across all their merchandise categories.Elsewhere, Gap reported an 8 per cent fall in comparable sales, but said it had stopped the sales decline during the month at its troubled Old Navy division. Gap brand US sales were down 14 per cent, and Banana Republic fell 16 per cent. But the retailer said it had achieved profit margins above those seen last year.Despite the outbreaks of optimism, overall March sales fell by more than Wall Street expected. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index fell 1.6 per cent, against the 0.6 per cent fall it had been expecting. But it also noted that several retailers including Hot Topic, American Eagle and Cache, the fashion retailers, as well as “off price” discounters TJX and Ross Stores had raised first quarter earnings guidance.
306;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target rebuffs activist investor Ackman;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Wednesday removed the gloves in a proxy battle with Bill Ackman, the activist investor, accusing him and his Pershing Square investment group of seeking seats on its board “to advance his own risky agenda”.In a letter to shareholders, Target’s chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, urged them to re-elect four board members at Target’s annual meeting in late May. He attacked what he called Mr Ackman’s “hasty and last-minute selection” of his alternative nominees, and defended Target’s decision to reject previous proposals from Mr Ackman on restructuring its real estate portfolio.Mr Steinhafel also highlighted the fact that more than half the shares controlled by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square group are in the form of derivative securities, on which it has so far recorded substantial losses.“We believe Pershing Square’s sizeable derivative positions create an incentive to favour risk-taking to affect short-term share price performance,” he wrote.Pershing Square controls about 7.8 per cent of Target’s shares, making it the company’s largest shareholder, with about 4.4 per cent held through derivative securities.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square IV fund, which is entirely invested in derivatives linked to Target, lost more than 90 per cent of its value in February, leading Mr Ackman to describe it in a letter to investors “as one of the greatest disappointments of my career to date”.Target’s shares have fallen from more than $60 in 2007 to slightly more than $37.Mr Ackman argues that he has a long-term interest in Target, having held on to the major stake he started to acquire in April 2007.In his own letter to Target’s shareholders earlier this week, he said his nominees would give the board independent expertise in retailing, as well as expertise in credit cards and property.
307;TGT;Target Corp;2009-03-26T20:14:48Z;Best Buy;;"Mobile phones, like fountain pens, become subtly shaped to the hand of their owner over time. In fact, there are few objects today with which consumers have such a personal relationship. So, as electronics become everyday staples, might they be resilient in the face of recession?Good fourth-quarter results from Best Buy on Thursday, which caused shares in the largest US electronics retailer to jump by more than a 10th, suggest that predictions for the death of non-essential consumer spending are at least premature.The December to February period was poor – same-store sales dropped 5 per cent from a year ago – but better than analysts had expected. And in the US, a disastrous December (sales down 7 per cent) was followed by a moderation in January and February (sales off just 2.5 per cent). All categories of merchandise showed signs of improvement, particularly from the third quarter, when uncertainty had caused shopper paralysis. It is reasonable to hope that those still with jobs are willing to spend again.Management was buoyant, expecting sales declines to be no worse for the balance of the year, with good control of expenses and capital expenditure helping earnings. Yet much of the good cheer stemmed from the opportunity to take market share thanks to the bankruptcy of competitor Circuit City.The share price reaction also reflects changed expectations, with Best Buy’s stock still rebounding from a November low in the wake of a profits warning. There are other reasons to worry about consumer electronics. In Europe, where Best Buy operates a joint venture with UK-based Carphone Warehouse, mobile phone sales were up, but only thanks to a strategy of discounting to take market share. In the US, Target and Wal-Mart keep electronics pricing keen. The prospects for consumer spending are merely a little less bleak than may have been feared.Best Buy, the largest US consumer electronics retailer, on Thursday lent some support to hopes on Wall Street that the slump in US consumer demand may be bottoming out, delivering better than expected results and a comparatively upbeat forecast for the new fiscal year.Executives also said they believed that low inventory levels in the first two months of the year meant it had missed out on some potential sales – another indication of firming customer demand.For the coming year, it predicted that its worldwide comparable sales would range between flat and a fall of 5 per cent, compared with the overall 4.9 per cent decline seen in the fourth quarter.During the first two months of the year, Best Buy’s more than 1,000 US stores were facing pricing pressure from the liquidation of Circuit City, its former rival, while picking up customers from it. Its stores had gained 1.2 per cent of domestic market share over the year ending on February 28, to 22 per cent.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

308;TGT;Target Corp;2009-03-16T20:16:02Z;Ackman signals Target battle;;"Bill Ackman, the activist investor, is launching a proxy battle at Target, the fifth largest US retailer, by nominating himself and four others to Target’s board.Target responded by saying it was “disappointed that Pershing Square has decided to pursue a costly and disruptive proxy contest”, despite the dialogues previously held with the company.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square funds control almost 8 per cent of the retailer’s shares.His four additional nominees are: Jim Donald, the former chief executive of Starbucks; Richard Vague, the former CEO of First USA Bank, Michael Ashner, a real estate executive; and Ronald Gilson, a business law professor.Pershing Square took a significant stake in Target two years ago, and initially pushed the company to sell off its credit card portfolio and to put its store leases into a real estate management trust.Target subsequently sold half of its credit card business to JPMorgan Chase in May last year in a $3.7bn deal, but the retailer has dismissed Mr Ackman’s real estate proposals as “speculative”.Mr Ackman has argued that his nominees would bring expertise that Target’s board currently lacked in the three areas of grocery retailing, credit card development and real estate.“If you look at the board the only executive with retail experience is the CEO,” he said.Target said in a statement that it had recently met with Mr Ackman to discuss his proposal to nominate two new board members, including himself, but said its nominating committee had determined against the proposal. Instead, Target is nominating four existing board members for re-election.“Target’s Board, with its breadth of relevant and diverse experience, is comprised of 12 highly qualified directors, 11 of whom are independent,” the company said.Target’s board includes Mary Dillon, global head of marketing at McDonald’s; Anne Mulcahy, CEO of Xerox; Solomon Trujillo, CEO of Telstra; Mary Minnick of Lion Capital; and Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo.Mr Ackman’s move comes as Target is battling with declining comparable store sales, reflecting its greater dependence on discretionary products such as fashion and home furnishings. The retailer has responded with an increased focus on low-prices for national brands, and more aggressive promotions such as giving away five dollar gift cards, and online coupons.Mr Ackman has repeatedly praised the management of Target under Gregg Steinhafel, its chief executive, a company veteran who took over the top job last year.Target’s shares have lost over half their value over the past two years, and are now trading just under $30. Wal-Mart’s shares have gained almost 30 per cent over the same period.On of Mr Ackman’s funds, Pershing Square IV, which is entirely devoted to leveraged investment in Target, reported a 90 per cent loss last year, and allowed investors the option of pulling out. Mr Ackman called the fund’s performance ”one of the greatest disappointments of my career to date.”"
309;TGT;Target Corp;2009-03-03T19:10:33Z;Target’s mass store opening to create 3,000 jobs;;Target, the US discount chain, on Tuesday said it would open 27 new stores in 15 states on Sunday, in what may be one of the last simultaneous retail launches for several years.The mass openings will add an additional three million square feet, expanding Target’s network to 1,699 stores and creating more than 3,000 jobs.But the rush of new stores will also make up more than a third of the 70-75 stores that Target is planning to open this year, compared with the 114 stores it opened in 2008, which included launching 43 in a single day.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, warned last week that in 2010 the number was expected to drop to as low as five new stores, and no more than 30.Looking ahead, he said future growth “all depends on how soon and to what extent we are able to return to a profit formula that makes it a very interesting proposition to invest more aggressively in new store openings.”Wal-Mart, Target’s larger rival, is also paring back store-openings this year, while continuing to expand. It has said it plans to open 125-140 Supercenters and 17 of its smaller Neighborhood Markets, down from 191 new stores last year and 218 in 2007, when it announced it was slowing its US growth rate.Wal-Mart, with more than 3,500 stores, is one of the few US retailers to continue to deliver sales growth during the downturn.There are signs that the retailer is also hoping that the prospect of new stores and jobs may ease some of the political opposition that has previously blocked its attempts to expand into Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.The retailer is reported to have stepped up lobbying directed at members of Chicago’s city council, which currently has only one Wal-Mart within its city limits. It is also developing smaller versions of its Supercenters – at around 100,000sq ft – that can be more easily located in already developed areas.Other retailers still expanding include Kohl’s, which operates 1,004 low price department stores. The retailer will open 55 new stores this year, including 36 locations acquired in October following the bankruptcy of Mervyn’s, a California-based rival. It opened 75 stores last year – including over 40 on one day – and 112 in 2007.But the most dramatic expansion will come from Dollar General, which operates more than 7,000 small neighbourhood hard discount stores. It is planning to open 450 new stores this year, up from 210 in 2008, as its ultra-low cost foods and household goods pull in cash-strapped customers.Dollar General’s fourth quarter sales increased 11.2 per cent ito $2.85bn, while its comparable-store sales improved by 9.4 per cent.

but the fact that the S&P had closed below 750 for the first time in almost 12 years certainly suggests that there’s plenty of life left in the bears for now.”The stock market gains came in spite of new data showing that US consumer confidence plunged to a record low in February and the housing market continues to stagger.Mr Bernanke gave stock market investors some confidence when he said in prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee that the recession should end this year.Weakness in material, industrial and technology shares had, in the previous session, pushed the S&P beneath a nadir reached in November last year.Continuing worries about the long-term future of the financial sector were shrugged off and the sector as a whole rallied strongly.JPMorgan shares rose by 7.7 per cent to $21.02, saying that the first-quarter so far had been “solidly profitable”. The bank, which appears to have avoided the most severe difficulties of its peers, also disclosed that it would cut its dividend by 87 per cent in a move to preserve capital.Citigroup and Bank of America, which found positive territory in the previous session in spite of the gloom elsewhere, were up 21.5 per cent $2.60 and 21 per cent to $4.73, respectively.American International Group is seeking an overhaul of its $150bn government bail-out package that would substantially reduce the insurer’s financial burden, while further exposing US taxpayers to its fortunes, according to reports.AIG is widely expected to post a loss of more than $60bn for its fourth quarter.

311;TGT;Target Corp;2009-02-24T18:27:43Z;Gap widens between US retailers;;"Five leading US retailers offered a cross section look at the state of US consumption on Tuesday, and underlined the growing gap between the sector’s strongest and weakest store chains.The worst news came from Office Depot, the office supplies retailer, which saw comparable sales fall 18 per cent at its 1,200 North American stores.It said it would need to boost liquidity following a drop in demand from retail and small business customers, and said it would close 118 US stores in the coming year.Its shares fell almost 20 per cent on the news.RadioShack, the consumer electronics retailer, reported that net sales fell 7.7 per cent in the holiday quarter, sending shares down almost 20 per cent on Tuesday.RadioShack has been facing growing competition in its core mobile phone business.However, Home Depot, Target and Macy’s expressed broad satisfaction with their performance, despite reporting steep falls in earnings amid the worst slump in retail sales for decades.The challenges facing retailers were underlined by consumer confidence figures from the Conference Board reaching new lows for February.Looking ahead, Carol Tome, chief financial officer of Home Depot, said the company was expecting the country’s GDP to contract by 2.5 per cent in the first half of the year, and by 1.1 per cent in the latter half, leading it to a “working estimate” of a 9 per cent fall in its sales over 2009.“It has really come down to what is happening in the overall economy; you can’t just look at one metric,” she said.The estimate excludes any possible benefits from the US federal stimulus package, which includes a broad range of initiatives that are aimed both at increasing employment and at supporting other goals such as energy efficiency that might support home improvement sales.“We are trying to digest the stimulus package, just like everyone else,” Ms Tome said.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, said the discounter expected sales of home furnishings and clothing to remain weak in the coming quarter, with continued growth “in the upper mid-single” digits in its low-cost food and healthcare categories.Target said it had cleaned out excess inventory left after retail demand collapsed in September and October. “We feel pretty good that we’ve got the sales and the receipts matched up appropriately as we look forward into 2009.”"
312;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Reaching for the Starbucks;;The decision of Starbucks to begin marketing Via, its own brand of instant coffee, is a powerful symbol of something – either of the unexpected resilience of innovative companies or the collapse of the whole logic of the consumer economy.The struggles of Starbucks are well known. Its stock lost half its value last year, and store sales were off 9 per cent in the most recent quarter. The company announced in January that it would shed 6,700 jobs and close 300 more outlets, after shuttering 600 last year. Other espresso chains are nipping at its heels, some with better services (such as Caribou in the US, where high-speed internet is free), some with lower prices (such as Dunkin’ Donuts). Home-grown competitors are rising in important markets – for example Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero in Britain. People differ on whether Starbucks has expanded too fast – losing sight of the bohemian ambience that was its main selling point – or whether peddling coffee for several dollars, or pounds, a cup is a non-starter in this straitened economy.Whatever the problem is, it is hard to see how instant coffee could be the way out of it. One prong in the Via marketing strategy is to sell it through the discount retailers Target and Costco for about $1 a sachet. That is a lot of money. While there is a logic in selling premium coffee at a premium, there seems to be little in selling so-so coffee at five times the price of other so-so coffee. The second prong is to sell it, starting in March, in Starbucks stores in three cities – Seattle, Chicago and London. That makes sense: 81 per cent of the coffee drunk in Britain is instant, and the world instant coffee market generates $17bn (€13.5bn, £11.9bn) in sales. So perhaps Starbucks can sell enough in prestige markets to convince shoppers elsewhere to buy it in bulk.That would be in character. Ever since it began expanding, Starbucks has worked by paradox and misdirection. It is supposed to be a chain of espresso bars but, in the US at least, it has been years since most Starbucks have stocked proper espresso cups. A shot of espresso comes as a little puddle rolling back and forth at the bottom of a pint paper cup meant to hold some other concoction, most likely one with lots of steamed milk and syrup. Starbucks is basically a malt shop and this should not surprise us. Creamy foods are always popular in booms. The great food fad of the 1920s, the historian Frederick Lewis Allen tells us, was “Eskimo Pie”, and US ice cream production rose 45 per cent in the seven years to 1926. The genius of Starbucks is to keep its identity as a coffee shop, letting its customers feel more virtuous than if the place they habitually nip off to at 10:15am were called the Dairy Tub, or something like that.This makes the shift to instant coffee easier. If you are selling milkshakes, the quality of the coffee is not that important, any more than the quality of scotch is important to someone whose favourite drink is scotch-and-coke. But there is a problem with instant, too. Part of what Starbucks founder Howard Schultz calls “the Starbucks experience” has always been a matter of class. Starbucks has managed to give its customers the feeling they are “in” in two ways.The first is through its reputation as a “responsible corporate citizen”. Starbucks offers health insurance to employees who work 20 hours a week or more and has been punctilious about trading only with ethical coffee growers. These choices are defrayed through higher retail prices. Since people who care about corporate responsibility tend to be well-educated, and hence well-paid, caring is a class marker. Corporate responsibility and conspicuous consumption are near relations. You can “feel good” about ordering Starbucks in more ways than one.The second link to class is through real estate. This may hold the key to the company’s difficulties. Starbucks has had a genius for sizing up properties and picking locations. The company starts, according to the writer Taylor Clark with “a database ranking every US metropolitan area according to the qualities Starbucks found especially desirable – high income, high population and high education”. In plotting its expansion this way, Starbucks not only collected information but generated it. An up-and-coming neighbourhood would have a Starbucks: a superficially similar but stagnant one would not. In the very act of its site selection it became a sort of rating agency. One extraordinary side-effect of Starbucks’ retrenchment is that, as outlets have closed – particularly in struggling cities such as Newark, New Jersey – protests have arisen to “Save Our Starbucks”. Naturally! A closed Starbucks signals a downgrading of the neighbourhood. But picking real-estate winners is not as lucrative now as it was a couple years ago.Starbucks may have come up against the limits of its model. The chain will have to serve a different function in the bust economy than in the boom. Maybe espresso bars could thrive as purveyors of “cheap luxury”, the way cinemas did in the 1930s. A lot of people thought that the collapse of phoney equity values would make people turn to healthy, high-value food. But, really, that almost never happens – the natural food craze of the late 1970s was a cultural coincidence, not an economic effect. As this paper has reported, people today are turning to fast food, fish and chips and other comfort foods. “The less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food,” George Orwell wrote in The Road to Wigan Pier. “When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ‘tasty’.” The taste for the kind of sweet drinks Starbucks serves is unlikely to wane any time soon.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly StandardMore columns at www.ft.com/christophercaldwell
313;TGT;Target Corp;2009-02-12T21:46:46Z;Wall Street rallies from early slide;;Retail stocks were among the losers in a wild session on Wall Street on Thursday as the market took scant comfort from better-than-expected sales figures.However, the benchmark S&P 500 index finished in positive territory after jumping by 3.2 per cent in the final hour of trading on a Reuters report that the Obama administration was working on a move to subsidize mortgage payments for troubled homeowners.The S&P had lost as much as 3.1 per cent as analysts warned that the apparently upbeat retail sales data had been skewed by seasonal swings and investors focused instead on the latest downbeat unemployment data and earnings reports.The decline left the index only 3 points away from a fresh low for the year, but traders were relieved late in the session that the market did not cross the key technical support level.The major indices finished at the break-even line: the S&P closed 0.2 per cent higher at 835.19 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.1 per cent lower at 7,932.76. Strength in the technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite Index close up 0.7 per cent at 1,541.71.Tiffany and Target shed 2.1 per cent to $20.57 and 2.8 per cent to $30.85, respectively, in spite of a Commerce Department report that showed retail sales unexpectedly rose in January for the first time in six months.The retail sector losses came even though the headline figure rebounded 1 per cent, while economists had forecast a decline of 0.8 per cent.Although the data also appeared upbeat when excluding motor vehicles and parts – sales rose 0.9 per cent on this basis against expectations of a 0.4 per cent decline – analysts highlighted that the previous month was revised downwards and suspected the supposed recovery was little more than a statistical anomaly.“Don’t believe the headlines,” wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, in a note to clients. “January’s results by no means suggest that the consumer is on the road to recovery.”Kohl’s was the biggest loser in the sector after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its “conviction sell” list. The shares lost 3.7 per cent to $36.54.The consumer staples sector outperformed, helped by better-than-expected quarterly earnings from Coca-Cola, which rallied 7.6 per cent to $44.39 on better-than-expected quarterly profits. The sector was the best performing on Thursday, up 1.2 per cent overall.Financials were the worst performing, down 1.3 per cent overall, on persistent concerns over the Obama administration’s rescue plans for the sector even though Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, hit back at criticism that the proposals lacked detail.Wells Fargo fell 4 per cent to $16.80. Illustrating the scale of the volatility, JPMorgan fell as much as 7.4 per cent but closed up 0.4 per cent at $26.19.NYSE Euronext was among the victims, off 3.8 per cent to $19.82 after Citigroup downgraded its view of the stock to “hold”.“Sentiment for market structure stocks remains fairly negative due to concerns around volume trends, hedge fund de-leveraging, reduced risk appetite and bank consolidation,” wrote Donald Fandetti, Citi analyst, of the sector. “While there have been some signs of a thaw and more aggressive government action, we believe a true recovery will simply take some more time.”Homebuilders were among the biggest losers, down 3.5 per cent overall after National Association of Realtors data showed prices of existing single-family homes tumbled by a record 12.4 per cent in the fourth quarterDownbeat labour market data – the four-week moving average for initial jobless claims rose to the highest level since 1982, while total unemployment benefits rose for a fourth straight week to near the 5 million mark – also weighed on the market.“The jobless claims number is the one that traders really care about,” said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at thinkorswim, who downplayed the significance of the retail figures. “It’s forward looking.”The lower oil price hurt the energy sector, which spent much of the session in the red although found positive territory by the close.In other earnings news, Viacom rallied 3.9 per cent even to $17.70 even after the media group disclosed a sharp decline in fourth-quarter profit.
314;TGT;Target Corp;2009-02-05T19:36:26Z;US retailers report grim January;;After the toughest Christmas season in decades, US retailers on Thursday reported grim January sales figures that underlined the intensity of their struggle for survival.Gap’s Old Navy stores delivered one of the worst performances, with comparable sales down by more than a third. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 23 per cent drop, echoing the 24.4 per cent drop at Neiman Marcus announced this week.Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle, the youth fashion stores, also reported sales down by more than 20 per cent, while JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw mid-teen percentage drops.In contrast, Wal-Mart, the low-cost retailer, again outperformed rivals, with same-store sales up 2.1 per cent for the month, ahead of its own expectations.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart USA, said comparable sales for the past 52 weeks were three times higher than the previous year. “Clearly, our stores are performing very well,” he said.The retailer reported strong sales growth in groceries and healthcare but also said it outperformed the market in sales of home and entertainment products.The comparative strength of discount stores was underlined by Dollar Tree, the chain that sells items for only $1, which reported a 2.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its quarter ending January 31.In contrast, Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, and said it had seen a decline of more than 20 per cent in sales of women’s clothing. The retailer lowered its fourth-quarter earnings guidance.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales, said its index of same-store sales from leading retailers fell 1.8 per cent for the month, the fourth consecutive month the index had fallen.Retailers have announced several thousand job cuts this year, including 1,100 jobs at Saks and 7,000 at Macy’s. Most have also indicated that they are sharply reducing inventory levels.Chris Donnelly, a retail consultant at Accenture, said: “The name of the game is to focus on cash, keep inventories low, and try to ride this thing out.”But he also noted that retailers faced the challenge of managing cutbacks while trying to maintain the customers’ experience of their stores.“Can retailers manage cuts without damaging the customer experience? It is a fine balancing act, so that people don’t feel that they are either going out of business, or are a frustrating place to shop.”
315;TGT;Target Corp;2009-01-27T23:56:14Z;Target to cut 1,000 HQ positions;;Target, the US mass discounter, is to cut 9 per cent of its headquarters staff positions and close one of its 34 distribution centres, as its “cheap chic” fashion and home furnishings fall victim to the slump in consumer spending.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive officer, said in a statement that the retailer was “clearly operating in an unprecedented economic environment that requires us to make some extremely difficult decisions to ensure Target remains competitive over the long-term.”The move underlines the breadth of the slowdown in US discretionary spending over the past year, from top end luxury stores such as Neiman Marcus and Saks, to Target, whose most expensive women’s dresses cost less than $45.Before last spring, Target was reporting consistent monthly increases in its comparable store sales, and was regularly outperforming Wal-Mart, its larger, more cost-focused rival. It was also opening around 100 stores a year, including 45 on one weekend last October.But as the economic climate worsened, Target’s sales weakened, reflecting its dependence on discretionary fashion-focused clothing and home wear categories, and lack of the extensive low-cost groceries offering that has helped keep Wal-Mart sales positive.The retailer was also slower than some of its rivals to respond to the changing consumer mood with more value focused advertising.In December it reported a 4.1 per cent fall in comparable store sales, compared with a 2.8 per cent increase at Wal-Mart’s discount stores and Supercenters.600 staff at its headquarters in Minneapolis will lose their jobs and 400 other job positions will be left vacant. The distribution centre, in Arkansas, employs around 500 people.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer that is also based in Minneapolis, said this month it had agreed voluntary severance packages with around 500 of its 4,000 corporate staff.On Monday, Home Depot, the home improvements retailer, announced that 7000 jobs, with 5,000 resulting from the decision to close around loss-making 40 home project planning stores, and 2,000 coming from administrative staff reductions.Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, also announced hundreds of job cuts earlier this month.The National Retail Federation said on Tuesday it expected retail sales to fall 0.5 per cent in 2009, but warned that the situation could be worse if the government failed to move quickly to pass an economic stimulus package.
316;TGT;Target Corp;2009-01-14T19:57:30Z;US retail sales plunge in December;;"US retail sales plunged in December at the fastest rate on record, as consumers cut back sharply on spending in spite of deep discounts throughout the holiday shopping season.December retail sales were off 9.8 per cent compared with the year before, the sharpest such fall since record-keeping began in 1992, according to figures released on Wednesday by the commerce department. The 2.7 per cent month-on-month decline was also the sixth consecutive month of falling sales, the longest on record.The speed of the decline last month was more than twice as much as economists expected. Most forecasters predicted a monthly fall of about 1.2 per cent.“After a great run, a US consumer besieged by falling wealth, job losses, collapsing income and a need to save is finally tapped out,” said Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.The monthly drop, which accelerated from a revised decrease of 2.1 per cent in November, was fuelled by reduced turnover at petrol stations, where sales fell
15.9 per cent. More than half of the decline in sales in December was due to lower petrol prices, noted Ian Sheperdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. Meanwhile, sales excluding cars and parts were down 3.1 per cent.Sales at clothing stores were down 2.5 per cent in December, while those at department stores fell 2.3 per cent and at home furnishing stores by 1.8 per cent.Retailers have suffered their worst holiday season for decades, as slumping consumer spending and bad weather took their toll. The International Council of Shopping Centers reported a 2.2 per cent decline in the index of comparable sales for November and December, the biggest month-on-month fall since it started tracking the data in 1970.Last week Wal-Mart, which has outperformed its rivals since the summer, reported a lower-than-expected 1.7 per cent increase in same-store sales at its US stores.From a 31.2 per cent slump in comparable store sales at Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, to a 4 per cent fall at Target, the discounter, December’s sales numbers showed the impact of the aggressive price cutting in categories ranging from toys to luxury handbags, lingerie and jewellery.On Wednesday, Tiffany & Co, the world’s second-largest luxury jeweller, announced global sales in November and December had fallen by 21 per cent compared with the holiday season in 2007. Same-store sales in the US were off 35 per cent from a year ago and the company said net earnings would decline in the fourth quarter.Analysts last month predicted that as many as 200,000 retailers could shut their doors this year, and weak sales have been taking their toll on retail workers. According to Ashraf Laidi, an analyst at CMC Markets, the 522,000 retail jobs lost in 2008 exceeded the number of jobs lost in the sector from 2001 through to 2003.Consumer restraint has led companies to shrink their inventories. Business inventories fell by 0.7 per cent in November, the commerce department reported. The rate of decline was the fastest since 2001 and went beyond expectations of a 0.5 per cent drop.Inventories held by wholesalers fell by 0.7 per cent in November and falling sales resulted in an inventories-to-sales ratio of 1.41, the highest since 2001."
317;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
318;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Wal-Mart cuts earnings forecast;;Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, cut its fourth quarter earnings forecast on Thursday, citing the impact of slower than expected sales at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores and international units.The retailer, whose low cost Supercenters have outperformed other retailers since the start of the consumer slowdown, said comparable sales in the US grew by 1.7 per cent in December, lower than Wall Street had forecast. Sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 1.9 per cent, while its Sam’s Club discount clubs saw an increase of just 0.1 per cent.The retailer cited the impact of the economic slowdown and bad weather across the US in the week before Christmas, which led to the closure of several stores. But Eduardo Castro Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart USA said the retailer believed it had continued to gain market share, and that customer numbers increased for the third month in a row.It forecast a US same-store sales increase for January of between 0 and 2 per cent.Wal-Mart’s total sales for the month edged down by 0.1 per cent to $46.51bn, reflecting the impact of a 10.4 per cent fall in the value of its international sales in dollar terms.“The current economy remains challenging for all businesses, and retailers have already seen customers pull back on discretionary spending,” said Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s finance chief. “Consumers are very focused on value and necessities.”Wal-Mart said it now expected fourth quarter profit from continuing operations between 91 cents and 94 cents a share. It had already reduced earnings forecast by 6 cents in November, citing the impact of the strong dollar on international earnings, and by a further 6 cents last month due to its settlement of 63 lawsuits over pay and conditions.It said it expected its overall operating performance for the year to be at or ahead of its fourth quarter last year.Shares of Wal-Mart were down almost 10 per cent at $50.35 in pre-market trading on Thursday.Costco, the warehouse club, reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales at its US stores excluding fuel sales. At BJ’s Wholesale Club, comparable club sales were up by 1.6 per cent in December, its lowest monthly increase for the year. The company said sales would have been 1.5 per cent higher if not for severe snow and ice storms during the month.Target’s December same-store sales fell by 4.1 per cent. The retailer said this was in line with their expectations and that it had to slash prices to clear inventory.“These markdowns, combined with additions to our accounts receivable allowance, will put additional pressure on our profitability in the fourth quarter,” the company said.Clothing retailers also struggled in December as customers trimmed spending. Macy’s said on Thursday it would close 11 stores and that same-store sales in December were down by 4 per cent. The company also slashed its full-year earnings forecast.Limited Brands, which own Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw same-store sales fall by 10 per cent in December as it offered deep discounts to clear inventory. The company also slashed its fourth quarter earnings outlook.
319;TGT;Target Corp;2008-12-04T20:24:02Z;US retailers suffer worst month this decade;;US retailers experienced their worst month this decade in November, as stores such as Macy’s, Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch reported double-digit falls in comparable store sales amid the economic gloom.But Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, led a small band of retailers that managed to deliver comparable sales growth during the month, beating its own forecast with a 3.4 per cent increase.The retailer said it had seen rises in both customer numbers and average spending per trip, and had benefited from the rapid fall in petrol prices.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said it was “extremely difficult” to provide sales guidance in the current environment, but Wal-Mart forecast December comparable sales at the high end of its quarterly growth estimate of 1-3 per cent.Costco, a warehouse club, reported comparable sales growth of 1 per cent at US stores, excluding petrol. Its rival BJ’s said sales rose 6.2 per cent. Sales at Sam’s Club, Wal-Mart’s warehouse unit, were up 3.5 per cent.Reflecting increasingly value-focused shopping, Family Dollar, which operates a large chain of small hard-discount stores, also reported a 2.1 per cent gain in comparable sales for the quarter ending November 30.Elsewhere, the figures were largely bleak. Poor performances were exacerbated by a difficult comparison with last year, when the Thanksgiving holiday fell earlier in November and boosted seasonal shopping at the end of the month.While several retailers reported strong sales at the post-Thanksgiving “Black Friday” sales, it was not enough to make up for the weakness.Retail Metrics, which tracks monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index fell 1.8 per cent, the worst monthly performance this decade. Without Wal-Mart, the index would have dropped 9.3 per cent.Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a 10.4 per cent drop in comparable sales, worse than its predicted range of a fall of 6-9 per cent.Department stores also struggled, with Macy’s down 13.3 per cent, JC Penney down 11.9 per cent, and Kohl’s down 17.5 per cent. Among speciality clothing retailers, Gap was down 10 per cent, while comparable sales at Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth fashion retailer, dropped 28 per cent.
320;TGT;Target Corp;2008-12-04T14:00:19Z;Grim corporate news dents mood on Wall St;;A host of glum corporate developments in a wide range of sectors from telecoms to retail were set to push Wall Street stocks lower on Thursday.Merck lost 2.7 per cent to $25.59 in pre-market trade after the drugmaker issued lower guidance for next year. Cost-cutting plans from Dupont failed to stop the shares losing 7.4 per cent after the chemical maker forecast a fourth-quarter loss.Less than an hour before the opening bell, S&P 500 futures were down 13.9 points at 854.60, Nasdaq 100 futures were down 15.75 points at 1,140.25, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 137 points at 8,442.In economic news, Labor Department data showed the number of new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell by 21,000 last week.However, continuing claims were worse than expected. Some 4.09m fired workers received benefits in the week to November 22, the most since December 1982, according to Bloomberg.AT&T was up 1 per cent to $28.31 after the group became the latest to unveil substantial cuts to its workforce. The phone company said it would cut 12,000 jobs, about 4 per cent of its total headcount and that capital spending in 2009 would be lower than this year.Another bright spot was Wal-Mart, up 4.5 per cent to $55.85 on the back of better-than-expected revenue. Bargain-hunting consumers helped the discounter lift like-for-like sales for November 3.4 per cent.However, other retailers – which benefited earlier in the week on reports that sales during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend may not have been as bad as expected – could come under pressure after the release of more downbeat sales figures.Target, another discounter, was pushed 5 per cent lower to $32.76 by poorly-received figures.Abercrombie & Fitch was pushed 0.5 per cent lower to $16.50 by a 28 per cent drop in November same-store sales, although Gap was flat at $12.87 in spite of a 10 per cent drop in like-for-like sales.The future of the country’s car makers was likely to be among the primary investor concerns. General Motors tumbled 9.3 per cent to $4.40 and Ford lost 0.4 per cent to $2.69 ahead of fresh executive testimony to plead for aid before Congress, due later in the session.“Will GM Get It?” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note to clients. “At [a] minimum, we see ‘A Bridge to Bridge Loan”. We anticipate GM’s comprehensive and newly specific plan is likely to meet with significantly improved reception upon Capital Hill.”However, it added that even were the group to be granted the funds, “significant risks remain given the perilous operating environment.”European stocks were higher ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was up 2 per cent to 846.32. Asian equity markets closed mainly down, although Chinese shares were higher on a report that the government may support the country’s banks by injecting funds.Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was 1 basis point higher at 0.892 per cent while the 10-year Treasury note was 1 basis points lower at 2.648 per cent.The rate at which banks lend to each other, measured by three month dollar Libor, fell for a third day to 2.19 per cent.Gold was trading $0.5 lower at $770 per troy ounce.The energy sector could come under pressure as oil prices were lower early in New York. US crude prices were $0.97 lower at $48.90 a barrel.
321;TGT;Target Corp;2008-12-03T23:18:18Z;Discounts drive 15% sales jump on ‘Cyber Monday’;;"US online retailers saw a 15 per cent jump in sales on the Monday following the Thanksgiving weekend compared with last year, according to early estimates, as aggressive bargains boosted traffic on the day the industry has dubbed “Cyber
Monday”.But the jump to $846m was not enough to offset an unprecedented seasonal downturn in US online retail spending, which, until this year, had been growing at year-on-year rates of more than 20 per cent, supported by increased internet usage. ComScore, the online data analyst, estimated that web sales have fallen 2 per cent to $12.03bn since November 1, compared with the same period last year.Gian Fulgoni, chairman of comScore, said the data showed consumers were “clearly responding positively to retailers’ aggressive online discounts”, with internet sales up by an average 13 per cent against last year on the Friday-to-Monday period.“This is an extremely encouraging development for retailers and we can
but hope that their aggressive discounting has still left room for profits,” he said.Hitwise, which tracks more than 10m US internet users, said Amazon was the busiest US retail website on Monday, with 10.77 per cent of US visits, while Walmart.com was second with 8.55 per cent of visits. Amazon’s traffic on the day was up 21 per cent against last year, while Walmart.com’s was up 6 per cent.Consumers’ online behaviour closely mirrored patterns seen in shopping centres over the weekend, during which aggressive discounting by retailers managed to stimulate sales, which had been slumping since mid-September.Online retailers have increasingly focused online discount promotions around Cyber Monday after the Thanksgiving sales, which has seen a regular spike in sales as people return to work after the holiday and shop from their desks.Some retailers, including Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, are this year offering online specials over the entire week, adding to the widespread use of incentives such as free shipping offers to drive sales.In spite of the hype surrounding Cyber Monday, the busiest day for online retailers usually comes about 10 days before Christmas.November’s decline in sales reflects the fact last year’s sales were boosted because the Thanksgiving Thursday came five days earlier in the month – in effect adding extra holiday season shopping days. The earlier Thanksgiving will also weigh on comparable store sales data, which leading US retailers are due to announce on Thursday."
322;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Wall Street plunges on economic fears;;The health of the economy and financial institutions returned to haunt Wall Street on Monday as US stocks suffered their heaviest losses since October.The month began in a sour mood as traders, on their return from the Thanksgiving break, were greeted with official confirmation that the economy has been in recession for a year.Yet it was the financial sector – bludgeoned 17 per cent overall – that led the market declines, which wiped out most of last week’s spectacular gains and ended a five-session winning streak.JPMorgan, off 17.5 per cent to $26.12, was among the key losers after Meredith Whitney, analyst at Oppenheimer, forecast the credit card industry would cut lending by more than $2,000bn over the next 18 months.“We believe we are now entering a new era in the financial landscape that will be characterised by expanded forced consumer deleveraging, with a pronounced downshift in consumer spending,” she wrote in a note.Banks endured heavy losses on fears they could need more capital. Citigroup – whose bail out helped fuel last week’s rally – sank 22.2 per cent to $6.45.Morgan Stanley lost 23.1 per cent to $11.35 after Credit Suisse analysts forecast a net loss in the fourth quarter of $0.35 a share.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 8.9 per cent to 816.21, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 7.7 per cent to 8,149.09 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 9 per cent to 1,398.07.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 24.1 per cent to 68.60, indicating high levels of distress.Industrials such as Caterpillar, off 10.8 per cent at $4.41, came under particular pressure after data from the Institute for Supply Management showed manufacturing activity last month contracted at its fastest pace in more than a quarter of a century.“Nothing like this has ever been seen before in post-second world war history,” said Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets.Retailers came under heavy selling pressure in spite of initial reports that sales on “Black Friday”, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season, were not as bad as some had feared.Stocks such as Macy’s and Abercrombie & Fitch tumbled 13.6 per cent to $6.41 and 14.8 per cent to $16.47, respectively, as traders remained concerned that, although discounting may have helped drive footfall, the heavy markdowns would hurt margins.“Even a great Black Friday…won’t be enough to save the month,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan, who visited stores across the Atlantic seaboard to monitor shoppers.Reports of widespread consumer bargain-hunting failed to lift Wal-Mart and Target, the discounters, which fell 5.1 per cent at $53.01 and 12.5 per cent at $29.54, respectively.The prospect of using the $700bn financial sector rescue package to help homeowners, mooted by Henry Paulson, treasury secretary, afforded the market scant relief and the sell-off worsened into the close.Stocks remained near session lows after Ben Bernanke warned that the Federal Reserve had “obviously limited” scope to lower interest rates, yet may buy Treasury securities to stimulate the economy.The retreat was wide ranging and even took in stocks such as Ford, down 5.2 per cent to $2.55 even after the motor group said it could sell its Volvo division. General Motors, which along with Ford and privately held Chrysler is due to present restructuring plans to Congress on Tuesday to make their case for $25bn in emergency aid, fell 12.4 per cent to $4.59.The energy sector was one of the biggest losers, down 10.3 per cent, as Opec delayed a production cut until mid-December.Chipmakers such as Intel, down 9 per cent to $12.56, were dragged lower by figures from the Semiconductor Industry Association that showed global sales fell 2.4 per cent in October.A report in The Sunday Times that Microsoft was in talks to buy Yahoo’s online search business for $20bn failed to give the search group a boost after AllThingsDigital quoted Ross Levinsohn, an internet executive said to be involved in the move, as saying the report was “total fiction”.The search group lost 6.7 per cent to $10.74 and Microsoft 8 per cent to $18.61.
323;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-28T17:09:12Z;US shoppers brave downturn on ‘Black Friday’;;"The woman leaving the Target discount store at the Eastwood Mall in Niles, Ohio, just after 7am on Friday seemed a little perplexed by the bustling pre-dawn scene. “Right, there’s a real bad economy out there. Yeah. Uh-huh.”Behind her, the lines at Target’s check-out counters stretched 40 to 50 people deep into the rear of the store, with shoppers pushing carts loaded with “door-buster” specials, such as the Target-exclusive FurReal Friends voice-programmable parrot for $24.99.Outside, the vast parking lot was full, as local shoppers ignored the cold temperatures and the snow on the ground to head to the stores for the traditional post-Thanksgiving sales.Two hours earlier and a few miles away, the crowds at the local Wal-Mart Supercenter had been similar, with cars again cruising the parking lot looking for spaces.Jessica Baldwin, who had just bought two plasma flat-screen televisions for over $1,100 at Wal-Mart, as well as some pyjamas for her children, said that she was not cutting back on her spending this year, although she thought that she “probably ought to”.Michelle Croyle, who was in a line of over 50 people waiting to pick up Kodak cameras at Wal-Mart also said that she planned to carry on as normal, despite the national mood. “I’ll just write a cheque if I have to,” she joked.But most leading US retailers are predicting that their holiday sales will decline this year, even though Friday’s pre-dawn traffic seemed, in northeast Ohio at least, to be at least on a par with or above previous years.With similar scenes being reported at malls across the country, Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, said in a statement that “the deep discounts on the hottest holiday items may have been just enough to get the attention of those consumers who were on the fence” about going on to shop.The three-day weekend accounted for around 10 per cent of total holiday season retail sales last year, with the opening day dubbed “Black Friday” because it historically marked the day on which retailers balance sheets could be expected to turn positive for the year.The early morning crowds this year were driven by unprecedented promotional price-cutting that reflects the pressure on amid the steep declines in discretionary spending that continued into the first weeks of November.Inside the Eastwood Mall – where the stores began opening their doors this year at 4am - American Eagle Outfitters, the youth clothing store, was offering 25 per cent of its entire stock for the day. Pacific Sunwear, a teen-clothing store that recently slashed its fourth quarter earnings guidance on falling sales, was offering a 35 per cent storewide discount.Meanwhile, at one end of the mall, the local branch of Steve & Barry’s was a reminder to retailers of the costs of failure. New owners who had tried to bring the 173-store chain out of bankruptcy abandoned the effort last week; yellow and black “Everything Must Go” signs in its windows were on Friday announcing the chain’s final liquidation sale."
324;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-21T22:33:45Z;Target rejects Ackman Reit plan;;Target, the US discount retailer, said on Friday it had rejected a plan from Bill Ackman, the activist shareholder, that proposes spinning off its real estate assets into a separate $25bn real estate investment trust (Reit).Target said the the proposals had been reviewed by its management and board, who had decided that Mr Ackman’s estimate of the potential value of the plan “is highly speculative and insufficient to merit pursuit of a transaction” given the potential risks and costs.“These concerns are heightened in the current economic environment,” it said in a statement.Target, which has been advised by Goldman Sachs, said it was still concerned about the validity of Pershing Square’s market valuation of Target and the proposed separate Reit, as well as the reduction in financial flexibility and the “frictional costs and operational risks” of executing the ideas.Mr Ackman this week revised his proposal in response to concerns about the impact of the proposed transaction on Target’s debt rating, but the company said it believed “meaningful risk” to its ratings would remain.The revised proposal called for the separate real estate trust to conduct an independent public offering of about 20 per cent of its shares, raising roughly $5bn that Mr Ackman said could then be used to pay down some of Target’s debt and alleviate ratings concerns.Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, said on Friday that the company respected the spirit in which the proposals had been presented by Pershing Square, which is Target’s largest shareholder with about 10 per cent of its stock.Mr Ackman first announced a stake in Target in December last year, and was believed to have influenced the retailer’s decision in May to sell 47 per cent of its credit card receivables to JPMorgan Chase in a $3.6bn deal.He has said he started discussions on the proposed real estate transaction in May. He first set out his ideas to other investors and analysts at a public meeting in New York last month, which Target said it learned about from Pershing Square’s news release.Separtely, Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, has raised his stake in Saks, the luxury department store chain, to about 15.5 per cent, according to a regulatory filing. Mr Slim’s investment vehicle has increased his holding in Saks from an estimated 11 per cent in August, as Saks’ share price has fallen sharply amid concerns about the slumping luxury market.
325;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-19T21:53:50Z;Deflation fears send Dow below 8,000;;The chilling prospect of a deflationary US economy and collapsed car industry sent Wall Street stocks on Thursday to their lowest levels since the financial crisis began.Investors took fright at labour department data that showed the cost of living plunged the most since records began in 1947, and the first decline in so-called core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, in more than 25 years.Sheryl King, senior US economist at Merrill Lynch, said the data suggested there was a “genuine risk that the US economy could fall into a corrosive deflationary phase”.That prospect helped push the benchmark S&P 500 index down 6.1 per cent at 806.58, less than 4 per cent away from an 11-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 5.1 per cent at 7997.28 while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.5 per cent to 1,386.42.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, shot up 10.1 per cent to 74.45, which indicated mounting signs of distress.General Motors and Ford shed 9.7 per cent to $2.79, and 25 per cent to $1.26, after Republican senators argued that the Detroit-based companies should consider bankruptcy protection.Concerns over the fate of the pair, along with privately held Chrysler, have dogged the market for weeks and the bankruptcy of either would be the biggest business failure in US history.Investors, nervous at such a prospect, kept a close eye on developments on Capitol Hill as executives faced another grilling over their case for a $25bn aid package.Financials led the market declines, down 11.5 per cent overall to a 13-year low. Insurers suffered more losses in part over fears that they may face delays in securing funding under the government’s troubled assets relief programme.Metlife dropped 8.3 per cent to $19 even after Credit Suisse said the brutal sell-off – due in part to concerns over its high asset leverage – was “way overdone”.Elsewhere, Yahoo dropped below $10 for the first time in more than five years, down 20.9 per cent to $9.14, after Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, scotched speculation that the software group could make a bid.In healthcare, St Jude Medical shed 9 per cent to $27.80 after Jefferies initiated coverage on the medical device group with a “hold” rating and said it faced “numerous risks” in delivering “ambitious expectations”.Homebuilders came under pressure from Commerce Department data showing construction starts on new homes and applications for building permits fell in October to record lows.Target shed another 10.3 per cent to $26.96 as investors questioned whether plans by William Ackman, the activist hedge fund manager, to spin off its land into a listed real estate investment trust would be successful or be accepted by management.Best Buy, the electronics retailer which last week sent a chill through the market when warning of a “seismic” slowdown in consumer spending, dropped 11.4 per cent to $18.58 after Standard & Poor’s cut its debt rating on the company to the lowest investment grade.In materials, down 7.4 per cent overall, Alcoa lost 13.9 per cent to $8.16 after JPMorgan cut its earnings estimate for next year and turned bearish on the sector.“Our strategists see commodity markets remaining lacklustre in 2009. The significant pull-back in prices has led to reduced capacity expansions and mothballing of some existing operations.”Oil refiners came under particular pressure in the energy sector – down 5.2 per cent overall as crude prices slid below $54 a barrel – after Deutsche Bank issued a downbeat outlook.“The most underappreciated issue is the combination of poor demand with major new refining capacity additions and the extent to which that will undermine light sweet crude prices,” the bank’s analysts said. Sunoco shed 12.7 per cent to $33.20 after Deutsche cut its recommendation on the refiner from “hold” to “sell” due in part to its exposure to the Atlantic basin markets “that are already showing signs of stress”.The market had briefly entered positive territory yet declined steadily throughout the afternoon and sold off heavily into the close.
326;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-17T22:01:41Z;Wall St falls on financial sector layoffs;;The biggest round of US job cuts for 15 years helped push Wall Street stocks lower on Monday as fears heightened over the scale of the difficulties facing financial institutions.Financials were among the biggest losers, down 6 per cent overall. Citigroup shed 6.6 per cent to $8.89 after unveiling plans to cut 52,000 jobs, which, according to consultants Challenger Gray & Christmas, was the biggest job cut announcement since the 60,000 by IBM in 1993.The bleak news, coupled with mounting signs of global recession, overshadowed any developments at the G20 meeting.Still, the market pared early losses as investors hunted for bargains in the energy, material and industrial sectors and briefly entered positive territory.Jeffrey Kleintop, strategist at LPL Financial, said there was a “tug of war” between poor economic developments and some signs of improvement in credit markets.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished down 2.6 per cent at 850.75 points after a sharp sell-off into the close, near the session’s lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.6 per cent at 8,273.58 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 2.3 per cent at 1,482.05.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, edged 4.2 per cent higher to 69.10, which continued to indicate elevated signs of distress.Elsewhere in financials, Bank of America slid 8.5 per cent to $15.03 after the group said it would increase its stake in China Construction Bank from 10.75 per cent to 19.1 per cent.Investors brushed aside a better-than-expected reading on industrial production – output rose 1.3 per cent last month, according to the Federal Reserve – as downward revisions to prior figures offset the rare positive news.RDQ Economics said the data were in any case primarily a result of “post-hurricane rebounds” and Bank of New York Mellon called the increase a “dead-cat bounce”.Official confirmation that the Japanese economy had entered recession increased concerns that the global downturn was spreading.Construction groups came under pressure after separate data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed manufacturing in New York contracted in November at the fastest pace since records began in 2001. Caterpillar lost 3.4 per cent to $35.70.General Motors jumped 5.7 per cent to $3.18 on mounting hopes Washington would grant aid to the car industry, although Ford eased 4.4 per cent to $1.72.In earnings news, Lowe’s and Target became the latest retailers to disclose sharp falls in third-quarter profit.Yet the figures were not quite as dire as analysts feared and shares in the former rose 4.2 per cent to $18.99.Target lost 4.1 per cent to $31.68 after management warned that the discounter’s gross margin performance might not be repeated in the fourth quarter.Also in the consumer sector, McDonald’s edged 0.9 per cent lower to $55.61 even after UBS upgraded its recommendation on the fast food group from “neutral” to “buy”. The bank said it was encouraged by the group’s “ongoing strong global trends amid a deteriorating global consumer environment”.In technology, Dell fell 3.4 per cent to $10.52 after Merrill Lynch downgraded its recommendation on the computer maker from “buy” to “neutral” ahead of results due this week, owing to lower than expected demand.Walt Disney lost 6.4 per cent to $19.74 after Soleil Securities cut its recommendation on the theme-park operator and media group from “buy” to “hold”.United Parcel Service was up 0.3 per cent at $53.28 even after the delivery group declined to forecast its peak day for holiday shipping, breaking with a long-standing practice in the industry. An uncertain economy made prediction too difficult, it said.Alcohol, tobacco and casino stocks received a boost after Merrill Lynch issued a bullish outlook on the so-called vice sectors.“Consumers do not kick their habits in tough economic times,” said Merrill.Still, brewer Molson Coors shed 2 per cent to $41.71.Energy was one of several sectors to find positive territory earlier in the session, but finished down 1.6 per cent overall as crude oil settled just above $55 a barrel.
327;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-17T15:44:52Z;More US retailers report grim results;;Lowe’s and Target, two of the largest US retailers, on Monday joined the long procession of stores reporting grim third-quarter results, as US consumers cut back on discretionary spending amid anxieties about the economy.Lowe’s, the second largest US home improvement retailer, reported a 24 per cent fall in third quarter earnings to $488m, or 33 cents per diluted share.Robert Niblock, chief executive officer, said the retailer “saw a decline in sales trends in the last week of October that continued into November as the overall economic outlook deteriorated”.Larry Stone, chief operating officer, noted that the retailer had seen declining sales “pretty much across the whole US” during the quarter, compared with a previous pattern of slower sales in Florida, California and other areas most affected by the housing slump.“The uncertainties of the election, and the real impact of the financial markets had a lot to do with it, with people sitting on the sidelines to see what was going to happen,“ he said.The retailer said there had been a sharp fall off in spending related to major discretionary household projects, such as new kitchen cabinets.Lowe’s overall sales increased 1.4 per cent to $11.7bn, but fell on a comparable store basis by 5.9 per cent.The retailer, which operates 1,616 stores across the US, predicted that comparable sales for the fourth quarter would decline by between 5 and 10 per cent, and trimmed its full year earnings guidance by 2 cents to $1.46-$1.54.Target, the mass discounter, saw its third-quarter earnings fall 24 per cent to $369m, or 49 cents per diluted share, as a sharp fall in income from its proprietary credit card portfolio added to the impact of a 3.3 per cent fall in comparable stores sales. Its total revenues increased 1.7 per cent to $14.6bn.Target said the profitability of its credit card business fell to $35m, from $202m, citing “higher bad debt expense resulting from current period write-offs and additions to the reserve for future periods”.The retailer sold just under half of its credit card receivables to JP Morgan Chase in May this year for $3.6bn.Bad debt expenses on the card more than doubled to $314m from $130m before the sale of receivables to JPMorgan.Target’s results contrasted with its larger rival Wal-Mart, which reported a 10 per cent increase in quarterly profits last week. Target is more dependent on sales of clothing, housewares and other discretionary items than Wal-Mart, while its rival has also been able to use its extensive low cost grocery business to attract customers.Target’s shares rose over 2 per cent to $33.95 while Lowe’s was up over 4 per cent at $19.12 in morning trading in New York.
328;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-06T21:50:04Z;US stocks plummet on grim economic outlook;;Fresh signs of the serious difficulties facing corporate America pushed Wall Street stocks sharply lower for a second straight session.A host of big names neared or surpassed yearly lows in a heavy sell-off that took in all sectors and extended the losses endured in the market’s worst ever post-election day drop.“This time next year, Obama euphoria will be crushed under the weight of the unfolding economic and market meltdown,” warned Albert Edwards, analyst at Société Générale. “The crushing weight of the ‘Great Debt Unwind’ has only just begun.”The future of carmakers General Motors and Ford topped a long list of traders’ concerns. The pair fell 13.7 per cent to $4.80 and 5.3 per cent to $1.98 after Toyota warned that operating profits would fall to a 13-year low.Along with privately-held Chrysler, they were expected to meet with Nancy Pelosi, House of Representatives speaker, and push for a fresh aid package in addition to $25bn in loans from the Bush administration.The S&P 500 closed down 5 per cent at 904.88 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 4.9 per cent at 8,695.79. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 4.3 per cent to 1,608.70.A fresh round of interest rate cuts overseas had earlier trimmed losses in the futures market, but the relief was brief and did little to calm jitters upon the open. Investors digested the International Monetary Fund’s stark warning that the developed world faced its first annual fall in growth since the second world war.They were further unsettled by business productivity data and weak jobless claims figures, which failed to inspire confidence ahead of a closely watched payrolls report due for release on Friday.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, shot up 16.6 per cent to 63.64, indicating heightened signs of distress.The media sector came under pressure from News Corp’s downbeat outlook, which prompted JPMorgan to downgrade its recommendation on the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”.“We have little confidence that the company will be able to cut costs fast enough to offset newspaper ad revenue declines,” the bank said, and also cited concerns over TV income.Rupert Murdoch’s group sank 16.3 per cent to $8.31 while Walt Disney, also exposed to the advertising market, shed 5.9 per cent to $22.81 ahead of results due after the market close.In technology, Cisco fell 2.6 per cent to $16.94 after the network router and switches maker warned of a slump of up to 10 per cent in its current quarter revenue. The glum outlook heightened fears that the technology sector would be hit by corporations scaling back IT spending. Savita Subramanian, quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said stocks were tending to “travel more tightly in industry groups as news typically affects the entire sector”.Qualcomm fell 6 per cent to $33.05 ahead of results due from the chipmaker after the market close.Yahoo edged 0.3 per cent higher to $13.96 and was one of the few in the sector to find positive territory after Jerry Yang, chief executive, rekindled the prospect of a deal with Microsoft, which fell 5.4 per cent to $20.88.The energy sector suffered some of the heaviest declines, down 6.1 per cent overall as crude oil settled near $60 a barrel.Meanwhile, the worst monthly retail sales data so far this decade rekindled fears over US consumer spending and highlighted the worsening prospects for chain stores over the vital holiday season.Consumer staples was nevertheless the best performing sector, down 2.5 per cent among even heavier losses elsewhere and helped as Wal-Mart bucked the gloomy trend. Higher in the morning session on the back of a better-than-expected 2.4 per cent rise in same-store sales for October, the world’s largest retailer later fell back with the wider market and finished down 1.2 per cent to $53.49.Regarded as a defensive stock, Wal-Mart was still one of the strongest performers on the Dow and its performance contrasted with discount peer Target, whose shares fell 6 per cent to $35.47 following a worse-than-expected sales slowdown.
329;TGT;Target Corp;2008-11-06T20:46:29Z;US retailers battered by financial turmoil;;Dismal October sales figures from most leading US retailers on Thursday underlined the impact of the financial turmoil on American shoppers across the economic spectrum.From a 27 per cent fall in same-store sales at Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion retailer, to a 13 per cent drop at JC Penney, the quintessential middle American department store, the data showed a sharp drop-off in discretionary spending on items such as clothes, jewellery and shoes.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, saw sales drop 6 per cent, Kohl’s fell 9 per cent, while Target, the discounter, said its comparable sales fell 4.8 per cent.But Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, again outperformed the sector, with a 2.4 per cent same-store sales increase at its US Supercenters and discount stores.The number of people visiting Wal-Mart’s stores during the downturn has increased, supported by its low-cost groceries, which account for about 40 per cent of its total sales, and its $4 generic prescription drug programme.It has also been attracting more prosperous customers from its competitors, luring them with television advertising.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart USA, said its stores had again seen a rise in customer traffic against the same period last year. “We see more customers shopping more often at Wal-Mart. Customers see that we are broadening the price gap against our competitors,” he said.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said the company was forecasting an increase of 1-3 per cent in November comparable sales, and highlighted the potential positive impact of lower fuel prices.“While there remain some uncertainties with the global economy, we believe falling gas prices could help customers as we enter this holiday season,” he said in a statement.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said the company’s index of same-store sales fell 0.3 per cent in October – the first decline in a non-Easter holiday month since 2000. Without Wal-Mart the drop would have been 3.5 per cent.Speciality clothing retailers were also battered. Gap reported a 16 per cent fall in same store sales, while youth-focused retailers Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle were down 20 per cent and 12 per cent respectively.Retailers have responded to the fall in demand by cutting back inventory, and advancing pre-Christmas promotional sales that would traditionally not be launched until after the Thanksgiving holiday.
330;TGT;Target Corp;2008-10-30T22:40:47Z;Wall Street shrugs off GDP contraction;;US stocks shrugged off official confirmation that the economy had shrunk as upbeat developments elsewhere gave the market a boost.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose as much as 3.6 per cent in intraday trade after the release of the third-quarter gross domestic product data, which though glum were not quite as bad as some feared.Traders took some comfort from record profits at ExxonMobil, the world’s biggest oil company, the prospect of more global interest rate cuts and a further easing of strain in money markets.Alan Ruskin, of RBS Global Banking & Markets, said the market was “trying to already look beyond a dire quarter four, and at the moment is inclined to give various governments, notably the US, the benefit of the doubt that some of the policy initiatives will work”.The market remained positive although it briefly entered negative territory in volatile midday trading.The S&P finished up 2.6 per cent at 954.09 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.1 per cent higher at 9,180.69. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 2.5 per cent at 1,698.52.Consumer stocks found positive territory even though the hit to GDP was driven by a 3.1 per cent drop in consumption, which had not declined since 1991. Consumer discretionaries were one of the biggest sectoral winners, up 3.3 per cent, while consumer staples stood 2.5 per cent higher.Hard-hit office retailers put in particularly strong performances after Staples upgraded its guidance for the quarter. Its shares jumped 15.6 per cent to $18.42.OfficeMax and Office Depot rocketed 46.1 per cent to $7.07 and 48.6 per cent to $3.12, respectively.Target, whose shareholder Pershing Square Capital Management is trying to persuade it to spin off the land beneath its stores into a real estate investment trust, gave back the strong gains of earlier in the week, falling 5.7 per cent to $38.39. Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup analyst, said she had “several concerns” about the hedge fund’s proposal, which the bank said could lead to a credit rating downgrade for the discount retailer.Also bucking the positive trend, Avon sank 15.4 per cent to $22.57 after the ­ cosmetics group missed ­forecasts due to particular weakness in North American sales.Colgate-Palmolive rose 7.1 per cent to $64.23 after the toothpaste group posted a slightly higher-than-expected quarterly profit.ExxonMobil’s better-than-expected earnings set another record in corporate profits but still failed to impress Wall Street. The group is planning to cut costs. Although traders welcomed the quarterly figures, the stock was down for much of the session although it recovered to close 0.5 per cent higher at $75.05.“Don’t be fooled,” said Professor Anthony Sabino of St John’s University. “These astronomical numbers were driven by a market frenzy that pushed up oil prices to absurd levels.” Chevron added 4.5 per cent to $74.18 ahead of its earnings on Friday.Elsewhere in the sector, First Solar jumped 24.5 per cent to $144.07 after increased demand for its technology helped the group beat expectations.Telecoms was the worst performing sector for the second session, up 0.8 per cent. Motorola slid 5.3 per cent to $5.17 after the group posted an unexpected third-quarter loss and said that the mobile device business spin off would be delayed.Among a host of insurers to post results after the previous session, Prudential Financial disclosed a quarterly loss and its shares fell 18.1 per cent to $28.87. Hartford Financial Services Group was among the biggest losers on the S&P, down 51.6 per cent to $9.62 on concerns it may need to raise more capital after swinging to a surprisingly large loss. The group said the third quarter was the toughest in its history.In technology, Symantec slid 17.7 per cent to $12.20 after the security software group missed analyst estimates.The media sector received a boost after CBS, which gained 8.1 per cent to $9.43, said it would cut more costs to mitigate against a fall in advertising.Cigna slid 21.5 per cent to $15.58 after the health insurer posted weaker than-expected results and cut its full year outlook.
331;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Ackman calls for Reit to hold Target’s land;;William Ackman, the activist investor, said that he wanted Target, the discount retailer, to spin off most of its land holdings into what could be a $27bn publicly traded real estate investment trust (Reit).“We are asking the company to do something that is transformational,” he said during a public presentation in New York to investors and analysts at which he set out details of a plan first discussed with Target in May.Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square funds have held almost 10 per cent of Target’s shares since December last year, argued that Target’s real estate assets had been substantially undervalued by the stock market. The company owns about 95 per cent of its real estate, a higher percentage than most other large US retailers.The retailer, which operates more than 1,600 stores, responded to the presentation by outlining its concerns about the proposals, which it said included questions over the assumptions on which Mr Ackman had based his valuations of Target and the proposed Reit.Target also cited concerns over maintaining its top level debt ratings, over its future financial flexibility and over the risk that executing the strategy would divert its management from its core retail business as it faced an increasingly tough trading environment.Mr Ackman described the proposed real estate entity as an “inflation protected” Reit. Under his plan, the land would be spun off tax-free to existing shareholders, and the entity would be protected from takeover by rivals and focus its investments only on Target’s land holdings.It would lease the properties back to Target under 75 year leases, while reducing Target’s tax obligations.The retailer would pay rent that would rise in line with inflation, but would retain ownership of the buildings with the flexibility to remodel and reconfigure stores that could be constrained by conventional leases.For the first two years, the Reit would be Target’s exclusive land developer and would subsequently work as a preferred vendor for land development, with Target’s growth plans giving it steady future growth.Mr Ackman compared the proposed relationship between the entity and Target to those between Coke and Pepsi-Cola and their respective bottlers, saying the Reit’s committed link with Target would attract long-term investors.
332;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Ackman to hit out at Target;;William Ackman, the activist investor, is launching a public campaign against the management of Target, as the “cheap chic” US discount retailer faces slowing consumer demand and an expected tough holiday season.Mr Ackman is to hold a public presentation in New York on Wednesday at which he is expected to lay out proposals for restructuring Target’s real estate holdings.His Pershing Square Capital Management group, which took almost 10 per cent of the retailer in December last year, said he would discuss “a potential transaction that …will build long-term value for Target Corporation and all of its stakeholders”.Target’s shares have fallen over 30 per cent since mid-September, while its sales have been trailing Wal-Mart, its main rival, reflecting its greater focus on discretionary fashion and home items.Target launched a strike on Mr Ackman’s proposals, by saying on Tuesday it had “serious concerns” with “various ideas for an alternative ownership structure” for its real estate proposed by Mr Ackman since May.The retailer, which operates almost 1,700 stores across the US, said it had evaluated the proposals with outside advisors.“Our analysis raised serious concerns on a number of important issues, which we have raised with Pershing Square,” it said in a statement.Mr Ackman is expected to propose that Target take steps to monetise its real estate assets.The retailer, in common with Wal-Mart, owns the majority of the land on which its stores and distribution centres stand, with less than 6 per cent of its properties currently under lease.He has previously conducted activist campaigns at McDonald’s, the fast food chain, and Wendy‘s, now part of Nelson Peltz’s Triarc group.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive officer, said Target “has a strong record of engagement and open dialogue with shareholders over many years”.The retailer had previously held discussions with Mr Ackman before its decision to sell half of its credit card portfolio for $3.6bn to JP Morgan Chase in May. In November last year, it announced a $10bn three-year share buy-back.In a statement, Pershing Square praised Target’s “thoughtful and constructive approach with shareholders”, which it said had been instrumental in its developing a potential transaction.Carol Levenson, retail analyst at Gimme Credit, a research firm, expressed surprise at the move in a note to clients, pointing to the potential risk borrowing against real estate assets could pose to Target’s high credit ratings.She argued that “fighting off activist shareholders would be a huge distraction for management at this crucial time of a very difficult year”.
333;TGT;Target Corp;2008-10-28T04:06:48Z;Time to begin the bargain hunt;;I have some good news and some bad news for investors. First the bad news: I think the economic and psychological damage inflicted by the global financial crisis has been so severe that both the US and world economies are likely to be weak for a number of years, making it hard to imagine either corporate earnings or the multiples investors are willing to place on those earnings going up for quite some time.Thus, in spite of the devastation visited on equity markets over the past year, I would be shocked to see a sustained comeback in overall share prices over the next two to three years.Now for the good news. Based on the number of cheap stocks I am seeing – they are everywhere – I have never been more bullish in my investment career.With fear running rampant, some of the best businesses are priced today as if their earnings will never rise again, and many lesser businesses are priced as if they might go out of business entirely. While I profess no great insight into calling the bottom of the market, I have never felt greater certainty that with patience and perseverance I will be well rewarded by the stocks I own at current prices.Far more esteemed investors share my bullish views on stocks. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett recently wrote: “Equities will almost certainly out­perform cash over the next decade, probably by a substantial degree. Today, my money and my mouth both say equities.”In a recent interview with the newsletter I co-edit, Value Investor Insight, pre-eminent value investor Seth Klarman of the Baupost Group made a compelling case for the increased value added from fundamental stock-picking in today’s market environment.“You could argue that for the past 10 or even 20 years, equities haven’t been allowed to get cheap,” he said. “When it appeared the market was really going down – in 1987, 1998, 2000 – the government tended to intervene to prop it up. One of the pernicious problems of doing that when things are about to get cheap is that it creates the illusion that there isn’t much downside risk, and also prevents the necessary creative destruction that happens when an asset gets incredibly cheap.“In the past 15 months we’re starting to see stocks trade at whatever price. There’s a much higher probability that fundamental value investors in this type of period will be able to add value with specific stock selection.”I think Mr Klarman is right and that there are a great number of exciting ideas to choose from. The most interesting opportunities fall into three broad categories, appropriate for investors with risk profiles from the most conservative to the most aggressive.For conservative investors, the stocks of some of the greatest businesses, with strong balance sheets and dominant competitive positions, are trading at their cheapest levels in years – due primarily to the overall market decline and weak economic conditions rather than any company-specific issues. In this category, funds I co-manage own Berkshire Hathaway, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, but the list of the best beaten-up blue chips today would also include Altria, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.On average, these eight stocks have held up relatively well, falling just more than 25 per cent from their 52-week highs versus a more than 40 per cent drop for the S&P 500. But given the high quality of their businesses, these stocks should trade at closer to 18-20 times next year’s earnings estimates rather than the 12 times at which they trade as a group. And they pay an average dividend yield of 2.8 per cent.Berkshire Hathaway is our favourite blue-chip stock, in large part because we believe it benefits from the credit crunch. Its operating businesses will be negatively affected by the recession, but this should be more than offset over time by the investment opportunities Mr Buffett is taking advantage of to put Berkshire’s enormous cash hoard to work.So far this year, he has invested more than $50bn and he still has tens of billions of dollars of buying power remaining. It is likely his future deals will be struck on even more favourable terms, as those who need capital get more desperate. We estimate that Berkshire Hathaway is trading at least 30 per cent below its intrinsic value – and the few times in the past when we have seen the discount this large, the stock has risen quickly.Berkshire is a great example of letting someone else find bargains for you in this tumultuous time. We have also recently added a position in Leucadia National, a diversified company similar to Berkshire Hathaway that we have long admired but never owned because the stock was never cheap enough – until now.Leucadia is run by two of the savviest investors on the planet, Ian Cumming and Joe Steinberg, and its stock has outperformed Berkshire’s over the past 20 years. Leucadia shares have historically traded at about two times book value but, after a recent 60 per cent decline, can now be bought at less than book.For more adventurous investors looking to buy great companies in the most out-of-favour sectors such as financials and retailers, I recommend American Express and Target. Both stocks are down 50-60 per cent over the past year and trade near 11-year and five-year lows, respectively.Amex, which recently reported better-than-expected earnings, will no doubt suffer significant losses in its credit card business and will be hurt by weak consumer spending for some time, but one does not often have the chance to buy one of the world’s great businesses with excellent long-term growth opportunities at less than 10 times earnings.Target is a similarly superior business facing significant macro headwinds, which have crushed the stock to below 10 times this year’s earnings estimates (which the company recently reaffirmed). In September, Target’s same-store sales were down 3 per cent, yet total sales were up 2.5 per cent, a respectable showing given the environment.Target remains healthily profitable and is taking advantage of its weak share price to buy back stock –4 per cent of its outstanding shares per quarter over the past three quarters – which is exactly what we as investors would hope to see.More aggressive investors would be well served to search for bargains in the energy sector. Speculative excess had crept into prices of energy stocks as oil prices reached as high as $147 a barrel this summer, but now that excess of optimism appears to have been replaced by an excess of fear, as concerns over weak demand have caused energy prices to fall sharply.At the same time, leveraged, momentum-driven investors who were big holders of energy shares have panicked (or are being forced to sell due to margin calls), leading to a more dramatic decline in stock prices.Particularly attractive today, we believe, are natural gas processing and pipeline companies, which have limited commodity-price risk and pay out nearly all of their earnings in hefty dividends. Investors can buy them via publicly traded master limited partnerships such as Crosstex Energy and Atlas Pipeline Partners.Atlas, for example, at a recent $20.30, is priced to yield 16.5 per cent and we consider the dividend payout to be safe. We also see considerable upside in exploration and production company Contango Oil & Gas, which is more of a direct bet on natural gas prices. Recently trading at about $40, we believe the stock price already discounts much lower natural gas prices than today’s level.Last but not least, we consider two companies recently involved in corporate transactions, Wendy’s/Arby’s Group and EchoStar Corporation, to be trading at well below half their respective intrinsic values. Following its recent merger with Triarc Companies, Wendy’s is now being run by Nelson Peltz and his team, top operators and capital allocators who engineered a remarkable turnround at Arby’s and are a good bet to do the same with Wendy’s.EchoStar was spun out of satellite TV company Echo­Star Communications at the beginning of this year and is a collection of satellite technology and set-top box businesses run by legendary founder Charles Ergen. Today’s stock price is so depressed that it nearly equals the company’s cash and investments, meaning an investor is paying almost nothing for the company’s ample assets and cash flows.Successfully navigating today’s market takes a strong stomach, a realistically long investment horizon and a very discerning eye. Regardless of your tolerance for risk, however, the opportunities are out there.• Funds managed by Mr Tilson own Berkshire Hathaway, McDonald’s, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Amex, Target, Crosstex Energy, Atlas Pipeline Partners, Leucadia National, Wendy’s and EchoStar Corporation.The writer is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress.

334;TGT;Target Corp;2008-10-22T23:37:33Z;Amazon forecast highlights holiday fears;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, underlined the uncertainty facing retail sales this Christmas, forecasting fourth-quarter sales in the broad range of $6bn to $7bn – representing growth of as low as 6 per cent or as high as 23 per cent on the same period last year.Tom Szkutak, chief financial officer, said the forecast reflected “appropriately conservative assumptions” and followed slower sales at the end of the quarter in September as consumers reacted to the turmoil on world financial markets.The slowdown included a fall-off in the number of online purchases worth more than $1,000.Wall Street had been forecasting sales of $7bn in the holiday quarter. The cautious outlook spooked investors, who sent Amazon’s shares down more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading to $43.Forrester Research this week predicted that US online sales would increase by 12 per cent in November and December to $44bn, versus an 18 per cent increase last year, supported by the comparatively more affluent profile of online shoppers.The National Retail Federation is predicting Christmas sales growth of 2.2 per cent, the lowest level since 2002.Amazon’s caution followed a strong third quarter, with overall revenues increasing 33 per cent to $4.26bn and earnings up 48 per cent to $118m, or 27 cents per diluted share.Amazon’s international sales again edged up as a share of total revenues, now accounting for 46 per cent of the total.The share of sales from non-media items such as electronics increased to 38 per cent from 33 per cent.The company also highlighted the performance of its Kindle digital book reader, saying it now accounted for 10 per cent of sales of all books available in both digital and physical form.Separately, Target, the discount retailer, saw its shares fall 11 per cent on Wednesday, after it reported an increased rate of non-payments on its credit-card portfolio, which it jointly operates with JPMorgan Chase.
335;TGT;Target Corp;2008-10-19T22:27:23Z;Pressure on US retailers rising;;"At the Linens ’n Things store in Jersey City, the staff were hanging the “Everything Must Go” and the “Going Out of Business” signs from the store’s light fixtures on Friday.“Unfortunately we won’t have a job soon,” said one of the store’s 38 staff members. By January, all 371 remaining Linens ’n Things locations will be closed.After seeking bankruptcy protection in May and selling off some 200 locations, the second largest US home store finally failed to find a buyer last week.The retailer, which was taken private in 2006 by Apollo Management, is one of the highest-profile victims of the downturn in US consumer spending that began almost two years ago.This summer also saw the failure of Boscov’s and Mervyn’s, two regional department store chains, with Mervyn’s announcing on Friday that it too will liquidate its stores and stock.In electronics, the year started with the demise of CompUSA, while Circuit City, the second largest consumer electronics retailer, is now desperately trying to reorganise its floundering business.Most of the retailers who experiencing serious difficulties were already in competitive trouble before the spending downturn gathered pace. Linens ’n Things and Circuit City were both losing customers respectively to rivals Bed Bath and Beyond and Best Buy, as well as to the Wal-Mart and Target, the discounters.The small regional department store chains have been struggling for several years to differentiate themselves from the discounters and national department chains, lacking the market clout that has allowed JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s to secure exclusive brand deals to attract custom.But even America’s most successful retail companies are expected to feel the pain this holiday shopping season, as the turmoil in the stock market hits American households through their 401K retirement savings accounts.Last week, the National Retail Federation’s annual survey of holiday shopping sentiment, conducted in the first week of October, showed that its 8,000 respondents were expecting to increase their spending on gifts by just 1.9 per cent — the lowest growth seen since the survey began in 2002.The NRF is forecasting an overall 2.2 per cent increase in spending in November and December.In an indication of the extent of the softening in discretionary spending, VF Corporation, one of the world’s largest branded clothing companies, slashed its fourth-quarter revenue forecast on Friday to 3-4 per cent from 8 per cent, with earnings growth of 1-5 per cent, from 20 per cent previously.Its brands, including Wrangler jeans and The North Face, are sold by retailers from Wal-Mart to Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store.“The month of September — particularly the second half — marked a turning point in market conditions,” the company said, adding that the financial crisis
and economy had taken “a heavy toll on consumer confidence and spending in many markets around the world”.Macy’s, one of VF Corp’s leading clients, also lowered its earnings forecast for the year last week and said it expected autumn season sales at its over 850 locations to be down by 3-6 per cent, against its original forecast of a 1 per cent drop.The second half of September also hit Best Buy, whose consumer electronics sales had previously largely shrugged off the slowdown.After previously running at more than 5 per cent, its comparable domestic sales dropped by 2 per cent in September, with the company blaming the impact on discretionary spending of “heightened turmoil in the financial markets” and general economic conditions.Best Buy also announced it expected to hire fewer seasonal workers during the holiday at its more than 900 stores, predicting that it would hire 16,000-20,000 people, down from the 26,000 last year, in spite of having expanded its store base by more than 60 stores.Eric Wiseman, chief executive of VF Corp, said the company was expecting a challenging 2009, with retailers already pulling back on spring season orders.“There is caution out there, and we’re seeing that caution reflected in our order base going forward,” Mr Wiseman said."
336;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US high-end retailers battered;;Cut-backs by America’s wealthiest shoppers amid Wall Street’s woes drove down sales at the country’s most exclusive stores in September, according to sales data released on Wednesday by leading retailers.Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based retailer which operates 64 luxury stores, said comparable sales at its stores fell 15.8 per cent during the month, while its overall revenues fell 11.1 per cent.The retailer’s monthly sales declines are the worst reported by the retailer since September 2002.Neiman Marcus warned last month that it expected its three New York area stores, which include Bergdforf Goodman in Manhattan, to be hit by Wall Street’s troubles ands by a decline in spending by tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar.Its September sales also reflected the hurricanes that affected its Texas stores.Burt Tansky, CEO, said that “based on our September performance and the current economic environment, we expect customer demand will remain weak for an extended period of time”, and warned that the retailer had higher than expected inventory levels.Saks, which derives 20 per cent of its revenue from its flagship store in New York, reported a 10 per cent fall in its comparable sales and a 11.1 per cent fall in total revenues. Nordstrom, which targets a more mainstream affluent customer, reported a 9.6 per cent drop in comparable sales and a 5.8 per cent fall in revenues.Saks said in a statement that it “anticipates the extremely challenging economic environment will continue”, and said it was now expecting sales in the second hald of its fiscal year to drop below its estimate of a low-single digit decline.Blake Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said that ”the consumer environment has been impacted by events in the financial markets over the past month”, as the retailer lowered its third quarter earnings forecast by 17 cents, to 32 to 37 cents per share.The dramatic slowdown in spending at Neiman, whose holiday gift catalogue this year includes exotic luxury items such as a $60,000 personalised portrait Lego replicas, contrasted with the more robust performance at Wal-Mart and at discount warehouse clubs focused on low cost food and basics.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s stores and supercenters rose 2 per cent during the month, while sales at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores rose 4.6 per cent. Costco and BJ’s, the discount club stores, saw US store sales excluding fuel increase by 6 and 5.6 per cent respectively.Richard Galanti, Costco’s CFO, told investors that the retailer was seeing high double digit sales of food and grocery items, while sales of bigger ticket items such as televisions, jewellery and furniture were declining.Stores more focused on discretionary purchases struggled. Target, the discounter that has a heavy focus on fashion and housewares, saw its comparable sales drop 3 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 12.4 per cent and 5.5 per cent. Both retailers cut their third quarter earnings forecasts.Clothing retailers - some of whom report sales on Thursday - have also seen falling sales. American Eagle said its comparable sales were down 6 per cent, and lowered its earnings forecast, while youth brand Zumiez reported a 9 per cent drop.The gloomy same store sales numbers followed consumer spending data released earlier this week by MasterCard Advisors’ Spending Pulse, which reported declines in all sales categories in September.The report, based on MasterCard credit card spending data and estimates of other forms of payment, said sales at speciality retail stores - which include clothing sellers and department stores - fell 7.7 per cent aganst the same period last year, following a 4.1 per cent decline in August.
337;TGT;Target Corp;2008-09-04T18:36:25Z;Thriftiness boosts US lower-cost stores;;US shoppers maintained their focus on keeping costs down as they embarked on the “back-to-school” shopping season, favouring Wal-Mart and other low-cost retailers over department and fashion stores, according to August sales figures.Wal-Mart saw sales at its supercentre and discount stores open at least a year rise 2.8 per cent, led by its grocery and health sales, which includes pharmacy. Together with its Sam’s Club warehouse stores, sales rose 3 per cent, ahead of its forecast of between 1 and 2 per cent growth.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, said the retailer had gained market share as a result of the relative strength of its business. The retailer forecast comparable sales growth of between 2 and 3 per cent for September.Wal-Mart again outdid Target, its main rival, which aims at attracting more discretionary spending. Target’s comparable sales fell 2.1 per cent.JC Penney and Kohls, the department stores, reported comparable sales falls of 4.9 and 5.8 per cent respectively on Wednesday.However, other price-focused stores did comparatively well, with the Family Dollar chain reporting a 3.6 per cent increase in sales at its network of small neighbourhood stores. Costco and BJ’s, the bulk warehouse club stores, reported US comparable sales gains of 6 per cent and 7.7 per cent, excluding their fuel sales.At BJ’s, bulk food sales far outstripped other goods, up 11 per cent, against a 2 per cent increase for general merchandise, in another indication of shoppers focusing on saving money.In teen fashion – normally a beneficiary of back-to-school spending – the lower-priced Aeropostale chain reported a 13 per cent in­crease in comparable sales, while Abercrombie & Fitch saw comparable sales fall 11 per cent.Ken Perkins, of Retail Metrics, said the data showed that “necessities have taken centre-stage against a backdrop of rising prices and less discretionary income”.Retail Metrics’ monthly index of same-store sales rose 2 per cent.Sanjay Srikanth of retail consultants AT Kearney said the back-to-school performance underlined concerns about the coming holiday season. “Everyone is tightening their inventories and expecting a fairly difficult holiday season relative to last year.”The S&P 500 was down 1.8 per cent on Thursday at lunchtime amid broad-based weakness. The S&P retail index was down 1.4 per cent, led by a 6.6 per cent fall in TJ Maxx and a decline of 5.9 per cent in Abercrombie and Fitch. Wal-Mart was up 1.3 per cent.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
338;TGT;Target Corp;2008-09-01T21:35:32Z;Amazon to make web more open to blind;;Amazon, the world’s largest internet retailer, will be required to make some of its web software more accessible to blind people, under the terms of a $6m legal settlement agreed between Target, the discount retailer, and the National Federation of the Blind.The NFB took legal action two years ago against Target in California, arguing that its e-commerce website, one of the busiest in the US, was not sufficiently accessible to software programs used by blind people to read online text aloud.Under the terms of a settlement, Target has agreed to implement a new design code for its site, to fix a list of issues, and to work with the NFB to improve features on the site.The changes include making it possible to navigate the entire website with a keyboard, rather than a mouse, and the creation of easily understandable text that appears when a cursor passes over a picture or graphic.Chris Danielson, of the NFB, said the group welcomed the settlement, and hoped that it “will give an incentive to other websites to look at accessibility”.“Most websites are at least somewhat accessible to blind people…there are a very few at one end that are completely inaccessible, and some at the other end that have no problems whatsoever, and most fall along that continuum.”Several of the changes on Target’s site called for by the settlement, such as new “header tabs” on its home page, will directly involve Amazon, whose enterprise solutions division provides the technological core of the site on behalf of Target.Amazon Enterprise Solutions provides website technology to Marks and Spencer, Mothercare, Lacoste and Timex.The NFB has an agreement with Amazon under which it is working with the retailer to ensure “full and equal” access for blind people both to its own site, and to those of the merchants it supports.Under the terms, neither side is able to comment on progress, although it originally envisioned achieving “free and equal” access to Amazon’s site at the end of last year.The NFB’s legal case against Target went ahead after California’s state court ruled that the complaint was covered by the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled people have full access to all public facilities and buildings, as well as telecoms services.Cynthia Waddell, of the International Center for Disability Resources on the Internet, noted that the court had also ruled in the case that the state’s Ralph Civil Rights Act requires all websites, not just those of groups with a physical presence such as a retailer, to provide equal access to disabled people. “I don’t think this is on the radar of most businesses yet.”
339;TGT;Target Corp;2008-08-27T22:21:55Z;US shoppers turn away from credit;;Middle-class US consumers are increasingly leaving their credit cards at home when they go shopping, extending a trend first shown by Wal-Mart’s low-income shoppers last year, and adding to the pressures on US retailers’ sluggish sales.Mainstream retailers are reporting that shoppers are opting for debit cards or cash instead of credit cards as they face tighter credit limits, illustrating how the wider credit crunch is being transferred to main street spending.Target, the discounter with over 1,500 stores across the US, said last week that it had seen the share of total payments made using credit cards fall for the first time ever in its second quarter, while the use of debit cards continued to rise.The retailer said the resulting slowing of credit use has in turn hurt its sales performance – which saw a slight decline in sales at stores open for at least a year during the quarter.“Clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards…is one of the issues that is determining our same-store sales performance in the current environment,” Doug Scovanner, Target’s chief operating officer, told investors.Lowe’s, the US home improvement retailer whose sales fell 5.3 per cent year-on-year in the six months to August 1, also reported an increase in the mix of cash and debit card use during the latest quarter.Kohl’™s, the budget department store chain, reported an increase in the use of its Kohl’s credit card, which rewards loyal shoppers with monthly savings.But it said the share of payments made by regular bank credit cards and cash had both declined, while it also saw a rise in debit card use. The retailers’ experiences on the shop floor reflect the broader slowdown in the growth of credit.MasterCard, the payments network, said US credit card use was virtually unchanged in the second quarter, with a slight 0.7 per cent increase in total payments, against a 16 per cent increase in debit card use.Visa’s US credit card payments increased 8 per cent, while debit card use increased by 16 per cent.In addition to accepting bank credit cards, most US retailers also issue their own charge cards and co-branded credit cards in partnership with issuing banks.Retailers use these own-brand cards to promote customer loyalty through offering discounts to card holders, and to gather data on their customers’ shopping habits.However, both banks and retailers have been tightening the terms both on their existing cards and on new applicants, in part to reflect declining credit scores that are the result of the increasing economic pressures on their customers.Lowe’s said the share of payments using its own-brand credit card fell 100 basis points in the second quarter to 22 per cent.Target, which co-issues store-branded credit cards with JPMorgan Chase, has followed other card issuers by increasing interest charges on existing accounts and what it describes as “aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting”.Home Depot, the second largest US retailer, says it has seen “significant erosion” of credit scores which led it to reduce some credit limits on existing card holders whose cards accounted for almost 30 per cent of its sales last year.Wesley McDonald, Kohl’s chief financial officer, noted that while its charge card performed strongly in the second quarter, accounting for 44 per cent of sales, the rate at which it is issuing new cards is slowing.“Part of that is just obviously with people having more economic difficulties, their credit scores are falling across the country,” he told investors this month.
340;TGT;Target Corp;2008-08-19T20:47:00Z;Wall Street stocks endure further pain;;"US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors responded to deepening worries about the financial sector, inflation and disappointing economic data.Financials continued to lead losses in the broader stock market, with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae once again in sharp focus.Worries about possible dilutive capital-raising by the two government-sponsored mortgage lenders led to further losses with Freddie shares down 5 per cent at $4.17 and Fannie shares falling 2.3 per cent to $6.01. Both had fallen sharply in the previous session.Lehman Brothers shares fell 13 per cent to $13.07 amid reports that the Wall Street bank might sell part of its investment-management business and as analysts raised the possibility of further writedowns.Most other financial sector companies, with the exception of credit card providers, were in negative territory for the day. Among other big fallers were HSBC, whose depository receipts fell 2.5 per cent to $77.29; Wells Fargo, down 3.5 per cent to $27.79; and JPMorgan, which was 3.2 per cent lower at $35.58. Morgan Stanley shares were 3.8 per cent down at $38.08.American International Group fell back as analysts warned of the possibility of more writedowns. Its shares lost 5.9 per cent to $20.32.The S&P Financial Index was off 3 per cent for the day at 267.18, while the S&P Investment Banking Index was down 3.2 per cent at 106.30.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.9 per cent lower at 1,266.70 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 1.35 per cent lower at 2,384.36 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.1 per cent at 11,348.55 points.Stock market investors responded to two pieces of economic news.Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy, jumped 0.7 per cent in July after a 0.2 per cent June increase, the fastest rise in monthly core producer prices since November 2006.Michael Woolfolk, a senior strategist at The Bank of New York Mellon, said: “The rise in core inflation is troubling. It is clear that headline inflation is spilling over into the core at an accelerating rate.”US builders slowed construction on new homes in July to the lowest annual rate in 16 years. The US commerce department said US July housing starts fell 11 per cent to a 965,000 annual rate, the lowest level since March 1991.That sent homebuilder shares to a three-week low. Shares in Centex Corporation were down 4.5 per cent at $14.05 and those in Pulte Homes fell 3.7 per cent to $12.07.In earnings news, several retailers issued downbeat results, as consumers continued to cut spending amid the slowing of the wider economy.Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, reported a 24 per cent drop in second-quarter profit.Home Depot said earnings fell to $1.2bn, or 71 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $1.59bn, or 81 cents a share, in the same period last year. The shares were down 3.7 per cent at $25.96. Retail group Target reported a 7.6 per cent drop in second-quarter profit. Its shares in fell 0.7 per cent to $49.72.Shares in retailers Saks and Staples dropped after both companies said that their second-half performances would miss forecasts.Saks shares fell 8.3 per cent to $10.29 after it reported its biggest quarterly loss in two years on discounts for women’s apparel and said second-half sales would be lower than it had forecast.The S&P retailers index was dragged down by the generally disappointing earnings news to stand at 2.7 per cent lower at 383.12. Hewlett-Packard reported a slight rise in second-quarter earnings after the market closed and its shares rose in after hours trading having ended the trading session down 2 per cent at $43.69.In corporate news, aircraft builder General Dynamics agreed to buy Swiss company Jet Aviation for $2.25bn in cash. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2008. Shares in General Dynamics were down 0.3 per cent at $91.99.The energy sector held up relatively well amid the wider sell-off, with most companies in positive territory as the price of crude oil made ground after falls in early trading."
341;TGT;Target Corp;2008-08-19T18:28:52Z;Leading stores suffer from US slowdown;;The breadth of the slowdown in discretionary US spending was underlined on Tuesday by quarterly results from Home Depot, the home improvement store, Target, the mass discounter, and Saks, the luxury fashion retailer.Saks saw its shares fall over 8 per cent to $10.29 at the New York close after it reported a $31.7m loss on softening demand for its luxury ­clothing, shoes and accessories.Saks also predicted flat or falling comparable sales for the second half of the year. Over the first six months of the year Saks comparable store sales have increased just 2.7 per cent, compared to the high-single digit growth it saw before the economic slowdown started to hit higher-end consumers at the end of last year.Steve Sadove, chief executive, said that the retailer had “experienced a softening across nearly all geographies and merchandise categories” during the quarter.He also said that the retailer had seen price increases of between 10 and 15 per cent in the cost of some of its European brands which it would pass on to customers in the coming weeks, reflecting the weakness of the dollar over much of the current year.The retailer said sales commissions from its leased departments, which include Louis Vuitton handbags - were unchanged from the previous quarterThe retailer reported a net loss of $31.7m, or 23 cents per share, while revenues fell 3 per cent to $669m, a fall due in part to the shift of a spring clearance sale to the first quarter.At the other end of the retail spectrum, Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement store, reported a 5.4 per cent fall in total sales, and a 7.9 per cent fall in comparable stores, as sales of products from paint to electrical goods fell.Comparable sales of stores in California and Florida – the areas in the US most hit by the housing slump – fell by more than 10 per cent, mirroring results at Home Depot’s rival, Lowe’s.Carol Tome, Home Depot’s chief financial officer, said that, while statistics suggested that the decline in home improvement spending should be bottoming out, other factors such as the uncertain mortgage market and rising costs for consumers were continuing to weigh on the sector.“We should be getting towards the bottom, but there’s all this other ­uncertainty that cause us to remain cautious not just for the back half of 2008, but also into 2009,” she said.Target, the mass ­discounter which aims at a more prosperous customer than its market rival, Wal-Mart, also reported a fall in profits and sales, with net earnings down 8 per cent to $634m.While new store openings pushed total revenues to $15bn, sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.4 per cent.Home Depot’s shares fell over 2 per cent to $26.39 while Target’s shares slipped less than one per cent to $49.70
342;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Investors take steps to foil activist ploy;;Investors who have grown frustrated with one of shareholder activism’s classic moneymaking ploys – buying stock in a company and then calling publicly for it to be sold at a premium – are starting to take matters into their own hands.Harbinger Capital and Pershing Square Capital, the activist hedge funds, have hired bankers or lawyers to find buyers for companies they have invested in, often without shareholder or management’s consent.Harbinger used Moelis & Co, the boutique merger advisory firm, to drum up bid interest in Cleveland-Cliffs, the iron ore miner, earlier in the year, and is using the same strategy in regard to AK Steel, the US steel producer, say people familiar with the matter.Pershing Square recently announced in a regulatory filing it hired advisers in connection with its purchase of a stake in Longs Drug Stores. Pershing saw Longs as a takeover target for CVS Caremark or Walgreens, and used lawyers to gauge whether a deal with either company would present antitrust risks.Pershing Square had not yet hired bankers in Longs’ case, but Bill Ackman, the Pershing founder, has done so at times. He currently has bankers evaluating Target, the retailer, and used Blackstone to pin a value on the Wendy’s fast food chain.The most common modus operandi of activist shareholders when trying to spark a takeover tends to be a public letter to a company’s board of directors calling for a sale. But some funds are working more often to mitigate risk by stirring a sale process directly.“It is fascinating when a hedge fund is having someone on its behalf go out to beat the bushes to find perspective buyers,” one merger adviser said. “You’ve got an activist who is taking more extraordinary steps than usual,” the adviser said, “rather than just annoying management and the board.”Hedge funds do not need a company’s blessing to fan out into the market in search of takeover suitors willing to pay a high enough price. Bankers can also help activists establish clout in suggesting other courses of action, such as restructurings or share buy-backs.“Banks take on a degree of reputational risk, particularly when they’re advising a hedge fund,” one investor said. “Very often, it can create a stronger impression if you can get a top five investment bank to agree with you.”It is not clear that an age has dawned in which shareholders can ostensibly “sell” a company without management’s participation, however. The strategy is not always successful.The biggest hurdles for hedge funds may be reputational. If a company is not convinced it should sell, suitors might not want to irk its board by participating in a hedge fund-run process – a concern that deterred some companies that looked at Cleveland-Cliffs.Hedge fund attempts to rouse takeover bids can also be limited by a lack of access to confidential information, which the target would have to agree to provide.Harbinger’s attempt to solicit suitors for Cleveland-Cliffs, in which it is the biggest stakeholder, has so far been unsuccessful. Cleveland-Cliffs instead announced a deal to buy Alpha Natural Resources, the coal miner, which Harbinger opposes.Pershing Square’s investment in Longs proved well-timed. But while one person close to that situation felt Pershing and its advisers’ presence may have sparked the deal, another called it “pure coincidence”.The jury is still out on AK Steel, in which Harbinger owned a 13 per cent stake according to recent filings. Speculation that the company could be a takeover target resumed last month, helping drive up its share price.But there was no formal sale process under way at AK Steel at that time, merger advisers said. Harbinger did not return calls and AK Steel declined to comment.
343;TGT;Target Corp;2008-08-07T21:06:44Z;Wall Street stocks fall on AIG losses;;US stocks fell back for the first time in three sessions on Thursday as further losses at AIG hurt the financial sector and Wal-Mart posted disappointing July sales figures.AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime losses, slumped as much as 19.1 per cent, its biggest one-day drop in 39 years, after posting a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss of $5.4bn. By the close, the stock was down 18.1 per cent to $23.84.Analysts at Barclays Capital said: “Although we would be surprised to see large writedowns of the same magnitude over the next two quarters, we believe that the risk of additional impairment remains, adding to investor concerns about capital deficiency. In addition, we believe that further downgrades could be on the cards.”Meanwhile, Citigroup said it would buy back more than $7bn worth of auction rate securities and take a $100m fine as part of an agreement to settle claims that it mis-sold the instruments to clients. Citigroup lost 4.3 per cent to $18.85.The sell-off in financials gathered pace in mid-afternoon after Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade American Express’s debt rating and the sector closed down 5 per cent.JPMorgan Chase slipped 3.8 per cent to $39.81, Bank of America dipped 5.8 per cent to $31.52 and American Express slid 4.2 per cent to $36.40.Consumer-facing stocks faced headwinds from volatile oil prices and some poor sales data from retailers.Wal-Mart said same-store sales grew less than expected last month and forecast slower sales growth in August, which suggested that the temporary fillip from tax rebates was beginning to fade.The shares slid 6.3 per cent, the most in six years, to $56.96 on that bleak prospect.Meanwhile, Whole Foods and Kimberly-Clark dipped 5.9 per cent to $18.88 and 3.5 per cent to $58.48 respectively.That overshadowed better-than-expected July sales for Costco Wholesale and an improved outlook from JC Penney. Costco shares rose 0.2 per cent to $65.82 while JC Penney added 6.1 per cent to $33.53.The consumer discretionary sector fell 2 per cent as Target and Abercrombie & Fitch dropped 4.7 per cent to $45.76 and 10.6 per cent to $49.80 respectively after they posted disappointing same store sales in July.Markets took another leg down after the release of the latest batch of numbers on employment.The number of Americans making first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose 7,000 to 455,000 from 448,000 a week earlier. That is the highest level in six years.All 10 leading industry groups closed in the red, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1.8 per cent to 1,266.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.9 per cent to 11,431.43 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,355.73On Wednesday stocks climbed to their highest levels since the end of June, shrugging off morning worries about wider-than-expected losses at Freddie Mac as oil prices dropped and positive results buoyed the technology sector.So far this earnings season, more than 400 S&P 500 companies have reported results and, on average, profit has declined by about 21 per cent.Information technology companies have posted some of the best performances. Their profits have grown by an average of 18 per cent this quarter.On Thursday, Teradata led the sector higher. The data storage software provider reported second-quarter profits that beat analysts’ estimates and its shares rose 6.6 per cent to $24.40.The sector was among the best performers, giving up only 0.1 per cent.Semiconductor stocks also made ground after Citigroup analysts suggested Intel was on course to meet “aggressive” third-quarter revenue growth targets thanks to the popularity of its Atom chip.Intel climbed 3.8 per cent to $23.67, Advanced Micro Devices rose 4.8 per cent to $5.03 while SanDisk added 6.1 per cent to $16.17.Markets also took a measure of solace from the most recent housing data, which showed an unexpected bounce in pending home sales, although homebuilder stocks themselves were largely unmoved.
344;TGT;Target Corp;2008-08-07T18:26:30Z;Hard-up US shoppers spurn bigger stores;;The boost to US retailers from about $100bn of tax rebate cheques has proved short-lived, with leading chains on Thursday reporting sluggish or falling sales in July, while Wal-Mart warned of slowing sales ahead.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said it expected August sales in stores open at least a year to grow by between 1 and 2 per cent, after reporting 3 per cent sales growth in July.“With the end of the stimulus checks, we know consumers are spending more cautiously, and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month,” said Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US business.Consumers received about $100bn in rebate checks between April and mid-July as part of the Bush administrations’ economic stimulus package from earlier this year. Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its index of comparable retail sales for July rose 2.3 per cent.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that positive factors such as warm weather and the back-to-school shopping season “could not overcome broader macro-economic drags”.The latest monthly sales figures from retailers underlined shifts in US shopping habits identified by Procter & Gamble and other suppliers, as more frugal consumers turn to discount stores, warehouse clubs and to hard discount “dollar stores” and make fewer shopping trips to reduce fuel costs.Mr Castro-Wright said Wal-Mart was also continuing “to see improvement in our customer traffic, relative to last year”, an indication that the low-cost stores are attracting shoppers from rivals.Target, Wal-Mart’s smaller and more upmarket competitor, reported a 1.3 per cent fall in comparable sales, and predicted a further decline in August.Costco, the largest US warehouse club, also reported healthy results for the month, with same store sales excluding fuel sales up 6 per cent in the US.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small hard-discount stores, saw its comparable sales rise 4.6 per cent, following an 8 per cent increase in June.Department stores and clothing retailers continued to feel the pressure on their monthly sales figures, as they try to stock less, in response to slower demand, and avoid ending up with excess inventory that has to be cleared at sale prices.JC Penney, the mid-range department store whose performance has tracked the broader decline in consumer spending, reported a 6.5 per cent fall in comparable sales, although last July’s numbers were boosted by a shift in reporting of back-to-school sales. But the company predicted sales growth in the low single-digits in August. It also raised its earnings guidance for the current quarter, from 38 cents to 50 to 52 cents, citing effective cost management and inventory control. Its shares rose more than 7 per cent.Its rival, Kohl’s, reported a 10 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year. Larry Montgomery, its CEO, said that the reduced inventory had depressed sales but led to improved gross margins.Gap, the largest speciality retailer, said its comparable sales fell 5 per cent, while the figure for its Old Navy stores was down 16 per cent. However, the company said it had successfully increased its margins, it also raised its earnings guidance, to $1.30 to $1.35 from its previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.27.
345;TGT;Target Corp;2008-07-04T17:46:24Z;Outsourcing too much to bear for Steiff;;In the 106 years since it was invented, the cuddly teddy bear has become a bellwether of capitalism.The plush toy was pioneered by Steiff, the German company that claims it made the first bear with moveable arms and legs in 1902.The mohair and felt invention came just as the citizens of the US were celebrating the humaneness of then president Theodore Roosevelt, who spared a bear on a hunting trip. Steiff was soon able to snag a burgeoning export market.A hundred years later, the company helped swell the outsourcing wave as it moved about a fifth of production from high-cost Germany to low-cost China. Five years later, it is in the throes of moving it back, having learnt that cost is not everything.The privately-owned company in southern Germany joins a steady stream of small, specialised western companies that have found the lure of cheap Asian labour outweighed by the added difficulties – many unforeseen – of manufacturing there.“We have learnt our products are better if we make them ourselves,” says Martin Frechen, co-chief executive of the firm in Giengen, Baden-Württemberg.“The things we wanted to be done were not the things the Chinese were used to doing.” He stresses that Steiff never had the problems with safety standards that some US importers have struggled with. “Things were also fine in terms of quality,” he says. “But when we looked at whether this was sustainable, big question marks arose.”This was less a symptom of purported Chinese laxity than changing priorities at Steiff. Mr Frechen and co-chief executive Wilfried Blömke-Trox, installed in 2006 and 2007 respectively, decided to bring the brand back to its high-quality roots.“Steiff had tried to enter the €20-€30 ($31-$47) range – before, some products had sold for €100,” Mr Frechen says. “But cheapness meant an end to uniqueness. So we switched from price back to quality” – a Steiff bear now costs €30-€80.But the high turnover of staff in China made for problems. “It takes eight to 12 months to get a seamstress up to speed,” Mr Frechen says. “As sewing is difficult and making microchips easier, we worried about keeping enough trained staff.”There were also the disadvantages of distance that Steiff had born stoically up till then. High transport costs and overbooked container ships meant the company had to buy pricey space in advance, sometimes to find out no shipment was ready. Outsourced production is meant to be fully in-sourced again by late 2009 to factories in Germany, Portugal and Tunisia. They employ 800 people. Transport savings and selling more expensive products are expected to cover the rise in the wage bill.Mr Frechen declines to divulge numbers. But he says repositioning the brand and moving production is helping a bottom line hit when Steiff went down market five years ago.He clearly feels global trends in manufacturing are less to blame for Steiff’s roller-coaster ride than changes in the retail front end. He notes that US department stores once accounted for 30 per cent of toy sales, but today that figure is just 1 per cent.“Soft toys in the US are now dominated by the discounters. Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us account for over two-thirds of sales,” he says. “Retailers and customers think soft toys have to be cheap – it’s a trend we’re seeing elsewhere as well.”As a result, Mr Frechen says, Chinese toy manufacturers “always think in terms of price and volume”. Any one with “complicated” criteria should think about keeping manufacturing in-house. “We say soft toys don’t have to be cheap,” he says.“For children, surely only the best is good enough – the best design, the best production, the best safety standards.“Soft toys help to comfort children, they’re vital for a child’s development,” he says.And maybe for capitalism’s, too.
346;TGT;Target Corp;2008-06-05T14:58:53Z;Wal-Mart sales jump at rivals’ expense;;Sales at Wal-Mart again outperformed its competitors in May, suggesting that it the US discount retailer is set to benefit greatly from federal tax refunds aimed at stimulating the economy.Wal-Mart’s US outlets open at least a year saw sales rise 4 per cent, supported by strong activity in basic goods, including groceries and pharmacy products. Including its Sam’s Club discount warehouse stores, comparable sales rose 3.9 per cent, against the retailer’s original forecast of an increase in the flat-to-2 per cent range.But a range of other major retailers saw comparable sales fall in May. Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket competitor, reported a 0.7 per cent fall in comparable sales. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores, saw their sales down 4.4 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, saw its global same store sales fall 14 per cent, with a huge 25 per cent fall in sales at its troubled Old Navy chain, and a 7 per cent fall in Gap brand stores.Tom Schoewe, Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, said Wal-Mart’s comparatively strong performance had benefited in part from spending linked to tax refund cheques cashed by the retailer during the month that had exceeded $350m.While he said that it was not possible for the retailer to know how much of this money had been spent at its stores, he noted that “there’s been a positive difference from that”.Mr Schoewe said Wal-Mart is also benefiting from improved operations, merchandising and marketing at a time when its low cost format is in-line with consumers’ need to economise.May was the first month in which American households began receiving tax refunds of up to $600 per eligible adult under the federal economic stimulus package.Mr Schoewe said that Wal-Mart had also seen an increase in store visits during the month, with greater increases continuing to come at more affluent stores, suggesting that the retailer is gaining market share from competitors as customers “trade down” to the low-price discounter.Customers, he said, remained focused on basics, such as food and pharmacy, which “is a big portion of total basket”.He also noted that Wal-Mart’s home business saw its first growth in comparable sale for two years, which he suggested might reflect reports that Ameicans are saving money by going out less.“While they’re under pressure and disposable income is down it appears to us that that family might be spending more time at home …we’re seeing prepared meals, pizzas and those kind of things ramping up,” he said.Costco and BJ’s, both discount warehouse clubs, also delivered strong comparable sales growth, as Americans turned to their low cost bulk sales. BJ’s, which operates 178 stores mostly in the east of the US, said its sales of food rose 11 per cent, while non-food sales were flat. Its comparable sales excluding fuel increased 6.8 per cent.
347;TGT;Target Corp;2008-06-03T16:49:21Z;China and Wal-Mart: the champions of equality;;The US presidential campaign has sometimes sounded like a contest to prove who despises trade the most. Media reports of job losses to China and the destructive effect of Wal-Mart on local businesses are ubiquitous. In recent weeks, Lawrence Summers and Martin Wolf have in the Financial Times both highlighted the dangers of having high-income countries turn against globalisation. This public debate has taken for granted that inequality in these countries has risen as a result of globalisation.But has it really? In a recent paper*, co-authored with John Romalis from the University of Chicago, I argue that it has not. The reason is simple. How rich you are depends on two things: how much money you have, and how much the goods you buy cost. If your income doubles but the prices of the goods you consume also doubles, you are no better off. Unfortunately the conventional wisdom on US inequality is based on official measures that look only at the first half, the income differential. National statistics ignore the fact that inflation affects people in different income groups unevenly because the rich and poor consume different baskets of goods.Inflation differentials between the rich and poor dramatically change our view of the evolution of inequality in the US. Inflation of the richest 10 per cent of US households has been 6 percentage points higher than that of the poorest 10 per cent in the period 1994-2005. This means that real inequality in the US, if measured correctly, has been roughly unchanged.The reason is just as dramatic as the result. Why has inflation for the poor been lower than that for the rich? In large part it is because of China and Wal-Mart.Poor families in America spend a larger share of their income on goods whose prices are directly affected by trade – such as clothing and food – than wealthier families. By contrast, the higher a person’s income, the more they spend on services, which are less subject to competition from abroad. Since 1994 the price of goods in the US has risen much less than the price of services – and, yes, this includes the recent surge in food prices. Focusing on the past few quarters of high relative food prices misses the fact that the main trend we have observed for decades is exactly the opposite.This trend can partly be explained by China. Prices of consumer goods in US stores have fallen most heavily in sectors where the Chinese presence has increased most. In canned seafood or cotton shirts, for example, where China’s exports to the rest of the world have increased dramatically this decade, inflation has been negative. In sectors where there is no Chinese presence, inflation has been more than 20 per cent. Moreover, as China produces goods of relatively low quality, sectors that have a strong Chinese presence are disproportionately consumed by the poor.The expansion of superstores – such as Wal-Mart and Target – has also played an important role in accounting for the inflation differentials between rich and poor. Superstores sell the same products as traditional shops but at much lower prices. Today the poor buy roughly twice as much of their non-durable goods in these stores as the rich do. Poor consumers have therefore been the biggest beneficiaries of Wal-Mart’s coming to a town.What is really worrying is that, in spite of these facts, we have had a backlash against China and Wal-Mart in the US. Trade sceptics who suggest that there is no point in buying cheaper goods if you have lost your job should check America’s unemployment rate again. It is about 5 per cent, close to its record low.We need to remind politicians and the public that the gains from trade are broadly shared. Every time the discussion of trade is diverted towards problems facing specific producers – from farmers in France to textile workers in the US – the central point is missed. Trading allows everyone, and especially the poor, to buy things that they could not otherwise afford.Without better public understanding of these facts governments will not only keep supporting policies that are aimed against China and Wal-Mart but may receive the uninformed support of many consumers who are benefiting from trade.*Inequality and Prices: Does China benefit the Poor in America?

348;TGT;Target Corp;2008-05-21T20:50:43Z;Wall St falls sharply as Fed minutes released;;US stock markets fell sharply for a second session on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it was finished with rate-cuts for the moment even as it slashed its economic growth forecasts and raised its projections for inflation and unemployment.The day began in downbeat fashion as oil prices continued their relentless climb, cruising past $133 a barrel and casting a pall on equity indices. Spot oil prices hit above $134 in after-hours trading, up more than $5 on the day.The moves hit the consumer discretionary sector, swamping some positive deal news that Time Warner is to spin off its cable division while Barnes & Noble is considering a bid for rival bookseller Borders.Oil-dependent industries such as air transport were pummelled by the threat of dramatic input cost increases. Losses accelerated in mid-afternoon, when the minutes of the FOMC meeting in April revealed that the 25 basis point rate cut had been a “close call” with rising inflation risks weighing against growth concerns.Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research said: “What really scared people was the fact that the Fed cut their growth numbers and they talked a little about inflation so in essence they have opened the door to rate hikes down the road. Throw in the fact that oil is up again and we have pretty big sell-off.”All 10 leading industry groups on the S&P 500 fell back, with materials stocks leading the way.Financials followed close behind, dragged down by revelations in the Financial Times that computer modelling errors caused Moody’s to mistakenly assign top-notch ratings to debt securities that later fell in value.Ratings agencies have been criticised for their part in the mortgage backed securities market, the collapse of which triggered the credit crisis.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.6 per cent to 1,390.75 points, its first close below 1,400 in eight days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also suffered, falling 1.8 per cent to 12,601.76 points - it’s biggest one day fall in a month. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.8 per cent to 2,448.27.On Tuesday, equity markets pulled back from four-month highs amid rising oil prices, data showing a bump in core inflation and a number of analyst earnings downgrades to the banking sector.The chronic and well-publicised woes of financials over the past year have wiped hundreds of billions of dollars off the market capitalisation of the leading players with the result that the sector has been overtaken by technology as the biggest on the S&P 500.Still, neither sector fared well on Wednesday. Financials fell 2.6 per cent, led lower by Moody’s, which tumbled 15.9 per cent to $36.91. McGraw-Hill, owner of rival ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, fell 5.5 per cent to $41.18.Technology stocks came under pressure in mid-afternoon. Google and Apple lost 4.9 per cent to $549.99 and 4.2 per cent to $178.19 respectively.Fears about rising energy and input prices weighed on the consumer discretionary sector. Stephen Wood, Senior Portfolio Strategist at Russell Investments, said: “Given what is happening with housing prices, the credit markets and with oil, we are looking at more muted economic and consumer activity.”Retailers Macy’s and Target fell 5.6 per cent to $23.18 and 2.6 per cent to $52.87, but some deal news helped pare losses for the sector to 1.9 per cent.Time Warner, the media company, agreed to spin off Time Warner Cable. Time Warner owns 84 per cent of Time Warner Cable and has been under pressure to relinquish the business and focus on turning round its ailing AOL internet division. Time Warner shares rose 0.6 per cent to $16.24 while Time Warner Cable shares added 3.5 per cent to $31.27.Bid speculation enveloped booksellers. Borders rose 8.8 per cent to $6.91 and Barnes & Noble was flat at $29.95.Among US carriers, Continental Airlines fell 13.2 per cent to $14.20, United Airlines parent UAL dropped 29.5 per cent to $8.15. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 24.2 per cent to $6.22 after it announced plans to cut domestic capacity.Materials groups fell 3 per cent – the most since early March. Allegheny Technologies lost 5.2 per cent to $77.41 while an analyst downgrade knocked Nucor 4.8 per cent to $76.01.
349;TGT;Target Corp;2008-05-20T18:00:55Z;Slowdown hits Target and Home Depot;;Home Depot and Target, two of the largest US retailers, illustrated the regional nature of pressures on US consumers Tuesday, as they announced quarterly falls in sales and increasing pressures on credit.Target, the mass discounter, reported an increase in write-offs in its credit card portfolio to a 7.6 per cent annualised rate, from 6 per cent last year. Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, said the problems were focused in Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada, states that have been particularly hard hit by the housing slowdown.“Our adverse experience in delinquencies, and our adverse experience in write-offs is very heavily concentrated in those four states,” which account for 30 per cent of the retailer’s overall credit card receivables.Frank Blake, chief executive of Home Depot, said the home improvement retailer’s stores in California and Florida remained most heavily hit by the housing slowdown.“It is hard to see a lot of improvement there. We’ve got other areas that have been relatively strong that have declined a bit,” he said, while pointing to continued relative strength in markets in Texas and the Midwest.Home Depot’s shares fell more than 5 per cent in New York, after it warned its full-year results would be at the lower end of its previously forecast decline of earnings between 19 and 24 per cent.For the first quarter, it reported a sharp fall in profits to $356m, or 21 cents a share, including a $543m one-off charge, linked to its decision to close 15 stores and to abandon plans for around 50 more.Excluding the charge, earnings were still down 22 per cent on the same quarter last year, as total sales fell 3.4 per cent to $17.9bn. Comparable sales at its US stores fell 8.4 per cent.Target reported a 7.5 per cent decline in quarterly profit to $602m, as sales grew 5 per cent to $14.3bn, as customers opted for lower margin basics and food products. Target focuses on a more up-market customer base than its larger rival Wal-Mart and has been harder hit by the pressures on US consumers.Gregg Steinhafel, who succeeded Bob Ulrich as CEO this year, said Target still expected low-level growth in sales throughout the remainder of the year and was committed to its goal of opening 80 to 100 new stores a year.Target said it was focusing on effectively controlling its inventory to respond to the the slowdown in demand, and on reducing operating expenses.Separately, Staples, the largest US office supplies retailer, reported a 6 per cent fall in quarterly sales at its US stores open at least a year, although international sales helped its total sales to increase 6 per cent to $4.9bn.Ron Sargeant, CEO, said the 6 per cent drop in US same-store sales illustrated that “monthly trend is bad, bad, and bad’’. But he expressed guarded optimism.“I do feel like we’re in the trough and the general direction is up from here.’’Staples on Monday launched a $2.34bn hostile bid for Corporate Express, the Dutch office supply retailer.
350;TGT;Target Corp;2008-05-08T20:36:56Z;Wall Street higher on retail sales;;US stocks posted modest gains on Thursday as investors responded to solid sales figures from Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and encouraging data on retail sales and jobless claims.Leading market indices moved from positive to negative within a fairly narrow range, before closing higher.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,397.68 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,451.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 12,866.78.Analysts were looking for leading retail chains to report a 2.5 per cent gain in same-store sales in April. If stores hit the forecasts, it would mark the biggest monthly rise in same-store sales since November.Target said April same-store sales rose 3.1 per cent, missing forecasts for a rise of 4.5 per cent. The company said sales were weakest in regions getting hit the hardest by the housing market collapse. Its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $52.34.Costco reported an 8 per cent sales gain for the period, topping a forecast of a 6.1 per cent rise. But this figure was boosted by petrol sales, and shares in the company were down 1.2 per cent at $71.20.McDonald’s reported a 5 per cent rise in same-store global sales as the company cited menu variety and longer hours as drivers of growth. Shares in the fast-food chain gained 0.7 per cent to $59.77.In economic news, initial jobless claims fell to 365,000 last week, down from a revised 383,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said.Economists had expected the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time to come in at 375,000.Wholesale inventories, a measure of lag in demand relative to expectations, slipped 0.1 per cent in March, down from a revised 0.9 per cent increase in February, according to the Commerce Department. Economists had expected inventories to climb by 0.5 per cent.Stocks had fallen their largest amount in a month during the previous session after record high oil prices hurt consumer and transport stocks and financials tumbled on speculation that new regulations will force them to disclose further losses.Oil futures were steady near record highs. US crude rose 3 cents after closing at a record settlement of $123.53 a barrel.In other corporate developments, News Corp’s chief operating officer, Peter Chernin, told investors the company was not in talks with Microsoft or Yahoo about a combination involving its MySpace online unit. News Corp shares rose 2.5 per cent to $19.68.Investors were bracing themselves for what were expected to be a poor set of earnings from American International Group, due after the closing bell. The world’s largest insurer is set to post a second consecutive quarterly loss due to its exposure to the subprime mortgage market. AIG shares were down 2.1 per cent at $44.15.On the upside, shoe retailer Crocs reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue late on Wednesday and said that second quarter and full-year 2008 profit were on target to meet previous forecasts, despite slowing US retail trends. Shares in Crocs soared 14.5 per cent to $11.40.Unilever shares were up 5.8 per cent at $34.35 after the company reported a better-than-forecast 34 per cent rise in quarterly net income.Toyota said late on Wednesday that profit in the January-to-March period tumbled 28 per cent due to the rising yen and weak North American sales. Toyota’s US traded shares were 4 per cent lower at $100.56.Mortgage companies’ shares were also weaker. Fannie Mae fell 4.9 per cent to $27.63 while Freddie Mac was 2.2 per cent lower at $25.43.Best Buy shares fell 3.2 per cent to $42.05 after the company said it would form a joint venture with Carphone Warehouse to establish a consumer electronics retail presence in Europe.Among other movers, Metal, mining and oil services stocks rose. Dow components Alcoa, Chevron and ExxonMobil all gained.Shares in Fortress Investment Group, the publicly traded alternative investment business, slid by 6.3 per cent to $13.65 on the New York Stock Exchange after it reported a $69m loss in the first quarter.
351;TGT;Target Corp;2008-05-01T19:22:21Z;Corporate US faces changing shopping habits;;Corporate America has been dealing with the damage done by the mortgage crisis and resulting credit crunch since last year, with the effects spreading gradually across consumer companies ranging from Tiffany, the jewellers, to Starbucks and General Motors.Yet the economic slowdown has not been bad news for everyone, reflecting both behavioural shifts among US consumers and the advantages enjoyed by those companies that are less reliant on the US domestic market than most of their rivals.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has a mass discount business that is focused on low-income consumers, who have been the hardest hit by rising fuel prices and tightening credit.But its sales have outperformed other mainstream retailers, including the department stores JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s, and Target, its more upmarket discount rival. Its shares have risen more than 30 per cent since October, to hit their highest levels for four years.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, this week offered investors data supporting the view that the retailer was benefiting as more affluent customers were “shopping down”. He said traffic at the hundreds of Wal-Mart stores classed as “affluent” – serving households with incomes in the $55,000-$75,000 range – had increased in March 2.3 percentage points above the average for the entire 3,500 store network.“We are capturing our customers from the more affluent segments,” he said.He noted that Wal-Mart’s customers overall were increasingly using cash, rather than credit. The trend continued even in the run-up to Christmas last year, when the share of credit would traditionally increase.Wal-Mart’s credit receipts in February and March, fell almost 6 per cent, compared with the same period in 2007.“People don’t have as much access to credit as they used to and clearly that is having an impact on how consumers behave,” he said.“This isn’t that people have decided that they can’t spend more, but they have gone beyond their ability to get any more credit . . . they’ve topped out,” he said.Frank Badillo, chief economist at consultants TNS Retail Forward, says there is increasing evidence in the US of shoppers responding differently to economic pressures in their shopping habits. The upper income shoppers are increasingly likely to go to a discounter such as Wal-Mart to buy their preferred brands, while low- and middle-income shoppers opt for store brands that cost less.“The upper income shopper is more likely to stick with brand buys but is more likely to shift shopping channel,” he says.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, suggests that is a factor in the continued strength of its leading brands such as Pampers and Tide.The only other bright spots on the corporate American landscape are those companies with large export markets, which are helped by the weak dollar, and those exposed to booming sectors, such as energy and mining, and emerging markets.In contrast to this week’s warning from Michelin, its European rival, Goodyear, the US tyremaker, reported strong first-quarter profits as the weak dollar boosted exports.Other strong quarterly performance came from Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of bulldozers, and Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, which were also buoyed by strong demand from overseas.Meanwhile, Kraft, the largest US food brand company, is trying to hold on to customers by producing smaller versions of its pizzas and deli meat packages at lower price points – traditionally a tactic used by consumer brands building market share in the developing world.
352;TGT;Target Corp;2008-04-10T17:45:24Z;Easter and slowdown depress US sales;;US retailers felt the brunt of the developing slowdown in consumer demand in March, with leading clothing chains and department stores reporting sales that were worse than already depressed expectations.Retailers said demand for the month was affected by the early Easter holiday, which fell on March 23 rather than in April. While Easter generally boosts sales of spring clothing and gifts, the holiday came as cold weather continued across much of the US, suppressing demand. Most retailers also missed a day because of Easter Sunday closures.JC Penney and Kohl’s – low-cost stores that focus on the middle-income heartland – said sales at their stores that had been open at least a year fell respectively by 12 per cent and 15.5 per cent. Gap, the largest speciality clothing retailer, reported an 18 per cent fall in comparable sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic brand stores. Dillard’s, the medium-sized department store chain, reported a 10 per cent fall in same store sales.Larry Montgomery, chief executive of Kohl’s, said weak sales of “weather-sensitive” items such as shorts, tank-tops and sandals “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall”.In an indication that the broad-based nature of the slowdown, Neiman Marcus, the luxury fashion store, reported a comparable sales increase of just 0.4 per cent, while Saks Fifth Avenue saw its same store sales fall 2.9 per cent.Nordstrom, a fashion department store that aims at more prosperous customers, reported a 9 per cent fall in comparable sales.However, Wal-Mart, the mass discounter that is the country’s largest retailer, again delivered a comparatively strong performance, with a 0.9 per cent increase in comparable sales at its more than 3,400 Wal-Mart outlets.Target, its more upmarket rival, saw same-store sales fall 4.4 per cent.Wal-Mart raised its guidance for the first quarter, with Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, citing effective inventory management that “has resulted in lower markdowns, expense leverage and reduced shrink”. It is now forecasting first quarter earnings per share of 74-76 cents, from 70-74 cents previously.Many retailers will benefit from an extra selling day in April this year, as a result of the shift in the Easter holiday. Wal-Mart is predicting a comparable sales increase of 1 to 3 per cent.But JC Penney, which predicted a comparable sales fall in the “mid- to high-single digits” in April, said it was expecting “a continuation of the incremental weakness in sales trends we started to see in late February and early March”.
353;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;Retailers clash with Pepsi over free music;;Pepsi is at odds with some of its biggest US retail customers over a national marketing campaign offering free digital music downloads from online retailer Amazon.The deal represents Amazon’s biggest-ever marketing partnership with another brand, and is an important part of its efforts to drive traffic to the fledgling MP3 “DRM free” music download service it launched last year.But the partnership has antagonised rival bricks-and-mortar retailers. Amazon’s media and electronics business competes directly with Wal-Mart and Target, the two largest mass retailers, while its rapidly growing grocery business competes with major supermarkets.“You have to ask yourself why Pepsi would team up with a company that doesn’t sell its products, and risk antagonising all the people that do sell its products,” said a source at one retailer.The programme was launched with a high-profile television ad featuring pop-star Justin Timberlake during February’s US Superbowl. But the promotion has received little attention in grocery aisles.In an apparent response to retailers’ concerns, Amazon’s name has been banished from the front of Pepsi bottles carrying the promotion – rendering it invisible in supermarket aisles to passing shoppers.Similarly, Amazon’s logo is on the back of cardboard multi-pack cartons of cans that are stacked on the shelves of mass discounters and supermarkets, next to the product’s bar code and nutritional information.The treatment contrasts with a promotion between Pepsi and Apple’s iTunes, in which the iTunes name was carried prominently.Jeff Smith, retail consultant at Accenture, argues the tensions reflect underlying challenges for Pepsi and other brands in adapting the traditional way they communicate with retailers to accomodate new digital selling and marketing channels.“The thing they didn’t think about is that anyone selling Pepsi in the general merchandise or electronics business is going to feel that they were promoting a competitor,” he says.Wal-Mart accounts for 18 per cent of North American sales of Pepsi’s parent PepsiCo, while about a third of PepsiCo’s North American sales come from just five retailers. The store has its own Mp3 download service.Both Pepsi and Amazon declined to comment.
354;TGT;Target Corp;2008-03-13T20:23:21Z;Amazon pushes social shopping;;Amazon is to become the first leading online retailer to tap into the potential merchandising opportunities presented by Facebook, the hugely popular social networking site.The largest online retailer has launched applications aimed at pulling millions of Facebook users into its merchandising efforts, in a further extension of a move by retailers towards online “social shopping”.The two new applications, Amazon Giver and Amazon Grapevine, tie Amazon’s own system of shopping “wish lists” and product reviews into Facebook’s social networking pages.A Facebook user who adds the “Giver” application to his or her online profile can then view other users’ Amazon wish lists, and link through them to make a purchase at Amazon’s site.The system also allows users to view product recommendations generated by Amazon that are based upon what the other person has listed as their likes and interests on their own Facebook profile – extending the kind of “artificial intelligence” techniques used by Amazon to generate customer recommendations on its own site.The Grapevine application will automatically update a participating Facebook users’ online friends if he or she adds items to their own Amazon wish list, or writes a product review on the Amazon site.Ebay, the online auction site, currently offers applications to both users of Facebook and its rival MySpace to keep abreast of bidding and to make purchases directly on its site.Amazon has been in the vanguard of the “social shopping” trends, with the early development of user reviews and wish lists on its own site, as well as “tagging” of pages by users to create a personal portfolio of interests.Donna Hoffman, a director of the Sloan Center for Internet Retailing at the University of California, told an industry gathering late last year that online retailers had to be ready to move from their current search engine optimisation as part of the development of “Web 3.0” techniques.“Social shopping sites have the potential to make online shopping much more engaging,” she said. “Consumers are spending much more time on these sites.”Other online retailers in the US, including Wal-Mart, Target and JC Penney, have subsequently added a selection fo similar features to their own sites.
355;TGT;Target Corp;2008-03-13T01:42:53Z;Target in talks to sell credit card stake;;Target, the US discount retailer, is in talks to sell about half of its credit card portfolio to an undisclosed investment partner, in what could be a $4bn deal.The talks follow a review of the credit card business launched in September after pressure from activist investor William Ackman, whose Pershing Square fund is Target’s largest shareholder.Target’s total credit card portfolio is valued at about $8.3bn, the tenth largest in the US and the largest of any non-financial company.While retailers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s have sold off their credit card receivables, Target has argued that owning the cards contributed significantly to its financial performance and enhanced its efforts to reinforce customer loyalty.Target has been able to reduce overhead costs on the cards through its ability to issue them through its own subsidiary banks – one of the factors behind an unsuccessful attempt by Wal-Mart, its main rival, to secure its own banking licence.Target says talks could lead to a sale in the second quarter and that the deal would “forge a new, long-term relationship” with an investment partner “whose experience is expected to result in strategic and financial benefits”.Its credit card receivables were up 29 per cent at the end of its 2007 financial year against 2006, reflecting a drive to offer higher limit cards to more affluent customers and a decline in payment rates reflecting economic pressures.The portfolio’s fourth quarter contribution to earnings before taxes grew 12 per cent to $137m against the same period last year. Target has said it expects non-payment card delinquencies to remain within “acceptable ranges” this year.
356;TGT;Target Corp;2008-03-06T19:55:46Z;Discount stores in US gain ground;;New sales figures from the leading US retailers on Thursday painted a picture of stressed shoppers “trading down” and focusing increasingly on price in the face of growing economic pressures.Monthly sales data for February showed Wal-Mart, the low-cost mass discounter, again outperforming its more upmarket rivals, reporting a 2.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year.Target, the rival discounter focused on more middle class customers, saw comparable sales increase just 0.5 per cent. JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-price department stores, saw their sales fall 6.7 and 3.3 per cent, respectively.“I think what we are seeing is probably the moving of shoppers from traditional department stores and speciality apparel stores over to Wal-Mart and other discount players,” said Mike Moriarty, head of AT Kearney’s US consumer goods and retail practice.Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the month’s figures also highlighted the relative strength of retailers which, like Wal-Mart, sell staples such as grocery and healthcare items. “Areas of retail that are value oriented or consumer-staple oriented did well,” he said.Family Dollar, which operates more than 6,000 small stores that sometimes undercut Wal-Mart, saw its comparable sales rise 1.5 per cent, beating Wall Street’s expectations of a sales fall. Costco and BJ’s, the discount warehouse clubs, also reported comparatively strong sales growth.The figures apparently reinforce the findings of a recently published annual survey of US consumers sentiment by AlixPartners, the turnround consultancy. Fred Crawford, of AlixPartners, said the firm’s 2008 survey showed consumers at all levels were increasingly focused on price, rather than other factors such as quality when making shopping decisions.He said it also showed that shoppers were ready to shift “one level down” in terms of the type of stores they shop.“Consumers who were shopping at Nordstrom’s and Macy’s are now looking at JC Penney or Kohl’s, and those [who] were shopping at JC Penney are now at Wal-Mart,” he said.On Wednesday, both Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, said they were seeing signs of slowing demand even from affluent customers.“You’re going to see a lot more Lexuses and BMWs in Wal-Mart parking lots going forward,” Mr Crawford said.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of comparable sales rose 2 per cent, beating its forecast of a 1.2 per cent rise.
357;TGT;Target Corp;2008-03-06T15:29:41Z;Wal-Mart sales beat forecasts;;Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said its February sales beat its own forecast, in a sign that US shoppers are “trading down” in the face of economic pressures.Wal-Mart said sales at its US stores and Sam’s Club discount warehouses open at least a year rose 2.6 per cent during the month. Wall Street analysts had on average been predicting a 1.1 per cent increase.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, said comparable sales in grocery, health and wellness and entertainment - Wal-Mart’s three biggest categories - again outperformed competitors during the month.“We’re very pleased with the way customers responded to our merchandise offerings and the ongoing ‘save money, live better’ messaging across our US stores,” he said in a statement.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s rival Target, which aims at more middle-class customers, rose just 0.5 per cent during the month, in line with its forecasts.Family Dollar, which operates over 6,000 small hard discount stores, also beat expectations with a 1.5 per cent increase in comparable sales.Sales at JC Penney, the low-cost department store that targets Middle America, fell 6.7 per cent, worse than management had forecast. Its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 3.8 per cent.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index of same store sales rose 2 per cent for February, beating its forecast of a 1.2 per cent rise. Last year, the index rose 2.6 per cent. However, February’s performance outstripped the 0.4 and 0.2 per cent reported in December and January.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said that while 2 per cent “is not going to make investors take to the streets and jump for joy, it has to be a sigh of relief for retailers and investors alike, as it bucked the recent decline trend”.In a further indication of pressures among more affluent shoppers, Nordstrom, the speciality fashion store, reported its third successive decline in monthly comparable store sales, with a 3.3 per cent fall. Saks and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department stores, both reported on Wednesday that they were seeing signs of a slowdown affecting even their more affluent customers.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, has stopped issuing monthly same-store sales figures. It recently announced plans to reorganise its US store operations, and is continuing efforts to improve sales at the May stores it acquired in 2005.
358;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-29T02:29:24Z;Wrong turnings that led into a trap;;It made its name in the mucky business of catching mice and cleaning corporate toilets. Now Rentokil’s shares are being dragged through the dirt.The company issued its second profit warning in three months on Thursday and said Brian McGowan was stepping down as chairman, after disclosing that the group’s parcels business had fallen into the red.“[Chief executive] Doug Flynn and Brian McGowan made a big bet on the pest control and parcels businesses,” says Robert Morton, analyst at Investec. “This disaster is firmly at their door.”Rewind six months and Rentokil appeared to be putting earlier problems right. The company seemed to be growing again after three-and-a-half years of declining profits and downgrades. Analysts had upgraded their ratings.But following what has been described by one analyst as “a catastrophic and monumental screw-up” at the company’s City Link parcels business, profits will be significantly lower this year.The reason for the disaster? Poor management and strategy, say analysts.In 2005, Rentokil’s new management – Mr McGowan and Mr Flynn – announced they were buying up the franchise network of its Initial City Link parcels delivery business to boost profits as part of the company’s recovery plan.Then Rentokil made the transformational acquisition of Target Group for £210m ($418m) in December 2006, doubling the parcels operation. But integration has been a disaster.Mr McGowan, the first casualty in this debacle, is to leave in May but pressure is likely to remain on Mr Flynn.Under Mr McGowan and Mr Flynn, Rentokil cut the number of markets in which it operates, with the sale of the manned guarding, electronic security and conferencing businesses.At the same time, they expanded existing businesses, buying a US pest control business and a clutch of companies in Asia Pacific, as well as Target.The bulk of Rentokil’s revenues now come from its textiles and washrooms services division and building management, but it also remains big in parcels and pest control.Some analysts believe an incoming chairman is likely to refocus the business on one core activity – either washrooms or pest control.Calls for the group to be broken up go back years, though previous suggestions that it could be bought out by private equity and then split seem to have faded.“Six months ago maybe [that might have happened],” says Kevin Lapwood at Seymour Pierce. “But they have sold some prime assets. That was one of the things that private equity wanted. What is left is very unappealing. At least three private equity firms have done proper due diligence on Rentokil but there are so many problems.”Gerry Robinson, who tried to buy the company in 2005, told the FT on Thursday he was unlikely to look at the business again.It has been a four-year fall from grace for Rentokil, after Sir Clive Thompson, the then chairman, and James Wilde, his chief executive, were ousted from the company over plans to sell two of Rentokil’s non-core businesses.They wanted to use the proceeds to make acquisitions in Rentokil’s core areas of security and hygiene or to return cash to shareholders but were unable to obtain the backing of the board.In 2004 Rentokil’s pre-tax profits were £347m on sales of £2.4bn and its market capitalisation topped £3bn. Last year profits were £142m on sales of £2.2bn, and the company’s value has halved.
359;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-28T22:20:34Z;Toys for a green generation;;Laurie Hyman had a busy time at this month’s New York Toy Show, the US industry’s biggest annual event, with more than 1,200 exhibitors. Her start-up company, Green Toys, sells toy teacups, bowls and gardening tools that are made in California from recycled plastic milk containers, and sold in boxes made from recycled cardboard.“We’re getting a lot of interest – from big retailers, from small retailers, from everyone,” she says, showing off a jar holding the white shredded plastic used to make the toys.Across the exhibition hall, Louise and Tim Scott were promoting their line of Anamalz wood and rope animal figures, under a big sign saying “Environmental Toys”. Based in Australia, they launched the company last year and were at the show for the first time.With their environment-friendly displays, Green Toys and Anamalz – both founded by young couples with children – were hardly typical of the toy show, which was awash with coloured plastic and synthetic fur.But some in the industry see them as the sign of a coming transformation – mirroring changes seen in the US personal and household care industries where small entrepreneurial companies such as Burt’s Bees, Seventh Generation or Tom’s of Maine have taken a lead over the past decade in responding to consumer desire for more environmentally sustainable products.“Two years ago I didn’t hear anything about environmental sustainability issues,” says Mark Randall, head of toys and baby products at Amazon, a major toy buyer. “Now I think the industry is at the beginning of that change process.”“I think we’re at the beginning of a sea change,” says Ed Schmults, chief executive of FAO Schwartz, New York’s most famous toy store. Mr Schmults says that when he joined the company after a career that included working for Patagonia, the outdoor clothing company, he was taken aback by the toy industry’s lack of awareness of environmental issues.FAO Schwartz stores now list “product safety and environment” as among the five qualities they want the toys they sell to reflect.“I think the toy business has been out to lunch on the environmental thing,” says Mr Schmults. “If there’s something positive to come out of the China recalls, it is that this is now getting much more attention.”Last year leading US toy manufacturers including Mattel and RC2 recalled millions of toys over unacceptably high lead levels in paint – while more than 4m children’s crafts sets (known as Bindeez in Australia and Aqua Dots in the US) were recalled because of the presence of a chemical that became toxic when swallowed.In other sectors, such as the household cleaning products industry, similar real or perceived risks from chemical ingredients have been a factor in driving demand for green products.Last year’s toy recalls were seized upon by US consumer activist groups concerned about potential threats from even permitted levels of chemicals. In December, the Michigan-based Ecology Center launched a website, www.healthytoys.org, that provides parents with independent test results on the chemical content of toys. The Toy Industry Association dismissed the findings, saying in a statement that “the mere presence of inaccessible substances in trace amounts does not mean a product is harmful”.But Mr Schmults says parents do not want to hear about even legally allowed trace quantities of chemicals such as lead, arsenic and cadmium in the chip board used in many toys. “As a parent should I be worried about that? I don’t know, but if someone said [it] has zero levels [of such chemicals] that would get my attention.”Leading US retailers are beginning to respond to consumer pressures over the use of poly-vinyl chloride, which has been the target of environmentalist campaigns since the 1990s.While the US chemical industry argues that there are no significant health risks from PVC, the three largest US general retailers, Wal-Mart, Target and Sears, have said they will work to eliminate the substance – commonly used in the toy industry – from their packaging and own-brand children’s and baby products. Sears, for instance, set itself the goal of “sourcing bio-based polymers that are sustainably sourced, have higher recycled content, and can be reused, recycled or composted”.Mr Randall at Amazon points out that these environmental health concerns are already shaping toy marketing in Europe, which is ahead of the US on consumer awareness of environmental issues.This was evident at the New York Toy Fair, where Haba, the German toy maker, prominently advertised its products as “100 per cent water-based non-toxic stains” and with “no lead paint”. HaPe International, a German-owned toy company which distributes the Anamalz line and entered the North American market in 2003, proudly displayed trailblasing products that include a “fast and eco-friendly” toy car line – coloured with water-based paints and made from bamboo.

Gold hit an all-time high of $957.90 in Asia, and other precious metals also hovered at record levels.The dollar touched $1.5057 against the euro in New York – its lowest level since the European single currency was launched in 1999. It was at $1.5039 by late afternoon in Singapore.Hong Kong was ahead of its regional peers with a gain of over 3 per cent, while the MSCI Asia Pacific index had risen 2.1 per cent to 149.37 by early evening in Tokyo.David Cohen, head of Asian economic forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore, said markets may have now priced in the worst of the bad news coming out of the US as economic data in Asia seemed to be buoyant.“Clearly global demand was very strong in the final quarter of last year,” he said. The latest exports figures show that demand “doesn’t seem to be falling off a cliff. Maybe that’s a valid reason to think it’s not the end of the world.”In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average closed just off the day’s highs, up 1.5 per cent at 14,031.30. The broader Topix was up 1.3 per cent at 1,364.52.Retailers were heartened by better-than-expected earnings from US counterparts such as Target, the discount chain, and Macy’s, the department store.Marui, one of Japan’s biggest shopping chains, jumped 10 per cent to Y1,093 after it upgraded its profit forecast and said it would buy back 3.5 per cent of its outstanding shares. Fast Retailing, the clothing retailer, gained 2.1 per cent to Y7,940.Inpex, Japan’s largest oil and gas explorer, rose 3.4 per cent to Y1,220,000, adding to gains sparked earlier in the week by talk China’s state investment fund may buy a stake in the company.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng ended up 3.2 per cent at 24,483.84 as investors appeared to warm to the financial secretary’s budget speech, even though he predicted that the territory would in 2008 grow at its slowest pace in five years.Standard Chartered rallied 7.2 per cent to HK$258.20 after it beat expectations on Tuesday with a 27 per cent rise in profits, despite writing down some assets. Rival bank HSBC gained 3 per cent to HK$123.30. Shares of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China added 3.4 per cent to HK$5.40 after garnering a ‘buy’ rating from JPMorgan.Real estate companies benefited from news that Hong Kong will extend a waiver on quarterly property rates – a tax on homeowners – for one year, extending a rally begun earlier this week on speculation this measure would be introduced. SHK Properties rose 1.5 per cent to HK$137.80 and Cheung Kong advanced 3.5 per cent to HK$118.40.The sub-index of Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong rose 5 per cent, and on the mainland itself, Shanghai’s composite index gained 2.3 per cent to 4,334.05.Ping An Insurance rallied 5.5 per cent to Rmb71.81, extending Tuesday’s gains on speculation that it would scale back or abandon its planned share issue. Shanghai Pudong Development Bank rose 0.4 per cent to Rmb40.67.The Australian stock market closed at its highest level in three weeks as commodity shares advanced, with the S&P/ASX 200 index up 1.8 per cent at 5,767.20.

BHP Billiton, the world’s largest miner, rose 2.8 per cent to A$39.85 and Rio Tinto gained 1.9 per cent to A$136.20.Allco Finance made the biggest gain, surging over 20 per cent at one point on talk that it may strike a deal with creditors over repaying A$1.15bn of debt. The shares ended the day up 9.6 per cent at A$1.03, and remain far below a peak of A$13.24 reached in December 2006.Trading in ABC Learning Centres was suspended as the the world’s biggest listed childcare provider talked to potential buyers for parts of the business. ABC shares fell 42.8 per cent A$2.14 on Tuesday on worries that it would not be able to repay the large debts it took on to finance expansion abroad.Singapore’s Straits Times index was up 0.5 per cent at 3,094.45. Noble, the commodity supplier, jumped 12 per cent to S$2.33 as fourth-quarter profit nearly doubled compared with a year earlier, fuelled by strong demand for raw materials in China and India. Noble said it expected annual profits to double in the next four years.But subprime worries dragged down United Overseas Bank, with shares of Singapore’s second-largest bank by assets losing 2 per cent to S$18.460 after fourth-quarter profit fell 6 per cent due to credit writedowns. UOB shares have fallen 23 per cent from a lifetime high set in June.The Singapore dollar reached its strongest level against the US currency since January 1997, passing S$1.4 per dollar.In India, the Sensex 30 was up 0.7 per cent at 17,939.05 by mid-afternoon in Mumbai.
361;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-26T21:44:15Z;US stocks higher despite grim data;;US stocks moved higher on Tuesday when investors weighed disappointing economic data against encouraging corporate news.Economic data showed a stronger-than-expected uptick in January producer prices. A separate report showed a sharp fall in consumer confidence.However, stocks reversed earlier losses after IBM raised the low end of its 2008 earnings outlook and said its board of directors had authorised a continuation of its stock buy-back programme with a $15bn repurchase. The group’s shares jumped 3.9 per cent to $114.38.A report from research group ComScore said the number of clicks on paid advertising links on Google was down sharply, sending the search engine’s shares down 4.6 per cent to $464.19 and leading the Nasdaq Composite Index lower in early trade.The US labour department’s producer price index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, rose 1 per cent in January, while core inflation rose 0.4 per cent for the month.The data fanned fears that the Federal Reserve might be forced to discontinue cutting interest rates.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was 0.7 per cent higher at 1,381.29, while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.8 per cent to 2,344.99 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 12,684.92.“The data add to the Fed policy dilemma, which is risk negative. But I suspect the market has taken this on board for now,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“Nonetheless, the Fed still stands out as a central bank that has to take greater account of downside growth risks, in effect trying to put aside the poor inflation data for now.”In other data, the S&P/Case Schiller home price index showed home prices fell 8.9 per cent in the fourth quarter last year.Consumer confidence fell more than forecast in February, to the lowest level in five years, as the labour market slowed and the economy faltered. Foreclosure filings nationwide climbed 57 per cent in January compared with last year, indicating that housing woes are deepening, according to a report from RealtyTrak.The Conference Board’s index of confidence decreased to 75.0, from a revised 87.3 in January, which was lower than previously reported.The employment outlook weakened and expectations for the next six months dropped to the lowest level since January 1991.Retailers were in focus as a group of companies reported quarterly earnings. Macy’s said its profit had edged up 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter when a tax settlement helped offset weaker-than-expected sales. The nation’s largest department store operator reported net income of $750m, or $1.73 a share, compared with $733m, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Its shares rose 7.1 per cent to $26.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.Target’s fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 8.1 per cent, when growth in credit card operations could not offset weakness in core retail sales. Its shares were 3.1 per cent higher at $54.89. CBS reported a 15 per cent decline in fourth-quarter profits but beat earnings estimates. The company expects operating income growth of 3-5 per cent this year. Its shares were 0.9 per cent lower at $24.78.RadioShack shares jumped 21.5 per cent to $19.13 as the retailer posted a 20 per cent rise in fiscal fourth-quarter profit.HJ Heinz, the food producer, said its third-quarter profit held virtually steady compared with a year ago as sales growth offset the impact of a higher tax rate. Its shares were 0.8 per cent lower at $45.60.Hedge fund group Och-Ziff Capital Management re-ported a net loss of $774.6m in its first earnings release.Shares in the New York-based company were 7.3 per cent higher at $22.70. The loss for the fourth quarter compared with a $453m profit for the same quarter a year ago.Stocks had staged a late-session rally in the previous trading session after ratings agency S&P affirmed its triple-A ratings on troubled bond insurers Ambac and MBIA.The move helped soothe investors worried that downgrades of bond insurers could lead to more hefty writedowns at financial firms.
362;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-26T19:58:45Z;Home Depot forecasts challenging year;;"Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer after Wal-Mart, painted a gloomy picture of the coming financial year and described 2007 as “one of the most difficult years ever”.The retailer is forecasting 2008 total sales to be down 4-5 per cent and earnings per share to be down 19-24 per cent.Frank Blake, chief executive, said: “We expect 2008 to be another challenging year in terms of the housing and home improvement markets. There is a substantial inventory of houses for sale; continued pressure on housing prices; uncertainties around credit availability; and concerns around the overall economy beyond the housing sector.”Home Depot also reduced its planned capital expenditure by about a third to $2.3bn for 2008 and said it would open only 35 stores in the US, down from 78 last year. The retailer also said it would rethink large store remodelling projects.Mr Blake said Home Depot had continued to lose market share since he took over from Bob Nardelli in January last year. But he said the rate of loss was slowing as the retailer launched a series of initiatives aimed at improving its stores.“We don’t feel like we’re picking up share yet. We’re on that trajectory, but we’re not there yet,” he said.The retailer’s grim view of the market echoed the concerns of Lowe’s, its main rival, which said on Monday that it would not see any significant improvements in the housing market until 2009.Carol Tome, Home Depot chief financial officer, said: “The back half of the year should be a bit better than the front half – still negative, still down. And we are hoping that there’s improvement in 2009.”Home Depot’s earnings fell 27 per cent during its fourth quarter to $671m, or 40 cents per diluted share, on sales of $17.7bn. Net sales for the full year fell more than 2 per cent to $77bn.Reports from other leading US retailers underlined the broad pressures on the US consumer as a result of the housing slowdown and credit squeeze.Target, the discount retailer, reported an 8 per cent fall in fourth-quarter earnings to $1.03bn, or $1.23 per diluted share. This contrasted with the 4 per cent earnings increase reported by rival Wal-Mart this month.Target’s sales were up less than 1 per cent at $19.9bn. The retailer said it was not forecasting any improvement in macroeconomic factors for the year ahead. It said comparable store sales growth would be 2-3 per cent for the year.Meanwhile, Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, said it expected its 2008 comparable sales to range between a 1 per cent decline and a 1.5 per cent increase.The retailer said it had registered weaker-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter but managed to beat Wall Street’s expectations with earnings per share of $1.65, supported by stronger gross margins."
363;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-22T22:03:41Z;Ambac sparks rebound on Wall Street;;US stocks rebounded in late trading yesterday on hopes that a plan to bail-out troubled bond insurer Ambac Financial would soon be announced, helping to calm fractious markets.News that a group of banks was preparing to inject at least $2bn in funds into the monoline to avoid a potentially crippling credit downgrade caused the market to surge, reversing earlier losses.Oversold consumer, telecoms and financial stocks led the rally, pushing the S&P500 into positive territory for the week. Stocks had steadily retreated until the news broke amid continuing worries about the threat of a US recession and creeping inflation. Fears about potential losses at government-chartered mortgage agencies had also contributed to the malaise.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,353.11 having fallen 1.2 per cent. The index rose 0.2 per cent for the week. A 240 point intraday swing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average left the blue chip index up 0.3 per cent on the week at 12,381.02. Concerns about the technology sector lingered and the Nasdaq Composite finished the week down 0.8 per cent at 2,303.35 points.Traders this week faced a combination of a looming US recession and burgeoning inflationary pressures. Investors reacted by buying commodity producers, which gained from soaring prices for raw materials, and by shifting into defensive sectors such as consumer staples and healthcare.Stocks were hit after an unexpected sharp decline in a survey of regional manufacturing activity and as an index of leading economic indicators fell for a fourth consecutive month. The reports persuaded some analysts that talk of a short-lived recession may have been premature and that a serious downturn looms.Many investors have been consoled by a belief that the Federal Reserve will keep cutting interest rates to stave off a recession. A larger than expected spike in consumer prices was therefore particularly unwelcome this week because run­away inflation could restrict the Fed’s room for manoeuvre. After the CPI numbers, talk of “stagflation” did the rounds on trading desks.“Inflation pressures ap­pear to be intensifying, and we do not think a few quarters of soft US GDP growth will be enough to stem these pressures,” said Dean Maki, head of US economics research at Barclays Capital.Financial stocks rushed into positive territory yesterday on reports of a plan to bail-out Ambac Financial. The Financial Times said a group of banks would provide capital as part of a plan to split Ambac’s operations, separating municipal bond insurance activities from the riskier business of insuring structured credit products. Ambac’s shares rose 16 per cent to end the week at $10.71, up 4.8 per cent.Investment banks climbed into positive territory amid hopes they can avoid losses linked to the monoline insurers. “If the market felt the monoline situation was being taken care of that would be a huge step,” Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said.Investors are concerned that banks’ corporate earnings could yet reveal more problems. Many analysts are concerned that the next problem on the horizon could be the fate of government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), which guarantee about 40 per cent of outstanding US mortgage debt. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, were downgraded from “neutral” to “sell” by Merrill Lynch. It said the GSEs’ stock prices did not reflect “the severity or duration of the financial headwinds facing the companies”. The shares fell 6.3 per cent to $26.61 and 2.3 per cent to $28.72 respectively this week.Telecoms companies were punished on fears of a price war among mobile network providers. Verizon, down4.3 per cent at $36.20, and AT&T, 7.7 per cent lower at $36.20, launched unlimited nationwide calling plans. Sprint Nextel fell 6.9 per cent to $8.91 on concerns it would also slash prices.Energy stocks were in demand as oil spiked above $101 a barrel. Chevron rose 2.2 per cent to $85.42 this week as it joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average.In retail, Wal-Mart continued to attract investors as its quarterly sales topped $100bn. The shares rose 1.1 per cent to $49.97 this week and have climbed more than 15 per cent since November. JC Penney climbed 4.6 per cent to $48.80 after quarterly earnings beat estimates.Target fell 1.8 per cent to $52.07 after Citi Investment Research told investors to sell the shares.In technology Hewlett-Packard’s full-year earnings inspired an 8 per cent gain to $47.40. Microsoft fell 2.6 per cent to $27.68 this week.
364;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T20:00:02+0000;US retailers hope for tax boost;;For beleaguered US retailers struggling with slowing consumer demand, relief could be on the way in the form of an estimated $42.9bn spending boost from federal tax rebates, aimed at steering the US away from recession.According to a survey of more than 7,000 people for the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend about 40 per cent of the extra $105.7bn due in rebates that will start arriving in May. A further $30bn will be used to pay down debt, $19.8bn will be saved and the remainder either invested or used to pay for medical bills.However, for retailers and consumer goods companies, much will depend on whether consumers choose to spend the extra money on food and low-margin basics, or on discretionary purchases, such as home goods, electronics and toys.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, has said she expects the rebates to deliver a “one-time jolt” to consumer spending. But she told clients that “we expect most consumers who decide to spend their cheques to purchase lower- margin food and consumables” rather than discretionary items.In an indication of the state of lower-income consumers, Wal-Mart said that, in January, its customers were using Christmas gift cards to pay for food and other basics, rather than buy discretionary goods.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and other discounters are expected to offer free cheque cashing facilities for rebate cheques, and they are likely to be prime beneficiaries of the extra spending. Citigroup says that, in 2001, about 25 per cent of a similar round of rebate cheques were spent at Wal-Mart.But if the large discounters – Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target – seem well-positioned to win business from hard-pressed consumers, others who depend on discretionary spending, or spending linked to the housing market – such as Home Depot or Macy’s department stores – seem less likely to benefit.The split in fortunes between basic and discretionary spending extends across the consumer sector.In the food industry, restaurants are showing signs of strain: same-store sales growth at McDonald’s has been slowing, while Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has declared that the US consumer is already in a recession, as his company reported a second quarter of falling traffic.However, food companies such as Kellogg, Kraft and Pepsico are more troubled by higher commodity prices than slowing demand, and see themselves as able to profit if consumers opt to eat at home, rather than restaurants.Also, suppliers of household staples, such as Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Clorox, argue that they have seen no significant slowing in demand, or evidence of consumers shifting to cheaper alternatives.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate Palmolive, told investors that “so far we are seeing no indication of the slowdown,” in the US.But beyond personal care, companies that sell even some of the most basic household products have been feeling the pressure. Newell Rubbermaid, whose products range from storage bins to baby chairs, cut its 2008 sales growth forecast on January 31 to 2-3 per cent, down from its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent.Martin Franklin, chief executive of Jarden, argues that his company’s lower-cost consumer products such as coffee pots and fire extinguishers will benefit from the rebates. “I don’t think the stimulus package is going to make you go out and buy that $2,000 flat-screen TV.“But when it comes to going out and buying some of the smaller ticket items that you have in your life that you don’t want to cut back on, then I think the stimulus package will have a positive effect.”Predictably, US retailers welcomed the federal tax rebates, which they had lobbied strongly for. Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the NRF, described the package as “a crucial component to economic recovery”.But as retailers set out their first-quarter earnings view over the coming two weeks, investors still expect the overall mood to remain sober, with retailers taking a conservative approach to inventory planning, with resulting knock-on effects for their suppliers.
365;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-15T22:45:51Z;Wal-Mart puts Blu-ray on brink of victory;;Blu-ray’s victory in the home video format war appeared complete after Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said on Friday that it would commit itself exclusively to the Sony product and no longer stock Toshiba’s rival HD-DVD.Wal-Mart, which has long reigned as the biggest seller of DVDs, said its decision to carry only Blu-ray discs and players was a response to customer preference. It follows similar moves by other large retailers, including Target, Best Buy, Netflix and Blockbuster.After fighting to a stalemate for much of the past two years, Blu-ray’s advantage now appears commanding and has stoked speculation that Toshiba could soon concede defeat.At stake has been the opportunity to establish the technology for the next generation of high-definition DVDs and players. Some analysts believe that the victorious format could also give its backers a foothold in the digital living rooms of the future.In spite of high hopes at Sony and Toshiba, sales of both formats have been slow as consumers have remained on the sidelines, not wanting to bet on the wrong one.That situation frustrated retailers, such as Wal-Mart, which were forced to dedicate shelf space and marketing resources to Blu-ray and HD-DVD discs and players.However, Blu-ray gained a decisive advantage in January when Warner Brothers, Hollywood’s largest player in the home video market, announced that it would exclusively throw its weight behind Blu-ray.Some have predicted that both formats could ultimately be leapfrogged by technology that allows consumers to download films and video from the internet.Blu-ray executives are now expected to push for greater customer education from retail partners such as Wal-Mart as they try to gain broader acceptance of the new format.
366;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-07T19:45:21Z;US retail sales;;January proved frigid for US retailers. But although declining home values and the wobbly economy have prompted consumers to pare back spending, many retailers closed out the holiday season with fewer patches of frostbite than expected.Same-store sales by US retailers overall dropped 1.6 per cent last month, according to Sanford Bernstein. The broader market reacted uneasily to the results, particularly after Wal-Mart eked out a lower-than-expected same-store sales gain of just 0.5 per cent. Other retailers also undershot estimates, including department stores Macy’s, Dillard’s and Nordstrom and discounter Target.But contrary to expectations that the sky could fall, the sector’s sales decline was shallower than the 2.1 decrease analysts had forecast. Gap, J.C. Penney and several wholesale clubs beat expectations, and their share prices rallied. The Standard & Poor’s retail index, which has bounced sharply since January 15 on hopes that share prices had hit a trough, rose 5 per cent.Pinched by higher housing, gas and food costs and worried over the economy, some consumers are making more deliberate spending choices. This trend is not altogether surprising, given the country’s slightly negative savings rate. Shoppers are searching for clearance-sale bargains and using their holiday gift cards to buy staples. To counter their shrunken profit margins, Macy’s, Ann Taylor and a few other sector laggards have been forced to close stores and slash jobs.Yet after repeatedly ratcheting back earnings projections in recent quarters, other retailers who have managed their inventories well were able to stick to their earnings guidance this time around. Gap boosted full-year profit estimates after selling apparel at better-than-expected prices, and J.C. Penney said fourth-quarter earnings would hit the top end of its range. With market expectations already low, retailers who continue to underperform will struggle to lay the blame anywhere but on their own doorsteps.Post and read comments on this Lex

368;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-07T18:42:59Z;Wal-Mart to open hundreds of medical clinics;;Wal-Mart is to open several hundred new walk-in medical clinics at its stores that will be co-branded under its own name.Branded as “The Clinic at Wal-Mart”, the new facilities will be owned and operated by local healthcare groups and hospitals, but will share common systems developed by Wal-Mart, including standardised electronic medical records.Wal-Mart said it had signed a letter of intent to work with RediClinic, a healthcare provider, and local hospital systems to open 200 clinics.It will also form a partnership with the St Vincent Health System to open four co-branded clinics in Arkansas.Wal-Mart has previously relied upon a handful of regional third-party operators who have opened about 70 clinics at its stores over the past two years. The clinics are staffed by qualified nurses who can treat a range of basic ailments, or refer patients to doctors for treatment.The clinics cost patients and their insurers significantly less than a visit to a regular doctor or to a hospital emergency department.The economic challenges of establishing the clinics on a local basis were illustrated last month by the bankruptcy of Checkups, which operated 23 clinics in Wal-Mart stores in three states.Target, Wal-Mart’s rival, has opted to set up walk-in clinics under a similar model in Minnesota and Maryland. CVS and Walgreens, both leading US drug store chains, have respectively bought third-party operators Minute Clinic and TakeCare Health to run clinics in their stores.The clinic network will support some of Wal-Mart’s other healthcare ambitions, which include providing all its 1.3m US workers and their families with electronic health records by 2010.The retailer is also launching a pilot scheme to manage prescription benefits for a number of US employers. Wal-Mart last month announced a partnership with 1-800 Contacts, an online and mail order contact lens supplier, to supply lenses to customers of its 3,000 in-store Vision Centers, under an arrangement that involves possible future investment by Wal-Mart in the supplier.
369;TGT;Target Corp;2008-02-07T18:42:59Z;Post-holiday sales disappoint US retailers;;"Low-income customers at Wal-Mart appear to be using Christmas gift cards to buy food and other basics rather than using them on discretionary gifts, the largest US retailer said on Thursday, in a telling sign of the economic pressures facing the least well-off US consumers.Wal-Mart cited lower-than-expected redemptions of gift cards during January as a factor for moribund sales during the month. Sales at stores open at least a year increased by just 0.5 per cent, against its original forecast of 2 per cent growth.The retailer, which also blamed bad weather in the Midwest for the weak
figures, said: “Customers appear to be holding gift cards longer and using them more often for food and consumables rather than discretionary purchases.”Wal-Mart has sought to capitalise on its reputation for low pricing in the
current gloomy economic environment, announcing a range of price cuts in late January that it marketed as its own “economic stimulus plan for US shoppers”.But the poor January performance raises doubts over predictions from some Wall Street analysts that its model will perform better than its rivals as consumers become more cost conscious.Both Wal-Mart and Target, the rival discounter, reported that sales of food and healthcare items remained strong during the month. But Target reported a 1.1 per cent decline in comparable sales in January, with poor clothing sales again contributing to a slump that first hit the retailer in September.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales figures, said its comparable sales index rose just 0.2 per cent in January.There were a few exceptions to the generally bleak picture. JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said it did better than expected during the month, and issued a positive earnings forecast that drove its shares up 7 per cent, to $46.91 in early-afternoon trading.But its rival Kohl’s saw comparable sales fall 8.3 per cent as it cut prices to clear inventory, predicting earnings at the low end of its previous guidance.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said that its “customers continue to be selective in their purchases, driven by value and need”.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, said on Wednesday that its comparable sales fell 7.1 per cent in January, leading it to cut its earnings forecast for the quarter. It also announced it was shedding 2,300 administrative jobs. Saks, the luxury department store, reported a 4 per cent increase in sales.But it said even its largely prosperous customers “have continued to shift more of their spending to promotional events”. Nordstrom, another high-end store, reported a 6.6 per cent fall in comparable sales, while Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer, said its same store sales were up 3.3 per cent."
370;TGT;Target Corp;2008-01-31T21:04:58Z;Reality snuffs Sony’s beacon of hope;;Nine days ago, Sir Howard Stringer’s optimism about Sony’s performance was a rare beacon of light that cut through the gloom that had descended on Davos.Ensconced in Switzerland, Sony’s chief executive happily told the Financial Times that the Japanese electronics and media group saw no sign of a US slowdown in its stores or at cinemas.“It’s certainly easy to aggregate negatives about the economy …but our own experience runs counter to that,” said Sir Howard.Not quite. As it turns out, the weakening US economy, limp dollar and falling global stock markets have all pummelled Sony. And on Thursday the company admitted it would not meet its 5 per cent operating margin target after cutting its annual operating profit forecast by Y40bn ($37.6m) to Y410bn.The 5 per cent margin had been seen as the fruit of Sony’s long and painful restructuring programme, which was spearheaded by Sir Howard.In a little more than two years, 10,000 jobs have been cut and the company has been steadily disposing of non-core assets. Most importantly, employees spanning different divisions are collaborating on big projects, such as PlayStation Network, enabling users to download films, songs and games to their PS3 and other Sony devices.Executives had emphasised repeatedly that Sony was “on track” to achieve this target as recently as a few weeks ago. So the fact that Sony is set to miss its own target – which became a company mantra – has some observers mystified.If performance was going to fall short of expectations due to “external factors” such as the weak dollar, surely Sir Howard knew of this last week, when he was trumpeting Sony’s success in the corridors of Davos?David Gibson, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, said Sony’s third quarter results were “disappointing”. “The performance of Sony Financial Holdings, in particular, which reports the mark-to-market impact of its financial portfolio, was significantly worse than we expected,” he said.The unit lost about Y25bn from its convertible bonds and impairment losses of equity securities.There were some bright spots on Thursday, including the fact that its struggling games division finally swung into the black after two years of losses. Sales of electronics were 10 per cent higher in the three months to December, driven by strong sales of Vaio laptop PCs, Bravia LCD TVs and Cybershot digital cameras.But some analysts say this momentum might not be sustainable, particularly given that consumer spending in the US is expected to slow this year.One analyst at an overseas investment bank said: “The problem today is that there were no significant surprises in the [third quarter] numbers.“If you look ahead to next year, there are even more risks on the horizon and Sony has a huge exposure to the US economy,” he added.One reason why performance in Sony’s core electronics division was not able to mitigate forex movements was the savage price declines in the sector, particularly for flat-panel televisions.Nobuyuki Oneda, Sony’s chief financial officer, said the company was aiming to push up volume at its eighth-generation LCD panel plant in South Korea, where it makes panels jointly with Samsung.Analysts say increasing output is the only way Sony will reach profitability with its Bravia LCD TVs. Sony is also planning to expand significantly the line-up of its Bravia TVs at US mass-market retailers including Wal-Mart and Target from the spring, including the debut of televisions with screen sizes of more than 40 inches.Sony’s chief executive has said that the “Shirley Temple factor” could help the company through the choppy waters ahead.“When depression looms, people entertain themselves and don’t want to be reminded by economists that things aren’t so good,” he said. The numbers that Sony presented on Thursday, however, serve as a reminder that consumers today are better informed – and tread more carefully than they did 80 years ago.■ When Sir Howard Stringer was appointed chief executive in June 2005, his most pressing tasks were to revive Sony and boost morale, writes Mariko Sanchanta.One of the clearest ways to chart Sony’s progress was to set a numerical target and, in three years, Sir Howard said the company’s operating margin would be 5 per cent.Three years later and Sony has missed this magical number. A slippery US economy and a limp dollar have largely been to blame. Other Japanese stalwarts, such as Canon, have also been hit.Sony on Thursday maintained that Sir Howard would stay on for another three years, as he had pledged in December. Sir Howard has gone a long way towards repairing morale and breaking down the walls that have prevented the company from developing truly innovative products.Sony has a history of not meeting its target margins. When Sir Howard’s predecessor, Nobuyuki Idei, aimed to turn the company round in 2003, he pledged to more than double Sony’s profit margins to 10 per cent by 2006. Needless to say, the company did not achieve this.Sony’s lesson? No more numerical targets. An analyst who attended Sony’s briefing on Thursday said the company would probably not set a similar target for the 2008 fiscal year.
371;TGT;Target Corp;2008-01-10T15:02:52Z;Wal-Mart stands out amid retail misery;;Wal-Mart on Thursday reported a 2.4 per cent rise in December sales, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 2.1 per cent, amid otherwise predominantly bleak sales figures from other leading retailers.The largest US retailer said comparable store sales during the five-week December period were driven by strengths in grocery, pharmacy and electronics.Wal-Mart’s US stores saw sales increase by 2.6 per cent. Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of the US stores unit said that “in a difficult retail environment, we were pleased with our comparable store sales,” and said strong food sales had helped bring in customers for other areas of the stores.Wal-Mart outperformed Target, its main rival, which reported a 0.6 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, after adjusting for a callendar change that saw a week of extra post-Thanksgiving sales shifted to November’s figures.Target’s sluggish performance was broadly reflected across the sector.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures said its index of retailer’s combined comparable sales figures for November and December showed a 1.7 per cent increase, the slowest growth since 2002.JC Penney, the mid-range department store, said its stores sales fell 3.9 per cent for November and December combined, citing “a challenging consumer environment”.The retailer said it now expected its fourth quarter earnings to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of $1.65 to $1.80 per share.Kohl’s, JC Penney’s rival, reported a 0.7 per cent decline in same store sales, on an adjusted basis, and said November and December sales were down 3.2 per cent. It also reduced its earnings guidance, saying that sales had occured later in December, leading to price cutting that would reduce its profit margins.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, posted a 1.1 per cent fall over the two months.Terry Lundgren, CEO of Macy’s said “macroeconomic trends led customers to spend cautiously for the holiday”.Gap’s same-store sales adusted for the calendar changes were down 6 per cent.Costco was another rare bright spot, reporting a rise of 7 per cent, beating estimates of an increase of 5.7 percent, according to Reuters.Saks, whose New York flagship store has benefited from increased European tourist traffic linked to the weak dollar, reported a 10.2 per cent increase in comparable sales over the two month period.A number of retailers cut their fourth quarter earnings guidance after releasing poor December sales, including Limited Brands, AnnTaylor, Chico’s, American Eagle and Men’s Wearhouse.US retailers have been sounding increasingly downbeat in recent weeks, reflecting growing concerns about a slowdown in consumer spending due to a broader slowdown in the economy.US retailers from Office Depot, the office supplies company, to Zumiez, the snowboarding and skateboarding clothing retailer, have been showing increasing signs of suffering over the first weeks of the new year.Talbots, the mid-range clothing chain, said last week it planned to close 78 stores focused on children’s and men’s apparel and Macy’s has said it will close nine underperforming stores.Circuit City, the struggling consumer electronics chain, said on Monday that its December same-store sales fell 11.4 per cent.
372;TGT;Target Corp;2007-12-27T00:34:35Z;Poor Christmas sales leave stores hungry;;US retail stocks fell on Wednesday as sales figures for the holiday period disappointed in spite of a last-minute rush by shoppers in the days before Christmas and heavy discounting by stores.Shares in Target, the discount retailer, fell 2.5 per cent after it warned that sales could decline this month, denting hopes of a “Santa Claus rally”. Earlier, it had predicted a gain of as much as 5 per cent.Target and other retail stocks were hurt further by a report by MasterCard Advisors, a unit of the credit card group, which said consumer spending climbed by only 3.6 per cent between Thanksgiving and Christmas.The gloom deepened when the International Council of Shopping Centres warned that same-store sales or sales at stores open a year during the November-December period were below projections of a 2.5 per cent gain.The reports fuelled concerns that consumers, hit by the housing market slump, rising petrol prices and the credit crisis were shying away from the shops.Indeed, US home prices fell 4.5 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the sharpest drop since Standard & Poor’s began its nationwide housing index in 1987 and another sign that the housing slump is far from over. The dollar declined against the euro and slipped slightly versus the yen.But shares of online retailer Amazon.com rose more than 2 per cent after the company said the 2007 holiday season was its strongest to date, raising hopes of healthy online sales.There was mixed news for stores in Europe.UK retailers’ fears of a bleak period looked to have been eased by a last-minute surge of shopping but concern over profits remained after widespread discounting of stock in the run-up to Christmas.In Italy, Confcommercio, the retailers’ association, said it had seen a small rise in spending on electronics and food but falls in clothing and shoes.Anecdotally, stores in Rome had a grim Christmas, with consumers hanging on for the January sales, although restaurants appeared to have fared better.In France, the first indications were encouraging. French toy retailers said they expected a significant jump in sales after a buoyant Christmas.Meanwhile, the Federation of E-Commerce was predicting a sharp increase in internet sales at the end of the year from €2.5bn ($3.6bn) to €3bn.Early reports from members of the German HDE retail federation suggested the last weekend of the month had seen the highest daily sales levels this year.Reporting by Anuj Gangahar in New York, Guy Dinmore in Milan, Bertrand Benoit in Berlin and Peggy Hollinger in Paris
373;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Late spending spree helps Europe’s retailers;;Europe’s retailers showed tentative signs on Wednesday of having overcome bleak expectations for consumer spending in the run-up to Christmas, even as high street retail stocks in the US tumbled on the back of disappointing performance.Target, the US discount retailer, led the bad news by warning that sales may decline this month, denting hopes of a “Santa Claus rally” and sending its shares down 3 per cent.Internet sales in the US looked better, however, with shares in online retailer Amazon.com rising more than 2 per cent after the company said the 2007 holiday season was its strongest to date. On December 10, its busiest day of the season, the retailer said shoppers ordered more than 5.4m items, or 62.5 items per second.High street sales were more promising in many parts of Europe. In France, consumers do not appear to have cut back during the holiday period. According to Luc Chatel, secretary of state for tourism and consumption, end-of-year spending was “either slightly ahead [of last year] or stable”. While it was too early for official figures, “the first indications are rather encouraging”.His optimism was reinforced by comments from some retailers that Christmas budgets had been generous this year. Franck Mathias of the French toy chain La Grande Récré said in an interview with Le Monde newspaper: “On Saturday and Sunday our sales jumped 20 per cent compared to 2006.”JouéClub, another toy retailer, is also cited as expecting a significant jump in sales after a buoyant Christmas.The Federation of E-Commerce was predicting a sharp increase in internet sales at the end of the year from €2.5bn to €3bn, as more customers turn to online purchasing.In the UK, hopes for a year-end sales bounce were boosted by figures from Footfall, the market research company, showing that over the last weekend before Christmas there was an increase in shopper numbers of 6.8 per cent on Saturday, climbing to more than 20 per cent on Sunday as shoppers hunted for bargains.Early indications from members of the German HDE retail federation suggested the last weekend of the month had seen the highest daily sales levels this year.Business will have been boosted by longer store opening this year, with Berlin and several other states allowing retailers to trade on the four Sundays in December for the first time since the end of the second world war.In Italy, Confcommercio, the retailers’ association, said Christmas spending saw a small rise in electronics and food business, but falls in clothing and shoe sales. Consumer spending is expected to rise 1.6 per cent in 2007, just less than GDP.Anecdotally, stores in Rome had a grim Christmas, with consumers hanging on for the January sales, although restaurants appeared to have fared better.Reporting by Anuj Gangahar in New York, Guy Dinmore in Rome, Bertrand Benoit in Berlin, Peggy Hollinger in Paris and Philip Stafford in London
374;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Weak retail outlook weighs on Wall St;;US stocks fell in early trade but later finished slightly higher on the day as energy stocks surged on the sharp rise in oil prices. Retailers lost ground on concerns about the crucial holiday shopping period and homebuilders were volatile after US house prices declined by a record amount.Investors hoping for a “Santa Claus rally” were disappointed with the financial and consumer discretionary sectors bearing the brunt of selling pressure.By the close of trade in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,497.66, having earlier fallen as much as 0.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction higher at 13,551.69 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,724.41, as technology once again outperformed the broader market.The retail sector declined after a report by MasterCard Advisors said consumer spending climbed only 3.6 per cent between Thanksgiving and Christmas, adding to concerns that US consumers, hit by the housing market slump, are shying away from the shops. Excluding petrol and car sales, spending increased only 2.4 per cent.Among the leading fallers were Macy’s and Dillard’s, the department store operators, which fell 3.9 per cent to $25.95 and 5.5 per cent to $19.19 respectively.Shares in Target, the discount retailer, fell 2.5 per cent to $51.16 after it warned that sales may decline this month.The company set guidance for December same-store sales of between a 1 per cent decrease and 1 per cent increase, compared to previous expectations of 3-5 per cent growth.Adrianne Shapira, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Target’s guidance “stokes the fears of disappointing December sales.”Economic news was dominated by a record decline in US house prices. The average price of single-family homes in 10 metropolitan areas covered by the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index fell 6.7 per cent in October compared with a year earlier.The S&P homebuilder index fell 1.9 per cent after the report was released but recovered later to trade 0.6 per cent higher at 377.61.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch also fell in early trade before rallying 1.2 per cent to end at $54.54. Meredith Whitney, CIBC World Markets analyst, said she expects the bank to post a $2.70-a-share loss for the fourth quarter, with writedowns reaching up to $7bn.Merrill on Monday said it would receive up to $6.2bn in new capital from Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and Davis Selected Advisers, a money management firm, but the stock fell after Merrill said the stakes were acquired at a sharp discount to the previous closing price. Davis Selected Advisers, also moved shares in MBIA on Wednesday after it disclosed a 6.4 per cent stake in the bond insurer. MBIA’s shares rose 11 per cent to $22.33.There was also good news for investors looking for a pick-up in dealmaking activity after Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, said it planned to buy a 60 per cent stake in Marmon Holdings.Berkshire Hathway will pay $4.5bn for its stake in the family-controlled manufacturing and services group and will acquire the remaining 40 per cent over the next five to six years.Commodity prices rose on Wednesday, providing a boost to energy and mining stocks. Hess, the oil producer and refiner, rose 2.2 per cent to $104.63 while Newmont Mining, the world’s largest gold producer, climbed 1.4 per cent to $49.11.Supply concerns drove the price of crude oil to a one-month high of $96.54 while gold climbed 2 per cent to $824.60 an ounce.Bond prices edged lower on Wednesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note gained 2 basis points to 3.26 per cent while the 10-year Treasury note yield was up 0.5bp at 4.21 per cent.The dollar was mixed against major currencies early in New York. The US currency lost 0.6 per cent against the euro and fell 0.5 per cent against the Swiss franc but rose slightly against the yen.US stocks rose on Monday after a spate of deal-making helped spur a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.The S&P 500 on Monday closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,496.45, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 13,549.33, and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.8 per cent to 2,713.50. Equity markets were closed on Tuesday for the Christmas holiday.
375;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Relief for UK retailers after late sales rush;;UK retailers’ fears of bleak trading look to have eased after a last-minute surge of shopping but concern over profits remains after widespread discounting of stock in the run-up to Christmas.Figures from Footfall, the Experian-owned market research company, showed an increase in shopper numbers of 6.8 per cent on Saturday, climbing to more than 20 per cent on Sunday as shoppers hunted for bargains.John Lewis, the department store chain, also reported a record Christmas, with sales passing £100m for a second consecutive week.Gordon McKinnon, head of operations at the Trafford Centre in Manchester, said there was no doubt shoppers were being “more circumspect in how they’re spending their money”.“It’s clear a lot were leaving it until the last minute but it’s been a bumper last four days,” he said.Martin Davies of Experian said the “slow and steady” browsing patterns of previous years had been replaced by shoppers buying online or using websites to find the best prices before swooping on shops in the high street.Fears had been growing that the increasing gloom from the housing and financial sectors would hurt consumer spending. Last week, a long-standing measure of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in 12 years.In the US, stocks fell on Wednesday as retail sales figures for the holiday period disappointed, in spite of a late rush. Target, the US discount retailer, warned sales might have declined this month.Online sales in the US looked better however, with shares in web retailer Amazon.com rising more than 2 per cent after the company said the 2007 holiday season was its strongest to date.Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis Stores, said: “We always say there will be winners and losers and it will be more so this year.”He agreed online shopping was changing customers’ behaviour but said John Lewis had seen a “rip-roaring” final few days even without its Christmas internet service.
376;TGT;Target Corp;2007-12-24T19:07:22Z;Financials bring cheer on Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks rose on Monday after a spate of deal-making and a capital injection at Merrill Lynch helped spur a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,496.45 the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 13,549.33 and the Nasdaq Composite put on 0.8 per cent to 2,713.50.With many traders taking the day off, volumes were light before the session concluded at 1pm.Financial stocks posted solid gains after Merrill Lynch said it would raise up to $6.2bn from Temasek Holdings and Davis Selected Advisors, through the private placement of new common stock.Merrill also said it would sell most of its middle-market commercial finance unit to General Electric’s finance arm, allowing the company to free-up around $1.3bn in capital.Temasek, a Singaporean state investment arm, will invest $4.4bn and has the option to put in additional $600m . Davis, a US-based asset manager, will put up $1.2bn as part of a “long term investment”.Merrill’s shares rose as much as 5 per cent but later erased these gains and fell 3 per cent to $53.90 after it said Temasek would acquire its stake for only $48-a-share.Like many US banks Merrill needs to shore up its balance sheet after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October, with further damage expected when it reports fourth quarter results in January.Goldman Sachs rose 2.3 per cent to $214.32 on news it has moved closer to acquiring the assets of Cheyne Finance, a troubled $7bn structured investment vehicle now known as SIV Portfolio, which went into receivership in September.US banks have struggled to bring liquidity to the market in securities controlled by off-balance sheet investment vehicles.A US-Treasury backed plan to create a $75bn “superfund” to buy SIV assets collapsed on Friday. However, analysts said they did not expect the unwinding of the fund to have big implications for financial markets.In other deal news Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent to $37.01 after the mining company agreed to sell its packaging and consumer businesses to Rank Group for $2.7bn in cash.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries gained 2.9 per cent to $46.48 after it raised its full-year earnings guidance. Wyeth, a rival, fell 3 per cent to $45.45 after it said it would sue to recover lost income from sales of Teva’s generic version of its Protonix heartburn drug.United Rentals, up 4.4 per cent at $18.70, said it would seek a $100m non-complete fee from Cerberus Capital Management after the private equity group pulled its $4bn takeover offer last month.Retailers posted strong gains on the last shopping day before Christmas but as many analysts remained downbeat on prospects for the holiday season.Office Depot rose 6.7 per cent to $13.96 while JC Penney and Nordstrom, the department store operators, gained 4.6 per cent to $45.85 and 3.8 per cent to $37.65 respectively.Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by activist investor William Ackman, said on Monday it had increased its stake in Target, the discount retailer, to just under 10 per cent. The shares gained 3.5 per cent to $52.47.Stocks ended last week on a high after technology and energy stocks spurred a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.Many investors are hoping that a phenomenon known as the “Santa Claus rally” makes an appearance again this year: the tendency of stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and New Year.European stocks also enjoyed a holiday-season boost. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index added 1 per cent while the FTSE 100 gained 0.7 per cent. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 1.8 per cent jump on the Hang Seng.The rally in equity markets drove mild selling pressure in US Treasury markets. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 5 basis points to 3.24 per cent and the 10-year Treasury note yield gained 4bp to 4.21 per cent.The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen and the pound but fell against the the euro. Crude oil prices climbed 63 cents to $93.94 while gold prices edged up $0.80 to $816.2.
377;TGT;Target Corp;2007-12-07T21:36:36Z;Wall St achieves back-to-back weekly gains;;Wall Street achieved back-to-back weekly gains on Friday. Investors are hoping that another Federal Reserve rate cut, and a White House plan to resolve some of the pain afflicting holders of subprime mortgages, can prevent the credit squeeze from freezing the broad economy.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.2 per cent at 1,504.66, but was higher by 1.6 per cent this week. For the year, the S&P is up 6.1 per cent, about 4 per cent below its 2007 peak of 1,565.15, set in October.The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,706.16 on Friday, a rise of 1.7 per cent this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a fraction higher to 13,625.58, up 1.9 per cent since Monday.The worst fears of investors about the economy were not met on Friday, when the November employment report recorded a gain of 94,000 jobs. The report was not strong enough to change expectations that policymakers will ease the Fed funds rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent next week.“I think the Fed will still cut rates, as they would rather be safe than sorry,” said Scott Wren, senior equity analyst at AG Edwards.Analysts are worried about how the economy and earnings will fare in the coming months as banks scale back their lending and house prices are seen falling further.The US administration’s plan to help some holders of subprime mortgage modify their loans was described as being no “silver bullet“ by Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary.That came after data showed the share of mortgages more than 30-days delinquent reached 5.6 per cent in the third quarter, the highest level since 1986.“Investors are attempting to fathom the depths of the credit crunch and its subsequent impact on consumer borrowing and the housing market,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Financials rebounded 0.5 per cent this week, but remain 15.6 per cent lower for the year. The outlook for the sector’s earnings in the fourth quarter darkened and these are now seen falling 35 per cent after a 27 per cent slide in the third quarter, according to Thomson Financial.With materials companies facing a decline of 6 per cent in their fourth-quarter earnings, overall average S&P 500 earnings are now seen falling 0.8 per cent.This bleak outlook for the current quarter follows a fall of 4.5 per cent in S&P earnings for the third quarter. The last time S&P earnings fell in two consecutive quarters was in the last quarter of 2001 and the first three months of 2002.“History has shown that the equities do not fare well in the face of a recession,’’ said Mr Ablin. “The S&P 500 dropped more than 20 per cent in the 12 months leading up to the last recession in March 2001.’’This year, as financials and consumer discretionary stocks and other areas of the market – such as small companies – have been hit hard by the credit squeeze, investors have sought large companies with exposure to the global economy.The falling dollar has inflated foreign based earnings, but this week central banks in Canada and the UK cut interest rates, weakening their currencies.“The recession clock in the US ticks steadily closer to midnight,’’ said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS. “We see developing economic weakness among key US trading partners as another link in the chain that ends with a recession in the US with the vital export sector as a transmission.’’Mr Wren said consumer staples and healthcare stocks, up 13.8 per cent and 9.4 per cent in the S&P, respectively, this year, are safe places for investors.He added that financials may be a story next year. “If the Fed cuts rates to 3 per cent, financials will benefit.”Among stocks in the news this week, Lennar, the home builder, rose 15.7 per cent to $18.32 after it announced a joint venture with Morgan Stanley’s real estate unit.A sense that homebuilders are getting on top of their inventory problems powered a 16.6 per cent rally in S&P homebuilder index this week. Since making a low of 291.55 in late November, the index has risen more than 30 per cent, clipping its loss this year to 57 per cent.Mixed retail sales for November were reflected in the share prices of retailers. JC Penney gained 8.6 per cent to $47.92, while Target lost 7.4 per cent to $55.51.Financials did experience a number of downgrades this week, and on Friday American Express fell 4.3 per cent to $56.96 after Merrill Lynch cut it to a “sell”. Bond insurers were hit after Moody’s said MBIA might need additional capital and the stock fell 17.8 per cent to $30.American International Group rallied 5.7 per cent to $61.45 as the insurer soothed investors after announcing its exposure to subprime losses.Research In Motion, the maker of BlackBerry devices, fell 8.9 per cent to $103.65 after a brokerage downgrade.Activision, the video game publisher rose 20.9 per cent at $26.79, after Vivendi said it planned to buy a controlling stake in the company.Comcast said 2007 revenue would be lower and expenses higher than previously forecast. The cable operator fell 11 per cent to $18.28.Intel rose 6.3 per cent to $27.73, and is up 37 per cent in 2007, after the chip maker was upgraded to overweight by Thomas Weisel Partners.Macrovision, a developer of technology that prevents unauthorised copying and viewing of video, said it would buy Gemstar, the television listings provider, for $2.8bn in cash and stock on Friday. Shares in Macrovision were 21.4 per cent lower at $20.44, while Gemstar had dropped 16.6 per cent to $4.99.At the start of trading, Wall Street was set for gains after a modest rise in the number of jobs created in November left the door open to a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.Non-farm payrolls expanded by 94,000, down from a revised gain of 170,000 in October. Economists had expected a rise of 75,000 jobs last month, but in recent days some had raised their estimate to 125,000 after a strong private-sector reading on Wednesday. The unemployment rate was steady at 4.7 per cent.“Overall, these data should not change anyone’s mind at the Fed or otherwise regarding the health of the economy or the prospect of rate cuts,” said Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers.Within the US jobs report, average hourly earnings increased 0.5 per cent and were up 3.8 per cent from a year earlier. September job creation was revised sharply lower from 96,000 to 44,000.Construction employment fell 24,000, the fifth-straight monthly decline, while financial services payrolls fell 20,000. In contrast, service-sector employment rose 127,000. Retail payrolls rose 24,200, breaking a run of three straight monthly declines.
378;TGT;Target Corp;2007-12-06T21:52:43Z;Wall St up as traders welcome subprime rescue plan;;Wall Street stocks gained strongly in late trade on Thursday, closing higher as investors digested mixed retail sales figures and welcomed government plans to help homeowners.The retail sector came into focus with the release of same-store sales for November. Department store retailer Macy’s said its sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 13.4 per cent in November, easily beating Wall Street’s 8.2 per cent forecast. But its shares fell 4.5 per cent to $29.81.Target said sales in December needed to improve in order for the retailer to meet its fourth-quarter outlook. The company’s shares sank 7.6 per cent to $55.57 on the New York Stock Exchange.“Results are mixed,” said analysts at Thomson Financial.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 index was 1.5 per cent higher at 1,507.34, while the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent ahead at 2,709.03. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.3 per cent higher at 13,619.89.The S&P financials sector was up 2.6 per cent. The scale of writedowns among financials and subsequent slashing of earnings prospects leaves the S&P 500 facing its first earnings recession in five years.Average earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to fall 0.8 per cent for the fourth quarter, led by a 35 per cent decline in results for financials, according to Thomson Financial. Materials companies face a decline of 6 per cent in their fourth-quarter earnings.The outlook for the current quarter follows a fall of 4.5 per cent in S&P earnings for the third quarter, as financials posted a 27 per cent fall in earnings. At the start of October, fourth-quarter earnings were expected to rise 11.5 per cent.The last time S&P earnings fell in two consecutive quarters was in the last quarter of 2001 and the first three months of 2002.At this juncture, total earnings for 2007 are on pace for a gain of 3.2 per cent, its worst rate of growth since 2002. At the start of the year, analysts had expected a rise in earnings of 9.3 per cent for 2007.Earnings are still forecast to rebound next year. Thomson said analysts expected a 7.8 per cent rise in the first quarter and for earnings to post average growth of 14.9 per cent during 2008.In economic news, weekly jobless claims fell 15,000 to 338,000, a touch lower than the forecast fall to 340,000. The four-week moving average of new claims, which is seen as providing economists with a clearer trend, rose to 340,250 from 335,500 the week before.Traders now await the November employment report, which is due on Friday.Homebuilder Toll Brothersposted a fourth-quarter loss as the value of its land continued to plummet in the weak housing market. Toll posted a loss of $81.2m, or 52 cents a share, down from a net gain of $173.8m, or $1.07 a share last year. It was the company’s first quarterly loss in more than two decades, but it was less severe than analysts had expected. Shares in the company soared by 13 per cent per cent to close at $23.42.The S&P homebuilders index took its lead from Toll, surging 13.3 per cent to 385.33.Brokerage stocks suffered early on due to downgrades but bounced back later. Goldman Sachs shares finished up 2 per cent and Morgan Stanley advanced 3 per cent Morgan Stanley in spite of Merrill Lynch cutting its rating from buy to neutral. JPMorgan gained 2.9 per cent to $46.21 after Merrill maintained its share earnings estimate on the bank.The S&P investment banking index advanced 3.6 primarily driven by a 6.2 per cent share price gain at Merrill Lynch.In other corporate news, American International Group shares continued their advance, gaining 5.5 per cent to $61.35, having risen more than 6 per cent on Wednesday after Martin Sullivan, chief executive, tried to reassure investors about the insurance group’s exposure to subprime losses.Coca-Colasaid Muhtar Kent, chief operating officer, would succeed Neville Isdell as chief executive from July. Coke shares were 4.8 per cent ahead at $57.87.Dell shares gained 2.6 per cent to $24.70 after the computer maker said it would begin selling computers through more than 900 Best Buy outlets in the US.
379;TGT;Target Corp;2007-12-05T20:53:04Z;Walk-in clinics help to cure US healthcare ills;;Walk-in retail health clinics have moved from oddity to near ubiquity in just two years in the US. They provide nurse practitioners, who treat minor illness, perform examinations and offer preventive medicine such as vaccines for about $50.Take Care, acquired this year by the drugstore group Walgreens, estimates it will open one clinic a day and have more than 400 by this time next year. The industry is expected to reach 5,000 -10,000 retail clinics in the next few years.“Patient demand could warrant significantly more than 5,000-10,000 clinics. What will limit it is the availability of nurse practitioners,” says Peter Miller, chief executive of Take Care.The explosion of walk-in clinics is one of several significant moves to reform US healthcare by business and other groups outside the traditional medical industry.They range from clinics in retail stores to internet social networking for doctors, retailers’ rethinking pricing policies for prescription drugs, widening support for cost-effectiveness studies of medicines, and financial service industry help for hospitals.These seemingly unrelated examples could change the system at some of its weakest points. They are tackling problems including inexpensive access to basic healthcare for everyone, transparency in medical information, and personal accountability for one’s own health.Walk-in clinics have been set up in some of the largest drugstore and retail groups, including Wal-Mart, Target, CVS and RiteAid.Their business model seeks to offer basic healthcare for patients, whether insured or uninsured.They treat minor illnesses at low cost, and could help to head off higher costs with preventive medicine while leaving physicians time for complex cases.In addition, they generate a computer patient record for each visit, which could help to spur wider adoption of electronic health records.“We are serving as a critical entry point for patients,” says Mr Miller. “In many cases, there are patients that haven’t been in the healthcare system in years.”Since it opened two years ago, the established medical community’s concern in one of Take Care’s first markets of Kansas City has shifted. In some months 10-15 per cent of its patients are referrals from doctors.Clinics see potential to expand services, including helping with obesity and patient health and wellbeing, “transforming how healthcare is practised today”, says Mr Miller.Doctors are not to be left behind. Sermo, the internet networking site for doctors, has emerged to give physicians a network to discuss their medical cases or problems, find new information such as drug data, operate their business better, or post personal information.Sermo has up to 40,000 US physician members, recently adding 2,000 each week. Dr Daniel Palestrant, founder and chief executive, says: “It could be indispensable. But it also does what we want to do – and that’s help fix healthcare.”Healthcare costs have also attracted new reform efforts. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, launched a $4 plan for 30 days’ supply of commonly used generic drugs. It has targeted $10bn (€7bn, £5bn) of savings by squeezing out pricing anomalies and making generic drugs pricing more transparent.Efforts to get evidence to judge whether medical treatments are cost-effective received a surprising boost last month from government researchers.Peter Orszag and Philip Ellis, of the Congressional Budget Office, argued in the New England Journal of Medicine that healthcare costs and quality could be helped by “generating more information about the relative effectiveness of medical treatments and enhancing the incentives for providers to supply and consumers to demand, effective care”.Some estimates, they wrote, say that less than half of all medical care “is supported by firm evidence of effectiveness”.Finally, hospitals have seen their bad debt continue to soar, as uninsured patients or those with less insurance fail to pay large bills.As people are required to take on more costs, this debt has created a vicious cycle that is destabilising US healthcare, experts say.McKinsey & Co says financial institutions have expertise either being used or implemented in the future that could help the healthcare payment system, with “electronic payment processing capabilities that the sector needs”.US healthcare is changing and adapting with these new ideas, either paving the way for potential federal policy reforms, or in lieu of their absence.This is the second in a series on the problems of the US healthcare system. Part three will appear tomorrow
380;TGT;Target Corp;2007-11-20T23:37:53Z;Off Target;;The consumer spending slowdown has struck Target with more force than expected, surprising those who thought the stylish discount retailer would top profit estimates for the third quarter. Target’s revenue matched expectations as foot traffic held solid, but slow sales of higher-margin apparel and home goods chewed into its bottom line.Margins are eroding across the US retail sector, as inventory overstocks plague retailers and force them into tough pricing decisions. Those who sell housing- and weather-dependent “soft goods”, including department stores JC Penney and Kohl’s and home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma, have seen inventories spike the most.To pare back their positions and drive sales during the key holiday season, retailers are splitting into two camps with divergent strategies. Saks, Tiffany and other luxury retailers, along with electronics vendor Best Buy, are working to protect profit margins by luring shoppers with invite-only sales and special customer treatment. Target, meanwhile, expects soft apparel and home sales to continue hitting gross margins as long as economic and housing worries persist. But it is banking on the success of its limited-design merchandise lines to help attract traffic, rather than embarking on widespread discounting.Wal-Mart is leading the charge in the other direction, cutting the price of certain items more deeply and earlier than usual to draw customers into stores and justify the cost of the petrol required to get there. That leaves struggling department stores stuck in the middle, forced to discount to clear out inventory and keep customers from trading down.On Tuesday, Target said this year’s holiday promotional environment was not that different from past years, and not as desperate as some had suggested. If that is true, there should be room for positive surprises from those retailers which can successfully play the balance between driving sales and protecting margins.
381;TGT;Target Corp;2007-11-20T21:41:10Z;US indices hit reverse on Freddie Mac gloom;;Wall Street endured another volatile session on Tuesday after a large loss at Freddie Mac, the mortgage agency, reinforced worries about credit-losses in the financial sector.Energy and mining stocks were buoyed by a spike in commodity prices, with crude oil futures closing at a record high above $98 a barrel.Some strong results from Hewlett-Packard cheered harried investors early in the session but confidence waned after poor housing data hit homebuilder stocks.Minutes from the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s October meeting, released in mid-afternoon, provided little encouragement to traders betting on future rate cuts, referring to last month’s decision to ease as a “close call”.However, the futures market continued to price in a rate cut next month after a new quarterly Fed report on the outlook for the US economy cautioned that GDP growth would slow next year while unemployment could rise slightly, while inflation was expected to remain moderate.The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a 268-point intraday swing but closed only 0.4 per cent higher at 13010.14. The S&P 500 opened strongly, then fell as much as 1 per cent, before closing up 0.5 per cent at 1439.70 .The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent at 2596.81.Traders have become accustomed to these large intra-day share price movements.“If anyone out there with sizeable capital goes in at the end of the day, and goes either long or short, all the speculators out there tend to jump on board. That exacerbates the move,” Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab said. “They are desperately scared of being caught on the wrong side of it,”The CBOE Vix index fell 4.2 per cent at 24.9 on Tuesday but remains elevated, amid continued expectations of share price volatility.Some terrible results from Freddie Mac, the government sponsored mortgage company, provided a further blow to confidence in the financial sector on Tuesday.Freddie’s third-quarter net loss widened sharply to $2.03bn as it set aside $1.2bn to account for bad home loans. The shares plummeted 28.7 per cent to $26.74 after it said it was “seriously considering” cutting its dividend by half to raise capital. Shares in fellow mortgage lender Fannie Mae fell 24.8 per cent at $28.25, leaving them almost 60 per cent below their high this year.Countrywide Financial, suffered sharp falls after an analyst said funding shortages at Fannie and Freddie could hurt the largest US mortgage lender. But the shares rallied to close only 2.7 per cent lower at $10.28 after the mortgage lender said persistent rumours that it could go bankrupt were “absolutely false.”Citigroup fell 1.9 per cent at $31.40 after Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo cut his price target to $29. He said “recent problems with CDOs and their lack of disclosure reflect a serious risk management break-down” and could prompt regulators to impose restrictions “such as the inability to pursue acquisitions”.Elsewhere trading was extremely choppy.Hewlett-Packard reported a 28 per cent leap in fourth-quarter net income, while sales rose 15 per cent and were nearly $1bn higher than Wall Street had anticipated. The stock closed up 0.2 per cent at $49.56. Google clung on to a 3.6 per cent gain at $648.54 after Credit Suisse raised its price target to $900.Retailers were also in focus amid contrasting quarterly corporate performance.Target’s third-quarter earnings slid 4 per cent, missing expectations. The shares fell 4.1 per cent to $51.69 even as the discount retailer announced a new $10bn share buy-back programme. Office Depot, lost 7 per cent at $17.48 after quarterly profit fell 9 per cent. But Nordstrom surged 12.1 per cent to $34.21 after its quarterly earnings increased more than anticipated.There was more bad news for the real estate sector. Although housing starts rose a surprising 3 per cent in October, building permits were 6.6 per cent lower, more than expected.“Despite the increase in starts in October, there is no evidence here of housing market stabilisation,” economists at Bear Stearns said.Shares in the big homebuilders felt heavy selling pressure, although DR Horton, which swung to a fiscal fourth-quarter loss, closed 2.5 per cent higher at $11.53. The S&P homebuilder index shed 5.2 per cent at 326.12.
382;TGT;Target Corp;2007-11-20T19:50:56Z;Target upbeat on holiday despite profits fall;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Tuesday disclosed an unexpected 4 per cent fall in quarterly earnings but remained upbeat about the prospects for the important holiday quarter.Bob Ulrich, chief executive, insisted Target had “not observed any meaningful change in the intensity of the competitive environment”, though he conceded the third quarter had been “disappointing”. Target’s sanguine view of the forthcoming holiday contrasts with the bleak picture painted last week by JC Penney, whose customer-base overlaps with Target.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, and Wal-Mart have also remained broadly optimistic about the holiday.High-end stores have shaken off a significant impact from the broader economy, with Saks on Tuesday reporting that its third-quarter earnings had tripled to $21.6m, or 14 cents a share, supported in part by tourists taking advantage of the weak dollar at its flagship New York store.On Monday evening, Nordstrom said it expected its fourth-quarter earnings to be ahead of Wall Street’s expectations, and pointed to continued strong demand for its designer fashions.Target said its gross margins in the third quarter had been hit by slower sales of clothing as a result of the exceptionally warm autumn weather, while home furnishing sales had remained soft owing to the impact of the downturn in the housing market.Gregg Steinhafel, president, said November sales had been supported by a recovery in clothing and strong growth in electronics.“We’re cautiously optimistic that overall we’re going to have a decent holiday season,” he said.Target also announced a $10bn share repurchase programme, to run over three years, which includes $3.4bn outstanding from a buy-back announced in 2004. It said it expected half or more of the buy-back to be completed by the end of 2008.Target said it expected to make a decision on whether or not to sell its $7bn credit-card portfolio by the end of December. A review was launched after Bill Ackman, the activist investor, acquired control of more than 5 per cent of its shares.
383;TGT;Target Corp;2007-11-08T16:03:40Z;Weather and economy hit US stores;;One of the largest US retailers sounded a warning on Thursday over the prospects for holiday sales, after economic worries and warmer than ususal weather led to disappointing October sales.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said his mid-range department store chain expected “the challenging retail environment to continue for the foreseeable future”, after announcing that sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.8 per cent in October.”Our customers are clearly facing headwinds that are impacting both sentiment and discretionary spending levels, including weak housing market conditions, high energy prices, and uncertainty in the mortgage and credit markets,” he said.Bob Ulrich, chief executive of Target Stores, noted that for the second month in a row the discount retailer experienced soft sales in higher margin categories, including clothing and warm weather items, as the company reported comparable sales growth of 4.1 per cent.Macy’s, the largest US department store chain, reported a 1.5 per cent fall in same store sales, while Kohl’s said same store sales fell by 3.8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store that traditionally outperforms the sector, reported a 2.4 per cent drop in comparable sales.Larry Montgomery, Kohl’s chief executive, said sales of outerwear, fleece and sweaters “experienced significant declines …contributing to our sales shortfall” as a result of the warm weather.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, also reported soft apparel sales as it announced that its comparable sales increased by 0.4 per cent during the month. Wal-Mart, which launched aggressive pre-holiday price cuts in October, said it expected comparable sales to increase by between 0 and 2 per cent in November.Speciality clothing sellers were also hard hit. Limited Brands saw its comparable sales fall 6 per cent, while Gap posted an 8 per cent drop. Chico’s FAS reported a 10.6 per cent sales drop and added profit would fall sharply in the current quarter.Retail Metrics, a firm that tracks the monthly same store data, said that its index of sales increased 1.9 per cent for the month, following a disappointing 1.6 per cent increase in September.“There is virtually no momentum coming out of September and October as we head into the thick of the holiday shopping season,” the firm said in its analysis of the data.
384;TGT;Target Corp;2007-10-12T21:03:17Z;US consumers continue to spend;;The US economy appeared to be weathering the initial fall-out from the credit squeeze as steady retail sales showed consumers continued to spend in spite of a worsening downturn in the housing market.The surprisingly strong sales by retailers last month added to signs that expenditure was holding up and that the economy was drawing strength from other sectors. Fresh inflation data also suggested prices were in check.The data will ease pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the second straight month when policymakers meet at the end of this month, although the economic outlook remains highly uncertain.Bond yields rose as investors priced in less chance of a rate cut. The dollar firmed and stocks opened higher, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.3 per cent to 1559.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 14,051.62.Some policymakers are concerned that financial markets could be hit by a second wave of turbulence as tightening lending conditions and a declining housing market begin to translate into reduced economic activity.The fear is that there will be a “double dip” as investor confidence recovers amid positive economic data during the third and fourth quarters but then falters as the credit squeeze and housing market begin to constrain activity.Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said: “We suspect [consumption] will weaken next year as falling house prices and a weaker labour market take their toll.”Recent data on business inventories and capital expenditure suggest a hesitancy to build stock on the part of companies that underlines this uncertainty. “Equipment investment and especially inventories are tracking below expectations [in spite of strong export demand],” said Haseeb Ahmed, an economist at JPMorgan.There were also signs on Friday that consumer confidence was weakening as a survey by the University of Michigan showed sentiment dipped to a 14-month low in October, falling from 83.4 to 82.But Friday’s strong sales figures showed consumers maintained spending habits throughout the third quarter and financial market crisis, albeit at a tepid pace.Retail sales rose an estimated 0.6 per cent in September, well above the 0.2 per cent Wall Street economists were forecasting after a 0.3 per cent increase the previous month.The sales figures follow reports from retail chains such as Wal-Mart, Target, and JC Penney citing softening demand in some areas.
385;TGT;Target Corp;2007-10-11T20:29:13Z;Wall St falls as confidence evaporates;;US stocks erased gains in a volatile afternoon session as confidence suddenly evaporated from the market.Technology shares led the falls after an analyst at JP Morgan lowered his sales estimate for Baidu.com.Large-cap technology stocks, which have lately enjoyed strong gains, were sold down rapidly as momentum evaporated and investors took profits.Traders were also concerned by comments by Axel Weber, a governing council member of the European Central Bank, said the bank may need to raise interest rates to control inflation.Having climbed as high as 2,834, the Nasdaq Composite fell as much as 2.7 per cent from its high to close 1.4 per cent lower on the day at 2,772.20.The S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent lower at 1,554.42 after it hit a new intra-day high of 1,576.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a new high but closed 0.5 per cent lower at 14,015.12“The technology sector was extremely overbought going into today,” Paul Hickey co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group said.Amazon, down 5.6 per cent at $89.34 and Yahoo 2.5 per cent lower at $27.65 were sold down. Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry, saw some of the heaviest falls, down 5 per cent at $111.Baidu.com, which appeared to spark the sell-off, shed 10 per cent to $308.75 after JPMorgan cut its third-quarter revenue estimate by 3.2 per cent.Having surged to a record high of $641.41 Google closed the day down 0.5 per cent at $621.73.Earlier, positive news from Wal-Mart had helped soothe concerns about the outlook for US corporate earnings and offset weaker sales figures from other retailers.Wal-Mart surprised analysts by raising its third-quarter earnings estimate, helped by improved margins and expenses.The group expects third-quarter earnings of between 66 and 69 cents a share compared with previous guidance of 62-65 cents.But Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose 1.4 per cent in September, slightly less than expected. The shares gained 2.9 per cent to $46.90.Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the results showed consumers were still going to the shops.“The reality is that consumer spending is a reflection of jobs and wages, not home values,” he said.There was disappointing news from other retailers as September sales fell below expectations after unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers away.Target, the discount retailer, fell 1.8 per cent to $64.62 after it said fiscal 2007 earnings would come in below its previous guidance of $3.60 a share.Nordstrom was 7.5 per cent lower at $44.97 after it warned lower-than-expected sales would cause third-quarter profit to fall below previous estimates.Gap was 1.4 per cent lower at $19.06 after announcing a same-store sales decline of 7 per cent in September. Analysts had expected a fall of 4.4 per cent.JC Penney fell 7 per cent to $63.27 after same-store sales dropped 4.6 per cent. Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitch fell 4 per cent in September. The shares fell 1.3 per cent at $83.45.After disappointing results and forecasts from blue chips on Wednesday, fears rose that third-quarter earnings could decline.“Overall the market is probably headed lower. Earnings growth will slow to around 3 per cent, down from the previous quarter and at levels we haven’t seen for several years,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Avalon Partners. “I believe the market is overbought and third-quarter earnings will weigh.”Carmakers were cheered after the United Auto Workers union ended a strike against Chrysler just a few hours after it had begun.General Motors was among the leading stocks on the Dow, up 4.9 per cent to $39.99, its highest level since the end of 2004. Ford rose 6.5 per cent to $8.76.The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected in August, declining 2.4 per cent to $57.6bn.Initial claims for unemployment benefit fell 12,000 last week to 308,000, slightly better than expected.Interest rate futures priced in only a 36 per cent likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by the end of this month but the market still expects another easing by the end of the year.
386;TGT;Target Corp;2007-10-11T19:29:09Z;Warm weather softens US retail forecasts;;A dozen leading US retailers lowered their earnings forecasts on Thursday after unseasonably warm weather combined with the continuing housing market slump to slow September store sales.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its sales index for September rose just 1.6 per cent, against analysts’ forecasts of 2.3 per cent, and that all segments of the industry had been hit.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said “weather definitely distorted the month and made it look worse than it was”.But he said consumers were “finding it more difficult to get access to credit” as adjustable rate mortgages continue to reset. The housing market was still declining, “making consumers feel less wealthy” while food and energy prices were rising.Frank Badillo, economist at TNS Retail Forward, said that while the warm weather had affected sales of autumn clothing, shoppers were “also clearly telling us they want to hold the line on spending”.The retailers that lowered earnings guidance ranged from Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion store, to Target, the discount chain, underlining the broad impact of this autumn’s retail slowdown.PetSmart, the pet supplies retailer, lowered guidance on Tuesday, citing both weather and macro-economic conditions, while Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, trimmed its guidance last month.JCPenney, the department store, saw its shares fall more than 4 per cent after it sharply reduced its third-quarter earnings forecast. The retailer cited the impact of the housing slump on its home furnishings sales.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, also reported continued softness in its home and apparel sales.It said that a 1.4 per cent rise in same-store sales during the month had been driven by grocery and pharmacy sales – areas where its low prices are attractive to lower income shoppers. Wal-Mart said its research “reinforces that customers remain concerned about their finances, especially the cost of living”.However, the retailer also surprised Wall Street by increasing its earning guidance for the third quarter, citing a reduction in price mark-downs, and cost-cutting efforts in its US stores.Wal-Mart’s shares rose more than 3 per cent on the news.In an indication of continuing consumer uncertainties, TNS Retail Forward said on Thursday its monthly ShopperScape survey of 4,000 households had found that 27 per cent planned to spend “somewhat less” or “much less” during the holiday season, a rise from 21 per cent last year.The number saying they plan to spend “about the same” came in at just less than two-thirds, compared with almost three quarters of shoppers last year.
387;TGT;Target Corp;2007-10-04T20:01:10Z;Sears turns target;;Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager, has amassed 5m shares in Sears during the past month, a sign that patience with the department store operator’s turnround efforts may be finite.For now, Mr Ackman’s 3.5 per cent stake, at a cost of about $675m, is meant to prod Eddie Lampert, the chairman, along in his mission to boost Sears’ value. But, if history is any guide, Mr Ackman will have some suggestions of his own.Two and a half years after Mr Lampert, a lauded fund manager, combined Sears and Kmart into Sears Holdings, the retailer is still gasping for air. In the second quarter, profits sank 40 per cent and domestic same-store sales dropped 4.1 per cent. Sears’ shares had slumped 34 per cent since May 1 before rising recently owing to Mr Ackman’s interest. Elsewhere, his agitation for spin-offs, asset sales and share buybacks has propped up shares of Target, McDonald’s and Wendy’s.The two men are unlikely to sit cheek to cheek while Mr Lampert attempts to resuscitate Sears. They were at loggerheads last year over Mr Lampert’s failed bid to take Sears Canada private.For now, Mr Ackman plans to give Mr Lampert latitude. But Sears’ investors have grown displeased with its self-defined “softer side”. While none of Sears’ businesses has shown stellar results, some brands, including Kenmore, Craftsman and Lands’ End, have displayed promise. Others, however, notably Sears’ apparel, stack up poorly against competitors and take up square footage that could be used differently or sold.Mr Lampert has stressed that he views Sears as a retailer, not a real estate play. But it can be both. The share premium that Sears once commanded simply by dint of Mr Lampert’s presence has worn off. With commercial property prices holding strong and Mr Ackman underfoot, Mr Lampert may want to free up some real estate by quitting Sears’ weakest businesses.
388;TGT;Target Corp;2007-10-01T17:41:10Z;Target loses battle over logo;;"Target will be unable to use its distinctive red and white bulls-eye logo in the UK – and potentially the rest of Europe – after the US retail chain lost a four-year legal battle to wrest ownership of the trademark from Music Choice, a UK-based digital music provider.The UK’s Intellectual Property Office on Monday said Music Choice, which registered the bulls-eye trademark in 2001, was the legal owner of the logo and had exclusive rights to it. The decision could create difficulties for Target’s branding should it expand into the UK and Europe.“They can’t just start putting it out as a stand-alone logo [as they do in the US]; that would bring more proceedings against them,” said Laura Clatworthy, a solicitor at Rosenblatt who represented Music Choice.She said Music Choice was also fighting its case with the European intellectual property agency. The digital music company was awarded record costs from the regulator. Target could not be reached for comment.Target is the fourth-largest retailer in the US, with annual sales of $62bn, while Music Choice generated an operating loss of £2.9m ($5.9m) on sales of £8.2m in the year to December 31, 2005.Target’s growth strategy is firmly fixed on expanding its network of more than 1,500 US stores and the UK ruling is a setback for its international aspirations.This year, the discount retailer launched its first brand-building exercises in Europe, with two “pop-up” sales events at the Colette store in Paris and Selfridges in London aimed at supporting low-cost collections from Alice Temperley and Proenza Schouler.Target’s three-circle red and white bulls-eye logo, in use since 1968, is one of the most widely recognised corporate logos in the US.The lawsuit recalls the UK court battles fought over three decades between Apple and the company that manages the commercial interests of The Beatles, over the use of the apple motif and name."
389;TGT;Target Corp;2007-09-27T14:25:47Z;Wal-Mart shakes up generic pricing;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is to start selling prescription birth control drugs for around a third of their current prices, in a significant extension of its drive to lower the cost of commonly-used generic drugs.The retailer has also introduced a radically new approach to the pricing of generic alternatives to branded drugs that have just come onto the market.New generics with multiple producers are ususally priced at around 30 per cent of the price of the branded drug. Wal-Mart said it will sell a $4 new generic version of Glaxo’s Coreg, a blood pressure drug, that currently sells for $119. The generic alternative currently sells for around $30.Wal-Mart will also sell a new generic version of Novartis’ heavily marketed anti-fungal Lamisil for $4. A month’s supply of the branded drug currently costs over $330, while the generic alternative sells for $48.99 on Drugstore.com, the US internet pharmacy.The retailer said it would start selling a monthly supply of generic versions of Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri Cyclen birth control drugs for $9, compared to current prices of $24 to $30, introducing a second pricing tier into its low-cost generic programme.The retailer’s move to start selling generic drugs last year was copied by rivals including Target and a number of supermarkets, while Wal-Mart says it has reduced the costs to its customers by $396m over the past twelve months.Bill Simon, chief operating officer of Wal-Mart stores, said that the first phase of the programme “has exceeded all our expectations”.“We’ll continue to look for new ways to drive costs out of the healthcare system,” he said.The move has also led to other price cutting initiatives. Publix, a leading supemarket chain in the southeast US, announced this summer that it would start providing generic anti-biotics to its customers for free.Wal-Mart, which has been bitterly criticised over its own healthcare policies by union critics and others, said last year that it intends to use its market power as one of the largest pharmacy operators in the US to reshape the pharmaceuticals market.It is also supporting one of two business coalitions that are lobbying for government and state healthcare reform, with the retailer arguing for a more transparaent pricing system for healthcare services that would support “consumer driven” reforms.Mr Simon said: ”We have taken what we do best, working with suppliers, driving costs out of the supply chain and passing those savings to our customers. Now we’re applying that to health care.”
390;TGT;Target Corp;2007-09-25T20:43:18Z;Wall St rebounds from early lows;;Wall Street experienced a choppy session after big retailers lowered their sales forecasts and as house prices fell at their sharpest pace for 16 years.The market rebounded from early lows after existing home sales data declined at a slightly lower rate than anticipated. But athough technology stocks continued to surge, the gains failed to lift the broader market.The S&P 500 was flat at 1,517.22 after falling as low as 1,507.13. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed slightly higher, up 0.1 per cent at 13,778.65.The Nasdaq again outperformed the other main indices, as investors continued to favour tech-related stocks. The Nasdaq Composite index closed 0.6 per cent higher at 2,683.45, as Apple and Expedia hit all-time highs.Sentiment was bruised in early trade after disappointing sales forecasts from two big retailers and as new data showed consumer confidence had fallen close to a two-year low. Some early losses were pared as investors reasoned that much of the bad news had already been built in to stock values.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said: “It’s not at all surprising that existing home sales were down. It’s not even all that surprising that consumer confidence was off.“If anything, the most damaging thing is the anecdotal retail evidence.”Retail stocks suffered a torrid day after Target lowered its September store sales to an expected rise of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent, down from a range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent. Its shares closed 4.6 per cent lower at $61.35.The S&P retail index ended the day 2.7 per cent lower at 470.56 but is still trading 4.6 per cent above the low it hit when the credit squeeze began in August. The S&P consumer discretionary index lost 1.2 per cent to 287.36.Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, fell 6.7 per cent to $28.51, after it said slower sales would peg earnings at the low end or slightly below its prior guidance for the year. New consumer data weighed on retail stocks. The US Conference Board index of consumer confidence fell to 99.8 in August versus 105.6 in July, its lowest level since November 2005.Georges Yared, chief investment officer at Yared Investment Research, said: “Are we signalling the bottom in terms of consumer confidence? I think we are close but not quite there yet. The Fed is watching the actions of consumers like a hawk.”Other retail stocks suffered on weaker sentiment for the sector.Home Depot declined 2.4 per cent lower to $33.08, while Wal-Mart slipped 1.8 per cent to $43.16. Macy’s shed 3.2 per cent to $31.91.Housing-related stocks were also in focus after a string of new data.Existing home sales for August declined 4.3 per cent to 5.5m, their lowest level since August 2002. However, the result was slightly better than the 5.44m sales economists had predicted.The backlog of unsold homes climbed 0.4 per cent to 4.58m, the biggest backlog since records began in 1999. Existing home sales have declined in each of the past five months.Lennar posted a loss of $513.9m in the third quarter, versus a profit of $206.7m a year earlier. The loss was well beyond analyst expectations and shares in the homebuilder were down 7.7 per cent.The Case-Shiller home price index for July revealed a 4.5 per cent fall in its 10-city composite. The 20-city composite declined 3.9 per cent over the 12 months through July.Economists at Lehman Brothers said: “The housing market has indisputably taken a turn for the worse, largely due to tighter lending standards and higher borrowing costs. In an ugly feedback loop, buyer sentiment has fallen, putting even more downward pressure on sales and home prices.“We expect prices to ultimately fall more in this cycle than in the early 1990s.”The S&P homebuilders index fell 2.2 per cent to 419.58, while the SPDR homebuilders exchange-traded fund lost 2.6 per cent to $21.52.DR Horton shed 2.1 per cent to $13.28 while KB Home, which reports third- quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 2.5 per cent to $25.09.Energy stocks were also lower as oil prices fell below $80 in New York and after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said energy markets are “in turmoil”. The S&P energy index was down 0.9 per cent at 575.82 as US crude future prices shed $1.42 to $79.53 a barrel.
391;TGT;Target Corp;2007-09-13T20:42:57Z;Wall Street rally led by blue chips;;Wall Street stocks rose sharply higher on Thursday, buoyed by tentative signs of stability in money markets before next week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve.Stocks also held up in the face of a new record high for the price of oil, as benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed above $80 a barrel for the first time.The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 per cent to close at 1,483.95, outpacing the Nasdaq Composite’s gain of 0.4 per cent to 2,601.06.As stocks rallied, equity volatility, as measured by the Vix index, eased just 0.8 per cent.Financials were one of the best performing sectors in the S&P, while the top stock was Countrywide, up 13.9 per cent at $18.93, which more than reversed its losses earlier this week. The largest US mortage lender said it had arranged $12bn in additional secured borrowing capacity.Another sign that credit conditions were starting to stabilise was seen in the latest weekly data on the commercial paper market released by the Federal Reserve. Outstanding CP declined for a fifth successive week but the pace was much slower.“The decline is also the smallest since the CP tempest began last month,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets.“The notion that the moderation might signal the worst of the crisis is over is corroborated by anecdotal evidence of buyers beginning to re-enter, albeit on a very, very tentative scale, the CP market.”Lehman Brothers continued its recent rebound before third-quarter results next week with a rise of 4.6 per cent to $59.68. The bank’s shares have rallied nearly 13 per cent this week.The economic calendar picks up on Friday when retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilisation reports arrive. The information will provide policymakers with their last pieces of data before they meet next week to discuss monetary policy.Investors expect at least a 25 basis point cut in the 5.25 per cent Fed Funds rate. But given the continued strains in global money markets facing financial institutions, some economists and investors are calling for at least a half-percentage point easing.The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the major benchmarks on Thursday with a rally of 1 per cent to 13,424.88. A number of Dow components were in the news, led by General Motors, up 10 per cent at $33.29, after the United Auto Workers union indicated a willingness to help cut healthcare costs.McDonald’s gained 6.1 per cent to $54.30 amd set a record high of $54.68 after it announced a 50 per cent increase in its annual cash dividend to $1.50 a share. The company said this week that global same-store sales rose 8.1 per cent in August. The stock has rallied more than 10 per cent since Monday.Citigroup said: “Positive global momentum combined with shareholder friendly initiatives position McDonald’s well in a challenging market environment,” as it maintained a $58 target on the stock.Microsoftraised its quarterly dividend by a cent and the stock was up 0.8 per cent at $29.16.Merck was another Dow stock on the rise, with a gain of 0.4 per cent to $49.86 after Bank of America upgraded the pharmaceutical giant to a ‘buy’ with a price target of $57.Shares in Exxon Mobil were 1.1 per cent higher at $88.62, boosted by record oil prices. Other stocks in the news included, Target, up 2.7 per cent at $64.42 after the retailer said it might sell $7bn in credit-card receivables. Analysts at Citigroup said: “It is a positive that Target is taking steps to determine if there is additional value that can be returned to shareholders.“Bill Ackman’s 9.6 per cent stake in the company could have prompted management to take action, in our view.”Qualcomm rose 3.4 per cent to $39.17 after a judge halted an import ban on mobile phones containing the company’s 3G handsets. It represents a legal victory in the chipmaker’s patent dispute with rival Broadcom, whose shares rose 1.4 per cent at $35.87.Isis Pharmaceuticals rose 4.2 per cent to $13.30 after it announced a collaboration with Ortho-McNeil, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, up 1 per cent at $63.11, for the treatment of various medical disorders.Biogen rose 1.1 per cent to $65.40, and reversed losses in early trade after UBS downgraded the biotech drug maker to “sell” and maintained a $58 price target.First Data closed a fraction firmer at $33.39. Investors focused on talk that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which engineered a $26bn buy-out of the credit card processor, could delay the sale of loans to fund that deal.The stock remained below the $34 a share buy-out price.
392;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Wall St higher on retail sales figures;;Wall Street stocks closed moderately higher on Thursday, reversing earlier losses, as investors digested better-than-expected retail sales for August amid concerns over elevated money market rates.Of the 31 retailers that reported figures for August, 20 had beaten their estimates, according to Thomson Financial, the business information company.Wal-Mart shares were up 0.7 per cent to $42.76 after the largest US retailer said same-store sales rose 3.1 per cent in August, against estimates of 1-2 per cent growth.Target also beat estimates, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $63.39.American Eagle Outfitters’ same-store sales jumped 9 per cent, helped by a later tax-free shopping period in Texas and Florida, the retailer said on Thursday. Its shares were down 1.6 per cent at $24.71.Gap shares were 4 per cent lower at $18.25 after it reported a drop of 1 per cent.Macy’s, the second-largest US department store chain, also reported a gain in same-store sales, beating the estimate for unchanged sales, sending its shares 1 per cent higher at $30.87.By the close of trading in New York, the S&P 500 index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,478.55, while the Nasdaq composite was up 0.3 per cent at 2,614.32.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 13,363.35.“Equities are slightly edgy, credit spreads are marginally wider and the current most overt symptom that all is not right in the boiling room is that Libor rates continue to head in ‘the wrong’ direction, providing an overt symbol of the limitations of central bank liquidity injections,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.“Not that central banks are not pursuing appropriate policies, with the ECB continuing to pump in extraordinary amounts of cash.”On Thursday, three-month US Libor set at 5.72375 per cent, a new peak in the floating rate benchmark since the credit crunch started early last month. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said: “We continue to be bullish on the domestic stock market for the next 6-12 months, as our earnings, valuation and sentiment work all support our positive stance.“Admittedly, an increase in high-yield borrowing costs would be a roadblock for LBO activity and/or stock buy-backs funded with debt.”Mr Levkovich, however, noted some concerns for late 2008 and early 2009.“If the stock market continues to appreciate over the next 12 months or so, as we deem likely, we could see a deluge of money flows back into US stocks.“This would raise the risk profile, in our opinion, and could be an issue to monitor for any excessive bullish sentiment.”Also in the news, Countrywide Financialannounced it would cut another 900 jobs, as the nation’s largest mortgage lender deals with the credit crunch. Its shares were down 1.8 per cent at $18.48.Campbell Soup dropped 3.5 per cent to $36.68 after the world’s largest soupmaker said fourth-quarter profit was 14 cents a share excluding one-time items. Analysts had estimated earnings of 18 cents a share.In economic news, weekly jobless claims declined 19,000 to 318,000, much larger than a forecast 4,000 fall. Investors will focus on the monthly employment report for August due on Friday for a broader view of the underlying trend in the labour market.Meanwhile, non-farm business productivity rose 2.6 per cent during the second quarter, after being previously estimated at 1.8 per cent.Stock market investors also responded to the Institute for Supply Management’s survey of non-manufacturing activity for August.The report was expected to show a decline to 54.5 from 55.8, but actually remained unchanged in August from July at 55.8.The Federal Reserve released the outstanding commercial paper volumes, showing the outstanding level of commercial paper dropped once again over this week to Wednesday.But the decline was smaller than that seen in the previous three weeks.The total outstanding amount of commercial paper fell $54.1bn on a seasonally adjusted basis to $1,925bn.
393;TGT;Target Corp;2007-09-06T18:20:49Z;US retailers see solid August;;Leading US retailers on Thursday reported better than expected August sales as shoppers shrugged off the credit anxieties afflicting Wall Street.Wal-Mart, Macy’s and Target delivered stronger-than-expected growth in sales at stores open at least a year, while Retail Metrics’ monthly comparable sales index showed average growth of 3.1 per cent, beating its 2.6 per cent forecast.But analysts warned that the month did not represent a deeper shift in consumer sentiment.Frank Badillo, senior economist at TNS Retail Forward, said that while “shoppers were not spooked” by fears of a credit crunch, “that only means that the fallout for households will hit home more gradually in the coming months”.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, noted that, in spite of the August figures, overall sales continued to grow at a slower rate than last year as consumers faced concerns over housing prices and fuel costs. Retail Metrics said its index showed average monthly growth of 2.8 per cent so far this year, down from 3.7 per cent for the first eight months of 2006.Mr Badillo said retailers “are on a slowing trend that we have seen since January or so”. He said he expected further slowing as consumers face higher mortgage costs and reduced access to low-cost financing from car makers and others, as well as increased job insecurity.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported a 3.1 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, ahead of Wall Street’s 1.6 per cent forecast, as it cut prices on back-to-school items.Comparable sales at Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount outlets still grew by less than in the same period last year, up 2.8 per cent against 2.9 per cent last year. But overall sales were supported by a 5.2 per cent increase in comparable sales at the retailer’s Sam’s Club discount warehouses.Target, Wal-Mart’s smaller rival discounter, reported a 6.1 per cent increase in monthly sales, which Bob Ulrich, chief executive, said was “near the upper end of our planned range”.Sales at Macy’s, the largest US department store, beat its predictions of a 1 to 3 per cent fall during the month, with a 2.4 per cent increase.The luxury sector continued its strong run as Saks reported a same-store sales jump of 18.2 per cent on demand for designer clothing and shoes, and Nordstrom recorded a 6.6 per cent gain.
394;TGT;Target Corp;2007-08-21T20:38:25Z;Wall St unconvinced by Bush reassurances;;Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, in spite of assurances from Christopher Dodd, head of the US Senate banking committee, that Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, had agreed to use “all of the tools at his disposal’’ to stabilise financial markets and from President George W. Bush that there was “enough liquidity in the system”.A cautious afternoon rally followed early losses on comments by Henry Paulson, the US Treasury Secretary, who said he saw no quick solution to problems in the credit markets.Mr Dodd’s remark came after he met Mr Paulson and Mr Bernanke to discuss the markets’ recent turbulence.Last week the Fed cut its overnight discount rate by 50 basis points. While that initially gave markets a boost, the rally ran out of steam on Monday.The S&P 500 finished the day up 0.1 per cent at 1,447.12, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent at 2,521.30, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 13,090.86.There were signs that traders were shopping for bargains. Confidence among global institutional investors rose in August despite volatility on financial markets, according to a study by State Street, the financial services firm.Credit Suisse said markets presented buying opportunities. “There has been more of a liquidity crisis than an economic or valuation crisis in the stock market,” said analysts at the financial services group, adding that “relative valuations have become much more attractive”. But they also cautioned that there may not be a simple V-shaped recovery.More evidence of the pain in the housing market came yesterday from a report showing foreclosure filings — such as default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions — almost doubled last month from a year ago. In total, 179,599 foreclosure filings were reported during July, up from 92,845 in 2006, according to RealtyTrac, a research firm.Countrywide Financial, which has seen its stock price fall by 30 per cent in recent days, was in the spotlight again after speculation that the US’s biggest mortgage lender could be a buy-out target for Warren Buffett. Shares in the beleaguered mortgage giant rose 10 per cent to $21.79.Another mortgage lender grabbing traders’ attention was Accredited Home Lenders. The subprime lender said yesterday an unnamed investor had agreed to buy $1bn of loans with the option for Accredited to buy back the loans before mid-November. The news came after lawyers for Lone Star, the buy-out group, said problems at Accredited justified its withdrawal from a proposed $400m purchase of the company and said Accredited had no grounds for its lawsuit to force completion of the merger. The company’s shares rose 1.7 per cent to $6.55.A string of retailers reported quarterly earnings. Shares in Target closed up 1.7 per cent at $60.10 after the discount retailer reported second quarter earnings in line with expectations. Staples reported second-quarter profits in line with Wall Street projections but said sales slipped in its North American stores that have been open for more than a year. Issuing a cautious forecast for the rest of the year, Ron Sargent, chief executive, said he was worried about consumer spending. Shares in the US’s biggest office-supplies retailer lost 0.04 per cent to $23.30.Among other retailers, American Eagle reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. The youth fashion retailer’s shares closed down 0.9 per cent at $22.81, but S&P reiterated its “strong buy” recommendation on the stock. Dick’s Sporting Goods reported second-quarter profits well ahead of expectations, with earnings up 87 per cent to $47.9m from $25.7m a year ago. The retailer’s shares rose 8.7 per cent to $60.43. Saks reported a bigger loss for the second quarter than analysts had been expecting – $24.6m, up from a loss of $51.9m a year earlier. Its shares closed down 6.2 per cent at $16.83.In technology, shares in LSI rose 7.1 per cent to $6.62 after Infineon Technologies, Europe’s second-biggest semiconductor-maker, agreed to buy its mobility products group for about $445m. Apple rose 4.4 per cent to $127.57 after the company said sales of its iPhone could beat its own targets for the quarter.
395;TGT;Target Corp;2007-08-21T19:17:20Z;Target shrugs off economic woes;;Target on Tuesday underlined the resilience of middle-income US consumers by reporting strong quarterly earnings in spite of worries over the housing market and energy costs.While the US discount store chain said it would be slightly more conservative in its planning for the remainder of the year, Bob Ulrich, chief executive, said the company continued to believe it “will deliver strong sales and profit performance in 2007”.He said that Target’s forecast earnings of $3.60 a share for the year remained “within the range of likely outcomes”.The results from the retailer, known for its “cheap chic” offerings, contrasted with last week’s lowered earnings guidance from Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer.Wal-Mart cited economic pressures on its lower income customers, saying it was seeing evidence that its customers were running out of money at the end of each month.However, Target’s stronger performance was mirrored in robust results last week from JC Penney and Kohl’s, the mid-range department stores that serve similar customers, and from Nordstrom’s, the upmarket fashion store.US retail stores have seen monthly comparable sales growing at a slower rate this year compared with 2006, which analysts attribute to the impact of higher energy costs and interest rates.Mr Ulrich noted that Target’s sales at stores open at least a year had increased by almost 1 per cent less than last year during the first six months of the year.“We’re not anticipating that will soften. We’re saying we’re at slightly more modest pace than we were last year, and we see that continuing into the fall season,” he said.Bob Buchanan, retail analyst at AG Edwards, said on Tuesday that “overall …the consumer seems tired, and dragged down by such issues as the weak housing market and the related negative impact on personal balance sheets”.He forecast that the six-month average of AG Edwards same-store retail sales index would slip further during the second half of the year, from an expected 2 per cent for the six months up to August.For the quarter, Target reported net earnings of $686m, or 80 cents per diluted share, on a 9.5 per cent increase in sales to $14.62bn.Target also reported that earnings before tax from its large credit card business increased 34 per cent to $163m against the same period last year, in part due to an increase in late fees.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, said the retailer was not concerned about any increased strains on its credit card business as a result of the macro-economic environment. “We have a high degree of confidence in the continued health and prosperity of our credit card business.”
396;TGT;Target Corp;2007-07-16T18:04:14Z;Ackman takes 9.6% stake in Target;;Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has taken a 9.6 per cent share in Target, the US discount retailer, and says he will push for changes at a company whose shares have risen more than 45 per cent in the past 12 months.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Investment fund has given no details of objectives, but Wall Street analysts expect him to focus on capital structure rather than the company’s much-applauded operating performance.In a regulatory filing on Monday, Pershing Square said it believed Target’s stock “is undervalued and [we] intend to discuss with management ways in which this …can be corrected”.The filing also said Target, led by Bob Ulrich, its chief executive, had “the strongest operating management in the retail industry”. Mr Ulrich was recently named CEO of the year by Chief Executive magazine.The retailer serves more prosperous middle-class customers than the bigger Wal-Mart and has set standards for its effective marketing and creation of “cheap chic” private label brands by designers including Isaac Mizrahi and Michael Graves.Target would not comment directly on Pershing Square’s stake but said the company welcomed “a dialogue on company strategy and performance with any member of our investor base and the financial community”.Wall Street analysts expect Mr Ackman’s discussions with the retailer to focus on its lucrative credit card portfolio and property holdings. Target, which operates 1,500 stores across the US and had sales last year of $57.8bn, owns about 85 per cent of its real estate.Other top US retailers – including Macy’s and Kohl’s – have sold their credit card businesses but Target says the business is integral to its effort to build relationships with its customers.In an unusual development, Pershing Square also said it would donate a third of any after-tax profits resulting from its investment in Target to its charitable foundation, set up last year, which funds inner-city development and human rights work.Mr Ackman has previously staged activist campaigns at McDonald’s and Wendy’s. Pershing Square’s stake in Target is valued at more than $5.6bn.
397;TGT;Target Corp;2007-07-12T20:31:00Z;America’s chain stores feel the breeze;;US shoppers are feeling the strains of a gloomy housing market and high fuel prices, according to figures released Thursday by leading US chain stores.Wal-Mart, the largest, reported stronger-than-expected like-for-like sales in June, but sales in chain stores overall grew less than the year before, continuing the trend of the year so far.Retail Metrics, which surveys monthly figures, said its same-store sales index for the month rose 2.6 per cent, supported by Wal-Mart’s performance. But this compared with an average increase for the past six months of 2.9 per cent.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, warned that there would be no let-up for the sector. “The month was still soft …and we would expect that to continue for the rest of the year,” he said.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said the June figures continued a “soft patch” for US retailers. “The good news is that the soft patch did not get deeper, raising the threat of it continuing for longer.“The underlying dynamic is still with us, and the soft housing market in particular,” he said.Wal-Mart reported same-store sales up 2.4 per cent, more than double analysts’ estimates.The retailer benefited from a 6.9 per cent increase at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores, which cater for small businesses and prosperous shoppers. Sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 1.6 per cent.Target, its main rival, reported a 3.3 per cent same-store increase, but expected stronger sales growth in July of 5 to 7 per cent.US department stores also delivered worse results than expected. Macy’s, struggling to integrate its 2005 acquisition of May’s, reported comparable sales down 2.7 per cent. It predicted a sales drop of up to 3 per cent in July and cut earnings guidance for the quarter.JC Penney and Kohl’s reported sales declines of 1.5 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively. Comparable sales at Saks, the luxury department store, were down 5.6 per cent.The US Commerce Department will release its June consumer spending figures Friday.
398;TGT;Target Corp;2007-06-07T22:33:14Z;Warm May lifts sales at US retailers;;Leading US chain retailers on Thursday reported solid sales in May, as warm weather released pent-up demand from a dismal April and helped offset continuing consumer concerns over petrol prices and the housing market.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly sales numbers, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 per cent for the month, supported by good performances by upmarket department stores and some speciality clothing retailers.Nordstrom, Saks and Bon Ton department stores all beat Wall Street forecasts. However, Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, missed market expectations for the fourth consecutive month, with a 3.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, highlighting concerns about its integration of the former May’s Department stores it acquired in 2005.At JC Penney, comparable sales dropped 2 per cent, with it citing soft sales in jewellery, women’s accessories and household products, while sales at its rival Kohl’s saw a 10.5 per cent increase.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, reported a 7 per cent fall in same-store sales in North America, with sales at its Gap brand stores down 3 per cent. The retailer is pursuing a turnround while searching for a chief executive to replace Paul Pressler, who stepped down in January.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, reported that sales at its discount stores and Supercenters rose 0.3 per cent, although its Sam’s Club warehouse sales were up 5.4 per cent to give a total comparable sales increase of 1.1 per cent.Wal-Mart again said that its consumers continue to be troubled by rising petrol prices, which hit $3.20 during the month.The company said sales of clothing and home goods remained sluggish, but it expected to see improvements in the categories in its third quarter and “significant progress” in the fourth quarter. It said it expected sales in June to be between flat or up 2 per cent.Target, its smaller upmarket rival, said its same-store sales rose 5.8 per cent.
399;TGT;Target Corp;2007-05-24T14:08:22Z;Cheap drugs price war stirs US retailers;;"Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has over the past two decades reshaped both the US retail industry and the economy. Can it also reduce the more than $200bn (£100bn; €150bn) that Americans spend on prescription drugs every year?Since September, the company has been pursuing a high-profile attempt to cut costs, announcing that its in-store pharmacies would sell a month’s supply of 300 commonly prescribed generic drugs for $4, a 60 per cent cut in the cost of the most expensive drugs on the list.Wal-Mart says that low-cost generics – copies of brand name drugs whose patents have expired – now account for 35 per cent of the prescriptions issued in its instore pharmacies. Lee Scott, chief executive, de­clared in April that the cuts had so far saved his customers $290m, and that 30 per cent of the drugs were being issued without health insurance. Target, Wal-Mart’s main discount rival, has followed up with its own $4 programme, while Kmart has extended an offer of three months’ supply of generics for $15.But as the programme continues, questions remain over whether the initiative can eventually achieve the more substantive, structural changes to the US drug pricing model, and by extension the US healthcare market, that Bill Simon, head of Wal-Mart’s pharmacy operations, says he wants to achieve.“Before we took what was given us. What we’re doing now is trying to lead,” he says. Mr Simon argues that the $4 generic programme could eventually bring down the price for the selected generics across the market – just as Wal-Mart contributed to last year’s fall in the price of flatscreen TVs. That, he claims, would lead to a $10bn reduction in overall US healthcare costs.But in an indication of the opaque world of US drug pricing, several of Wal-Mart’s rivals haven’t yet followed suit.the US’s three largest drug store chains, CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid, have refused to follow suit, arguing that customers covered by insurance only pay around $5 out of their own pocket for generics because of co-payment arrangements.The arguments over the issue are an indication of the opaque world of US drug pricing. Wal-Mart and its allies say that, although the customer may pay only $5 up front in the drug store chains, the remaining costs, including the transaction processing costs, are borne by the healthcare system as a whole. “Standard industry practices had led to a place where price was relatively irrelevant,” Mr Simon says.In any case, Brian Sweet, chief clinical pharmacy officer at Wellpoint, one of the largest health insurers, says Wal-Mart’s current programme is not extensive enough to impact overall pricing. “If it was broader, then you may have a big enough initiative …that covers enough of the utilisation patterns, that it would change pricing.”But Wal-Mart wants to expand its project. It says it is considering introducing a second price tier for generics, of around $9, and that it believes that eventually 40 to 50 per cent of all drugs prescribed in the US could be covered. Wal-Mart is now talking to the insurers about designing healthcare plans that take account of the availabilty of both tiers of low-cost generic drugs.“They understand there’s a role these products could play in a new look at the fu­ture,” says Mr Simon. “They could redesign a programme that would offer to their clients extra value on the expensive drugs because they don’t need to provide support on the inexpensive ones.”Wellpoint’s Mr Sweet says the insurer is watching the unfolding dynamics of the programme. “It certainly is a bellwether to watch …if these programmes are utilised heavily or expanded then we may have some change in the way we do business here.”Wal-Mart’s interest in healthcare stems in part from its own healthcare issues; Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the US, with around 1.3m workers. It has faced rising healthcare costs and a storm of political criticism over the level of healthcare support offered to its largely low-wage workforce.Wal-Mart’s strategies should also win the company new customers. Pharmacies and clinics encourage customers to stay in stores longer, meaning they are also good for sales."
400;TGT;Target Corp;2007-05-23T20:42:18Z;Wall St retreats on Greenspan remarks;;US stocks retreated in late trading on Wednesday, closing lower, after former Federal Reserve chairman said he feared a ‘massive contraction’ in Chinese stocks and a slowdown in global growth.Meanwhile, technology was weighed down by further weakness among chip makers.The S&P 500 had been on course to close at a record high as deals and earnings led to early gains. But Mr Greenspan’s comments, in which he said recent growth in Chinese stocks was ‘unsustainable,’ led to the late downturn.A possible battle for control of Alcan was a major talking point. The Canadian aluminium producer’s board said shareholders should reject an unsolicited $27.6bn bid from US rival Alcoa.A Canadian newspaper report said Alcan was in talks with BHP Billiton regarding a possible merger with the Australian miner. At the close,shares in Alcan were up 6 per cent at $85.89 and Alcoa was 3.7 per cent higher at $40.38.Materials stocks were one of the best-performing sectors in the S&P. Other rising sectors included energy, while utilities were lower and technology was weighed down by further weakness among chipmakers.The S&P was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,522.17, having reached 1532.43 earlier in the session, above its record closing price of 1,527.46 set on March 24 2000.The June S&P futures contract has set a new high of 1535.70 and traders said it was poised to test 1,540.20.But the S&P has not yet threatened its intra-day record high of 1,552.87 – set on the same day as the all-time closing high seven years ago. Some analysts believe the recent consolidation in the S&P just below its record level has primed the index for a decisive move higher.“The longer we sit here, the more likely the S&P will move higher towards 1,600,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading.One possible reason behind the S&P’s sideways trading earlier this week may have been investors selling the index as it initially tested record levels.“The record close is a good level to set a short position for a quick trade but, as the market starts to move higher, any shorts left may be forced to cover,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, speaking before the S&P’s afternoon swoon.“I get the feeling that, if the S&P stretches higher, it will force a lot of people to buy in,” he added.Earlier this week, the New York Stock Exchange said short trades on stocks, which make money if prices fall, had risen to a new record level.Technology shares were in focus as Amazon rose 5 per cent to $72.30 in early trading, a seven-year high after the online retailer said it was buying Brilliant Audio, the largest independent publisher of audio books in the US for an undisclosed amount. But Amazon gave back most of the gains to close up 0.17 per cent at $69.The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.4 per cent at 2,577.1.Semiconductor stocks were in negative territory, as Analog Devices slumped 10.1 per cent to $36.33. The chipmaker said fiscal third-quarter earnings would fall short of the prior year’s third quarter results.Blue-chips, which had earlier marched further into record territory, also closed down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 13,525.4 and set a new intra-day high of 13,609.76. Caterpillar, a Dow component, was up 0.7 per cent at $76.03.Boeing‘s shares fell 0.9 per cent to $95.57 after the aircraft maker reaffirmed earnings guidance for this year.Ihere was a merger in the shoe sector as Payless ShoeSource said on Tuesday that it was buying Stride Rite for around $800m. Stride Rite soared 30.8 per cent to $20.21 and Payless gained 10.1 per cent to $35.13.Shares in Dow Jones were up 2.2 per cent at $52.58 as the Bancroft family was due to hold a private meeting and discuss last month’s $60-a-share offer from News Corp. The family, which controls 64 per cent of Dow Jones voting power through a special class of stock, initially rejected the bid. Shares in News Corp were up 0.5 per cent at $23.91.In earnings, Medtronic rose 4.3 per cent to $52.97 after its fourth-quarter earnings rose 10 per cent.Target said its quarterly results beat estimates and its shares were up 2.6 per cent at $59.54.
401;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US stores hit as shoppers scale back;;Continuing economic pressures on consumers combined with cold weather and the impact of an early Easter to give leading US retailers a miserable April, according to same-store sales figures published on Thursday.Ken Perkins, head of Retail Metrics, said 80 per cent of the leading chain stores reporting same-store sales figures missed Wall Street forecasts, which he described as the worst performance he could remember. Retail Metrics’ index of same-store sales fell 1.8 per cent for the month, after a 6 per cent increase in March.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, also pointed out that the average monthly growth in same-store sales over the past three months was 2 per cent, compared with 4 per cent over the same period last year.“I think the statement is that the consumer has scaled back spending …And the key story is really the ripple effect of slower housing demand on the retail sector,” he said.He also warned of continuing threats to consumer demand ahead, including rising petrol prices, lingering housing problems and future increases in food costs. “It is definitely a tough environment for the retailers, and it doesn’t look that much better in the near term.”Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said its monthly survey of shoppers showed concerns about higher fuel prices had “increased steadily since January”. During April, the retailer reported a 3.5 per cent fall in sales at stores open at least a year, its worst figures for more than 25 years. It cited factors including the cold weather, which discouraged consumers from buying summer clothing and goods, as well as the effects of a recall of petfood by its main suppliers. Target, its discount rival, said April stores fell 6.1 per cent, having warned last month that sales would be weaker than its original forecast of a decline of 2 to 4 per cent.Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, reported a 2.2 per cent fall in same-store sales, while JC Penney reported a 2.7 per cent decline, both worse the Wall Street analysts had predicted.Gap, the struggling speciality clothing retailer, was particularly badly hit, reporting a 16 per cent fall in same-store sales, including a 14 per cent fall at its Gap brand stores in North America, and a 20 per cent fall at Old Navy. Net sales were down 11 per cent.
402;TGT;Target Corp;2007-04-24T20:49:48Z;IBM gains boost Dow;;"Wall Street stocks held within tight margins on Tuesday after a string of solid earnings reports helped soothe concerns about weak home sales.The disappointing housing data, coupled with soft consumer confidence figures, soured the mood in morning trading by increasing concerns about the wider economy. Shares in homebuilders and retailers fell sharply.By midday, however, the main market indices had recovered, led by technology stocks. The relatively measured market reaction to the downbeat economic news encouraged some analysts.“I’m impressed that the market has held up even though the magnitude of the decline [in home sales] was pretty large,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.“I’m not a fan of weather-related excuses but in this case people are holding out to see the pattern over a longer period.”The S&P 500 index closed flat at 1,480.44. Boosted by gains IBM, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent at 12,953.94.Meanwhile, the technology-led Nasdaq Composite rose 0.03 per cent to 2,524.54.Most companies reporting on Tuesday beat profit estimates and raised their earnings guidance, according to Bloomberg data.“There has been more good earnings news than bad,” said Mr Hogan. “The guidance in particular is catching us by surprise.”The technology sector showed patches of strength.Texas Instruments jumped 7.7 per cent to $34.92 after the group overcame a glut of inventory to beat profit forecasts. In one of the first optimistic sets of remarks about demand for microchips this year, the group added that it expected better sales ahead.Piper Jaffray upgraded its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”, citing improved margins and a better product mix.The guidance lifted other chipmakers, including Nat­ional Semiconductor, which rose 4.3 per cent to $26.91. Meanwhile, SanDisk, the flash-memory maker, rose 4 per cent to $43.54.Some analysts remained guarded. “We caution investors from getting too bullish on the overall semiconductor cycle,” said Credit Suisse in a note to clients.“Demand and supply-chain dynamics continue to point to a muted recovery.”The Dow was led up by IBM, which gained 3.5 per cent to $98.49 after the computer services group raised its dividend and said it was buying back $15bn of its stock.AT&T reported a doubling of first-quarter profits to $2.8bn, beating estimates in its first full quarter since the company bought BellSouth. But its shares slipped 1.7 per cent to $39.10 after the number of its new subscribers disappointed.Housebuilders’ stocks fell after data showed the biggest year-on-year fall in existing home sales for 18 years. DR Horton pared early losses to stand 0.3 per cent lower at $22.53.The S&P Homebuilders index, which approached its lowest level in almost three years earlier this month, has dropped 16.6 per cent
this year. Retail groups were also under pressure after Target, the discount chain, said its sales were much weaker than expected in April.Its shares slid 1.8 per cent to $60.33. Rival Wal-Mart fell 0.5 per cent to $48.69.Steel stocks suffered after downbeat guidance from US Steel defied hopes that industry sales would imp-rove in the second quarter. US Steel slid 3.7 per cent to $103.04, while Nucor slipped 2.7 per cent to $66.71.AK Steel bucked the trend, rising 4.2 per cent to $30.99, after it reported a 10-fold jump in profits.IPSCO, which is in talks that could lead to the sale of the company, slipped 0.5 per cent to $151.48 after its earnings disappointed analysts.Speculation about the identity of a potential buyer has centred on Evraz, the Russian steelmaker."
403;TGT;Target Corp;2007-04-18T21:49:53Z;JC Penney enters Manhattan;;JC Penney, the mainstream US department store, is to open its first store in Manhattan, as it continues its drive to shake off its popular image as the favoured retailer of frumpy middle America.The retailer said on Wednesday it would open a 150,000 sq ft flagship store in the Manhattan Mall, a development close to Macy’s department store on Herald Square. The area has become an increasingly popular focus for national retailers, with Victoria’s Secret, Zara and H&M opening there in recent years.JC Penney already has a store in the suburban borough of Queens, but the new store will be the first in Manhattan to open since the chain was founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney.The new store plans are part of a five year growth plan which underlines the retailer’s resurgence since emerging from near bankruptcy in 1999. The company, whose 1,039 stores had sales last year of almost $20bn, will this year open 50 stores, up from 28 in 2006 and 18 in 2005.It said yesterday it will continue to open around 50 stores a year until 2011, with majority in free-standing locations, rather the traditional anchor locations in major malls.Mike Boylson, chief marketing officer, said JC Penney would continue its efforts to bring in new customers and those who only use the store occasionally. It included in the category former customers of the May department stores acquired last year by Macy’s.The retailer also set a target for improving its operating income margin of 12-12.5 per cent by 2011, against 9.7 per cent in 2006. It forecast compound average growth in earnings per share of 16 per cent from 2008 to 2011.Mike Ullman, chief executive, highlighted the importance of the retailer’s new deal with Polo Ralph Lauren to launch a range of exclusive private label apparel and home goods in 2008 under the name American Living.Developing an own brand strategy through links to leading fashion names has been a key part of the retailer’s strategy to differentiate itself from lower-cost competitors such as Target and Wal-Mart. More than 40 per cent of its products are own-label, against around 20 per cent for Macy’s, the largest US department store chain.Last year, it announced a deal with Liz Clairborne for low-cost clothing ranges, and with Sephora, the cosmetics retailer owned by LVMH, to open a series of stores-within-a-store across its networks. Earlier this year it launched a new brand identity programme around the slogan “every day matters”, after switching its advertising account to Saatchi & Saatchi.
404;TGT;Target Corp;2007-04-17T22:25:49Z;Expensive defensive stocks;;Compared with their bond market peers, investors in US equity markets remain notoriously optimistic in their economic outlook. Or so the conventional wisdom goes. Dig a little deeper, though, and the message is a lot less clear than the near doubling of the S&P 500 since its 2002 trough would suggest.For one thing, shares have lagged behind rapidly expanding earnings. That has left the market as a whole trading at just over 15 times underlying earnings on Standard & Poor’s bottom up estimates for 2007, leading some to conclude that even a few quarters of lacklustre growth need not spoil the party. But the aggregate hides as much as it reveals.Among the sectors commanding high price/earnings multiples, a revealingly large number are in areas that should do comparatively well during a downturn. Consumer staples, for example, trade at about 18 times earnings. This is roughly matched by such businesses as Anheuser-Busch or PepsiCo. Companies credited with earnings growth potential, such as Procter & Gamble or WM Wrigley, are a lot dearer still.Similarly, the slightly more cyclical consumer discretionary sector, which includes media companies and the likes of Target, McDonald’s and Nike, trades at about 20 times earnings. Healthcare, telecommunications and utilities are also valued more highly than the broader market, if less aggressively so. Among classic favourites in rising markets, by contrast, only information technology commands a premium rating.For the S&P 500 as a whole, all of this is offset by the low ratings of financials – the largest earnings contributor by far – and energy. Investors are certainly wise not to expect peak-level earnings in those industries to last forever. Unfortunately, in the process, they have also driven up relative valuations of more defensive sectors – including ones with fairly direct exposure to slowing consumer spending. The mundane headline valuation of the S&P 500 may offer far less protection than at first appears if and when peak profits begin to fall.
405;TGT;Target Corp;2007-03-19T15:42:29Z;Wall St falls for the week as subprime fears intensify;;"Wall Street plumbed new lows for the year this week but stocks recovered as investors regained composure after subprime mortgage scares.The talk on Wall Street yesterday after a week of severe volatility, was mostly about a report that Blackstone, the private equity group, was planning an initial public offering.A market debut by Blackstone is likely to be taken as a sign of confidence in the face of recent weakness in global equities. Details of the offer are unclear, but Blackstone is understood to be in advanced stages of preparation. The prospect of a flotation is likely to cause a big stir.Shares in Fortress Investment, the private equity group and hedge fund manager, almost doubled on its market debut in February amid intense demand from retail investors. By the close on Friday Fortress had fallen 30 per cent to $25.74 from its intra-day record high $37 reached on the day of its market debut.The Blackstone talk came at the end of a tumultuous week in which stocks were propped up by the seemingly relentless flow of deals, including a dramatic bid for CBOT Holdings.After the tentative gains made in the previous week, technical analysts had been anticipating a “test” that would indicate whether the recent turmoil would develop into a longer-lasting bear market.When the “test” came on Tuesday and Wednesday, it was once again related to subprime mortgage problems. But familiarity with the issue was little comfort to investors watching stocks plunge across the board.At one stage the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below the 12,000 mark; a plunge of 5.9 per cent from its record high in February.The Dow closed 0.4 per cent lower on Friday, to stand 1.3 per cent down for the week at 12,110.41. The S&P 500 Index was 1.1 per cent lower at 1,386.95. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6 per cent to 2,372.66.Financial groups led the slide down, and the way back up, as three big investment banks reported results. In the event, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns all met or exceeded expectations. But with rumours of losses swirling round the market, the announcements were a source of anxiety and reassurance by turns.Persistent worries about Lehman’s exposure to subprime mortgages sent its shares at one point 10 per cent below Tuesday’s opening. But the stock rallied as executives said the group was well-hedged. Lehman was finished the week 6.1 per cent down at $71.19. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent down at $199.Some analysts expected that volatility would continue. “Long-term investors should pull up a lawn chair and enjoy the fireworks,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “Until we get through some of the crazy action, the sidelines should be a safe and comfortable spot.”Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank, said the market “will need much greater clarity about corporate earnings before a meaningful rally can ensue”.Carmakers skidded this week. General Motors reported better fourth quarter profits and revenues. But its stock plunged 5.9 per cent to $29.17 on concerns about its US sales amid a possible economic slowdown. Rival Ford fell 4.9 per cent to $7.55.In deal news, the future of CBOT was thrown into doubt after the Intercontinental Exchange launched an unsolicited $9.9bn bid. CBOT was set to merge with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Shares in CBOT rose 12.5 per cent to $190 as investors contemplated a bidding war.Speculation that Dow Chemical was seeking a joint venture with Reliance Industries, India’s leading petrochemical maker, lifted its shares 5.2 per cent to $45.25.Retailers remained under pressure as confidence in consumer spending flagged. Wal-Mart, which withdrew its application to open a specialty bank on Friday, fell 2.6 per cent to $46.21. Target slid 3.4 per cent to $59.77.Homebuilders were in the doldrums on fears of tighter lending affecting the spring home selling season. Pulte Homes fell 8.5 per cent to $26.31 while DR Horton was down 6.3 per cent to $22.83.Accredited Home Lenders said it had agreed to sell $2.7bn of its subprime mortgage loans at a discount to free up cash to pay its creditors. Accredited surged 15.7 per cent to $10.90 on Friday."
406;TGT;Target Corp;2007-03-13T21:36:30Z;US indices down 2% on subprime fears;;The tentative gains made by Wall Street last week were rapidly erased on Tuesday as fears about subprime mortgage lending sparked a broad sell-off in stocks.After a shaky start provoked by a stronger yen and weak US retail sales data, stocks tumbled at midday on the release of data showing slightly higher-than-expected mortgage delinquency rates.This prompted nervous investors to sell shares in investment banks in spite of strong results from Goldman Sachs that showed a 29 per cent rise in first quarter profits. The alarm spread to drag down every sector.The Vix Index, a measure of market volatility nicknamed Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped 29.6 per cent to 18.13.Financial groups led the way down. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, which are active in the mortgage market, plunged 5.9 and 6.7 per cent respectively to $72 and $142.97. The S&P investment banking and brokerage index closed 4.2 per cent down. Even Goldman slipped 1.8 per cent to $199.03.“The subprime situation came into a market that is cruising for a bruising – subprime just greases the slide,” said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.The S&P 500 index closed 2 per cent weaker at 1,377.95, less than 4 points off its low for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2 per cent lower at 12,075.96.The technology-led Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.2 per cent to 2,350.57.The sell-off in subprime lenders continued without relent. The New York Stock Exchange moved to delist New Century Financial, and the lender said it had been asked to provide material for criminal investigations into the group.Another subprime player, Accredited Home Lenders, slumped 65 per cent to $3.98 after it said it needed to raise more money and was examining its strategic options.Shares in Countrywide, the big prime and subprime mortgage lender, were 4.7 per cent off at $33.49. The company said it would no longer make subprime loans that required no deposit or proof of income.Homebuilders suffered too, with Pulte Homes falling 5.1 per cent to stand at $25.99.Investors were wary of retail stocks after the release of weaker-than-expected sales figures for February. The S&P Retail index was 2.5 per cent down. Shares in Wal-Mart fell 2.3 per cent to $46.18 and Target fell 2.8 per cent to $60.47.Texas Instruments, the maker of chips for mobile phones, said on Monday that profits would fall short of the top end of its previous forecast. Texas shares initially fell sharply, but recovered some losses to stand 2.6 per cent down at $31.74.In deal news, Citigroup raised its tender offer for Nikko Cordial, Japan’s third-largest broker, by 26 per cent in a move that will raise the price of buying the group to Y1,578bn.Citigroup stock slipped 3.2 per cent to $48.75.
407;TGT;Target Corp;2007-03-08T15:09:44Z;US stores feel chill in February sales;;Bitterly cold winter weather across the central and northeastern US weighed on US retailers during February, as stores started to make the transition from winter to spring merchandise.Retailers including Wal-Mart and Federated Deparment Stores, the owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdales, cited the impact of bad weather as they reported lower than expected growth in like-for-like sales.Wal-Mart said sales at its discount stores, its core business, rose just 0.4 per cent, and that it continued to suffer from sluggish sales of clothing and soft furnishings.Federated said like-for-like sales were up 1.2 per cent, missing its target of 2 to 3 per cent growth.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, predicted sales growth of 1 to 2 per cent for March, in spite of despite an early Easter holiday which is expected to boost sales in the month.Its performance in February was again overshadowed by Target, its smaller rival, which reported same store sales growth of 5.7 per cent, and forecast growth of between 4 and 6 per cent over March and April.Wal-Mart’s sales statement also drew attention to its planned expansion of a service that allows orders made online at Walmart.com to be picked up in its stores. Last year, it stopped offering a “lay-away” service, popular with low-income shoppers, that allowed customers to hold a product by making an initial downpayment.It expects the service, which executives believe could drive same store sales, to be operating in all its US stores by the summer. Walmart.com is the third most popular retailer website, after Amazon and Ebay, and attracts a more prosperous cross-section of customers than the main stores. The retailer does not break out its online sales figures.Reviewing the overall February sales figures, Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said his index for same store sales rose 2.8 per cent for the month, against the 3.1 per cent forecast.He said the weather factor was a “legitimate reason” for the softness across the industry.He also noted that February was traditionally the least important month for retailers as they cleared winter merchandise and brought in spring styles, and that conditions should improve in March with the arrival of warmer weather and the early Easter.The sluggish overall picture was offset by strong performances from both Saks, the luxury department store, which reported a 24.7 per cent increase in same store sales this week, and its rival Nordstrom, which beat forecasts with 9.1 per cent growth.Pier 1 Imports, the home furnishings store, reported its 12th consecutive month of same store sales declines, with an 8 per cent fall.The retailer has suffered seven consecutive quarters of losses. and last year announced it was interested in a possible buy-out. last year. However, in January it appointed a new chief executive, Alex Smith, a former executive at TJX, the cut price retailer.
408;TGT;Target Corp;2007-02-07T01:57:20Z;Wal-Mart launches internet film service;;Wal-Mart on Tuesday launched its long-awaited internet film service, offering films from all of Hollywood’s main studios in a move that could see the retailer challenge Apple’s iTunes platform for supremacy in digital downloading.Unlike iTunes, the Wal-Mart service has the backing of Warner Bros, Walt Disney, Paramount, Sony, 20th Century Fox and Universal. More than 3,000 film titles are being made available, including recent releases such as The Devil Wears Prada and Superman Returns.The launch comes amid industry concern at slowing DVD sales growth. Selling films on DVD has long been an industry cash cow, allowing studios to make back the cost of producing and distributing their films.But with the DVD market maturing, analysts are forecasting a slowdown this year, which has forced the studios to consider other forms of distribution.The Wal-Mart launch comes weeks after Paramount became the only studio to join Disney on iTunes. However, Paramount is only selling selected titles from its film library on iTunes, and will not be selling new releases. Other studios had avoided doing deals with iTunes primarily because of fears about upsetting DVD retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target.Wal-Mart sells more DVDs than any other chain in the US and had expressed concern about the effect of downloading on DVD sales.However, the launch of its own service could clear the way for the studios to strike download deals with iTunes.The Wal-Mart service will offer films for digital download the same day that they are released on DVD. They will be priced similarly to the cost of buying a DVD.“With thousands of movie and TV titles now available for download, coupled with the strength of our successful physical DVD business, this is an unprecedented offering of video content, features and capabilities currently unmatched in the market,” Wal-Mart said. “Also, we’re excited to launch a service that has the support of all the major Hollywood studios.”

Uncertainty over the economy and interest rate policy has buffeted sentiment for stocks, outside of technology, in the first week of trading this year.“Stocks don’t seem to have the robust feel they showed during the fourth quarter,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. He expects equity volatility to continue rising as the debate over the economy and Federal Reserve policy plays out.The S&P 500 settled 0.1 per cent, or 1.74 points, firmer at 1,418.34.

QualComm gained 4.5 per cent to $39.15, while broker upgrades helped boost Amgen 4.3 per cent to $71.33.Cisco shares reversed an early decline to trade 2.6 per cent higher at $28.46 after the company announced that it had purchased e-mail security company IronPort Systems for $830m.The 9 per cent slide in oil prices this week kept the energy sector under pressure, with Exxon Mobil down 1.9 per cent at $72.72 and Chevron off 1 per cent at $70.28.But the big news in the sector was from ConocoPhillips. Its shares slipped
3.1 per cent to $66.07 after the oil producer lowered refining and marketing margins for the fourth quarter.On the up was Altria Group, which set a 52-week high for the second consecutive day on expectations of solid fourth-quarter earnings this month.The stock rose as high as $87.87, before closing $87.65, up 1.3 per cent.In earnings news, Monsanto posted fiscal first quarter 2007 net income of

411;TGT;Target Corp;2007-01-04T14:45:02Z;Warm Christmas hits US retailers;;Christmas resulted in disappointing sales for many clothing retailers in the US who blamed unseasonably warm weather and price cuts for lower than expected sales growth.Last month was the warmest December for 10 years, according to forecasters, and led to higher demand for out-of season clothing rather than winter items.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, confirmed that total sales in December had risen 1.6 per cent against its own estimates of 1 per cent sales growth. Sales at its US store network rose 1.3 per cent.Wal-Mart said that it had seen a “very strong performance” in electronics, where it launched an aggressive series of price-cuts at the start of November. But it said that apparel and home sales had been “soft” as expected, although price cuts in apparel had helped to boost sales. Target, Wal-Mart’s leading competitor, reported sales growth of 4.5 per cent, in the middle of its own forecast range, but below Wall Street’s average estimate.Retailers’ holiday sales are vital because the two months before Christmas can make up for 20 to 40 per cent of annual sales.Costco, the warehouse club that compete’s with Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club, delivered a 9 per cent rise in like-for-like sales, beating analyst’s forecasts of 5.7 per cent growth. Sam’s Club sales rose 5.6 per cent. But BJs, the third largest warehouse club, saw its shares drop 14 per cent after it reported sales growth of just 0.6 per cent, and cut its profit forecast.Gap said same-store sales fell 8 per cent, a worse figure than expected, despite swingeing price cuts designed to bring shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. Out of all of its brands and regions only Banana Republic in the US and Canada reported sales growth, with an increase of 2 per cent on last year. In North America Gap and Old Navy saw sales fall 9 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, and internationally sales fell by 8 per cent.The struggling retailer also cut its outlook and said it was reviewing its brand strategies for Gap and Old Navy.Department stores delivered a mixed picture. Saks and Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department stores, saw sales jump 11.1 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, both roundly beating Wall Street forecasts.But Federated Department Stores owner of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said sales at its stores, excluding the May stores acquired in 2005, rose by 4.4 per cent, below its own forecast. The company said sales at more than 300 former May Department Store locations, which have been converted to the Macy’s banner since their acquisition in 2005, “remained weak”, without giving details.JC Penney said same store sales increased 2.6 per cent in December, beating analysts’ expecations of 2.4 per cent and last year’s figure of 2.2 per cent. Children’s clothing and jewellry proved popular with shoppers. Its rival Kohl’s saw sales rise 3.4 per cent, below forecasts.AnnTaylor, another major apparel seller, said it had suffered a 5.3 per cent drop in same-store sales and said its full-year earnings will come in lower than its original guidance of $2.07 to $2.12 a share.Pier 1, the home-furnishings retailer, saw a 10.7 per cent drop in same-store sales, even worse than the 9.4 per cent fall Wall Street had anticipated.Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, saw a 4 per cent gain, well below the 9.3 per cent Wall Street expected.Zale said sales increased by 2.3 per cent for the combined months of November and December. It said profit margins were lower than expected because of price cutting.American Eagle Outfitters, the teen apparel retailer, said on Wednesday that same store sales grew 13 per cent for the month, beating Wall Street’s expectations for 8.7 per cent growth.
412;TGT;Target Corp;2006-12-26T21:49:58Z;US stocks rally in thin holiday trade;;US stocks rallied on Tuesday, as lower oil prices helped offset weakness in retailers amid reports that holiday sales had fallen short of expectations.The majority of gains arrived during the last hour of trading, with volumes at the New York Stock Exchange the lowest seen this year, as stocks enjoyed a rebound after last week’s broad losses.Analysts expect window dressing in stocks could dictate moves this week, as investors purchase those that have experienced solid gains this year in order to embellish their portfolios. This is seen outweighing sales of poor performing stocks, made by investors to lock in a tax loss for their 2006 tax returns.The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent, or 61.4 points to 1,416.90, on Tuesday.

The figures were adjusted for the fact that the holiday shopping season was one day longer than last year. Without the adjustment, sales grew 6.6 per cent in 2006, compared with growth of 8.7 per cent in 2005.The S&P 500 retail index was 0.2 per cent lower at 496.89, after hitting a low of 493.86 for the day in early trade.The S&P Department stores index closed 1.2 per cent lower at 262.81.Shares in JC Penney fell 2.3 per cent at $77.74, Kohls was down 01.3 per cent at $68.89 and Federated Department stores slid 0.9 per cent to $37.76.

Shares were 1.8 per cent lower at $52.36.The largest retailer in the US, Wal-Mart, forecast its December same-store sales gain would be no better than 1 per cent. That came after the company confirmed same store sales fell 0.1 per cent in November, the first such decline in a decade. Shares were 1.2 per cent lower at $46.35.Discount rival Target posted a gain in sales of 5.9 per cent, beating estimates of a 5.7 per cent rise.

414;TGT;Target Corp;2006-11-30T18:12:05Z;Wal-Mart suffers for its fashion mistakes;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, on Thursday issued a sombre forecast for sales in December, blaming mis-steps in its efforts to introduce more fashionable and expensive clothing and home furnishings into its low-cost discount stores.The retailer said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to grow by no more than 1 per cent, after comparable sales fell by 0.1 per cent in November – the first drop since 1996.The company cited continued problems with its home and clothing categories, where its core customers have not responded well to its drive to introduce goods such as the Metro 7 women’s clothing range across its entire store network.Eduardo Castro-Wright, chief executive of Wal-Mart’s US stores division, said: “The home and apparel business is challenging and this will continue throughout the fourth quarter.” He noted that basic items in both categories continued to sell well.The company said it did not expect to see improvements in both categories until spring.The drive to persuade more prosperous customers to buy more than food and basics at the stores has been the focus of an overhaul of the retailer’s marketing strategy over the past year – sometimes at the expense of its traditional low-price message.Mr Castro-Wright said the retailer’s pre-Christmas marketing would focus on “communicating price leadership” and that it would deliver further price cuts in the run-up to the holidays.Wal-Mart’s poor performance in November contrasted with Target, its more upmarket rival, which reported a 5.9 per cent increase in comparable store sales, and predicted growth of 3.5-5.5 per cent for December.Overall, leading US retailers reported a subdued November. Retail Metrics said its monthly index of same store sales growth rose 2.2 per cent, and that more than half the retailers reporting missed their forecast numbers.Several clothing retailers cited the impact of unseasonably warm November weather on sales of winter clothing, and this was also cited as a negative factor by Ann Taylor, the women’s clothing retailer, and Kohls, the low cost department store.The big three traditional department store chains, however, again delivered above-average performances. Federated said November same-store sales rose 8.5 per cent at its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores, and raised its estimate for December sales. Saks and Nordstrom saw sales growth of 7.2 per cent and 5.4 per cent respectively.Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, saw its sales woes continue at its Gap and Old Navy stores. The group’s overall same store sales were down 8 per cent, and total net sales slipped 2 per cent to $1.4bn.
415;TGT;Target Corp;2006-11-24T18:52:47Z;US retailers fire starter gun on sales;;US shoppers on Friday launched their frantic traditional post-Thanksgiving Day assault on stores and malls across the country, amid predictions of a solid but not spectacular holiday season for the retail sector.The annual Friday ritual of early-morning openings and “door-buster” limited availability offers is used by retailers to mark the start of the holiday shopping season.However, most leading retailers now launch their Christmas marketing campaigns at the beginning of November.This year the event again crept into the Thursday holiday itself – led in part by online retailers, who last year saw a spike in transactions from customers shopping from home on the holiday.Underlining the trend, Amazon, the largest online retailer, staged a Thanksgiving afternoon promotion in which it sold 1,000 Xbox 360 systems for a third of their advertised price. Kmart’s 1,400 discount stores opened for the first time on Thanksgiving Day, while CompUSA, the computer retailer, opened its stores from 9pm to midnight. FAO Schwartz, the Manhattan toy store, also opened on Thursday.Department stores, including JC Penney, Kohl’s, Saks and Macy’s also launched “pre-Thanksgiving” sales in the week before the holiday.A number of malls owned by Simon Properties opened their doors at midnight on Thursday. But the early Friday morning remains the most bitterly contested retail battleground. The focus on the day after Thanksgiving continues a tradition that dates back to the days when department stores reopened their stores with Christmas decorations and settings on the day after the holidays.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, and Best Buy and Circuit City, the largest electronics retailers opened their doors at 5am on Friday, with customers in some locations queuing all night for “door-buster” bargains, traditionally advertised in Thanksgiving Day papers.In an effort to thwart websites that have managed in the past to publish details of its door-buster offers ahead of time, Wal-Mart this year announced 17 “secret” items on its website on Thanksgiving Day – including the latest Xbox game console that would be limited to just six per store.The hooplah this year also included a stunt by David Blaine, the escapologist, in New York’s Times Square sponsored by Target, Wal-Mart’s main rival.Overall, economists are predicting stronger consumer spending over the holidays than last year, despite an initial level of pessimism based around high fuel prices and interest rate concerns.The National Retail Federation in September predicted a modest 5 per cent increase this year in sales in November and December to $457.4bn against a 6.1 per cent increase last year.But Wayne Best, Visa USA’s chief economist, said earlier this month that it expected growth of 7.5 per cent, as lower fuel prices and a buoyant stock market have improved consumer’s confidence.
416;TGT;Target Corp;2006-11-14T21:36:09Z;Wall Street shrugs aside profit takers;;US stocks rebounded from early weakness on Tuesday, as investors digested corporate earnings reports, and viewed sharply lower wholesale inflation and mixed retail sales data as elements heralding a soft landing for the economy.Opening gains in the indices were surrendered and consolidation loomed, only for buyers to emerge during afternoon trade. As buying picked up, the S&P 500 broke through a key barrier at 1389, and closed near a six year high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average pierced a key trading level at 12,190, and rallied further to a new record close.Stocks also took some heart after William Poole, president of the St Louis Federal Reserve, said inflation expectations are “well controlled” and that the central bank’s current policy stance is “about right.”Typifying the spirit of the day was Home Depot, which initially fell 1.7 per cent to a low of $35.77, as it blamed a “very challenging housing environment” for a third-quarter profit of 73 cents a share, below estimates of 75 cents a share. But despite its lowered guidance, shares rallied and closed up $1.56, or 4.3 per cent at $37.96.“The bulls came back after some profit taking. This has been the story for the past few months and is the type of day that postpones the idea the market is poised to take a break,” said Ken Tower, senior market strategist at CyberTrader, a division of Charles Schwab.The market was also led higher by Intel, up 88 cents, or 4.2 per cent at $21.88 and Wal-Mart, up $1.34, or 2.9 per cent at $47.66. The US’s largest retailer hit a peak of $48.20, after reporting earnings of 63 cents a share in the third quarter, at the top end of the company’s guidance provided last month. That beat the consensus estimate of 60 cents per share and analysts said lower guidance by the company was not as bad as feared.Among fallers was Agilent, down 5.7 per cent at $33. Agilent, which makes measuring technology, posted fourth-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, short of a forecast of 54 cents.Excessive pessimism over homebuilder DR Horton was abruptly punctured after its earnings of 88 cents per share comfortably beat estimates of only 69 cents. The company’s shares leapt 9.5 per cent to $24.50.The discount retailer Target earned $506m, or 59 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from $435m, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. The results exceeded the consensus forecast of 55 cents a share, and sent the company’s stock 2.4 per cent higher to $59.16.The S&P 500 finished up 8.8 points, or 0.6 per cent, at 1,393.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was 24.28 points, or 1 per cent higher, at 2,430.66. The Dow rose 86.13 points, or 0.7 per cent to 12,218.01.Retailer Saks reported net income of $6.18m, or 5 cents a share, for the fiscal third quarter, beating estimates of 3 cents a share. Shares in the company rose 2.6 per cent to $20.40 having been more than $24 earlier in the session.Shares in Staples fell 0.9 per cent to $25.83 as earnings of 36 cents a share, just pipping estimates of 35 cents.Still, some analysts believe stocks could be due for a period of consolidation after a run of solid gains that has sent the S&P 500 index towards a six-year high, buoyed by solid earnings.“The market has been brought a long way over the past 14 weeks and we now require a compelling signal to spark further gains,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is not capped, it just looks like we will see a period of consolidation in November.”Stock index futures were indicating a bright start in early trade and then pushed higher after retail sales and wholesale inflation reports for October arrived.Headline retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, less than the projected fall of 0.4 per cent, while sales for September were revised lower to a decline of 0.8 per cent, versus an original drop of 0.4 per cent.Excluding automobile sales, the data revealed that sales fell 0.4 per cent, more than the projected decline of 0.3 per cent.But, stripping out petrol sales, overall sales rose 0.4 per cent, a figure that shows the consumer is still spending say economists.“The main story on retail sales was the sharp revisions to the September data, while the October was fairly close to expectations,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The market is apt to still take away a view that the consumer has been restrained in spending the income that had been going to gas when gas prices were higher.”Meanwhile investors were soothed by the inflation picture at the wholesale level. The producer price index fell 1.6 per cent last month versus the expected decline of 0.5 per cent. Excluding food and energy, the core rate fell 0.9 per cent, again well under the expected rise of 0.1 per cent. The core rate rose 0.6 per cent during September and last month’s fall was the largest since August 1993. The core PPI has fallen in four of the past five months.Investors now await the consumer price index for September due on Thursday.Lou Crandall, economist at Wrightson ICAP noted the “report doesn’t change our forecast of a 0.2 per cent increase in the core CPI.” Still he concedes “the fact that PPI food prices surprised us on the downside (-0.8 per cent) does shift the risk in the overall CPI.”
417;TGT;Target Corp;2006-11-14T19:08:43Z;US retailers;;Last week, Wal-Mart announced that it would once again greet customers with “Merry Christmas” this year, rather than the “Happy Holidays” that offended some of America’s religious right. Unfortunately, neither sounds like a probable description of the retail giant’s own performance in the coming festive season.Admittedly, its latest subdued earnings forecast is broadly in line with increasingly gloomy expectations on Wall Street. There are positives. The growth in Wal-Mart’s gross margins compared to last year suggests that some of its historic strengths remain intact, notably in managing its supply chain and swiftly turning over inventory.The trouble is that to regain market share, Wal-Mart has little choice but to pass on the benefits of cheaper sourcing to customers. It is sounding increasingly belligerent on prices, even as other costs continue to rise. Third quarter operating costs – including wages and administrative expenses – rose more than 16 per cent year on year, well above revenue growth. There is little evidence as yet that lower energy costs are starting to have a positive effect.Unlike many of Wal-Mart’s recent missteps – from missing out on fashion trends in clothing to the awkward timing of its store revamps – the increase in compensation or utility costs are not company specific. Arch-rival Target, which for now continues to show far healthier same- store growth, also experienced a sharp rise in operating expenses as a share of revenues.Cost pressures are proving especially painful for retailers heavily exposed to the housing market, such as Home Depot, which saw same-store sales decline 5.1 per cent. But a combination of top-line pressures because of price competition and inflation in operating expenses could well prove the key to dissecting this year’s fourth quarter results. That suggests the need for caution, even when it comes to chronic share price underperformers such as Wal-Mart.
418;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Producer price inflation fell sharply, potentially good news for the Federal Reserve.Affter a run of solid gains that has sent the S&P 500 index towards a six year high, buoyed by solid earnings running above 19 per cent on a year-on-year comparison for the third quarter, stocks are poised for a period of consolidation according to analysts.“The market has been brought a long way over the past 14 weeks and we now require a compelling signal to spark further gains,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The market is not capped, it just looks like we will see a period of consolidation in November.”About an hour into the trading day stock indices were lower.The S&P 500 was down 3.54 points, or 0.3 per cent at 1380.88 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 7.07 points, or 0.3 per cent at 2399.31.Hurting the broad market was a sharp fall in Agilent, whose shares were off $2.24, or 6.4 per cent at $32.75. The maker of measuring equipment and technology said fourth-quarter net income was $152mn, or 36 cents a share, on revenue of $1.33bn. That was well short of an expected gain of 54 cents a share on sales.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37.06 points, or 0.3 per cent at 12,094.82.In earnings news, the nation’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart beat estimates, while hardware supplier chain, Home Depot fell short of expectations. Both companies are components of the Dow and Wal-Mart was the indice’s leading gainer.Wal-Mart said net income rose to $2.65bn, or 63 cents per share in the third quarter ending October 31, from $2.37 billion, or 57 cents per share a year earlier. That was at the top end of the 59 to 63 cent guidance provided by the company last month and beat the consensus estimate of 60 cents per share. Shares hit a peak of $48.20 and were recently up $1.18, or 2.6 per cent at $47.50.Wal-Mart’s discount competitor TargetMeanwhile, Home Depot blamed a “very challenging housing environment” for a flat third-quarter profit, of 73 cents per share, that missed estimates of 75 cents per share.The company cut growth expectations, and now expects a 12 per cent rise in sales and a 4 to 5 per cent rise in earnings per share for the current fiscal year. That’s down from estimates set in August of 14 to 17 per cent growth in sales and a 10 to 14 per cent rise in earnings per share. Shares were off 35 cents, or 1 per cent at $36.05.Excessive pessimism over homebuilder DR Horton was sharply punctured after its earnings were released.The builder reported its fiscal fourth-quarter profit slid 51 per cent against the backdrop of the housing slump, however,Retailer Saks reported net income of $6.18mn, or 5 cents per share, for the fiscal third-quarter, beating estimates of 3 cents per share. Shares in the company rose 38 cents, or 1.9 per cent to $20.27.Shares in Staples were down 54 cents, or 2.1 per cent lower at $25.52 after the company’s earnings excluding one-time items arrived roughly in line with expectations. despite. Staples’ profit rose 18 per cent to $265mn, and the 36 cents per share result just pipped estimates of 35 cents per share.Shares in Ford were off 11 cents, or 1.24 per cent at $8.76 after the company restated earnings citing accounting errors, due to how interest rate hedging by its financial arm, Ford Motor Credit was calculated, dating back to 2001. The revision boosts the company’s net income since then by $850mn and narrows its $7.25bn net loss for the first nine months of 2006 to $7bn.Stock index futures were indicating a bright start in early trade and then pushed higher after retail sales and wholesale inflation reports for October arrived.Headline retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2%, less than the projected fall of 0.4 per cent, while sales for September were revised lower to a decline of 0.8 per cent, versus an original drop of 0.4 per cent.Excluding automobile sales, the data revealed that sales fell 0.4 per cent, more than the projected decline of 0.3 per cent.“The main story on retail sales was the sharp revisions to the September data, while the October was fairly close to expectations,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The market is apt to still take away a view that the consumer has been restrained in spending the income that had been going to gas when gas prices were higher.”Meanwhile investors were soothed by the inflation picture at the wholesale level.

Office Depot closed off 22 cents, or 0.5 per cent, at $41.44. Also setting a bullish tone were shares in Isis Pharmaceutical. They rose $2.05, or 19.8 per cent, to $12.43 as the company said its experimental drug was successful in lowering LDL, so-called “bad cholesterol”.In deal news, gene-testing technology company Illumina announced it would acquire Solexa in a $600m stock agreement that is 44 per cent above Solexa’s share price of last week.Shareholders will receive stock in Illumina valued at $14 per Solexa share. Solexa shares were off their highs but still up $2.86, or 29.5 per cent, at $12.56.

Shares in the retailer closed down 1.2 per cent at $48.29.Gap also missed sales and Citigroup downgraded the clothing chain to a “hold” from a “buy”. Its shares fell 5.5 per cent to $19.50.Wholesale retailer Costco and other retailers, Target, Dillard’s, Kohl’smissed analyst expectations.Costco rebounded and setteld up 0.2 per cent at $53.

Federated beat sales but fell 3.9 per cent to $41.35 on a weaker sales outlook. Saks also enjoyed good sales and rose 1.5 per cent to $19.48“It’s striking that the discounters are seeing disappointing sales, while high-end retailers are holding up,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management.Beyond monthly sales figures, he believes the real test for the consumer will come when a spillover from the slowing housing market into job creation occurs. “The consumer will follow the economy into a slowdown, not lead it.”The next test for stocks will be the October employment report on Friday.The S&P 500 settled 0.47 points, or 0.03 per cent, lower at 1,367.34, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.33 points, or 0.01 per cent, lower at 2,334.02.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 12.48 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 12,018.54, having earlier slipped below 12,000.To date, 385 of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly earnings, with 74 per cent above estimates, according to Thomson Financial.Earnings for the third quarter are running 18.6 per cent higher versus a year ago, the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.Shares in Intel were off their lows, down 1.6 per cent at $20.68, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the chipmaker from “buy” to “neutral” amid weakening demand and persistent excess capacity. By contrast, Dell shares were up 3.3 per cent at $24.80 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the group from “sell” to “neutral” citing disciplined pricing and attention to sales mix.In earnings news, International Paper missed estimates as it reported 39 cents a share versus a forecast 43 cents. Its shares were down 1.6 per cent at $32.50.
422;TGT;Target Corp;2006-11-02T19:50:48Z;US retail;;Curious things are happening on America’s Main Street. The fact that the majority of US retailers experienced disappointing sales in October probably says more about Wall Street’s overblown expectations than longer-term trends. Following September’s shopping spree, though, a bit of a breather ahead of the holiday season looks appropriate enough.More peculiar, however, is the fact that Wal-Mart, along with other discounters, did especially badly. In contrast, mid-market department stores, such as JC Penney, continued to do pretty well. That is hard to square with the idea that consumers are finally starting to tighten their purse strings. Wal-Mart, after all, has tended to gain market share whenever depressed shoppers traded down.If the retail giant fails to do so this time round, that will partly reflect the awkward timing of its recent efforts to attract more affluent shoppers. Wal-Mart already admits that revamping its stores and pushing slightly pricier items has proved a bit of a distraction. That helps explain its subdued November guidance in comparison with expectations of a rebound at rival discounter Target.Unfortunately, none of this means other retailers are quite safe yet from the Grinch stealing Christmas this year. For one thing, the widely held belief that lower fuel prices will leave US consumers with more money to spend rests on something of a fallacy.After all, the average price of crude oil in the year-to-date is still up 20 per cent on last year’s level. If US consumers saved for the holidays the old-fashioned way, by putting money aside, they would have already spent a large chunk of their Christmas budget at the pump. Add to this a cooling housing market, rising interest rates and the effect of stagnant median incomes and it is not outlandish to think that Wal-Mart’s lower-income clientele may only be among the first to feel the pinch.
423;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Wal-Mart to sell $4 generic drugs;;Wal-Mart on Thursday raised more questions over the future of generic drug pricing, expanding to 15 US states its sale of a month’s supply of more than 100 common generic medicines for $4.The world’s largest retailer said the popularity of its $4 offer, launched earlier this month in Florida stores, had caused it to accelerate its expansion of the programme in 14 more states. Wal-Mart had previously planned to make the offer available next year to more states, and is pushing forward as fast as possible.The expansion makes the $4 generic offer available earlier than expected to about 1,500 of Wal-Mart’s stores. The retailer plans to extend the programme to its nationwide network of more than 3,000 stores.Its plan also reflects growing scrutiny of generic drug prices, the retail prices of which often contain a large mark-up for middlemen including pharmacies and distributors.Its extensive infrastructure and supply chain logistics could work around middlemen, and push generic drug pricing lower in the process.David Maris, analyst at Bank of America, said in a report that “disintermediation” would lead to pricing pressure at the root – generic drugmakers – not just pressure middlemen.“With median generic operating margins of approximately 23 per cent, there is juice to be squeezed from these oranges too,” Mr Maris said.On Thursday Target, another US retailer, said it would match Wal-Mart’s prices.Bill Simon, head of Wal-Mart’s unit overseeing pharmacy, said the company moved as fast as its infrastructure would allow, picking states where the programme would operate smoothly immediately.• Wal-Mart on Thursday said it tapped an outsider to head its China operations as the world’s biggest retailer speeds up expansion in the fast-growing market, Reuters reports.Ed Chan, north-Asia regional director of London and Singapore-listed Dairy Farm International, is due to take over as president and chief executive of Wal-Mart’s China operations from February, but he will join Wal-Mart next month, the company said in a statement.
424;TGT;Target Corp;2006-10-05T18:04:23Z;Child protection advocates hit at Wal-Mart;;Wal-Mart, the largest US toy retailer, is facing a campaign from child protection advocates against a new web-based marketing drive that it has launched in the run-up to the holidays.Walmart.com’s new “Toyland” microsite features two animated “renegade elves” called Wally and Marty who encourage children to help them review a parade of toys. Chosen toys are then boxed up and added to a wish list that can then be e-mailed to adults.As child-users move toys such as a new $20 Bratz doll and a $250 ride-able toy Ford Mustang into an animated rocket the elves announce that “choosing the toys is only the beginning. You also have to tell someone.““If you show us what you want on your wish list, we’ll blast it off to your parents,” the elves declare. “We’ll plead your case.”On Thursday, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood launched an online petition calling on Wal-Mart to close the site down, encouraging its members to send emails to Lee Scott, Wal-Mart’s chief executive and Carter Cast, head of Walmart.com, over the issue.Susan Linn, co-founder of the group, said the site “takes marketing to children to a new level”.“This is a store interposing itself between parents and children, and actively encouraging kids to nag for their products,” she said.Wal-Mart joins a growing number of marketers using online viral marketing techniques to target children. The Kaiser Family Foundation said in August that almost two-thirds of youth-targeted food companies were encouraging children to send e-mails to their friends inviting them to check out that site or to tell them about a product.Wal-Mart’s elves site, which will be featured in television and print advertising, goes beyond moves by its online rivals, Target, Amazon and Toys R Us, who have largely focused direct online toy sale efforts at adults.While Toys R Us’s online Geoffrey’s Birthday Club is aimed at children aged 2-10, registration requires parental consent, in line with the requirements of the Children’s Onine Privacy Protection Act of 1998.The act prevents retailers from collecting or retaining information on children without parental consent. However, it includes a number of exceptions, including allowing a retailer to collect a parent’s e-mail from a child in order to seek consent and other purposes.Wal-Mart says it is not retaining e-mail addresses submitted by children and will not use them for future promotions.The new microsite is part of an ongoing effort by the retailer’s new marketing team to focus on specific customer segments - which included an effort this summer to support back-to-school sales with a website targeting teenagers.J David Neal, Wal-Mart’s marketing manager for toys, said that the new site reflected the retailer’s belief that “the dynamic of children and toys is changing. They have their own resources and money, are hyper-aware of trends and are an integral part of the shopping experience.”“We are very keenly aware there are certain boundaries we don’t cross. The site is very kid-friendly, without being pushy.”Ms Linn said Wal-Mart was “parading these toys surrounded by sparkling stars…there’s no sense of what the parent can afford, or the parents’ own values”.
425;TGT;Target Corp;2006-09-19T19:53:01Z;Amazon to offer support services;;Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, said on Tuesday it would start providing warehousing, delivery and other logistical support to small US businesses who sell on its websites.The move comes as it battles Ebay, Google and Yahoo and others over the potentially lucrative sector.The company also said it will also now offer design and support services to small businesses that want to set up their own privately branded retail websites, charging a monthly fee of just under $60 and commission of 7 per cent on each transaction.The moves mark a significant extension of expertise that Amazon has developed with large retailers – and in particular with Target, the US discount store – to the army of over 1m small and medium-sized merchants who are registered to sell on the company’s website.Joe Walowski, who manages Amazon’s fulfilment services, said that the provision of warehousing and shipping had been developed in response to customers who wanted to combine direct orders from Amazon with purchases from third-party merchants.But the move also reflects Amazon’s wider strategic interest in establishing itself as a provider of web-based services, in parallel with its presence as a direct retailer.Third-party sales, both by large retailers such as Macy’s and individual merchants, accounted for 29 per cent of its unit sales in its most recent quarter, up from 28 per cent a year ago, and are more profitable for the retailer than its direct sales.In addition to providing warehousing, and order fulfilment, Amazon said it would also handle customer returns and refunds.Mr Walowski said the company was aware of the potential challenges involved in the new services, but that its experience in dealing with larger customers “had given us the confidence to think that we can do this very well”.He declined to give estimates of expected volume, or the likely profitablity of the new services. Shipments by third-party sellers who sign up for the warehousing and fulfillment service will be covered by the range of free shipping deals Amazon provides for its customers, he said, including its Amazon Prime fixed-fee shipping service.Amazon began operating Target’s website in 2002, and the two companies this summer extended the deal until 2010.Over the past year, Target.com has overtaken Walmart.com to become the second most popular US retail website after Amazon itself.
426;TGT;Target Corp;2006-08-31T17:05:04Z;Pressured US shoppers grow more selective;;August sales figures from leading US retailers on Thursday suggested that middle- and lower-income consumers were responding to higher energy prices and interest rates by making selective spending cutbacks.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index for the month rose 3.1 per cent, slightly better than forecast. But Ken Perkins, president, noted that the 52 per cent of retailers who exceeded market forecasts represented a fourth consecutive month in which the number had fallen.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, noted that overall sales growth had slowed over the first six months of the year.“We have seen some moderation: not dramatic and it’s very uneven. But there’s enough to say there’s something going on and that something is likely to continue for the rest of the year.”In possible signs of the stress on middle-income consumers, Target, the second largest US discounter, missed Wall Street’s sales target for the second consecutive month. Target, whose customers have a median family income of $58,000, reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, against the 3.1 per cent expected by analysts.The company said home decoration items as well as women’s clothing, costume jewellery and accessories were its weakest categories.JC Penney, the mid-range department store with a similar customer demographic to Target, also surprised analysts with a 0.5 per cent fall in August comparable store sales, citing slow sales of big-ticket items, including furniture - echoing comments from Costco, the warehouse shopping club.Dollar General, which operates 8,000 small-format discount stores across the US, gave one of the starkest indications of the state of the battle for the hard-pressed lower income consumer. The retailer said lower sales of home products and clothing had contributed to a 40 per cent fall in its profits during the second quarter.“We also expect consumer discretionary spending to continue to be negatively affected by high fuel prices and by higher interest rates as well,” the retailer said. It added that it expected “aggressive marketing and discounted pricing by competitors” to continue.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said its overall August sales rose 2.5 per cent at its US discount stores and 3.5 per cent at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores.But the continued strength of the higher end of the market was demonstrated by Nordstrom, the fashion department store, which recorded a 7.1 per cent increase in August comparable store sales, against the 3.6 per cent expected by analysts.

Apple endured a tough week after its latest product launch failed to impress investors.

The claims figures, however, suggested a slowing economy, which should reduce the risks from inflation. Such conflicting data have resulted in a lack of clear direction in the market in recent weeks.US retail sales figures for July, released on Friday, showed a rise of 1.4 per cent, beating forecasts of a 0.8 per cent rise and prompting further uncertainty about the US rate outlook.Over the course of the week, the S&P 500 index fell 1 per cent, or 12.62 points, to close at 1,266.74, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.3 per cent, or 27.3 points, at 2,057.71. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.4 per cent, or 152.32 points, at 11,088.03.Intrawest, the adventure travel and resorts company, agreed to be acquired by Fortress Investment Group in a transaction worth about $2.8bn. For the week, its shares soared 28 per cent to $34.14.The stock-option pricing scandal widened on Thursday, with Nvidia and Juniper Networks both saying they would have to delay quarterly results due to accounting issues on past stock-option grants.

The trade data suggested sound economic health, which could push up inflation and force interest rates higher. The unemployment report, however, suggested a slowing economy, which should reduce the risks from inflation. Conflicting data have been common in recent weeks, resulting in a lack of direction in the market.At the close, the S&P 500 index was up 0.4 per cent, or 5.6 points, at 1,271.55. The Nasdaq was up 0.7 per cent, or 13.9 points, at 2,074.14. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.5 per cent, or 57.0 points, at 11,086.18.In the previous session the market had given back early gains based on robust earnings from companies such as Cisco Systems and Walt Disney. A warning from Toll Brothers, the home builder, together with a spike in oil prices, raised concerns about inflation and a possible economic slowdown.AMR, parent of American Airlines, finished down 0.3 per cent at $20.24, having earlier traded as low as $19.25. UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, was down 1.3 per cent at $23.52 and Continental Airlines was 1.5 per cent lower at $23.86. All three stocks rallied in afternoon trading, having suffered steep falls earlier on the news of the foiled terror plot.Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards, said: “Investors decided to look at the fact the plot was foiled rather than focus on the heightened threat. There could easily have been panic, but that turned out not to be the case.”AIG, which fell sharply in the previous session, reported a 29 per cent profit decline that nevertheless beat analysts’ expectations. Shares in AIG rose 3.1 per cent to $60.32 at the close.Viacom reported a 23 per cent profit rise following the acquisition of DreamWorks. Viacom shares were up 9.7 per cent at $37.03.Before the opening bell, Target, the retailer, reported a 13 per cent rise in second quarter profit on the back of higher food sales.

429;TGT;Target Corp;2006-08-10T19:57:18Z;Target optimistic on ‘back-to-school’ sales;;Target and JC Penney on Thursday said there had been a good start to the key “back-to-school” selling season, despite concerns expressed by rival US retailers that high energy prices and a weakening housing market were hitting sales.Recent US economic data suggest that consumer spending is set to slow, but the impact has been more muted on discounters and department stores, as well as high-end retailers such as Nordstrom.Target, the second-largest US discount retailer by revenues after Wal-Mart, said it was comfortable with existing full-year earnings as strong early-summer sales and an expanding credit-card business overcame the impact of higher selling costs and an aggressive store expansion programme.Investors had been concerned after the company’s same-store sales growth fell to 3.1 per cent in July from 6.7 per cent a year earlier, and Wal-Mart has said high fuel prices were forcing shoppers to make fewer trips and focus on essential purchases. “We are pleased with our back-to-school business,” said Bob Ulrich, Target’s chairman and chief executive officer, although he stressed it was still early in the season.Target operates about 1,500 stores in the US and has a more affluent demographic than Wal-Mart, but is boosting the amount of food in its outlets, a move that hit gross margins in the first quarter.Margins rose slightly in the latest period from what analysts viewed as a tough year-ago comparison,The company pointed to tighter inventory management as it reported a rise in net profits from $540m to $609m in the quarter to July 29, with sales up 11.3 to $13.35bn. It has also adjusted pricing after a shift towards some more expensive product lines forced additional discounting in the previous quarter.Same-store sales growth – from outlets open for more than a year – reached 4.6 per cent in the quarter, but the company expressed confidence in maintaining its long-term average of around 5 per cent, above that achieved by Wal-Mart.The company has said it could double or even triple its existing store base, with selling space growing around 8 per cent a year.JC Penney reflected the continuing strength of the department-store sector – helped by the hot weather, which drew customers indoors – by raising its earnings’ guidance for the third quarter and full year. Net profits in the July quarter rose from $131 to $179m, with same-store sales up 6.6 per cent.
430;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Chicago passes ‘big box’ retail wage bill;;Chicago’s city council on Wednesday passed a controversial bill that would set a minimum wage for large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target that operate “big box” stores in the city.The 50-member council backed the bill by 35 votes to 14, more than the two thirds that would be needed to overturn a possible veto by the city’s mayor Richard Daley.Mr Daley had opposed the bill, which critics claim wouldl divert new store development into the city’s surrounding suburbs. The mayor has never previously vetoed a bill from the city council during his 16 years in office.While similar city minimum-wage laws exist in San Francisco, Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Washington DC, the Chicago law is the first to be aimed only at retailers, covering retailers those with annual sales of more than $1bn that operate stores of more with a floor space in excess of 90,000 sq ft.The Chicago “retail living wage law” was backed by a coalition of anti-poverty, religious and union groups and would set a $9.25 per hour minimum wage for 2007, rising to $10 in 2010, with a $1.50 benefits supplement rising to $3 in 2010.Current wages at Chicago stores such as Wal-Mart and Target start at around about $7.25 an hour. The Illinois state minimum wage is currently $6.50 an hour, while the federal minimum wage is $5.15 an hour.Retailers are concerned that the Chicago bill, if it becomes law, could serve as a template for similar legislation targeting their sector in other major US cities.The Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents the largest US retail comanies, said it was disappointed by the vote, saying it was “a setback for the city of Chicago, its citizens, and area retailers”.“The ordinance passed today is a clear disincentive for more than a dozen retailers impacted by this ordinance to locate or expand their operations in the city of Chicago,” Sandy Kennedy, RILA’s president, said in a statement.Andrew Young, the African American former mayor of Atlanta who now heads a pro-Wal-Mart group, also attacked the city council, saying its action “once again tells inner-city residents they alone will be frozen out of access to local jobs, affordable goods and a stable economic future”.Advocates of the bill say that minimum wage legislation in other cities has not driven away retailers, and that large retailers will still want to site stores in Chicago, lured by the size of its comparatively unexploited inner city market.Annette Bernhardt, of the poverty programme at the Brennan Cener for Justice, which helped with the drafting of the bill said that the vote sent “a clear message to big retailers that if they want to come into urban areas, they need to bring good jobs with benefits.”Opponents of the bill have said they will challenge its legality under the state’s constitution.

Discount retailer Target warned that it expected lower sales than it had previously forecast. AG Edwards cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “hold”. The shares fell 4.3 per cent to $45.03, its worst day since November.The gloom spread to other retailers. Nordstrom lost 3.6 per cent to $32.36, and JC Penney shed 3.5 per cent to $63.37.Federated Department Stores, which runs Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, fell 3.4 per cent to $33.33.The S&P retail index is now at its lowest level in over a year.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 2.37 points, at 1,236.86 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent, or 5.51 points, higher at 2,043.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent, or 51.87 points, at 10,799.23.“We did see a big pull back in the price of crude. That fed into investors’ psyches,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co.Investors reacted coolly to Merrill Lynch, which fell 1.1 per cent to $67.50 despite reporting a 44 per cent rise in second-quarter profits – more than expected. There were fears about a fall in revenues from the first quarter and the future trading outlook for the brokerage.Investors also seemed less enthusiastic about United Technologies, which ann-ounced a better-than-expected 14 per cent rise in earnings. The shares, however, gained only 1.6 per cent to $58.88.Coca-Cola climbed a modest 2 per cent to $43.55, despite reporting a 7 per cent increase in quarterly profit ahead of forecasts.The focus is likely to remain on earnings as more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 report this week.According to Thomson Financial, the blended growth rate – a composite figure created using a combination of estimates and earnings reported so far – stands at 12.3 per cent. Should the growth rate for this second quarter finish above 10 per cent, it would mark the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the S&P 500.The producer price index rose 0.5 per cent in June, up from 0.2 per cent in May and significantly ahead of the flat level that had been expected by analysts. The core PPI, which strips out food and energy prices, grew 0.2 per cent.Engineering group ITT Industries gained 4.8 per cent to $47.69 after Merrill Lynch changed its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, saying the company was well placed to weather a consumer downturn.
432;TGT;Target Corp;2006-07-14T19:16:26Z;Gap to launch eight-week TV ad blitz;;Gap, the largest US speciality clothing retailer, will on Monday launch an eight-week US television advertising campaign for its more than 3,000 Gap brand stores, as part of a comprehensive drive to turn around almost two years of falling sales.The TV ads are tied to the launch of the brand’s autumn clothing, and mark what some industry analysts see as a make-or-break moment for Paul Pressler, chief executive since 2002.Cynthia Harriss, president of the Gap brand, has been working over the past year to re-establish its reputation for selling stylish casual basics, after unsuccessful forays into dressier clothing, epitomised by its use of Sarah Jessica Parker, star of the Sex and the City TV series, in its marketing two years ago.“We’ve been re-establishing the essence of our brand and developing a clear point of view about what we stand for,” Ms Harriss told investors last month.Gap is now returning to TV ads after a year’s break, with a range of artists that Ms Harriss describes as “individual style makers”, including Jeremy Piven, the actor, and Natasha Bedingfield, the singer.Since taking over as Gap president in May last year, Ms Harriss has led a overhaul of its head office and store operations, appointing a new designer, Charlotte Neuville, and recently bringing in a veteran fashion brand merchandiser from Liz Claiborne to head its adult segment.Ms Harriss, who previously worked with Mr Pressler at Disney’s theme parks division, has also reorganised the company’s design and merchandising teams to focus on what the company sees at its four main product categories – denim, T-shirts, trousers and skirts and active-wear.The current launch – which sees changes in everything from the design of labels to a new carrier bag – is backed by stores being reorganised into four “store within a store” segments for T-shirts, active-wear, denim and more formal clothes.It has also largely phased out some of its traditional lines, such as men’s khaki pants in various fits.Gap argues that the new focus on categories, rather than cross-category collections, will allow it to deliver more rapidly changing selections of clothes – a step towards the fast-fashion model pioneered by retailers such as H&M and Zara.“Before, we were rooted more in collections, and it was more difficult to have that product constantly flowing into the store,” Ms Harriss says.Gap’s North American division, which accounted for more than $5.1bn of the company’s $16bn revenue last year, has seen flat or falling same store sales for the past seven quarters.The retailer has been squeezed in its 18-34 market between more fashionable competitors, such as Abercrombie & Fitch, and cheaper mass market competitors, such as Target, the discount store.“They’ve really become commoditised,” says Wendy Liebmann, of WSL Strategic Retail. “If I want basic, I’ll go to Target . . . if I want something special, I’ll go to Abercrombie.”Over the summer, Gap sought to build the groundwork for its current campaign with events in its major markets aimed at generating “buzz”. These included sponsoring concerts, and driving a Gap bus around California and on New York’s Long Island.It has also adopted more creative window displays, with monthly changes aimed at reinforcing the overall marketing push.Gap’s autumn line has received guarded reviews on Wall Street, which is also looking for signs of improvement at Old Navy, its lower cost brand, and at Banana Republic.Todd Slater, a retail analyst at Lazard Capital Markets with a “buy” recommendation on Gap, wrote this week after a meeting with management that he believed “all three brands showed varying degrees of heightened competitiveness”. However, he was not overly impressed by the autumn lines, saying he did not believe the range was “compelling enough to move the needle meaningfully . . . over the next couple of months”.Mr Pressler – who last year predicted an improvement in performance this spring that failed to materialise – has said the company expects its sales figures to turn “modestly positive” in the second half of 2006.“We need to get the momentum with our customers . . . It’s not going to be one thing, because we’ve really got a big job to do in winning our customers back,” says Ms Harriss.
433;TGT;Target Corp;2006-07-11T22:47:03Z;President of Gap’s Old Navy to step down;;Jenny Ming, president of Gap’s Old Navy division, is to step down in the autumn, the latest in a series of senior management changes as the speciality clothing retailer seeks to reverse falling sales across its three main divisions.Ms Ming, who has been with the company for almost 20 years, played a leading role in the launch of the lower cost Old Navy brand in 1994, becoming the division’s president five years later.Old Navy’s more than 950 stores accounted for around two fifths of Gap’s total sales last year of $16.8bn, slightly more than the 1600 Gap brand stores.But over the past two years, Old Navy has been unable to reverse declining sales, struggling to distinguish its range of casual fashion from discount competitors such as Wal-Mart and Target.A push this year to deliver better quality and more on-trend clothing has so far failed to produce improved sales. In June, sales at Old Navy stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent against a year ago, marking the the twentieth consecutive month of declining or flat comparable sales.Ms Ming said in a statement that she believed her departure was right “for me personally, and for the brand”, and that she would seek to smooth the transition to her successor.Her departure was announced as Old Navy is pushing ahead with the launch of an autumn clothing range that is seeking to distinguish itself from the discount competitors with higher quality items, including leather jackets and “special edition” embellished denim that are above its traditional price points.News of Ms Ming’s leaving follows a series of new appointments at the company’s US Gap division, including the appointment last month of Denise Johnston, formerly a senior executive at Liz Claiborne, as head of its Gap Adult operations. Gap also appointed Charlotte Neuville as its new head designer last year.Gap brand is preparing to launch a major integrated marketing campaign next week to support the arrival in the stores of its autumn clothing range, the first to be fully designed under Ms Neuville.
434;TGT;Target Corp;2006-07-06T22:47:28Z;Rising petrol costs take toll on Wal-Mart sales;;Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said on Thursday that its customers were increasingly feeling the pressure of higher fuel prices, as it reported that comparable sales at its discount stores increased by just 1.1 per cent during June.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said research among Wal-Mart’s predominantly lower income shoppers showed increasing concern about the rise in petrol prices over the past year.Wal-Mart’s customers, he said, were consolidating shopping trips to cut down on driving, and reducing non-essential purchases. “The priority in spending by our customers is on food and consumables,” he said.Other smaller discounters also reported lower than expected sales at stores open at least a year, although Target, Wal-Mart’s more upmarket rival, reported a strong 4.8 per cent gain in June sales.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said he saw signs of weakness at discounters “across the board” in June as low income customers faced higher driving costs. “We would expect that to continue to the second half, with no sign of an easing of gas prices”.A separate survey of US shoppers’ sentiment by Retail Forward consultants also raised questions on Thursday about the strength of consumer demand among wealthier US households, which account for the bulk of retail spending.Steve Spiwak, an economist at Retail Forward, said the monthly Future Spending index, based on a survey of 4,000 households, showed signs of increasing pressures that went beyond gasoline prices affecting households with incomes above $22,000.“In particular, the drag of debts amid rising interest rates is taking a bigger toll on household cash flow. The recent stock market downtrend and concerns about income growth also are crimping the desire to spend.”Retail Metrics’ overall monthly same-store sales index from leading retailers for June showed a 2.8 per cent gain, below the 3 per cent expected by Wall Street industry analysts.But Mr Perkins said sales had remained surprisingly resilient, despite both high fuel prices and the impact of heavy rains and flooding in the north-east US that further depressed demand.“I’m amazed at the American consumer’s ability to spend,” he said, suggesting that reported strength in the jobs market could hold up retail demand in the coming months.“As long as the job market holds up, there’ll be some floor for consumer spending and we’re not going to see the slowdown we’ve been expecting.”
435;TGT;Target Corp;2006-06-08T07:06:42Z;Wall Street dips as crude fall hits oil majors;;Wall Street closed lower for a third consecutive day on Wednesday as lower crude oil prices sparked a sell-offof energy stocks while failing to instill confidence in investors.The news forced the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 11,000 points, for its lowest close in more than three months.Philip Roth, chief technical market analyst at Miller Tabak, believes the market is continuing to be rattled by the lack of volume in the market when it rallies.“Since it made its lows on the 23rd and 24th of May, rallies have been very weak, with not much volume. Once again, today it tried to rally, and volume dipped off. There’s very little evidence of investment buying [in the market],” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent, or 7.70 points, at 1,256.15, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.98 points, at 2,151.80. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.7 per cent, or 71.24 points, at 10,930.90.Oil pulled back from its highs, dipping more than a dollar a barrel, as data showed increased inventories of crude and gasoline. The fall in prices fed through to energy companies, with Schlumberger dipping 5.4 per cent to $61.97, its worst day since February. ChevronTexaco was down4 per cent to $57.17.The health sector was pulled higher after GlaxoSmithKline’s statement that it was interested in buying Pfizer’s consumer unit “at the right price”. Pfizer gained 0.3 per cent to $23.91, while Abbott Laboratories rose 1.6 per cent to $43.05.Corning fell 8.7 per cent to $21.95 after new research linked asbestos to cancer of the larynx. Last month Corning restated a part of its 2005 financial results that concerned an asbestos settlement.Retailers posted gains, led by Target, which added2.7 per cent to $48.90. Supermarket Supervalu rose1.6 per cent to $29.29, while Kroger gained 0.6 per cent to $19.86.Consumer products were boosted as investors sought shelter in defensive stocks. Molson Coors jumped 3.3 per cent to $67.94 and Colgate Palmolive gained 0.9 per cent to $60.73. Colgate Palmolive has gained more than 11 per cent since March.“We are seeing some investors looking at consumer stocks,” said Chris Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, who attributed this to a defensive stance by investors.Chemicals companies were bruised by a downgrade. Dupont and Dow Chemical were both dropped from “buy” to “hold” by Deutsche Bank. Dupont fell 2.6 per cent to $41.09 and Dow Chemical dropped 1.3 per cent to $39.08.L-3 Communications rose 4.7 per cent to $76.93, as the death of chief executive Frank Lanza on Tuesday sparked takeover talk.
436;TGT;Target Corp;2006-05-19T20:57:52Z;Wall Street lower amid mixed data;;"Wall Street finished the week lower as mixed economic data painted a confusing picture for investors worried about the possibility of interest rate rises.A commodities sell-off dented the materials and energy sectors, while retail stocks were also in the spotlight as a range of earnings reports mostly heartened investors.Economic data provided cause for cheer and worry in equal measure in a week that saw the release of key inflation numbers. Although producer price data were benign, they were followed by worryingly robust consumer price numbers, which fanned fears that the Federal Reserve would be forced to raise rates again in June.Analysts said weak commodity stocks and inflation concerns were the key drivers behind the week’s decline in equity prices.“I would give equal weight to [commodities prices and] continued concern that inflationary fears will keep the Fed on a tightening trend,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. “The market didn’t think this was the case for the first four months of the year and it did some adjusting this week.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.4 per cent, or 5.22 points, for the day at 1,267.03, down 1.9 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite picked up, gaining 0.6 per cent, or 13.56 points for the day at 2,193.88 – a loss of 2.2 per cent for the week. on Friday the index finally broke eight days of consecutive declines, its worse losing streak since September 1994.The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up on Friday, adding 0.1 per cent, or 15.77 points, to 11,144.06, a fall of 2.1 per cent since Monday.In a depressing week for the markets, retail offered some therapy. It was the only major sector to end higher, thanks to mostly strong earnings reports.Robust numbers lifted Sears Holdings after it surprised investors with a
19 per cent increase in quarterly profit. The company’s shares gained 16.1 per cent to $161.89 for the week, its highest level since July of last year. It was the best performer in the S&P 500.The markets also warmed to Wal-Mart. The world’s largest retailer nudged up
1.7 per cent to $47.32 after it announced a 6 per cent rise in quarterly profits. The results, ahead of forecasts, offset a warning that high energy prices could affect results for this quarter.Others were less fortunate. Wal-Mart’s rival Target fell 5.8 per cent to $49.16, in spite of news of a 12 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. The stock was undermined by concerns about the retailer’s shrinking margins.Staples slid 7.9 per cent to $24.52. Although profits rose strongly, investors took fright at sluggish same-store sales that rose just 1 per cent, the slowest rate in three years.The commodities bull run finally looked like it might be running out of steam after a broad-based sell-off on Monday dragged oil and metals lower. A brief rally on Tuesday failed to hold, and Nymex crude for June settled on Friday at $68.53, down 5 per cent for the week, while gold and copper also fell steeply. The S&P Metals and Mining Index was down 10.2 per cent for the week.“The good news is that this takes a bit of the inflationary fears away,” said Mr Hogan.Oil services company Noble shed 11.2 per cent to $68.98, its lowest level since November 2005. ConocoPhillips sank 3.8 per cent to $62.72.Mining and materials stocks also suffered. Barrick Gold shed 9 per cent to $30.56 and Phelps Dodge, the copper producer, lost 12.9 per cent to $83.06. Aluminium producer Alcoa fell 8 per cent to $31.98.One of biggest decliners over the week was Carnival Cruises which shed 12.8 per cent to $40.71 after it cut its outlook for 2006. Of the 10 worst performing stocks on the S&P 500, Carnival was the only stock not involved in energy or mining.Technology stocks were on the move as Advanced Micro Devices surged 10.4 per cent to $34.95 after Dell Computer announced it would no longer exclusively use Intel chips in its PCs.

437;TGT;Target Corp;2006-05-15T22:00:20Z;Wall Street weakened by energy and mining stocks;;US stocks finished mixed on Monday after trading lower for much of the day, as the market remained skittish about inflation prior to the release of important economic data this week. A retreat in crude oil and commodity prices dragged energy and mining stocks lowerA retreat in crude oil and commodity prices dragged energy and mining stocks lower, while the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors bounced back. Stocks in focus included Target, Abbott Laboratories and Qualcomm.“The sell-off in commodities is a welcome relief,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. “Commodities have been going up up up, and now it looks like normal profit-taking.“There’s some follow-through after the blood-letting of last week. But some of the background is improving. Bonds are up, and the dominant trend for the market remains up, but we have to recognise that economic growth is slowing down, which is healthy.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent, or 3.26 points, at 1,294.50, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2 per cent, or 5.26 points, at 2,238.52. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent, or 47.78 points, at 11,428.77.Target was one of the day’s biggest fallers. The discount retailer reported a 12 per cent increase in quarterly earnings on Monday, which came in below the expectations of analysts. Target fell 4.2 per cent to $50.02, its lowest level since May last year.The pull-back in commodities and oil prices took its toll on producers.Phelps Dodge tumbled 6.5 per cent to $89.25 and oil services company BJ Services shed 5.4 per cent to $35.86, its lowest level in a month.Archer Daniels Midland, the largest producer of ethanol in the US, was also hit by the fall in oil prices, losing 2 per cent to $43.24.Pharmaceuticals were the best performers, with the sector up 1.1 per cent after AstraZeneca announced that it would acquire UK biotech company Cambridge Antibody Technology. Abbott Laboratories was up 2.1 per cent to $42.30 and Merck gained 1.2 per cent to $34.69.NYSE fell 4.9 per cent to $68.90 amid ongoing speculation that officials are in Europe this week to consider a deal with a European exchange. Names in the frame include Euronext and the London Stock Exchange.Qualcomm fell 0.7 per cent to $48.63 following a ruling by the US Supreme Court that will potentially make it harder for patent owners to gain redress for infringements. Qualcomm derives about 60 per cent of its profits from royalty payments for technology it created.Pulte, the largest builder of homes in the US, fell 2.9 per cent to $33.44, and Lennar dropped 1.4 per cent to $49.81, after a survey indicated that confidence amongst homebuilders was at an 11-year low. The S&P 500 Homebuilding index is now at its lowest level since January 2005.
438;TGT;Target Corp;2006-05-15T17:42:34Z;Target profits surge 12% with credit cards’ help;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Monday highlighted the strong performance of its credit card business as it announced that its first-quarter profit rose 12 per cent against the same period last year, to $554m, or 63 cents per diluted share.While other leading US retailers, including Federated, Kohl’s and Neiman Marcus, have sold off their credit card operations over the past year, Target said the contribution of its card portfolio to net earnings before taxes rose 59.5 per cent during the quarter, to $162m.Douglas Scovanner, chief financial officer, dismissed suggestions that Target might consider selling its card business. “The credit card portfolio continues to generate very, very strong absolute performance and spectacular year-over-year performance,” he told analysts.“This business had been a fabulous tool for making our guests want to visit our stores more often, and spend more on each visit across a long period of time, and our margins today are as wide as they’ve ever been.”In spite of the rise in profits – and a 12.1 per cent increase in quarterly sales to $12.8bn – Target reported larger-than-expected increases in its expenses, which grew faster than sales, and a slight decline in its gross margins.Mr Scovanner said store payroll and operating costs, including power and light, accounted for about 40 per cent of the increase in expense rate, with the remainder put towards initiatives aimed at increasing overall profitablity. For the full year, he expected expenses to be “up slightly” as a percentage of sales.The retailer, which has built a reputation around selling “cheap chic” style in its clothing and home furnishings, also indicated it had overshot its customers’ willingness to spend on home furnishings.Greg Steinhafel, Target’s president, cited in particular price markdowns related to its annual “Global Bazaar” promotion of ethnically styled home furnishings.“We upscaled too far at this particular point of time,” he said. “We will be bringing those price points down. . . We’re going to make the kind of changes that are going to stimulate impulse buying and people not waiting for the assortment to go on sale.”Mr Steinhafel also dismissed current efforts by Wal-Mart, its larger rival, to offer more upscale products. “We have seen just a limited amount of upscaling in home, and a slight upscaling in their apparel.”Target’s shares were down 4.4 per cent, at $49.40, by lunchtime in New York.
439;TGT;Target Corp;2006-05-09T21:06:16Z;Home Depot buys bank to offer financial services;;Home Depot, the second biggest US retailer, is seeking to expand into the direct provision of financial services with the acquisition of EnerBank, a small industrial bank based in Utah.The move comes amid renewed concern in the banking industry over the use of state-chartered industrial banks by commercial companies to offer loans and other services, prompted largely by the bid by Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, to open a Utah bank similar to EnerBank.EnerBank, which began operations in March 2002, currently offers unsecured home improvement loans of $10,000 to $25,000 to home owners using referrals from contractors, and currently has net loan assets of just $70m.The retailer bought the bank for an undisclosed sum from CMS Energy. It said it would now promote the loan service to contractors who use its network of more than 900 stores across the US.Jim Stoddart, president of Home Depot Supply, declined to speculate on possible opposition to the bank aquisition, noting that EnerBank had a “regulatory sound” business model.“EnerBank deals with hundreds of contractors, and we do business with hundreds of thousands of contractors. So this is a tremendous opportunity for us,” he said.He also argued that the acquisition was part of Home Depot’s drive to expand its services for contractors. In March, it closed its $3.51bn deal for Hughes Supply, which distributes construction, repair and maintenance products.The retailer also insisted that it intended to continue to focus on the bank’s existing business, and had no plans to change other aspects of its credit offerings.In common with other US retailers, Home Depot already offers branded credit cards and loans to individual customers - with 16m proprietary cards issued by Citibank accounting for around a quarter of its store sales last year.The change of ownership requires the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which earlier this year organised unprecedented public hearings to review Wal-Mart’s application for a Utah industrial bank charter.The Wal-Mart bank bid renewed a debate in Washington over the role of industrial banks, which the Federal Reserve and some members of Congress argue undermine federal laws aimed at separating banking and commerce.Wal-Mart has insisted it would restrict the operations of its proposed bank to back-office processing of its electronic payments.FDIC could also choose to open Home Depot’s takeover of EnerBank to public comment.A number of car companies, including Volkswagen and BMW, use their Utah-based banks to issue car and home loans, while Target, the discount retailer, uses its Utah bank to issue business credit cards.Existing banking regulations allow state-chartered industrial banks to issue credit cards, take deposits, and open retail branches.
440;TGT;Target Corp;2006-04-10T19:10:20Z;Wal-Mart draws fire from US banking industry;;The US banking industry has warned regulators that creation of a Wal-Mart bank would inevitably lead to the retail giant expanding into mainstream financial services.The American Banking Association and a range of other bank groups appeared on Monday before the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to voice opposition to Wal-Mart’s bid to open a state industrial bank in Utah.The unprecedented public hearing heard a range of critics argue that entry by Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, into the expanding state industrial banks sector would undermine federal laws aimed at separating banking and commerce.But the ABA also challenged Wal-Mart’s assertion that its proposed bank would be restricted to processing its electronic payments, saying the retailer has “a recent and ongoing track record of expanding the retail banking services it offers”.“Once a Wal-Mart bank obtains deposit insurance, there would be little or no opportunity for the public to comment on the bank’s expansion into other products, services or geographies,” said Art Johnson, the ABA’s head of government relations.He pointed out that Wal-Mart’s current programmes include testing Wal-Mart-branded debit cards that can be loaded with cash and payroll cheques, and “Money Center Express” machines operated by the retailer.Jane Thompson, head of Wal-Mart’s financial services division, insisted the retailer had no intention of opening a state-chartered bank in Utah to operate a branch network at its stores – seen by local and community banks as a potential competitive threat. She also pointed out that Wal-Mart’s application met the regulatory standards of the FDIC, which regulates state industrial banks.But Wal-Mart has not ruled out eventually expanding the bank’s activities into other areas, such as issuing credit cards or financing.Wal-Mart’s main rival, Target, has used a Utah industrial bank to issue credit cards, while car companies including Volkswagen and BMW use industrial banks to provide financing and mortgages. The FDIC has said it would not make a final decision on Wal-Mart’s application until the appointment of a new chairman by the White House, expected later this year.
441;TGT;Target Corp;2006-04-03T21:02:21Z;Wall Street pares gains on rate worries;;Wall Street put in a mixed performance on Monday as lingering concerns over interest rates and General Motor’s falling sales combined to pull the market away from its intra-day high.Stocks initially rode on the wave of new merger and acquisition activity to surge ahead. But gains were pared as the persistence of high bond yields and stronger than expected construction spending figures weighed on sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.3 per cent at 11,144.94, helped by Caterpillar’s 2.4 per cent advance on strong construction data. The broader S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,297.81, but the Nasdaq Composite reversed early gains to close down 0.1 per cent to 2,336.74.Retailers retreated after Wal-Mart’s March sales disappointed. Wal-Mart shares fell 1 per cent to $46.75 and rival Target lost 1.3 per cent to $51.34. Radioshack also slipped 4.2 per cent to $18.43 after Prudential downgraded the stock from “overweight” to “neutral”, saying said the consumer electronics retailer’s transition to selling Cingular products appeared to be more difficult than expected.Shares of mining companies surged however as prices for commodities such as copper and gold hit new highs. Copper producer Phelps Dodge advanced 4 per cent to $83.73, aluminum maker Alcoa gained 1.1 per cent to $30.90 and US Steel rose 2.5 per cent to $62.19.Energy stocks gained alongside crude prices. The Amex Oil index gained 0.4 per cent, led by ConocoPhillips, up 2 per cent at $64.41.Headlining the day’s deal activity was the eagerly awaited merger between telecom equipment makers Alcatel and Lucent. Lucent rose 1 per cent to $3.08 after news of the $13.4bn deal while the NYSE-listed shares of France’s Alcatel jumped 5.3 per cent to $16.21.General Motors, which agreed to sell a controlling stake in GMAC, its finance arm, for $7.4bn, was among the handful of blue-chip stocks trading lower.The stock fell 5.3 per cent to $20.14 as gains were pared by its ongoing dispute with its main parts supplier, Delphi and news that first-quarter sales fell by 14 per cent. Ford Motor, which also reported lower sales, was off 2.4 per cent at $7.77.Back on the deal front, Aztar, the Phoenix casino operator, rose 6.2 per cent to $44.60 after it received a $2.25bn, or $42 a share, acquisition proposal from Ameristar Casinos.The offer makes Ameristar, down 6.9 per cent at $24.01, the third bidder for Aztar, following offers from Pinnacle Entertainment and Colony Capital.News that Service, the biggest US owner of funeral homes and cemeteries, had agreed to buy Alderwoods, the industry’s number two, for $856m helped drive up shares in both companies. Service shot up 9.1 per cent to $8.51 and Alderwoods rose 8.1 per cent to $19.34.Elsewhere, a bullish article in the financial weekly Barron’s helped push Microsoft up 1 per cent to $27.49.Verizon and Motorola, rose 1.1 per cent to $34.42 and 1.9 per cent to $23.35, respectively, after each announced plans to sell off some of their assets.
442;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Google considers European retail push;;Google is attempting a significant push into the European retail industry with plans to launch a service aimed at giving traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers a base from which to market and sell their goods online.The US-based search engine company plans to develop Google Base, a product still in testing, into an online retail platform. The service would give retailers access to the hundreds of millions of Google users.Nikesh Arora, head of Google’s European arm, said in an interview with the FT that Google wanted companies in retail – and possibly sectors such as real estate – to hand over details of their goods, prices and customers.Google would index and package the information into a consumer-friendly search engine, giving its users a virtual supermarket across a number of retail brands.Mr Arora said: “Google Base is going to have a huge impact on retailers,” adding that the move reflected internal research, which found many leading European retailers did not feel they were competitive enough online.But it is unclear how companies will respond, given that many of the world’s biggest retailers – including Wal-Mart, the world’s leading retailer, Home Depot, the US home improvement company and Tesco, the UK supermarkets group – have invested millions in online operations.Some retailers are yet to set up their own internet operations, even though consumer purchases online have soared.One big UK retailer with no online presence said on Wednesday that Google’s retail offer would be of interest if the internet company could also arrange for distribution. This potentially huge task has raised doubts about the long-term business models of other online retailers such as Amazon.com.Though ambitious, Google’s plan to create a broader e-commerce platform for retailers lags similar initiatives from Amazon and Ebay. UK clothing and foods group Marks and Spencer, US discounter Target and US bookseller Borders have contracted out online operations to Amazon.Until now, Google had been vague about its ambitions for Google Base, which is structured as a collection of databases. Besides being used as a platform for retailers, industry observers who had seen the “beta” version of the product thought the service would be aimed at consumers and allow individuals to swap classified ads for free.Google is under pressure to develop new business lines amid fears that growth in its online advertising revenue is slowing after a strong recent run.Google’s research – based on interviews with 20 of Europe’s top retailers – reveals a high level of dissatisfaction among retail executives about their online operations.
443;TGT;Target Corp;2006-02-21T21:31:21Z;Lex: Wal-Mart;;Size matters. Wal-Mart can trumpet the $7bn in sales it added in the fourth quarter, but the retail group’s sheer scale means that translates into only 8.6 per cent growth year-on-year. More importantly, same-store sales growth at Wal-Mart Stores, the key US division, remains a relatively uninspiring 2.7 per cent.Kick-starting that number remains the key to ending Wal-Mart’s long share price malaise. With Wal-Mart Stores still accounting for two thirds of sales, the division’s performance far outweighs any progress on the international front, where Wal-Mart has expanded through acquisition.Admittedly, management is not standing still. It has started to revamp the group’s marketing and to expand into higher margin areas such as apparel. It is hoping to make more of its products appeal to slightly higher-spending customers like those who shop at rival Target. There are also some signs that Wal-Mart is getting to grips with the rising cost of operating its stores, particularly the labour costs. Operating margins rose year-on-year in the fourth quarter, having fallen in the earlier part of the year.But such glimmers of improvement are unlikely to shift Wal-Mart rapidly from its historically low valuation of less than 16 times this year’s earnings. For that, Wal-Mart needs its predominantly low-income shoppers to spend more freely. A sharp fall in energy prices could prove the catalyst, by removing some of the financial pressure on Wal-Mart’s core customers. But investors betting on that have repeatedly been disappointed. Progress from here remains a long, hard slog.
444;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
445;TGT;Target Corp;2006-02-16T21:34:26Z;Hewlett-Packard powers Wall Street gains;;Wall Street powered ahead for a third consecutive day on Thursday, with technology stocks leading the way after sector bellwether Hewlett-Packard delivered a stronger-than-expected set of quarterly earnings.HP shares jumped 7.4 per cent to $34.02 after the technology conglomerate beat both revenue and earnings forecasts. Net income rose 30 per cent to $1.227bn, helped by its restructuring efforts and higher personal computer sales.Deutsche Bank, Banc of America Securities and Bear Stearns all raised their price targets for the stock while Credit Suisse upgraded its recommendation on the shares from “neutral” to “outperform”.“We still like the HP story and think the stock has room for additional upside potential,” said Keith Bachman, a BofA analyst, in a research note.The broader technology sector appeared to benefit from HP’s strong performance. The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent higher at 2,294.63 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 per cent to 11,120.68 - its highest level since May 2001. The S&P 500, buoyed by gains in the energy sector, advanced 0.7 per cent to 1,289.63.The gains came despite a rebound in crude prices and renewed worries that the current strength seen in the US economy would prompt the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates.“We need good numbers but not too strong numbers,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist, AG Edwards & Sons. “But this week we have seen some pretty strong number in capacity utilisation, retail sales and housing starts.”Internet stocks were heavily traded, with Google and Ebay moving to the upside while Amazon and Expedia traded in the red.News that the number of sponsored link advertising impressions on Google grew 16 percent helped lift shares in the internet search engine out of its recent slump. After skidding almost 26 per cent in the last four weeks, Google bounced back 7 per cent to $366.46.By contrast, shares in Expedia plunged 18.3 per cent to $19.82 after the online travel company said quarterly profit fell 43 per cent.Boston Scientific, which is working to close a $27bn acquisition of rival medical device maker Guidant, moved up 8.7 per cent after its finance chief bought up 200,000 shares of the company for $4.5m. UBS analyst Kenneth Weakley, in a research note, said the purchase was “a positive sign on the value of the stock.”On other earnings news, Applied Materials, which makes equipment used to make computer chips, fell despite topping analyst forecasts with its fourth-quarter earnings.Although Citigroup and UBS both lifted their price estimates on the stock to $25, its shares fell 2.4 per cent to $19.96 on profit-taking after Goldman Sachs advised clients to sell the stock, citing valuation concerns.Network Appliance, the computer data storage company, jumped 7.8 per cent to $33.58 on the back of higher quarterly earnings.Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell more than 6 per cent to $14.51 after it reported a loss of $51m.Despite a weak start to last year’s holiday shopping season Target and JC Penney both delivered strong fourth-quarter earnings. However, while shares in JC Penney climbed 2.2 per cent to $57.85, Target slipped 2.2 per cent to $54.59.
446;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Target reports solid sales and profit growth;;Target, the US discount retailer, said on Thursday it expected to further expand its presence in food retailing in 2006, underlining the steadily increasing pressure on the traditional supermarket sector.Target is following Wal-Mart, its main rival, in pushing into the grocery business, which serves to increase traffic to its stores and overall sales, although at a lower profit margin rate.It is expanding the range of food products sold at its existing 1,239 discount stores, and currently operates 136 SuperTarget stores, which like Wal-Mart’s Supercenters combine a full range of fresh and packaged food with general merchandise.The retailer said approximately half of its general merchandise stores currently offer an expanded food section, and that it would continue to expand this in 2006, when it plans to open another 110 discount and superstores.It also said that its SuperTarget square foot age grew 16 per cent in 2005, twice the rate for its regular discount stores. Target said it planned to increase more deli-style ready-to-eat food offerings at its SuperTargets in the coming year.“We continue to grow SuperTarget square footage at a sharply faster rate than our general merchandise square footage,” said Bob Ulrich, Target’s CEO.Target said it expected to see same store sales growth of 4-6 per cent in 2006, against the 5.6 per cent seen in 2005. It also said it expected to meet its goal of a pecentage in increase in earnings per share “in the low double digits”, with revenues growing at 2-3 times the expected 4-5 per cent growth in the overall US retail market.Target announced fourth-quarter profits from continuing operations rose to $933m, or $1.06 per share, from $809m, or 90 cents per share the previous year and slightly ahead of analyst expectations. Revenues for the quarter grew by 12 per cent to $17bn.The retailer’s total sales for 2005 rose to $52.6bn, a 12.3 per cent increase on 2004
447;TGT;Target Corp;2006-01-31T19:25:42Z;Lex: US banking;;Most people agree that competition is a good thing, as long as it squeezes someone else. Bankers are no different. So it is little surprise they are concerned about the possibility of the likes of Wal-Mart invading their own turf. What is more surprising is the support they have mustered.Last week, Alan Greenspan joined the growing chorus warning of the dangers of allowing commercial companies to own so-called industrial loan companies. Such quasi-banks are increasingly popular. General Electric, several carmakers and Wal-Mart’s rival Target already own ILCs. Denying Wal-Mart the same privilege would be hard, without changing the law. The danger for consumers is that Congress might do just that.There are legitimate concerns on how to supervise ILCs, given they benefit from federal insurance on deposits. Mr Greenspan’s intervention, however, may be partly motivated by a desire to defend the Federal Reserve’s turf against rival regulators.With financial services profits still accounting for 26 per cent of domestic US corporate income in the third quarter, it is difficult to argue the banking sector suffers from too much competition. Banks might point to the explosion of new products as a reason for capturing a larger share of national income. Also, the high returns of recent years have arguably had as much to do with the Fed’s inclination to print money as the industry’s structure. But if financial services supermarkets really provide that much value for customers, they should not fear competition from stores of a more traditional kind.
448;TGT;Target Corp;2006-01-22T21:17:42Z;Supervalu set to venture into costlier aisles;;"Supervalu has taken a low-cost route to becoming the seventh largest grocery business in the US.Save-A-Lot, its largest brand with more than 1,200 stores, is a no-frills, hard discounter similar to Europe’s Aldi, that prides itself on having “no lobster tanks, cappuccino kiosks or floral departments”.Supervalu’s 230 larger format “price superstores” include Shop ‘n’ Save and Cub Foods – whose name stands for “Consumers United for Buying”. Almost half of Supervalu’s annual sales of about $19bn come from the unglamourous business of wholesale supplies.But the retailer is on the brink of venturing into far more costly shopping aisles, with its participation in a $17.4bn deal for Albertson’s, the second largest US grocer.Albertson’s has more than 1,700 supermarkets, most of them at least twice as large as the average Save-A-Lot store, and most including well stocked seafood counters, floral departments and Starbucks coffee kiosks. Its annual sales, at just under $40bn, are double Supervalu’s.The other members of the bidding consortium – Cerberus Capital and Kimco Realty – are expected to sell-off over 600 under-performing stores, while Albertson’s 700 free-standing drug stores will be sold to CVS.Left with the remaining stores - over 1,100 - Supervalu would join Kroger and Safeway among the largest supermarket operators in the US.“The sheer size of Albertson’s and the prospects of integrating its food retailing operations represents a massive shift in scale and price positioning for Supervalu,” wrote Ajay Jain, analyst at UBS Securities.Supervalu moved into retailing in 1980, when it acquired five Cub Foods stores in Minnesota. Under Mike Wright, its previous chief executive, it expanded, acquiring the innovative Save-A-Lot chain in 1991.The chain, now the largest extreme discounter in the US, has more than 800 stores operated under franchise agreements. It has a reputation for opening stores in tough urban areas and remote communities where other retailers fear to tread.Previously, Supervalu’s largest acquisition was a $1.2bn deal in 1999 for Richfield Holdings, a regional store operator. But Jeff Noddle, a 30-year veteran of the company who took over as chief executive in 2001, has shown interest in expanding its retail business through acquisitions.In 2003, a $400m takeover of Dominick’s, a Chicago-based chain, from Safeway was called off, and in 2002 it bought a St Louis-based chain of “dollar-stores” for an undisclosed sum.Mr Noddle told analysts this month that Supervalu viewed “the sale of Albertson’s and specifically the availability of its premier properties, as an extraordinary opportunity for the company to consider”.Karen Ghaffari, supermarket analyst at Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, also notes that Supervalu wants to expand the retail side of its business, over its lower-margin wholesale business. “This would move them very significantly into the
segment that they have been looking to grow in,” she said.But the acquisition will also represent a significant challenge. Currently, Supervalu’s store network includes only 60 traditional supermarkets, raising questions about the depth of expertise in a company that has been closely focused on discount retailing.The company’s Save-A-Lot unit, for instance, is still run by its founder, Bill Moran, while five of the company’s top seven corporate officers have been with Supervalu for more than 20 years.The sale of Albertson’s freestanding drug stores to CVS is also likely to increase the costs of operating the remaining in-store pharmacy network, although Supervalu does operate its own in-store pharmacy chain.But the biggest challenge will be moving into the heart of traditional supermarket retailing, at a time when the sector has been relentlessly battered by intense competition from Wal-Mart and Target among others, and by other low-cost discounters – including Supervalu itself."

But a profit warning from Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, raised concerns about the impact deep discounting could have on earnings.Wal-Mart expects fourth-quarter profits to come in at the low end of its forecast of 82-86 cents a share. Kohl’s, the mid-priced department store, also lowered estimates.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the margin impact of the promotional activity app-eared to have hurt some retailers, but the lower earnings guidance was “not as significant as many had feared”.Analysts were watching December sales as consumers delayed shopping until late in the month, with many opting for gift cards. Retailers book the revenue from the cards when they are redeemed, not when they are sold, which usually boosts January sales. Gift cards accounted for an estimated 15-18 per cent of consumer spending this holiday season.There were also fears about Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday, starting late, the lack of hot “must-have” items and whether the transit strike in New York would hurt the city’s big retailers.Overall sales rose 3.4 per cent, said Mr Perkins, better than his 3.1 per cent forecast. Factoring out Wal-Mart, sales were up 4.3 per cent. Sixty-four per cent of the Retail Metrics index beat expectations.Wal-Mart confirmed that December same-store sales – from stores open at least a year – rose 2.2. per cent, its weakest December sales increase in five years. The mediocre gain is a blow to the retailer in the wake of an aggressive holiday marketing campaign launched early in the season after it stumbled in 2004.Sales at Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, rose 3.4 per cent, beating expectations.“We are pleased with Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s performance in December, despite disruptions caused by the . . . strike the week before Christmas,” said Terry Lundgren, Federated’s chief executive.The biggest positive surprise came from Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen speciality retailer, which reported a 29 per cent jump in sales. The gain was impressive as most of its merchandise was sold at full price during a season of markdowns. Aeropostale, another teen retailer, surpassed expectations with a rise of 11.4 per cent against expectations of 4.4 per cent.Sales at Target, Wal-Mart’s discount rival, rose 4.7 per cent, while Nordstrom, a luxury retailer, beat expectations with a gain of 7.7 per cent. At Gap, the floundering apparel retailer, sales tumbled 9 per cent – worse than the forecast 3.8 per cent decline.
450;TGT;Target Corp;2005-12-14T13:31:15Z;Retail year in review;;For most retailers, the early part of 2005 will not be regarded with fondness. January provided a rash of less than spectacular trading statements from retailers, who it was universally acknowledged, were having a tough time.The gloom persisted for much of the year, and even the juggernauts of the sector such as Wal-Mart and Tesco suffered as higher fuel prices pinched at profits. The effect was twofold: inflated costs such as transportation and high petrol prices ate into profits, while customers became more price conscious as they faced higher fuel bills. The bombings in London in July did not help. However, the effects of these proved to be short-lived.Difficulties were backed up by statisticians in the UK. Consumer confidence in the UK remained at its lowest level since March 2003 according to data published at the end of November. Meanwhile a dirge-like CBI survey at the beginning of December charted retailers’ expectations at their lowest level in 22 years.There were some exceptions. Inditex, the Spanish retailer which owns Zara the clothing chain, continued to deliver increased revenues, a pattern that has persisted over the past five years helped by its ability to get new designs into stores fast.Meanwhile Sweden’s H&M, Europe’s biggest clothing retailer, reported higher sales and profits but in September gave investors a jolt when it revealed disappointing sales growth.However, discount retailer Primark, owned by Associated British Foods, flew in the face of the gloom, delivering double-digit underlying sales growth.And for J. Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer it was a year of two halves. At the start of the year, the once-great UK-based retailers appeared to be heading for intensive care but they ended 2005 on a significantly healthier footing.And in early December the British Retail Consortium said retail sales in Central London during November were 2.1 per cent higher, on a like-for-like basis, than last year, when sales had picked up 1.4 per cent. November’s result was the first increase since June, before the July bombings.By mid-December, the Office for National Statistics released figures showing that sales on the high street had continued to gain momentum in November, with the volume of retail sales jumping 0.7 per cent over the month, driven higher by strong sales in clothing shops and department stores. While in the US, retail sales showed solid gains in November, despite higher-than-usual energy costs.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer delivered a weaker than expected first quarter operating profit in the spring and warned on profits. By November though it was optimistic about the prospects for US pre-Christmas sales as it reported a 10.1 per cent increase in third-quarter revenues to $75.4bn. However, it gave a comparatively subdued forecast for December sales in the 2-4 per cent range, below the 3-5 per cent forecast it issued for November.Legal difficulties continued to plague the company, over gender discrimination and a lawsuit that sought to make it legally liable for violations of its own code of conduct at its suppliers factories around the world.It also suffered the embarrassment of the resignation of Tom Coughlin, its former vice-chairman whom it accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars over a seven-year period. Before his resignation, Mr Coughlin was regarded as a bastion of company culture and traditions.Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket operator, saw solid trading throughout the year and it now has more than a 30 per cent share of supermarket shopping in the UK. However, it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence and said in September that higher oil prices were increasing costs and hurting customers, while in November it reported the first slowdown in underlying sales growth for two years. But Tesco still managed to increase like-for-likes by 5.5 per cent in the 14 weeks to November 19, well ahead of rivals and most other general retailers with which it increasingly competes for non-food sales.However it was on the receiving end of some winter chill from Poland’s newly installed finance minister who said in early November that retailers opening up hypermarkets in the country were not welcome. Meanwhile the UK’s Office of Fair Trading is considering whether to refer the convenience market to the Competition Commission, as the Association of Convenience Stores, the trade body for independent shop owners, pushes for an inquiry.Meanwhile, the New Economics Foundation , a think-tank with links to the Treasury, proposed in June that Tesco should be broken up, arguing that the huge scale of the retailer was damaging communities and local enterprise.In continental Europe, KarstadtQuelle, the German retail chain which nearly went bankrupt last year, planned to cut its debt to zero in 2006 by floating or selling more real estate assets. Thomas Middelhoff, chief executive and former head of Bertelsmann, took the helm in May after the company had skirted bankruptcy in the second half of 2004, as sluggish demand and over eager diversification had almost crippled the retailer.The year started badly for Ahold, the Dutch retailer struggling to gain some equilibrium after being rocked by an accounting scandal in 2003. Nine people who worked for suppliers to Ahold were charged in early January by US authorities with collusion in its massive accounting fraud. The world’s fourth-largest food retailer, settled a class action suit in early December with US shareholders for $1.1bn, an amount that mirrored the effect on profits of the scandal.However, Ahold saw a return to profit in the second quarter, although it said the effects of Hurricane Katrina and higher fuel prices would make reaching its 2006 targets difficult. At the end of November it said it would lift profitability by splitting its US food distribution unit in two, re-igniting speculation that it eventually planned to sell part of the business at the centre of the accounting scandal.Carrefour, the world’s second-largest retailer, had a turbulent year. In February, its executive chairman Daniel Bernard, who over 13 years transformed the company into one of the world’s leading retailers, left the company along with three other directors. Luc Vandevelde, the former head of Marks and Spencer was named as chairman, while José Luis Durán took over as chief executive. In March it announced it was exiting Japan and Mexico as it battled to revive its hypermarket business in France, its home country.Marks and Spencer, the former queen of the British high street, regained some lustre towards the end of 2005 after a turbulent 2004. Things looked grim at the start of the year, when it issued a profit warning on the back of dismal trading, and in July it suffered its seventh straight quarter of falling revenue.But by the autumn, shareholders’ patience was rewarded as shares reached 400p, the level of Philip Green’s bid approach (Mr Green, the flamboyant entrepreneur and owner of retailers BHS and Arcadia group, walked away from a 400p bid for M&S 16 months ago). This followed improved trade, revealed in October when M&S said it had managed to increase sales for the first time since the end of 2003 and in November it revealed a near 20 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits, just above the top end of forecasts.And by the end of the year, its shares hit a seven-year high in early December and later in the month the retailer won its landmark tax case in the European Court of Justice, establishing that UK rules on group relief were unlawful. The M&S case itself, which involved about £100m of losses and a possible tax repayment of more than £30m, is now likely to be referred back to the High Court in London for resolution.There were high level splits at M&S. In July, Stuart Rose, M&S chief executive put on a brave face over the departure of his closest colleague, Charles Wilson, who resigned to become head of Booker. Later in the the year Mr Rose had a “lovers tiff” with George Davies, the founder of the well-regarded Per Una brand . Mr Davies went on to perform a remarkable U-turn, deciding to stay with the retailer in November four weeks after he quit.And after six years of hype and then disillusion, internet shopping started looking respectable again at the beginning of the year, with online sales at Christmas 2004 growing six times faster than the rest of the high street, accounting for 6.3 per cent of total spend.The number of shoppers visiting the websites of Wal-Mart, Target and Circuit City more than doubled on the Friday after Thanksgiving against last year, underlining the growing challenge from “bricks and mortar” US retailers to Amazon, eBay and other online sites. Ebay’s traffic slipped at the end of November 8 per cent to 9.4m, while Amazon’s grew 11 per cent with 4.6m unique users.Analysts said the strength of bricks and mortar retailers reflect the desire of new online shoppers to use familiar brands, and a broader interest in the benefits provided by recognised retailers, such as smooth handling of post-holiday returns and exchanges.While internet spend still accounts for a small proportion of spend with some retailers, for example only about 2 per cent of profits at Tesco, investors will be watching with interest to see how big the internet retailing market has become over the festive period and through 2006.
451;TGT;Target Corp;2005-12-01T18:24:00Z;US store sales at low end of forecasts;;US shoppers failed to respond as strongly as expected in November to lower petrol prices, favourable weather and deep discounting, raising doubts for retailers about the remainder of the holiday season.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics research, said the same-store sales figures released on Thursday by big US chains were “a little bit disappointing, given all the positive factors”.Mike Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said results from 65 chain stores showed an average sales increase at stores open at least a year of 3.5 per cent, against the ICSC’s forecast of 3.5 to 4 per cent.“It was a promotional month, and those doing the strongest promotions got the sales. The question is: at what cost for the companies? And how do the sales continue into the post-Thanksgiving period, where there is a traditional lull in sales?”He also said there were concerns about a pattern of spending that seemed to have concentrated spending towards retailers offering aggressively low prices, while other areas, such as upmarket department stores, had seen slower growth than previously.“There’s still a lingering concern about the consumer’s willingness to spend,” he said.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, issued a relatively subdued forecast for its December sales of 2 to 4 per cent, after reporting 4.3 per cent growth in same-store sales in November.The retailer’s same-store sales growth outstripped Target, its main discount rival, for the first time this year. Target said its sales at stores open at least a year increased by 2.6 per cent, in line with reduced forecasts made earlier in the month.Sales at Wal-Mart’s Supercenters and discount stores were up 3.8 per cent, while sales at its Sam’s Club discount warehouses were up 7 per cent. For the year so far, Wal-Mart’s Supercenter and discount same store sales are up 3.4 per cent, against Target’s 5.8 per cent.This year, Wal-Mart launched its holiday marketing campaign on November 1, two weeks earlier than last year, when it reported a disappointing 0.7 per cent rise in US same-store sales.Other retailers issued a mixed set of sales results for November, with traditional department stores producing disappointing figures.Federated Department Stores, which operates Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, said same-store sales fell 3.4 per cent, the biggest drop in more than two years. Kohl’s, Nordstrom, Dillard’s and Saks all performed more weakly than expected. Gap reported a 4 per cent drop in same-store sales, which included a 5 per cent drop at its Gap brand US stores.
452;TGT;Target Corp;2005-11-25T20:31:17Z;US retailers launch holiday sales with big discounts;;US retailers launched their annual post-Thanksgiving sales push on Friday with an unprecedented salvo of aggressive price-cutting and early openings in an attempt to bolster sales in the face of higher energy bills and other economic uncertainties.Some big stores, including Wal-Mart and JC Penney, opened their doors this year at 5am, an hour earlier than usual, at the start of the most important shopping season of the year, or Black Friday – the first day of the year on which retailers historically moved out of the red and into profit.Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, said she believed Friday was “one of the earliest and most promotional Black Fridays”. “Many stores opened earlier than ever before and retailers offered unbelievable sales and discounts to get people shopping.”Paul Cohen, spokesman for Visa USA, said the price cutting seemed more aggressive than last year. “The retailers have gotten savvy. They know that consumers are looking for bargains, and they want them spending in the stores now, rather than hanging back and waiting for prices to fall later.”In Howland Township, in northeast Ohio, scores of shoppers braved bitterly cold temperatures and overnight snow to line up in the dark outside their local Wal-Mart, seeking special early-bird bargains on goods including a 42-inch plasma flat screen TV for under $1,000.A few miles away, the Target store at the Eastwood Mall in Niles was swamped by an early morning rush, with lines more than 30 deep waiting for its 18 cash registers at 7am. Best Buy, the electronics retailer, also drew large early crowds with limited time offers including a Toshiba laptop for $380, while Old Navy, Gap’s low cost brand, drew long lines with a holiday scratch card discount competition, and free breakfast snacks at the door.Some analysts expressed worries that the cold weather in the north and east US might depress the weekend’s performance. Mark Rein, a retail consultant for Capgemini who was monitoring shoppers at the Mall of the America near Minneapolis, reported significantly smaller crowds than in previous years, despite lines at stores offering special holiday bargains.Despite the retailers’ marketing emphasis on the weekend sales, the share of holiday shopping carried out over the weekend is gradually falling, analysts say, as consumers start holiday shopping before Thanksgiving. A strong holiday weekend performance can also lead to a larger than usual sag in sales in early December.Last year, US consumers spent $22.8bn over the Thanksgiving weekend, accounting for just over 5 per cent of the total $414.7bn spent in the entire holiday season during November and December.A strong start to the sales should help allay worries that higher energy costs would undermine consumer spending. The Fed said this week that the economy overall was strong and it raised concern about inflationary risks, but it also noted that consumer spending softened towards the end of the third quarter. Confidence has rebounded sharply since then, with data this week supporting the Fed’s view that sentiment would recover from the lows seen after September’s hurricanes.Underpinning the optimism, Visa USA said its transactions at more than 6m retail outlets rose 9 per cent last week against the year before, and were 5 per cent up on the previous week. Visa USA’s online transactions on the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday also increased 28.3 per cent on the holiday last year, to $203m. “Clearly some folks were sneaking away from their family gatherings,” said Mr Cohen of the online sales. “I think we’ll see a rather good holiday season.”
453;TGT;Target Corp;2005-11-10T23:29:25Z;Target cautious on fourth quarter outlook;;Target, the second-largest US discount retailer, on Thursday said higher margins and strong business from its credit cards helped boost third-quarter earnings from operations by nearly 35 per cent.But the company was cautious on the outlook for the crucial holiday shopping season, saying it would seek to maintain rather than expand operating margins.Bob Ulrich, chief executive, estimated that earnings per share growth would be in the mid-teens for the fourth quarter, about 4 cents below analysts’ estimates.By comparison, Target last year earned 90 cents a share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.Shares in Target rose less than 1 per cent to $56.99 in midday trade on Thursday.Retailers are gearing up for the busy holiday shopping period, which accounts for most of their revenues for the year. But last year, highly competitive promotions and price wars with rivals such as Wal-Mart, the number one US discounter, cut into profits.Target’s modest forecast came even as it reported that third-quarter comparable store sales – those from stores open longer than a year – were 5.9 per cent higher than for the same period last year. It projects that November comparable store sales will rise by 4-6 per cent.“If history repeats itself I would be delighted 90 days from now to tell you we made a forecasting error and . . . earnings per share were off the charts,” said Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer.“I don’t think that’s very likely to happen, is the message that we’re trying, quite candidly, to deliver today.”Earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter reached $435m, or 49 cents a share, compared with $324m, or 36 cents a share, last year.Net income fell 18 per cent to $435 from $531 last year when Target sold its Mervyn’s store chain.Total quarterly revenues increased 11.9 per cent to $12.2bn from $10.9bn last year.Target’s credit card business grew 31 per cent to $158m over last year. Gross margins in the third quarter improved sharply by 121 basis points compared with a year ago, owing to higher prices and less surplus inventory.
454;TGT;Target Corp;2005-11-03T21:43:33Z;Wall Street higher on robust retail data;;Strong monthly sales data from retailers and a sanguine assessment of the US economy by the Federal Reserve chairman pushed Wall Street broadly higher on Thursday.Retailers accounted for the majority of the top 25 best performers on the New York Stock Exchange. Clothing and shoe retailers saw tidy gains but general stores also advanced.Aeropostale, up 10.12 per cent at $22.19, led the charge. Guess was not far behind, up 12.9 per cent to $31.60.Other retailers propelled higher by the broad sector rally included DSW, up 8.6 per cent to $22.75, and Men’s Wearhouse, up 10.65 per cent advance to $28.77.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, fell 0.23 per cent to $47.69 after it reiterated its forecast for same-store sales. Rival Target, a rival, declined 0.3 per cent to $56.80, while Saks fell 0.6 per cent to $18.22.Stocks received a further boost from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who told Congress that the world’s largest economy was still sound, in spite of hurricanes and energy price increases.Against this background, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent, or 49.86 points, to 10,522.59 by the close, while the broader S&P 500 put on 0.4 per cent, or 5.18 points, to 1,219.94. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 0.74 per cent, or 15.91 points, to 2,160.22.Leading the gains on the Dow was Merck, up 3.8 per cent at $29.48 after a jury found the drugmaker not guilty in a trial related to the side effects of its Vioxx painkiller.Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker and also a Dow component, was up 1.25 per cent to $21.87.Boeing, up 1.2 per cent to $65.50, and McDonald’s, 3 per cent stronger at $33.23, were also among the main gainers on the Dow industrials.Among the companies announcing earnings yesterday, Sara Lee shares increased 2 per cent to $17.87 after the panties-to-pastries group topped analyst forecasts.On the downside, Montpelier Re Holdings shares plunged 13.64 per cent to $18.55 after the reinsurer posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.Comcast, the largest cable TV systems operator in the US, fell 5 per cent to $27.36 after it reported that third quarter profit growth was essentially flat.The news came even as revenue from digital cable and high-speed internet services was showing improvement.Guidant traded down 4.7 per cent to $57.57 after Banc of America slashed the medical device maker’s price target to reflect the uncertainty surrounding Johnson & Johnson’s $25.4bn bid for the company.
455;TGT;Target Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Soaring oil will hurt spending, says Wal-Mart;;Lee Scott, chief executive of Wal-Mart, on Tuesday sounded the alarm over the impact of higher fuel prices on US consumers, highlighting the risks to spending by the discount retailer’s core lower-income customers.“The only real economic concern I have is that oil prices will erase improvements in employment and real income for a portion of our customer base …an important portion of our customer base,” Mr Scott said in a prerecorded statement on the company’s second-quarter results. “So I anticipate we will face challenges as the year proceeds,” he added.Wal-Mart’s cautious outlook for the coming quarter combined with sluggish second quarter results from the world’s largest retailer to send its share price down more than 3 per cent in New York, to $47.41. The company said second-quarter earnings rose 5.8 per cent to $2.8bn, or 67 cents per share, while sales increased 10.2 per cent to $76.8bn.In spite of the threat to the spending power of its customers posed by fuel costs, Mr Scott said that inflation “appears to be well under control”, and that the price of a typical basket of goods at Wal-Mart’s discount stores was unchanged from a year ago.But Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, also noted that higher fuel costs meant the company’s trucking fleet - the biggest in the US - had spent an additional $30m moving goods to its stores during the quarter. In addition, the costs of providing light and power to its network of more than 3,500 US stores had increased by more than $100m.Wal-Mart’s immediate concerns over fuel prices contrast with other major retailers, including Home Depot, which reported on Tuesday, and Target, its main discount rival, reflecting its dependence on a customer base for whom fuel prices make up a larger proportion of discretionary spending. US petrol pump prices have risen around 8 per cent during the last month.Emme Kozloff, analyst at Sanford CBernstein, estimates that higher petrol prices in the remainder of the year will add about $31 a month to household costs, against $25 a month in the first six months of the year.Wal-Mart initially responded to rising fuel price pressures with additional bargains. It is now trying to attract better-off customers, with higher quality products.Wal-Mart said its international division had again been hit by continuing problems at its Asda subsidiary in the UK, with its growth at stores open at least a year “essentially flat” during the quarter. The group also announced a $36m restructuring charge following Asda’s move to reduce management staff in favour of more store-level jobs.
456;TGT;Target Corp;2005-05-12T20:20:25Z;Wall St lower as falling oil hits energy sector;;US stocks fell on Thursday after energy companies were hit by the falling price of oil, which dropped back below the $49 a barrel mark. Investors were also grappling with disappointing results from Wal-Mart and a report showing a bigger-than-expected gain in sales across the retail sector last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1 per cent to 10,189.04, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent to 1,159.27, and the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.4 per cent to 1,159.27.The price of a barrel of crude oil fell $1.91 in New York, dragging shares in the energy sector down with it. Exxon Mobil, the biggest US oil producer, fell 4.3 per cent to $54.82. Marathon Oil, a rival, fell 5.1 per cent to $46.02. National Oilwell Varco, the bigggest US maker of oilfield equipment, fell 5.5 per cent to $41.63.An official report said that retail sales rose 1.4 per cent last month. The gain was twice what most economists had expected, but the country’s biggest retailer failed to get a boost from the news.Wal-Mart shares fell 2 per cent to $47.65 after the retailer said second-quarter results would probably miss forecasts. The company also reported lower-than-expected first-quarter profits. Wal-Mart said unusually cold spring weather and high oil prices were partly to blame for tepid sales.Target, Wal-Mart’s chief US rival, rose 1.2 per cent after it reported higher earnings. The Minnesota-based group reported earnings of 55 cents a share, slightly ahead of estimates.An undertow of economic uncertainty continued on Thursday after data showing a shrinking trade deficit pushed the leading indices modestly higher on Wednesday.Jitters over the potential impacts on hedge funds of last week’s unexpected moves in the share and bond prices of General Motors and Ford, the struggling US automakers, led stocks to fall sharply on Tuesday. On Thursday, a report showed that the number of people filing for initial unemployment benefits rose last week.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said the lack of direction in the stock market was surprising given the generally upbeat tone of economic and corporate news this earnings season. “This is still a market that is looking for what can go wrong rather than what’s going to go right,” he said.Walt Disney, the entertainment group, rose 0.3 per cent to $26.75 after it reported profits up 30 per cent for the quarter, driven by strong DVD sales.Shares in UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, edged 1 per cent to $1.00 a day after the company reported a $1.1bn quarterly loss. A court earlier this week ruled that the government should assume billions of dollars worth of pensions liabilities from the struggling commercial carrier. United said the move was necessary to avert bankruptcy.FedEx, the express shipper, slipped 2.6 per cent after it reaffirmed its second-quarter guidance. The company said that it expected earnings of between $1.40 and $1.50 a share.Ford Motor, the second-biggest US carmaker, fell 3 per cent to $9.35 after it suspended sales of unsecured short-term loans. Losses sharpened after Moody’s, the ratings agency, cut the company’s debt ratings to just above junk. General Motors, Ford’s bigger rival, fell 1.2 per cent to $30.62.Shares in US airlines were mixed. Delta Air Lines rose 1.1 per cent while AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.8 per cent. Investors were keeping a close eye on developments at United, the bankrupt US carrier. A court earlier this week relieved United’s parent, UAL, of billions of dollars in pension obligations.
457;TGT;Target Corp;2005-05-05T15:11:41Z;US shoppers shrug off petrol price rises;;US consumers largely brushed off the impact of higher petrol prices last month, according to retailers’ sales figures that underlined the continued strength of spending in the luxury and youth apparel and accessories sectors.“It’s a mixed bag, but overall the retailers came in ahead of expectations. It’s not blow-out, but it’s not bad,” said Gint Rimas, analyst at Thomson FirstCall, who noted that market expectations had been damped by the concerns over petrol prices and by unseasonably cool weather.“The consumer is indeed weathering the economic headwinds from high gas prices, worries over high inflation and interest rates, and even job worries,” said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ‘The consumer continued to spend.”Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer being sold to private investors for $5.1bn, reported a 12.5 per cent increase in sales at its 37 stores, exceeding analysts expectations of a rise of about 8 per cent. Nordstrom, the upmarket department store, also reported a better-than-expected 6.9 per cent increase in sales.But several department stores that cater to the middle of the market, which is more likely to be affected by energy costs, also reported better than expected sales. Federated, which own’s Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, saw its same store sales increase 2.8 per cent, against analysts’ expectations of a 0.9 per cent increase.Neiman, JC Penney and Federated increased their forecast for first quarter earnings, with Federated’s shares rising over 5 per cent in New York to $63.58.In one sign of the possible impact of higer petrol prices, Wal-Mart, the largest US discount retailer, said sales in food had been stronger than general merchandise during the month. Wal-Mart, which reported a 0.9 increase in sales, said a drop in the number of visits to its stores by customers had been offset by an increase in the value of each individual sale.Target, the rival discounter, reported a lower than expected 1.3 per cent increase in same store sales, but said it still expected “very strong profit growth” in the first quarter.A new survey of retail executive attitudes, released on Thursday by the National Retail Federation, also showed growing concern about the impact of higher interest rates and petrol prices. The NRF’s demand outlook index, which reflects business expectations for the coming six months, dropped 8.7 points in April to 52.8.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics consultancy, noted that retailers had not cited higher energy prices as a factor affecting performance during April. “If gas prices remain at these levels then it is likely to start pinching,” he said.Gap, the largest speciality apparel retailer, reported another month of disappointing sales, lowering its forcast for first quarter earnings after a five per cent fall in same store sales. Sales at Gap brand stores in North America were down 9 per cent, while sales at its international stores fell 12 per cent.Sabrina Simmons, head of investor relations, cited significantly lower margins as a result of sales to clear remaining spring merchandise.American Eagle, the youth apparel chain, continued its strong performance with a 20 per cent increase in same store sales, while rival Abercrombie & Fitch saw a 16 per cent increase.
458;TGT;Target Corp;2005-03-18T10:44:19Z;Where does CGT liability stop?;;In 1980 I took out a life assurance plan called the Intercity Vesta plan with a company called Target, which has since been taken over by Abbey Life. My regular monthly contribution is £12 and qualifies for income tax relief. As it matures in September 2005, I recently requested a valuation but was shocked to see that the company has passed on its capital gains liability to me. Can they do this?David Bird partner at Thomas Eggar has looked at your case and says the policy appears to be a unit-linked whole-of-life policy. He explains that certain policies which were taken out before March 14, 1984 will continue to qualify for life assurance premium relief at a rate of 12.5 per cent. The policy proceeds should not be subject to personal taxation if it is a qualifying policy, he adds. However, there may be instances where the company could pass CGT liability to you. “In the case of some old policies, the policy conditions contained provisions that a sum equal to tax on capital gains which arise within the life assurance fund will be borne by the policyholder.” You need to go back to check your original policy document to check see if it provides for the capital gains which arise on a disposal of investment assets to be deducted from the gross policy proceeds, he says. If there is a provision, along these lines,that may explain why Target has passed CGT liability to you. If this does not help, you should speak directly to the Abbey Life as this question appears to be specific to the plan in question.Return to which senderI left the UK 4 four years ago and worked in Australia until last year. My Australian accountant tells me that, soas long as I remain outside the country for more than 6 six months of the current tax year and have no definite intention of going back to Australia, then I am non-resident for taxation purposes (I have permanent resident status). In which case, where do I send a tax return? I have no residence or dependants in the UK but spent 2 two months there this summer. Separately, if I do have to pay UK tax, and if I have a capital loss on a qualifying asset (quoted shares) can they be deducted from a capital gain?Where you intend to return remain permanently will be important to determine where you will be considered tax resident, and your requirement to lodge returns says Megan Percey, tax accountant at Dynamic Management Solutions. Percey says that your Australian accountant is correct about your tax status. Given this, she says if your only Australian income going forward is interest or dividends subject to withholding tax (or franked dividends), then no tax return is necessary for that year. However, if you have an Australian rental property or have other Australian-source income, then a return must be submitted, she adds. The issue of your UK tax residency status must also be addressed. “The Inland Revenue states that if you leave the UK to work full-time abroad, you are treated as not resident and not ordinarily resident if your absence from the UK and your employment abroad both last for at least a whole tax year and, during your absence, any visits you make to the UK total less than 183 days in any tax year and average less than 91 days a tax year,” says Percey. If you meet these conditions you are treated as not resident and not ordinarily resident in the UK from the day after you leave the UK to the day before you return to the UK at the end of your employment abroad, she adds. You are treated as coming to the UK permanently on the day you leave your employment abroad and UK tax resident from that date. In regards to your shares, Percey says if you make a capital loss you can offset it against any UK capital gains. You are also entitled to use the capital gains tax allowance of £8,200 p.a. “It should be noted however that Australian losses cannot be set against UK income or gains.” Another important consideration, to keep in mind, Percey says, is that UK CGT will apply to UK assets disposed of while abroad by a former UK resident who returns to the UK within 5 five years. This is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent UK residents going abroad temporarily to avoid tax, disposing of UK assets in the following year, then returning to the UK.How to buy-to-let from abroadI want to invest in a buy-to-let property in the UK. However I am not a UK citizen and I am not resident in the UK at present. However, I lived and worked in the UK for a few years before returning to India. I have a bank account in the UK with a substantial amount of money in it. Can I get a mortgage from any of the British banks?Unfortunately for you very few lenders offer services for foreign nationals. This is because many consider foreign borrowers a higher risk as they are more difficult to track down if the mortgage goes into default, says David Hollingworth, of London Country. Some specialist lenders such as Mortgage Express and The Mortgage Works, however, do offer loans for foreign nationals but will only consider applications from certain countries. For example, The Mortgage Works will lend to individuals residing in FATF (Financial Action Task Force) countries, which does not currently include India. The Woolwich may be able to help, though, as they it can lend up to 65 per cent of the property value on their its standard buy-to-let range, so you will need a decent deposit. to put down. Hollingworth also suggests that you speak to the bank which has your UK current account. “They might be able to look at the proposition, perhaps on commercial rates.” Otherwise, it is worth looking to the offshore functions of UK institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland International, he suggests.
