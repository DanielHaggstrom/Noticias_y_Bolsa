0;IEX;Idex Corp;2012-02-03T15:35:35Z;Fillon announces five more centres of excellence;Both Insead and HEC included in successful higher education ‘clusters’;François Fillon, France’s prime minister, on Friday announced the names of a second wave of higher education groupings that would be awarded funding under the Initiative d’Excellence (Idex) scheme.The five ‘Idex2’ clusters – Sorbonne Université, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Saclay, Aix-Marseille and Toulouse – join three existing Idexes, Paris Sciences et Lettres, Bordeaux and Strasbourg.The Idex scheme is representative of France’s efforts to create a smaller group of world-class, highly visible universities to slowly replace the traditionally more fragmented – and complicated – higher education system. Reform is being led by Laurent Wauquiez, the country’s minister for higher education and research.Business schools such as Insead and grandes écoles such as HEC are all getting involved in clusters, working alongside universities.For Insead, which is part of the Sorbonne Université (or Sorbonne University) group, the announcement is particularly significant as it will enable the autonomous business school to draw on the expertise of other university departments, such as law, medicine and humanities. This is an increasing trend among university-based business schools in both the US and Europe.“There are lots of opportunities to develop (inter-disciplinary) research and programmes,” says Hubert Gatignon, the Insead marketing professor who is heading up the schools relationship with the Idex.Indeed, Insead and the former Paris 2, now both part of the Sorbonne University Idex, will launch a masters level law degree, or LLM, this month, in Paris and Singapore. The first eight courses will be legal topics, the second eight will be about business. The degree will be taught in English. “It’s already agreed that to be international you have to teach in English,” says Prof Gatignon.Furthermore, two groups of faculty and students from Insead are already working with academics and students from the Sorbonne medical school on projects relating to nutrition and the neurosciences.Two of the big advantages of the group is that there is no overlap between the different university departments in terms of subjects covered and, coincidentally, several of the groups in the Sorbonne University have set up operations in Singapore and Abu Dhabi - as has Insead.Although Insead was a founding partner in the Idex, and has representation at every level of governance, Insead will remain an independent business school, says Prof Gatignon. He likens the relationship to that which Insead already enjoys with two other business schools, the Wharton school at the University of Pennsylvania, and Tsinghua University, in Beijing. Insead is also a founding member of the Global Network for Advanced Management, recently launched by the Yale school of Management.HEC Paris is part of the Saclay cluster, which also received the green light.
1;IEX;Idex Corp;2011-09-09T15:30:59Z;Mumbai: The business in India’s bold, bright traditions;;Mumbai’s big jewellery show, IIJS, is best known for huge crowds, sweltering heat, and its high concentration of gold jewellery, diamonds and coloured gemstones.Last month, manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers and gem dealers signed between $880m and $1bn of orders at the event, according to Synovate Research.While the show lacks the sophistication of BaselWorld, India’s Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council believes the deals struck by multi-million dollar companies, coupled with a celebrity-studded catwalk, confirm that India means business – both at home in an increasingly competitive luxury goods market, and internationally.“Today, 11 out of every 12 diamonds in the world is cut and polished in India,” says Rupak Sen, a veteran analyst and Asia marketing director for ethical emerald miners Gemfields. “India is the largest supplier of jewellery to Middle Eastern retailers, particularly Dubai,” he says.More than 27,000 visitors included buyers from India’s main jewellery retailers, such as TBZ and Reliance Jewels, and more than 1,500 from outside the country.About 840 exhibitors ranged from Rosy Blue, to the World Gold Council, Platinum Guild International, Dalumi, Rapaport Group, IDEX, Taché and Mahendra Brothers.The Israel Diamond Institute, which will soon open an India office, organised a pavilion of eight companies, including De Beers sightholders Julius Klein, while declining “a long waiting list” of others. Staff from Manhattan’s International Gem Tower, set for completion next year, flew out for sales meetings.“It was bedlam – if BaselWorld was half as packed as the IIJS, they’d be laughing,” says Joanna Hardy, the jewellery expert.“The gem section was absolutely buzzing with much talk about rubies from Mozambique and non-heated stones. Although I’d thought the best emeralds had to be Colombian, at IIJS I learned a good Zambian emerald looked just as good. But most of the jewellery I saw there wouldn’t sell in western markets.”While BaselWorld 2011 saw more than 103,000 visitors, the IIJS has the advantage of taking place before the peak selling seasons of both Diwali and Christmas.But this year the show fell under the shadow of volatile financial markets, fears of another global recession and a backdrop of soaring gold and polished diamond prices.According to diamond news source IDEX, the Indian jewellery industry, which recorded a staggering 42 per cent growth last year, is heading for a more modest 15 to 16 per cent growth. Loose diamond dealers reported that, while the show was average in terms of sales, they witnessed extremely strong resistance to diamond prices. Manufacturers of diamond and gem-set jewellery saw strong sales, but gold jewellery manufacturers say gold prices and recent stock market falls detracted from better sales.A runway show, which kicked off the event and featured 40 celebrities including Bollywood actresses, highlighted the UN-supported Beti campaign against female foeticide.Featuring jewellery by the likes of Hollywood favourite Amrapali, and leading brand TanishQ, it also suggested India is focused not just on offshore production, but also on design.“At the catwalk show, the cameras and the local press went ballistic,” says Ms Hardy. “There was real excitement.”Understanding India’s jewellery traditions could now shed light on opportunities for those outside the country.Buying and wearing jewellery is at the heart of the culture. Whereas British people can tell a person’s background from their accent, in India their jewellery does the job, attesting to regional trends.“Indians are immensely proud of adorning themselves. Whether you like their jewellery or not, it’s visible, colourful and bright. It doesn’t say I’m worth a fortune, it says I love jewellery. Others in the industry, including trade show organisers, might do well to take on board India’s passion for bold jewellery,” says Ms Hardy.Mawi, the British fashion jeweller, selected as a 2010 Walpole Brand of Tomorrow, is making inroads into the local market, capitalising on a growing demand for more fashionable goods from the west incorporating gold.“I was born in Manipur, in north-east India. Indian fashion-conscious clients totally get and love our jewellery,” says Mawi, whose retail outlets include Le Mill in Mumbai – a concept store housed in a former rice mill, founded by four women with backgrounds at L’Oreal, Hermès and Vogue India.
2;IEX;Idex Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
