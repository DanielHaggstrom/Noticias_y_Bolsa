0;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2017-12-18T22:09:39Z;Akamai Technologies jumps on activist stake;S&P 500 propelled by another solid day for materials, energy and financial sectors;Akamai Technologies jumped more than 13 per cent on Monday after Elliott Management, a noted activist hedge fund, disclosed a stake in the “significantly undervalued” cloud computing company, leading a US stock market that hit record highs on mounting expectations of tax cuts.The Massachusetts-based company’s shares had recovered some of their ground in recent months after sliding to a one and a half year low in August, but the boost provided by Elliott has now almost erased the stock’s 2017 losses.Elliott, led by the billionaire Paul Singer, is one of the most feared activist investors for its often aggressive stance. It has embarked on bruising corporate campaigns in recent years.Akamai, which provides a cloud computing platform for companies including banks, insurers and asset managers, “possesses an unmatched network platform which provides a significant competitive advantage in its ability to deliver, accelerate, optimise and secure global traffic and business applications over the internet”, the hedge fund wrote in a regulatory filing made late on Friday.Elliott said that among the changes it would seek through talks with Akamai’s board were an overhaul of its operations, management, capital allocation and board composition, as well a strategic review or sale process for all or parts of Akamai.The tech company’s shares received another boost from Credit Suisse on Monday, which raised its price target from $55 to $75. The average 12-month price target of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $62.4 and Akamai’s stock was trading at $65.67 by the close of trading in New York.Akamai was the biggest climber in the S&P 500 on Monday, which is comfortably heading for its ninth consecutive month of gains. That would be the first nine-month streak of rises for the blue-chip US equity benchmark since 1982-83.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent on Monday to a record 2,690.16, propelled by another solid day for the materials, energy and financial sectors, all corners of the stock market that tend to do well when economic optimism is on the rise.Utilities, traditionally a more defensive sector, suffered a 1.2 per cent decline, while consumer staples also slide 0.1 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite also hit fresh highs. The Dow gained 0.6 per cent to 24,792.20 while the Nasdaq rose 0.8 per cent to 6,994.76.The expected passing of a large US corporate tax cut has solidified the stock market’s robust 2017 gains this month, with a Goldman Sachs-constructed index of companies that pay a higher effective tax rate — and so should benefit from the legislation — rising another 1.2 per cent on Monday.JPMorgan’s equity analysts reckon that the tax package is only halfway priced into the US stock market, and forecast that the S&P 500 will climb another 4 per cent early next year “on the back of tax reform catalyst, continued synchronised global economic growth and potential flows from developed market bonds and equities”.

2;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2017-05-02T22:49:51Z;Akamai shares drop on disappointing Q2 outlook;;Akamai Technologies saw its shares dive nearly 13 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after its second-quarter forecast fell short of Wall Street’s expectations.The US-based content delivery network and cloud services provider said it expects revenue for the current quarter to come in between $597 to $609m, versus the $622.9m that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg are expecting. Earnings per share, adjusted to exclude special items, are expected to come in between 59 cents and 61 cents a share, missing the 64 cents that Wall Street had predicted.The guidance was given by Akamai chief financial officer James Benson during an earnings call with investors following the after-market release of its first quarter earnings, which came in ahead of analysts’ predictions.For the quarter, earnings per share were 46 cents, versus estimates of 45 cents, on net income from operations of $80.9m, ahead of the $79.2m that Wall Street was looking for. Revenue for the quarter increased 7 per cent year-over-year to $609.23m, compared to expectations for $604.7m.Akamai was the latest tech company to dinged by investors following weak guidance on Tuesday, with Twilio shares falling nearly 30 per cent after it slashed its full-year outlook.
3;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2016-07-27T21:45:35Z;Garmin jumps after wearables advance;US stocks fluctuate between losses and gains;Garmin was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the company known for its fitness trackers and GPS devices lifted its full-year outlook and reported upbeat second-quarter results, driven by strong demand for its fitness products.Garmin shares listed in New York advanced 11.6 per cent to $51.79 on Wednesday, taking its year-to-date gains to nearly 40 per cent, after the company said it now expects full-year sales of $2.9bn, up from its previous forecast for $2.82bn. That topped analysts’ estimates for $2.84bn.The Swiss company also lifted its earnings outlook for the fiscal year to $2.50 a share, up from its previous outlook for $2.25. That eclipsed expectations for $2.30 a share.The news accompanied better than expected quarterly results. Profits rose to $161m or 85 cents a share, compared with $137.8m or 72 cents a share in the year-ago period. Sales rose 5 per cent to $811.6m.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of 67 cents a share, on sales of $760.8m.Garmin said its “strengthening position in the wearables market”, where it competes with FitBit and Apple’s smartwatches, helped drive a 34 per cent increase in sales of its fitness devices to $212.9m.The rally in Garmin shares came as US stocks fluctuated between losses and gains.The S&P 500 slid 0.1 per cent to 2,167.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was almost flat at 18,475.39 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 5,141.13.Elsewhere, shares in Akamai Technologies tumbled after the technology company revealed its slowest sales growth since 2009.Akamai said its sales rose 5.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $572.1m in the second quarter, missing Wall Street expectations of $575m.That represented a slowdown in sales growth from the 7.8 per cent pace in the first quarter and 13.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015.Net income rose to $73.6m, compared with $67.2m in the same three-month period in 2015. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude certain items, of 64 cents a share, matched expectations.The cooling in Akamai’s sales growth prompted concerns among some analysts that the company’s largest customers may be accelerating a move to distributing more online media, such as websites, using in-house solutions rather than Akamai’s services.The so-called “do it yourself” trend is “having an accelerated negative impact on Akamai’s top line”, said David Dixon, an analyst at FBR.Mr Dixon added that “management is not pivoting fast enough” towards the information security business that is growing at a much quicker clip.Indeed, the performance and security business logged year-on-year sales growth of 16 per cent in the second quarter compared with a 9 per cent decline in the media delivery unit.Akamai shares tumbled 13 per cent to $50.51, extending the 12-month loss to almost a third.Also in the technology sector, Apple shares jumped 6.5 per cent to $102.95, adding some $33.9bn to the group’s market value, after its chief executive hinted that the company was working to develop new products as iPhone sales slowed.“There is quite a bit that we are doing beyond our current products,” Tim Cook said late on Tuesday as the group unveiled quarterly earnings that narrowly topped estimates.Twitter, meanwhile, plummeted 14.5 per cent to $15.77 after the social media company said it expected sales in the range of $590m to $610m in the current quarter, below estimates for $681.4m.
4;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2016-03-17T01:45:08Z;Apple signs up to Google Cloud services;Latest high-profile win for Google in race with Amazon and Microsoft for market dominance;Apple has moved some of its iCloud services on to the Google Cloud, marking one of the most high-profile wins for Alphabet’s rival to Amazon Web Services since it came under new leadership last autumn.Google has been a distant third in its race with Amazon and Microsoft’s Azure as the trio vie for market share in cloud computing, but it has made strides since the appointment of industry veteran Diane Greene as head of that business in November.Google also scored a victory with Spotify last month, when the music streaming service announced it would shift away from Amazon Web Services and move most of its services on to the Google Cloud platform.Apple’s move is part of a broader push to diversify its wide range of internet services, which include iCloud backups such as photo storage, music streaming and video downloads. The company already uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, as well as its own data centres, according to people familiar with the matter.Apple could eventually take more of these services in-house, and it has disclosed plans to build three new data centres over the next two years, in addition to the four it already has.As one of the world’s biggest companies with rapidly growing needs for storage and computing, Apple is a prize customer for cloud service providers. Analysts suggested that it may be playing providers off of each other at a time of high competition.Apple’s move to Google also represents a rare co-operation between two companies that are locked in fierce competition in other areas of their business. However, such a dynamic is not unusual in internet infrastructure: despite having been owned by Google for two years, smarthome device maker Nest still uses Amazon Web Services for its cloud needs.Google’s cloud business has long lagged behind those of Microsoft and Amazon. A recent survey by RightScale, a cloud management provider, found that just 6 per cent of respondents used Google’s cloud infrastructure, versus 17 per cent for Microsoft and 57 per cent for Amazon.However, the company has put more muscle behind its cloud business since it appointed Ms Greene, a co-founder of VMware, a company which provides cloud-based software and services.“One thing we’ve been hearing from customers is that they are being more aggressive in terms of negotiating with people on commercial terms,” said Kim Weins, head of marketing at RightScale, referring to Google. “They are really trying to bend over backwards as needed to win these early enterprise customers.”The move will raise questions for Amazon Web Services, the market leader in cloud computing. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that Apple will spend $1bn on AWS services this year, representing about a tenth of AWS’s revenues.In addition to losing Spotify, AWS also suffered a blow this week when Dropbox, the online storage company and a longtime client, revealed that it had moved most of its data to its own servers to save money and improve efficiency.After launching its service a decade ago, AWS has dominated through first mover advantage. But competition has toughened recently, led by Microsoft and Google.“Clearly AWS is still in the lead in the vast breadth of their services,” said Ms Weins, adding that Google’s increased number of services had helped it win new business. All three companies have been cutting prices over time.As Apple shifts its cloud strategy, a range of companies is being effected. Akamai, another internet infrastructure provider, which is believed to count big tech and media companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook as customers, has warned in recent months that its largest customers are bringing more of their data centre requirements in-house.Frank Thomson Leighton, Akamai chief executive, said on February’s earnings call that sales from its two largest customers were likely to fall from 13 per cent of overall revenues to 6 per cent this year as a result of the unnamed companies’ “increased do-it-yourself efforts”. Analysts have suggested that Apple is probably one of those two companies.Apple’s iCloud move was first reported by tech industry news site CRN.
5;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2014-07-02T22:26:16Z;World Cup sets US live streaming record;;The World Cup has become the most streamed live sporting event in the US, as Americans tune in to this year’s tournament on their smartphones, tablets and computers in record numbers.A surge of US interest in football has also led to record television audiences for ESPN, owned by Disney, and Univision, the largest US Spanish-language network. The USA team’s loss on Tuesday to Belgium, which took place during working hours, was the second-most watched men’s soccer match in the US ever, averaging 21.6m viewers across the two networks, according to Nielsen only behind the USA v Portugal game, which 24.7m watched on a Sunday.But a 50 per cent surge in live streaming compared with the previous record, set during the 2012 London Olympics, shows the sport’s appeal has grown particularly among younger, more digital fans.US viewers had so far watched nearly 30m hours of video streaming on ESPN’s World Cup website and apps, the network said, beating the previous record 20.4m hours during NBC’s 2012 Olympics coverage. Univision has streamed 1.5m hours during the tournament.Akamai Technologies, a content delivery network, said online video traffic peaked at 5.7 terabits of data per second during the USA v Belgium game, a record for a single World Cup match this year.With most matches airing during the work day, Americans were increasingly turning to their devices to keep up with the tournament. Fifa, the sport’s governing body, said US fans make up 20 per cent of its global digital audience and are spending more time on its site and apps than fans in Brazil, Germany, England and France combined.Fans are also flocking to social media: Facebook has seen more than 1bn posts, likes and comments since the tournament started, making it the most talked about event in the social network’s history. The World Cup has been mentioned 20m times on Twitter, according to data collected by Brandwatch, a social analytics group, and FGV, a Brazilian think-tank.A Pew Research Center poll found interest in the World Cup was highest among Americans aged 18 to 29 – a cohort that has a high rate of smartphone ownership. Nearly one in four of that age group said they were following the tournament closely, compared with 17 per cent of 30-to-49-year-olds and 16 per cent of 50-to-64-year-olds.Last week’s USA v Germany match drew a record 1.7m concurrent streaming viewers to ESPN at its peak, with streaming on Univision peaking at 747,000. Tuesday’s USA v Belgium match hit 1.5m streams on ESPN and 680,000 on Univision. In comparison, live streaming of January’s Super Bowl peaked at 1.1m.The world’s biggest football tournament is taking place in Brazil – soccer’s spiritual home. Can the World Cup win over a sceptical Brazilian public?While the elimination of the USA team leaves a question mark over US fans’ interest in the rest of the tournament, Univision’s viewership for non-USA games has been robust.Univision said its Sunday broadcast of the Mexico-Netherlands match was the most-watched programme of any kind in US Spanish-language TV history, with an average 10.4m viewers. Its audiences have been largest in cities with large Spanish-speaking populations, such as Miami, Los Angeles, Houston and New York.“Our audience focuses on three things: soccer, soccer, soccer,” said Keith Turner, Univision’s president of sales and marketing. “The success that we’ve had with this World Cup has been just phenomenal, so much better than we expected and so much better than 2010.”But the private equity-owned network has also captured non-Spanish speakers, in part by making its streams accessible to anyone. On Friday it will start requiring viewers to log in through their pay-TV providers, as ESPN does.Univision is also capturing the attention of the young viewers that advertisers are keenest to reach. At an average age of 36, its audience skews younger than viewers of English-language broadcasters, a reflection of the 10-year gap in median age between the US’s Hispanic population and the country as a whole.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
6;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;American Funds warns on ‘Heartbleed’ bug;;American Funds, one of the world’s largest mutual fund providers, has become the first financial institution to warn that its customers may be at risk from the “Heartbleed” bug which has made much of the web vulnerable to cyber criminals.Investors using the site between December 12 last year and April 14 may have had their confidential information compromised and should change their passwords, security questions and delete their browsing history.Out of its 50m shareholder accounts, American Funds estimates 825,000 investors could have had their passwords revealed.But a company spokesman said it had no information to suggest that accounts had been accessed or data stolen.*Cyber criminals who use the Heartbleed flaw leave no trace so it is almost impossible to track what may or may not be stolen.None of American Funds’ own servers had been vulnerable, only those operated by a third part vendor, the spokesman added.“The risk, though quite remote, involves information that passes through servers maintained by one of our vendors. The vendor responded promptly to this threat by installing a security patch before news of the bug was made public, and they continue to evaluate and address potential risks,” American Funds said.The company contracts out to Akamai Technologies, a vendor which used the OpenSSL security software in which the Heartbleed vulnerability was discovered earlier this month.The weakness in Akamai protections means many other companies may follow American Funds in warning their customers. Akamai originally said it had updated its software to repair the flaw before it was announced but on Monday issued another statement, saying it would change its customers’ private cryptographic keys in case they had been compromised.Akamai supplies security services to a large number of customers including nine of the top ten banks, eight of the top ten asset managers and four of the top ten stock exchanges, according to its website. But different companies rely on it for different services, so they may not all use its security protections.The Heartbleed bug was discovered by security researchers from Google Security and Codenomicon earlier this month, prompting large technology companies including Google, Facebook and Yahoo to rush to update the vital software.The gap between the announcement of the flaw and a company updating its software is a critical moment, providing a window for cyber criminals to pounce. So far, the Canada Revenue Agency and the UK parenting website Mumsnet have said that they have been victims of hacking attacks using the vulnerability.US financial regulators warned banks and other financial institutions that attackers could use the vulnerability to impersonate banks or users, steal login credentials and gain access to internal networks.The first arrest of a hacker accused of exploiting the “Heartbleed” bug was announced on Thursday by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Canadian police force’s cyber crime unit said it had charged a 19 year old man from Ontario in relation to the malicious breach of taxpayer data from the Canada Revenue Agency website.Stephen Arturho Solis-Reyes faces one count of unauthorised use of a computer and one of mischief in relation to data. His computer equipment was seized and the police said the investigation was still ongoing.The Canada Revenue Agency said earlier this week that the social insurance numbers of about 900 taxpayers had been stolen as a result of the “Heartbleed” vulnerability.*This article has been amended from the original to clarify the nature of the potential security threat
7;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Lookout embarks on global expansion in war on cyber crime;;Lookout, the San Francisco-based mobile security company, is embarking on a global expansion as it plans to take on large cyber security incumbents in the battle to secure the smartphone.Armed with a brand new chief executive, Lookout is starting on the road to a public offering by targeting big companies in global financial centres who are worried about protecting employee devices from cyber criminals.The chief executive Jim Dolce, formerly of Akamai Technologies and Juniper Networks, joins the previously founder-led start-up at a crucial moment, as cyber crime moves up both the corporate and political agendas.One of the worst flaws in security software was revealed last week with the “Heartbleed” bug , which made two-thirds of the web vulnerable to hackers. Revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency and the recent massive data breach at US retailer Target have added to fears surrounding cyber security.The market for mobile security products, such as Lookout’s apps, is expected to reach almost $3bn by the end of this year and $4bn by 2017, according to research group Canalys, as smartphone adoption soars.Investment has been flooding into cyber security start-ups, with early-stage funding for the sector rising almost 60 per cent last year.Lookout, founded in 2007, was one of the first companies to focus solely on mobile security, after its founders John Hering, Kevin Mahaffey and James Burgess started worrying about how hackers could attack bluetooth-connected devices.They made their names when they mounted a stunt at the Academy Awards, showing how they could access data from celebrities’ mobile phones – though stopped short of hacking them.Mr Hering, formerly chief executive and now chairman, is convinced that Lookout can challenge major security providers, best known for their antivirus software designed for PCs, such as Intel Security, formerly McAfee, and Symantec.More than half of Lookout’s 50m users are already based outside the US, but they are predominately consumers who have either downloaded the app or received it through their telecoms carrier. Users get the basic app for free or can pay a few dollars a month for a more comprehensive service. Companies will pay substantially more.Now, Lookout plans to open offices round the world in order to sell to enterprise. “This is a different strategy and requires more feet on the street than we currently have,” said Mr Dolce.Lookout began to expand into providing security to businesses last year when it raised $55m from investors, including German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom and Qualcomm, the chipmaker. It has raised $131.5m in total.“The incumbent security companies are not unlike BlackBerry missing the next generation of smartphone evolution,” said Mr Hering. “They are very tied to PC and have a hard time migrating to mobile.”Lookout aims to get “every major global organisation” using the service before launching an initial public offering, he said. “And then when the time is right for us to go public we’ll do so.”
8;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Website attack kits heighten threat from cyber criminals;;Attacks that take down company websites are becoming a greater threat as new tool kits are sold, making it easy for cyber criminals to launch attacks from just a handful of servers.The number of high-bandwidth, high-volume “distributed denial of service” attacks rose more than 370 per cent in February from the month before with their power increasing over 200 per cent, according to data from cyber security company Prolexic, a division of Akamai Technologies.The attacks can cost companies– especially those that make sales from their website – millions of dollars as they are taken offline for hours, sometimes days. But many do not admit to being victims of an attack, preferring to apologise simply for technical problems.Stuart Scholly, senior vice-president of security at Akamai, said there had been a “dramatic rise” in the “network time protocol amplification” attacks, named after the new method used to disrupt networks.“Anyone can go out there and generate these really large attacks with really no skill sets,” he said. “What we’re finding today is a lot of denial of service attacks because it has essentially become a service.”DDoS attacks have been among the most common types of cyber attacks for years. High-profile examples include a widely reported series of assaults – thought to have originated in Iran – against leading US banks last summer, as well as the largest attack ever recorded, against a non-profit organisation that battles spam email in March last year.But Mr Scholly said that while 18 months ago the tool sets still required some technical ability, now no coding skills are needed – and virtual currencies mean people feel more protected from legal action when buying the kits.He added that DDoS attack kits were now available on the internet with deals such as “5GB for $5 for five minutes” and so could easily be deployed by hacktivists, who target sites as a form of protest, and criminals.Most attacks are driven by politically motivated hacktivists but Meetup, the networking website, was attacked for days at the start of this month by a hacker claiming to be working on behalf of a competitor.Meetup published the email they received from the hacker, saying he or she would stop the attack for just $300. When Meetup refused to pay, it was hit by more attacks keeping the site offline for hours each day.Scott Heiferman, co-founder and chief executive at Meetup, said the attacks were “massive” and “severe”. “We were prepared for most DDoS attacks but the nature of these attacks is changing,” he said.Meetup did not say how much the attacks cost it. Forrester Research estimates the average company loses $4m for each four hours down and $27m for a 24-hour outage, with business services and financial services groups suffering the most.John Kindervag, an analyst at Forrester, said cyber criminals were also increasingly using such attacks to distract the IT staff’s attention, while they carried out a more targeted mission.
9;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
10;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2013-07-24T09:58:54Z;EM internet speed: closing the gap;;"Anyone who has surfed the web in places like Marrakech or Jakarta knows that internet speed in many developing countries leaves much to be desired.But a report published this week by internet company Akamai shows that a good number of those countries are catching up.Iraq, for example, saw its average internet speed increase by 122 per cent in the first quarter from the same period of last year, to an admittedly still sluggish 2.0 Mpbs. Even Libya, which still has the slowest internet speed in the world at 0.6 Mbps, boasted an increase of 19 per cent.Globally, the average internet speed in the period was 3.1 Mpbs – less than a quarter of the speed in world leader South Korea, but still up by 17 per cent year-on-year.More people also had access to broadband internet. Indonesia saw broadband internet penetration quadruple, while it increased seven-fold in Morocco.But there was some bad news too: internet speed fell in countries such as Panama and Egypt. The report also noted the ease with with which internet in some troubled nations can be cut off, as in Syria during its ongoing civil war. Sixty countries, including Myanmar and Ethiopia, have only one or two internet providers, making them especially vulnerable to being forcibly taken offline.Related reading:

11;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Cloud computing: clearer skies ahead;Public whipping of Akamai and Rackspace seems excessive;"If the stock market is to be believed, cloud computing – the use of shared computing resources via the internet, rather than local hardware and software – is in trouble.Last week Akamai, which helps clients deliver content and services over the web, reported a quarter in which revenues grew 17 per cent from the year before; operating profits grew even faster. High-flying results, but expectations were higher still. The stock fell 15 per cent. On Tuesday evening Rackspace, which hosts clients’ websites and software applications, reported sales and profit up by a quarter. The market was not impressed. Rackspace’s “public cloud” business – whose customers pay as they go for usage of a shared data centre, as opposed to renting dedicated equipment – grew a mere 50 per cent, decelerating from the previous quarter. The stock lost a fifth of its value.The fundamentals have changed little, however. Both companies deploy a lot of computers to make internet services work better. This is capital intensive. Akamai’s capital expenditures amounted to 12 per cent of sales in 2012; at Rackspace the figure was more than 20 per cent. But as the companies grow, returns on that capital are ticking up. Free cash flow is rising fast. And the rates of sales growth, while they decelerated slightly in the recent quarter, are still robust.The perceived value of high-growth companies is very sensitive to even a small downward shift in growth expectations. The public whipping of Akamai and Rackspace seems excessive, though, especially considering that both have bounced back from single-quarter disappointments before. This is especially true of Akamai, which trades at just 18 times forward earnings (Rackspace’s multiple is still about 50 times). If you believed in either company before the results, you should believe still.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
12;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2013-02-07T22:12:32Z;Earnings disappointments leave Wall St lower;;Shares in Akamai Technologies tumbled after the leading cloud platform’s quarterly revenues and forecast missed analysts’ estimates. The company’s stock fell 15.2 per cent lower to $35.26.Analysts at Piper Jaffray, while disappointed with the earnings, remained confident in the company’s longer-term potential for improving growth and found a silver lining in the sharp drop in the shares.“Historically, a significant move lower in Akamai shares following a disappointing quarter or guide has proven to be a buying opportunity as investor confidence returns within one to two quarters.”Overall, US equities moved sharply lower, dropping below 1,500 mark but pared some of the losses as investors digested a batch of corporate earnings and economic data.Weekly jobless claims fell and the longer four-week moving average moved to a near five-year low, although analysts were expecting slightly sharper falls.Other data showed a sharp drop in productivity in the fourth quarter due to weak economic activity.The S&P 500 index finished 0.2 per cent to 1,509.39. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.1 per cent to 3,165.13 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3 per cent to 13,944.05.“The markets moved lower because the jobless claims were not great, just like the rest of recent economic data,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, an investment management group.“At current levels, the S&P 500 is very high, so day-to-day volatility is natural – but we believe it still has the potential to reach record levels in the first half of the year,” he added.LinkedIn shares, which finsihed the day lower, jumped in the extended hours trading, after fourth-quarter earnings beat estimates by a wide margin. The professional social network’s revenues rose 81 per cent after its membership swelled. Shares were 8.1 per cent higher to $134.50 in after-hours trading.KKR reported a 22 per cent rise in profits in the fourth quarter and registered its most profitable year since going public.However, shares closed 0.3 per cent lower to $17.72, possibly because the earnings results were already priced in. The share price in the group had risen to its highest level in 18 months, gaining more than 50 per cent in the past six months.Shares in Lazard, an independent investment bank, rose after quarterly earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations.Revenues from advising on mergers at the world’s largest independent investment bank jumped 40 per cent in the final three quarters of last year, as global volumes for M&A activity reached the highest levels since 2008. Lazard shares rose 2.4 per cent to $37.55.Shares in Sprint Nextel fell after the mobile telecoms operator disappointed investors with lower-than-expected fourth-quarter results.The company reported a net loss of $1.32bn, mainly reflecting the continuing costs of shutting down the costly Nextel network. The stock fell 0.5 per cent to $5.74.Shares in Apple dipped in and out of negative territory for the most of the trading session after the news that David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital has sued the iPhone maker over proposed changes to its corporate charter. The fund had been putting pressure on Apple to return more cash to its shareholders.Apple issued a statement in the last half-hour of trading session, saying it will return $45bn to shareholders over three years. Shares jumped and closed 3 per cent higher at $468.25 on the news. The jump in the company, which is the heaviest weighted in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 3 and 15 points to the indices respectively.O’Reilly Automotive was the best performer on the S&P 500 index, rallying 8 per cent to $100.04. The after-market auto parts retailer reported record quarterly revenues and earnings on Wednesday, after the market close, beating consensus estimates.
13;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2012-10-15T05:46:32Z;Skydiver sets speed and YouTube record;;Remarkable footage of a man free-falling from the edge of space has set new records, not just for daredevil stunts but for live online viewing, as more than 8m people watched the Red Bull Stratos stunt on YouTube.Felix Baumgartner, 43, became the first skydiver to break the speed of sound as he jumped from an altitude of 128,100 feet above New Mexico on Sunday, falling at an estimated 833.9 miles an hour (Mach 1.24) during his 10-minute descent.“On the step, I felt that the whole world is watching,” Mr Baumgartner said after the event. “I said I wish they would see what I see. It was amazing.”The giant leap highlights the opportunity for the internet to attract substantial audiences for live events, traditionally television broadcasters’ most lucrative asset.Millions of viewers were able to see what Mr Baumgartner saw through a carefully choreographed set of cameras positioned on the capsule from which he leapt.While Mr Baumgartner’s statistics are yet to be verified by the relevant authorities, the stunt is already expected to mark a new high for live internet broadcasting.Google-owned YouTube confirmed that Red Bull’s video feed of Mr Baumgartner’s slow ascent and rapid return to earth topped 8m concurrent live streams, the largest number in the site’s history.That beats what is believed to be the previous high, when 7m online viewers simultaneously watched President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009, according to Akamai, a digital content provider.In comparison, the BBC’s sports website received 8.3m visitors from round the world on the first Sunday of this summer’s Olympic Games, the site’s busiest day ever.YouTube said that total viewing figures for other recent media spectaculars, such as the London Olympics and last year’s royal wedding would have come close to Stratos’ total reach, but were “not close” in terms of the number of people watching the skydive simultaneously.As well as the exposure for Red Bull’s energy drink, YouTube viewers were shown a “pre-roll” advertisement for Chrysler, the carmaker, according to media industry blog Adland.tv.The stunt was also broadcast on traditional television, including on the Discovery Channel in the US and more than 40 other networks across 50 countries. A documentary about the stunt, two years in the making, is set to air later this year.YouTube – the largest video website by some distance – still has some way to go before it can attract a live audience to match TV blockbusters such as the Super Bowl. Some 111m people watched February’s American football game, setting a TV ratings record in the US.Although print media has seen its audiences and advertising income plunge since the emergence of the internet, television has remained relatively resilient.As people round the world turned to their computers and mobile devices to watch Mr Baumgartner’s death-defying feat, they also flocked to social media sites.Red Bull had used Facebook and Twitter to stoke anticipation about the event in recent weeks, sharing photos of the Austrian skydiver’s preparation and a computer-generated simulation of the leap. More than 366m people have viewed videos on Red Bull’s YouTube channel.Twitter said that 2m tweets were posted about Mr Baumgartner and a total of 3m about the jump on Sunday. During the final day of the US Democratic party convention in Charlotte last month, 4m tweets were posted.Earlier this month, South Korean pop hit “Gangnam Style” became one of the fastest videos to enter YouTube’s all-time top 10 with 464m views since it was uploaded in July.
14;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2012-02-09T21:57:41Z;Muted share price reaction to foreclosure deal;;US bank stocks saw a mixed reaction, as US regulators announced a deal that could be worth up to $39.5bn to resolve allegations that the largest US mortgage lenders improperly foreclosed on homes.The five biggest lenders will take a $25bn hit on mortgage principal writedowns and interest payments but the majority will come out of existing reserves.This is just a shuffling of losses. There will be almost no impact on bank balance sheets this quarter,” said Richard Staite, US bank analyst at Atlantic Equities. Bank of America, which has $30bn in loan loss provision and an additional $8bn in litigation reserves according to Atlantic Equities research, climbed 0.6 per cent to $8.18, its highest level since August.But JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent to $37.86, despite announcing that it will not require new reserves to cover its share of the settlement. Citigroup was off 1.7 per cent to $33.66 and Wells Fargo fell 0.2 per cent to $30.58.Exposure to legal risk stemming from the housing crisis has weighed heavily on bank share prices.But Tom Burnell at Wells Fargo cautioned that the banks remain open to litigation on mortgage origination and securitisation practices, as well criminal prosecutions by federal and state governments and claims brought by individual homeowners.News that leaders of the main Greek parties had reached a deal on spending cuts broke just before markets opened in New York, but US stocks barely flickered in response.“The market has seen such a big move up, that to break out again we need to see a significant catalyst, which the Greek deal is not,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.The S&P 500 closed up 0.15 per cent to 1,351.95 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up 0.1 per cent to 12,890.46.The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.4 per cent to 2,927.23, as Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, set an all-time high of $496., before falling back to $493.17, still up 3.5 per cent on the day.Reports suggested the company may launch a new iPad model in March, while Canaccord Genuity analysts said Apple shares could climb as high as $665 after its retail checks showed “strong sales trends for the iPhone 4S at all three US carriers and overall strong iPhone sales in international markets”.The S&P 500 is just 12 points short of its post-financial crisis closing high of 1,363 hit last April with Apple at the centre of that recovery.Technology stocks now account for 20 per cent of the benchmark US index’s market capitalisation, an increase of more than 10 per cent since April. The weighting of financials remains a full percentage point lower than last April. Payment processing companies have been one of the few bright spots for financials and Visa climbed 3.8 per cent to $112.42 yesterday, after reporting strong results that suggested new regulations on card payments were not weighing on the company.Visa’s shares are now up 60 per cent since the start of 2011, while those of MasterCard have climbed 77 per cent over the same period.But Donald Fanetti at Citigroup warned that credit card companies are likely to see a seasonal uptick in delinquencies when they publish data on parts of their portfolio next week, which could weigh on the stocks.Shares in PepsiCo fell 3.7 per cent to $64.27, after the company said it would cut 8,700 jobs and said “structural” changes, such as divestitures or joint ventures, would be considered if the North America beverage business does not show improvement in the next 18 months.Shares in Groupon fell 13.7 per cent to $21.75, after the discount coupon website declared a loss in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company.That eradicated gains made in the first two days of February, when Facebook’s IPO filing triggered a rally in social media stocks. It may also have generated profit for short-sellers, who had borrowed and sold more than two-thirds of available Groupon shares ahead of earnings.TripAdvisor fell 14.6 per cent to $28.29, after the online travel-recommendation service missed analyst estimates with its first earnings report since being spun off from Expedia.Lorillard, a cigarette maker, climbed 9.7 per cent to $124.37, after it lifted its dividend 25 cents to $1.55 in strong results. That helped rival Philip Morris climb 2.8 per cent to $80.06.Akamai Technologies surged 10.5 per cent to $38.06. The network server provider reported quarterly sales and profit that topped analyst estimates.Shares in Diamond Foods fell 37 per cent to $23.13 after the company ousted its chief executive and said it would restate its accounts after a probe. That put at risk Diamond’s planned purchase of the Pringles brand from Procter & Gamble, although shares in P&G were up 0.6 per cent to $64.04.Hospital operators sold off as a note from Gary Taylor at Citigroup said inpatient admissions in January fell 1.75 per cent compared to the same month in 2011.Tenet Healthcare fell 4.8 per cent to $5.58 and HCA was off 4 per cent to $27.80.
15;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Anonymous in revenge attack for MegaUpload shutdown;;Anonymous, the amorphous hacktivist collective, has claimed its “largest attack ever” on 10 music industry and government websites in retaliation for Thursday’s shutdown of MegaUpload.An Auckland court has refused bail to New Zealand resident Kim Dotcom, aka Kim Schmitz, and three other individuals alleged to be involved in running MegaUpload and its vast network of file-sharing sites, after the US Department of Justice charged seven people with copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering.Soon after the news broke, sites including the FBI, the US Department of Justice and the White House, as well as Warner Music, Universal Music and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) were knocked offline by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), whereby sites are flooded with more traffic than their servers can handle.UPDATE: In a second wave of attacks on Friday, Anonymous claimed credit for taking out the New Zealand police’s website and movie studio MGM’s online store. The group said it was again targeting the FBI and Department of Justice sites too.Data from Akamai, a content delivery network, showed global internet traffic spiked up to 24 per cent higher than normal during Thursday night’s DDoS wave.With no small amount of glee, Anonymous claimed responsibility for the attacks from various Twitter accounts and other online statements. One tweet indicated 5,600 people were involved in Thursday’s assaults.“The FBI didn’t think they would get away with this did they? They should have expected us,” Anonymous said in a press release which also posted what it claimed to be the home address and other personal details of Chris Dodd, chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America, and his wife.Anonymous, which has previously targeted Sony and the Church of Scientology among many others’ websites, rose to prominence after a wave of attacks on payment firms and hosting providers who were seen as opponents of WikiLeaks, the whistleblowing site whose free-speech goals the hacktivist group says it shares.The affected sites came back online after a time but, if Anonymous is to be believed, so too has MegaUpload, with several IP addresses being passed around Twitter supposedly leading to the revived site.However, such links should be handled with care. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, has warned of a new tactic by Anonymous which appears to have helped to scale up its attacks.“In the past, Anonymous has encouraged supporters to install a program called LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) which allows computers to join in an attack on a particular website, blasting it with unwanted traffic.“This time, things are slightly different: you only have to click on a web link to launch a DDoS attack… If you visit the webpage, and do not have JavaScript disabled, you will instantly, without user interaction, begin to flood a website of Anonymous’s choice with unwanted traffic, helping to perpetuate a DDoS attack.”This method may have encouraged many people to unwittingly participate in the attacks or give Anonymous activists an “I didn’t know what I was clicking” excuse.The attacks immediately prompted awkward parallels with Wednesday’s voluntary blackout of Wikipedia and other popular websites in protest at two proposed US anti-piracy laws, SOPA and PIPA.John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a leading campaigner against SOPA, tweeted: “Dear Anonymous… I don’t want to sound like your Uncle Gandhi, but DDoS is its own form of censorship. Chill, please.”Some commentators have speculated that the timing of the MegaUpload raid was no coincidence – either because of the blows to SOPA and PIPA from Wikipedia and Google’s online lobbying, or as a deliberate attempt to provoke Anonymous into action, perhaps paving the way for further arrests. Several alleged Anonymous members have already been charged with hacking offences around the world in recent months.Cary Sherman, chief executive of the music-industry body RIAA, was quick to welcome the arrests from people allegedly connected with MegaUpload, which the Justice Department’s indictment said had its main data centre in Virginia.“We are deeply grateful to the Justice Department professionals who worked tirelessly on this case for two years,” Mr Sherman said in a statement. “The government has many tools at its disposal, including criminal prosecution. But if this service were hosted and operated, for example, in a foreign country, our government would be essentially powerless to do anything about it. That needs to change.”
16;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2012-01-09T21:55:26Z;Google slips on fear of move into mobile;;Google shares slid as investors considered the internet group’s possible move into the manufacture of mobile phone handsets.Its shares fell 4.2 per cent to $622.94 after Motorola Mobility, the mobile phone company that Google has agreed to purchase for $12.5bn, said on Friday that fourth-quarter results would come in significantly below expectations because of increased competition.“We believe the Motorola Mobility pre-announcement could serve as a reminder of the operational challenges for Google to enter the hardware space,” said Doug Anmuth at Morgan Stanley, predicting a “slower growth, lower margin Google once the deal closes”.US stocks climbed ahead of the quarterly earnings season, which kicked off as aluminium producer Alcoa reported an estimated loss of 3 cents a share from continuing operations after the close.Alcoa shares had climbed 3 per cent to $9.42, recovering from weakness last week, while there had been strong call buying, in anticipation of a share price bounce off results. Many analysts had predicted a loss and shares held steady at $9.43 in after-hours trading.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,277.83, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent to 12,392.69.Although Google’s woes weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, the tech-heavy index eked out a 0.1 per cent gain to close at 2,676.56. Its other heavily weighted stock, Apple, hit a high of $427.75 in the morning session, before closing at $421.73, off 0.2 per cent.The S&P 500 has recorded gains on all but one trading day in 2012 but much of the legwork has been done by a concentration of industrial, material and financial stocks, making some analysts wary.“While the S&P 500 closed up 1.6 per cent last week, the percentage of industry groups in up trends actually contracted [from 56 per cent to 52 per cent],” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird. “Absent of a significant broadening in rally participation, the ability of the major indexes to move significantly higher is likely to be limited.”Netflix climbed 13.8 per cent to $98.18 as it launched its UK and Ireland video web streaming service.The stock, which bombed last year as its US service lost subscribers, is enjoying a mini-renaissance, now up almost $30 since the start of 2012, when the company said customers had streamed more than 2bn hours of content in the quarter to the end of December.Shares in Inhibitex climbed 141.1 per cent to $23.70 after Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to buy the pharmaceutical group for its hepatitis C medicines. That drove up shares in other treatment developers as Idenix Pharmaceuticals surged 37 per cent to $9.66.Bristol-Myers Squibb was off 0.9 per cent to $33.91.CareFusion fell 8.6 per cent to $23.28 after the medical device manufacturer lowered the bottom end of its full-year earnings forecast to $1.75 from $1.80.Rival St Jude Medical rose 3.2 per cent to $35.70 after it said it still expected to meet fourth-quarter and full-year guidance.Regions Financial rose 2.7 per cent to $4.53 on reports that the regional bank, which is yet to repay all Tarp funds borrowed from the Treasury, may offload its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, which could fetch up to $1bn.Financials were generally stronger with Bank of America climbing 1.5 per cent to $6.27, despite reports it would sack a fifth of its Asia managing directors.Health insurer AFLAC fell 2.3 per cent to $43.23 as UBS analysts warned “its outsized exposure to debt issued by European financials” makes it particularly vulnerable to a European slowdown.Exchanges continued to show weakness after JPMorgan analysts warned on Friday that earnings estimates may be over optimistic. The CME Group fell 2.5 per cent to $228.24 and IntercontinentalExchange was off 2.1 per cent to $112.58.Ralph Lauren climbed 4 per cent to $146.36 as Goldman Sachs analysts tipped the luxury brand to be one of the “secular winners with strong tailwinds of sales and margin expansion” in 2012.Video game retailer Gamestop fell 3.5 per cent to $23.99 as same store sales in the holiday period came in 0.3 per cent lower than in 2010.Tech stock Zynga fell 9.2 per cent to $8.00, $2 below its December IPO price. That might be bad news for investors in Morgan Stanley’s mutual funds as filings revealed that the investment bank owns 16 per cent of the group’s publicly available stock.
17;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-12-23T21:42:49Z;NYSE falls behind as S&P 500 solidifies gains;;Tech stocks sat out a good week for equities, as an earnings miss by Oracle led to a sell off in the software sector on Wednesday.Oracle ended the week down 10.8 per cent to $26.06 after revenues rose just 2 per cent to $8.8bn in the three months to the end of November compared with the 7 per cent growth that had been forecast, as corporate customers delayed purchases.“Management noted that IT budgets were not reduced, rather the sales cycle increased as additional levels of approval were required, which is typical of a macro slowdown,” said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund.“Cloud” software company Red Hat, which had lowered 2012 guidance earlier in the week, fell 12.7 per cent to $41.59 and Salesforce.com, a fast-growing software company, whose contract growth has slowed markedly in the past month, fell 8.4 per cent to $98.02.That meant the Nasdaq ended the week up just 2 per cent to 2,618.64, underperforming other US indices, and still in negative territory for the year.The S&P 500 climbed 3.7 per cent over the week to 1,265.31, putting the benchmark index into the red for December, historically a good month for equities, and, more importantly, just into positive territory for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.6 per cent to 12,294.00. That left the large-cap index up more than 6 per cent for the year, but analysts were quick to stamp on suggestions that meant US equities had enjoyed a good year.Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, pointed out that just two stocks – IBM and McDonald’s – had accounted for half of the Dow’s gains this year.“That’s a function of the way the DJIA is constructed – weighted by stock price rather than market cap – as well as the strong performance of these two stocks,” Mr Colas commented.The Dow has also been helped by the small number of financials in the index, and the low stock prices of the banks that are in the index. Bank of America has traded in a range of $4.92 to $15.31 this year and JPMorgan $27.85 to $48.36, meaning they do not move the price-weighted index significantly.On Friday, for example, BofA shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $5.60 for the best performance in the Dow, but that did not even shift the index 1 point, whereas a gain of just 1.5 per cent to $184.75 for IBM shifted the index more than 20 points.The Nasdaq and S&P 500, both market capitalisation-weighted indices, both lag the Dow by more than 5 per cent in the year to date.Shares in NYSE Euronext lagged behind the market up just 0.6 per cent to $26.38, despite receiving approval from US regulators for its proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Börse.Analysts at Raymond James said the deal was still likely to be blocked, as European regulators remain concerned about competition within the exchange space. Raymond James cut its 12-month price target for the exchange to $36 from $42, based on a 33 per cent probability the merger will go ahead.Akamai Technologies was a rare bright spot among tech stocks, climbing 19.8 per cent to $31.93 as investors in the internet services company applauded its $268m purchase of Contendo, a “cloud” services company.“This is a very positive move,” said Michael Turits, a tech analyst at Raymond James. “Akamai are doubling down on the cloud side of their business, which has seen faster growth and has higher margins than their core video acceleration business.”First Solar climbed 8.7 per cent to $34.70. lnvestors picked up shares in the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer by market capitalisation after Robert W Baird analysts said it could be subject to a takeover bid, after its valuation tumbled 75 per cent over the year.Takeover speculation was fuelled late in the week when Total boosted its stake in SunPower, a smaller panel maker, to 66 per cent. SunPower shares climbed 17 per cent to $6.00.TripAdvisor fell 13.3 per cent to $25.15, in its first three days of trading on the Nasdaq, after it was spun out from its parent, the travel booking website Expedia.Investors had shown strong interest in the travel review website as it traded in a “when-issued” market for two weeks before its formal listing, once Expedia shareholders had approved the spin off. But several analysts offered negative opinions once the stock was trading.A Morgan Stanley recommendation to sell the stock on Thursday, which citied expected margin compression and greater competition from online search engines, led to a 10 per cent fall.Mead Johnson Nutrition slumped 10.5 per cent over the week to $65.29, as it battled negative publicity after a newborn baby died in Missouri after being given one of its powdered products.Both Walmart, where the Mead product was bought, and Supervalu, the operator of Jewel-Osco supermarkets, pulled the Enfamil powdered baby food formula from their shelves, citing an “abundance of caution,” as investigations continued as to the cause of death.The CBOE Vix index of equity volatility continued to fall. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” has now dropped more than 25 per cent over the month and is trading at 20.88, meaning the price of options on the S&P 500 have tumbled during December.
18;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-12-22T21:46:00Z;Akamai shares jump on ‘cloud’ purchase;Semiconductor stocks surge;Semiconductor stocks surged on Thursday after Wedbush Securities called a bottom in the market for computer memory chips.The spot price of DRam memory has slumped this year, as demand for hard drive computers tumbled amid competition from tablets and hard disk drive free ultrabooks.But Betsy Van Hees, Wedbush’s semiconductor analyst, said the price will rise in 2012, as she recommended investors buy Micron Technology, the leading US DRam manufacturer.“We think with the DRam market at a trough [and with Micron] trading at 0.7 times tangible book value, that the risk/reward here is compelling,” Ms Van Hees wrote to clients.Micron shares climbed 15.9 per cent to $6.42, giving momentum to other semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices, closed up 7.3 per cent to $5.45 and Altera Corp gained 6.4 per cent to $37.98. The Philadelphia Sox index of semiconductor stocks climbed 3.5 per cent.The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 per cent to 1,254 for its third straight day of gains, as investors shrugged off a downward revision to third-quarter growth, and focused instead on another fall in jobless claims to new year lows.Banks did much of the work, as sentiment continued to firm after Tuesday’s bumper take up of European Central Bank long-term loans by eurozone banks.Citigroup climbed 5.9 per cent to $27.65 and Morgan Stanley was up 6.5 per cent to $15.88 as the financial sector climbed 2.1 per cent, twice the gain of any other sector. Goldman Sachs ended the day 2.6 per cent higher to $94.42, although reports that its debt had been downgraded by Standard & Poor’s, soon denied by the rating agency, had knocked a percentage point off its valuation in the mid-afternoon.The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 0.5 per cent to 12,1169.65, ExxonMobil climbed for the second day running. The oil major finished 1.4 per cent higher $84.29 as US crude oil nudged $100 a barrel. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.9 per cent at 2,599.45.Akamai Technologies rose 18.6 per cent to $31.63 as investors in the internet services company applauded its $268m purchase of Contendo, a “cloud” services company.“This is a very positive move,” said Michael Turits, a tech analyst at Raymond James. “Akamai are doubling down on the cloud side of their business, which has seen faster growth and has higher margins than their core video acceleration business.”Mead Johnson Nutrition fell 10.1 per cent to $68.76 after Walmart withdrew the company’s Enfamil Newborn powder from its 3,000 stores. A baby who had been fed the formula had died from what preliminary tests indicate was a rare bacterial infection.The government has not ordered a recall of the product and Mead said its records showed the lot tested negative for the bacterium before it was shipped. Walmart spokeswoman Dianna Gee said the company decided to pull the lot “out of an abundance of caution” while health officials investigate. Walmart slid down 0.3 per cent to $59.19.Bed Bath & Beyond, fell 6.3 per cent to $57.58. The home furnishings retailer beat earnings per share estimates on third-quarter sales of $2.34bn, which came in as expected, but margin growth ground to a halt at 40.9 per cent for the quarter.The company has been one of the star performers in the S&P 500 so far this year, as it consistently increased operating margin for several quarters.“These results suggest that the magnitude of earnings per share upside may slow in future quarters,” said Gary Balter at Credit Suisse.TripAdvisor tumbled 11.3 per cent to $24.53 on its second full day of trading on the Nasdaq.Morgan Stanley analysts recommended investors sell shares in the travel review website, while Barclays Capital gave it a lukewarm “hold” rating.TripAdvisor was spun-off by parent Expedia, the travel booking website, and initially debuted with a higher market valuation. However, Expedia climbed 4.5 per cent to $29.15, with investors appearing to favour the standalone transactions business for now.First Solar, the world’s largest solar panel manufacturer, whose market cap has slumped by more than 70 per cent this year, was up 7.4 per cent to $34.15 as analysts said it could make an attractive bid target at its current valuation.Robert W Baird’s renewables team told clients that General Electric or Siemens AG might consider an approach for the company to increase their exposure to the $55bn solar power industry.American Greetings sank 21.1 per cent to $13.39 after third-quarter profit at the cardmaker fell nearly 40 per cent compared to last year.Chief Executive Zev Weiss said not all of the spending increases would be permanent, telling analysts, “some of that is one time,” but conceded spending would weigh on margin in 2012.The CBOE Vix index of volatility continued to tumble, approaching 20 for the first time since July, before settling at 21.30.
19;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-10-13T20:56:32Z;JPMorgan pulls banks on Wall Street lower;;Bank stocks fell Thursday after JPMorgan kicked off the sector’s quarterly results season.Earnings per share of $1.02 were flat for the year but a full 10 cents higher than the average forecast of analysts polled by Bloomberg. But the figures were flattered by a $1.9bn debt valuation adjustment, which saw the company benchmark its own debt to a lower market valuation.“Excluding the various ‘one offs’, we think the numbers are about in line,” Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, wrote to clients. Mr Staite had forecast earnings per share to be as low as 77 cents.JPMorgan fell 4.8 per cent to $31.60, Bank of America was down 5.5 per cent to $6.22, and Citigroup was off 5.3 per cent to $27.64.JPMorgan’s investment banking division reported net income of $1.6bn, down from $2bn in the second quarter of 2011.But investment bank stocks did not suffer as much as the universal banks. Morgan Stanley was down 4.4 per cent to $15.14, while Goldman Sachs, fell 3 per cent to $96.15.JPMorgan set aside 15 cents a share for litigation costs in a sign that various mortgage-related cases pending against the big US banks may impact on the sector’s earnings.The bank only released $96m of loan loss reserves, down from $1.3bn in the second quarter, suggesting it is cautious about the outlook for credit quality.Safeway, the supermarket chain, was down 0.2 per cent to $17.93, reversing strong early gains, after quarterly earnings rose to 38 cents a share, from 33 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Sales rose from $9.4bn to $10.06bn.The S&P 500 reversed early losses to close down just 0.3 per cent at 1,203.85. The financial sector of the benchmark index was down 2.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which briefly moved into positive territory for the year on Wednesday afternoon, fell 0.4 per cent to 11,478.13.The Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,620.24, helped by a strong performance by semiconductor stocks.Fairchild Semiconductor, the first company in the sector to report results, was up 10.2 per cent to $13.49. That was a dramatic reversal after the stock fell 7 per cent in the first minutes of trading after reporting third quarter sales of $403.2m, a fall of 7 per cent from the previous quarter, while margins were also squeezed.“Investors always want to buy the last estimate cut,” said Bobby Burleson, semiconductor analyst at Canaccord Genuity, “and Fairchild is calling a bottom in demand.”The group reduced fourth-quarter revenue guidance by 11 per cent to between $350m and $370m, but forecast a turnround in 2012.That helped push Nvidia Corp up 5.8 per cent to $15.46, while SanDisk rose 3.3 per cent to $45.93 and Micron Technology was up 6.2 per cent to $5.52.But JPMorgan analysts suggested demand for D-Ram memory, a big product for many semiconductor firms, would continue to fall.“Given the PC industry’s shift from high-performance-oriented devices to adequate specification and low-cost products, we believe D-Ram content growth will decelerate further,” JJ Park told clients.A closely watched industry survey by Gartner found worldwide PC shipments rose only 3 per cent in the third quarter, 2 per cent less than Gartner had previously forecast.Akamai Technology, an internet service provider, was up 4.8 per cent to $24.49 on reports that Google might launch a bid for the company.Google, which was set to report results after the market closed, was up 1.9 per cent to $558.99.Yahoo was up 1 per cent to $15.93 on reported acquisition interest from the private equity arms of Blackstone and KKR.Insurers suffered as Citibank analyst Colin Devine said life assurers may be designated systemically important financial institutions, requiring them to hold more capital.Lincoln National Corporation fell 3.8 per cent to $16.70 and Genworth Financial fell 5.6 per cent to $5.56.Asset managers had another tough session, after Legg Mason revealed assets under management fell 5 per cent during September to $611.8bn as a result of investor redemptions and falling asset prices.Legg Mason was down 4.7 per cent to $25.62, and Blackstone Group fell 5.4 per cent to $13.55.Sprint Nextel was up 8.2 per cent to $2.78. Citigroup analysts said the third-largest US mobile network could “raise additional funds, even at the current implied yields for bonds”, which rose above 11 per cent on Friday. The company needs to fund $10bn of capital expenditure.Apple was up 1.6 per cent to $408.43, after Sprint and Verizon stopped taking pre-orders for the new iPhone because of strong demand.
20;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-07-26T23:01:16Z;Ofcom warns on broadband speed advert claims;;The internet speeds promised by broadband providers are diverging further from the reality that their services deliver to the average customer, according to a study by Ofcom.The media and communications regulator found that although the average UK broadband speed increased by 10 per cent to 6.8 megabits per second between December 2010 and May 2011, the gap between advertised and actual speeds widened. It said average speeds were 8.2 Mbps lower than the 15 Mbps average maximum advertised during the period, compared with 7.6 Mbps lower six months earlier.Consumer Focus, the consumer advocacy group, said the trend was “worrying”.“This is something which will doubtless be causing frustration for customers up and down the country,” said Adam Scorer, Consumer Focus’s director of external affairs.The findings come ahead of the publication of new rules by the Committee of Advertising Practice governing how broadband providers can market theoretical maximum speeds.Many in the broadband industry had expected the CAP to release its recommendations last month.The Advertising Standards Authority, which will enforce them, told the Financial Times on Tuesday that they would appear in the early autumn, explaining that the subject was “highly technical”.“Ofcom continues to urge the CAP and BCAP [broadcast] committees to make changes to their advertising guidance so that consumers are able to make more informed decisions based on the adverts they see,” said Ed Richards, Ofcom chief executive.The ASA said: “CAP and BCAP are committed to ensuring advertising is trusted and consumers are not misled which is why they publicly consulted on new advertising guidance on the use of ‘up to’ broadband speed and ‘unlimited’ usage claims in telecommunications advertising.”Several of Britain’s largest broadband providers have been reprimanded by the ASA for misleading consumers about broadband speeds in their marketing.Last month, the ASA banned a Virgin Media advertisement after BT and British Sky Broadcasting complained that Virgin had exaggerated the extent to which its broadband speeds were faster than its rivals.An ASA spokesman said the group hoped the new rules would lead to fewer complaints by rivals against others’ ad campaigns.“It’s important this guidance is right so we can move away from this tit-for-tat approach,” the ASA said.Jon James, executive director of broadband at Virgin Media, said: “We remain concerned that people paying for fast broadband are being misled and it is absolutely essential that consumers have all the information they need to make an informed choice.”A separate study by Akamai, a web content delivery network, ranked Britain 23rd in the world for average broadband speeds.It estimated UK speeds at 4.6 Mbps in the first quarter of 2011. South Korea was found to have the highest average connection speed at 14.4 Mbps.

As part of her plea bargain, the US government had agreed a sentencing range of 37 to 46 months, at the discretion of the judge.“The message to Wall Street needs to be loud and clear: If you trade on inside information, you will be caught; if convicted, you will be sentenced to prison,” said Richard Holwell, the federal judge who pronounced the sentence.Ms Chiesi, who wore a pale pink sleeveless silk dress and a pearl necklace, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service.“It won’t happen again,” she told the judge just before being sentenced. Her lawyers had asked the judge for leniency, saying that Ms Chiesi was manipulated by Mark Kurland, her former boss and lover, who was the first defendant sentenced in the case.Mr Rajaratnam was convicted in May and faces a September 27 sentencing, also by Judge Holwell.Prosecutors called Ms Chiesi the “consummate Wall Street insider”. They said she would use her charm and physical appeal to talk up powerful sources, getting inside tips about corporate activity that she would then pass on.In a statement as part of her plea bargain in January, Ms Chiesi told the judge she was “deeply ashamed” and apologised to the many people she said she had hurt, including her family. She said she did not personally profit from the trades.Prosecutors said Ms Chiesi had made $4m from illegal trades involving technology companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Akamai Technologies and IBM."
22;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-07-11T11:56:46Z;Business awards: Be in it, to win it;A selection of some of the popular business awards around the world;"Competitions and awards serve many purposes, both for those making the award and the lucky recipients. Certain prizes are highly prized in some business circles as a form of validation. Others open doors into valuable networks. Here is a selection of some of the more popular business awards schemes around the world.● MIT $100K The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT $100K entrepreneurship competition (previously called the MIT $50K) is seen as a key validation procedure for start-ups at the US university, and has been the launch pad for several fast growing companies. Winning the competition is not, however, the important thing. Akamai Technologies failed to make the final round in the year it entered but went on to become one of the leading players in the US technology industry.● America Competes Business prizes are likely to become more common in the US after Congress updated the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (‘Competes’) Act for government backed competitions. President Obama used an update to the legislation last year to call upon all government departments to run competitions to encourage innovative breakthroughs in science and technology. The White House has predicted that up to 15 competitions could be run for healthcare IT improvements each year, for example. Government departments can post their competitions on a single website, www.challenge.gov, to solicit commercial ideas.● Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year This competition is one of the biggest prizes for business owners. In 25 years of the award, there have been more than 8,000 winners of individual prizes in the 50 countries where the scheme runs. Previous winners include: John Mackey, co-founder of Whole Foods Market, the world’s largest organic food retailer; Michael Spencer, founder of Icap, the interdealer broker; and Ratan Tata, chairman of the conglomerate Tata Group. These alumni benefit from advice and support through Ernst & Young offices around the world.● Seedcamp Incubator programmes are hothouses for early-stage ventures. Although not technically award programmes, they often involve some form of competition between the entrants with the promise of a seed investment in the best teams. Y Combinator, which has worked with more than 300 start-ups in the last six years, pioneered the concept for Silicon Valley companies. Companies accepted on the programme spend three months in the US tech cluster and each get $18,000 of seed investment. In Europe, the nearest equivalent is Seedcamp. It also runs Mini Seedcamp events in European capitals, and in New York, partly to help support its main event each September in London."

Testimony revealed that traders and others were able to exploit friendships to reach into executive suites and boardrooms to gain access to secret information.“Every reputable company and advisory entity, including investment banks and McKinsey, has got to be horrified by this,” says J. Robert Brown Jr, a securities law professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law.Prosecutors depicted a network of insiders that included a number of senior company managers, a Wall Street banker and some board members.Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund trader who pleaded guilty in the case, allegedly received information about Advanced Micro Devices from Hector Ruiz, then the chipmaker’s chief executive. Mr Ruiz has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.Ms Chiesi also allegedly obtained information about AMD’s sale of its chip manufacturing business from Robert Moffat, a senior IBM executive. Mr Moffat pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months in prison. She had another source at Akamai Technologies, who has not been charged in the case. On calls they bragged about their access to corporate insiders.In one recorded call, Mr Rajaratnam said to Ms Chiesi that he “must defer to you on IBM”.“And Akamai too,” Ms Chiesi responded.“But [with] AMD, bring it on, baby,” Mr Rajaratnam said.Mr Rajaratnam’s ties reached into board rooms. Rajat Gupta, former global head of McKinsey, allegedly called Mr Rajaratnam within moments of two Goldman Sachs board meetings when he served as a director of the bank. One call took place 23 seconds after the meeting ended.Mr Gupta has been charged with civil violations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and denied any wrongdoing. Prosecutors have called him a co-conspirator.Anil Kumar, a former senior partner at McKinsey, testified that since 2006, he breached the confidentiality rules of McKinsey, a business that prides itself on its exclusivity, and shared secrets about his clients with Mr Rajaratnam. Mr Kumar has pleaded guilty to insider trading.Rajiv Goel, an employee at Intel’s treasury department, testified that he sought earnings information from a contact in investor relations for Mr Rajaratnam in April 2007 and also provided regular updates about investment plans by Intel Capital, an arm of the chipmaker.Mr Goel also testified that Mr Rajaratnam bought shares of @Road for him after learning from the company’s chief executive that it would be acquired. Krish Panu, who later joined Galleon, was chief executive of @Road at the time. Mr Goel has pleaded guilty to insider trading.The trial revealed holes at Moody’s Investor Service, the credit rating agency, where Deep Shah, a junior analyst allegedly tipped Roomy Khan, a former Intel executive and stock trader.Ms Khan then tipped Mr Rajaratnam who bought stock. Mr Shah has been charged with insider trading but remains a fugitive. Ms Khan has pleaded guilty.During the trial, jurors heard how Galleon insiders sought to add to their network and deepen their connections to corporations. Mr Rajaratnam was recorded speaking with his brother Rengan about recruiting another McKinsey partner.Adam Smith, a former Galleon portfolio manager who pleaded guilty to insider trading, testified that he recruited an Intel employee for inside information. He eventually cut ties with the Intel insider because his sources dried up.Mr Smith also testified that he had a number of contacts in Taiwan at technology companies who gave him information and links to a Morgan Stanley investment banker who provided him with information about three corporate takeovers.

25;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-05-03T13:12:24Z;Bin Laden death sees Twitter traffic soar;;Activity on Twitter hit its highest point in the communication site’s five-year history as news emerged of the death of Osama bin Laden on Sunday night.However, the spike in overall online news consumption fell short of last week’s royal wedding and the football World Cup in South Africa, according to Akamai, which manages internet traffic.Twitter said that at 11pm eastern time on May 1, shortly before President Barack Obama began his address confirming the events in Pakistan, users’ 140-character posts peaked at 5,106 per second. At 11.45pm, when the president had finished speaking, there were 5,008 tweets per second.“Last night saw the highest sustained rate of Tweets ever,” Twitter said, averaging 3,440 per second between 10.45pm and 12.30am. The site has around 200m registered users posting an average of 140m tweets per day, with 70 per cent of its traffic coming from outside the US.Previous Twitter highs have been seen around major sports events and the Japanese earthquake. This year’s Super Bowl saw a peak of 4,064 tweets per second at the end of the American football match. That beat the previous record achieved during the football World Cup last year, when message volume reached 3,283 per second.“[The] Super Bowl had a sustained spike during halftime, but it was closer to 15 [minutes],” Twitter said, “and [the] Japan earthquake had bigger spikes for more hours, but not for a significant sustained period.”The record for the single greatest intensity of tweets still stands at 6,939 per second, at midnight in Japan on January 1, 2011, although the spike did not last for long.Last week’s royal wedding in London generated around 300 tweets per second as Prince William and Kate Middleton exchanged vows.But even as Twitter lit up with excitement at news of the terrorist’s killing by US special forces, other online news sources failed to top the previous week’s highs.According to Akamai, global traffic to news websites spiked at 4.1m page views per minute shortly before midnight eastern time on May 1, compared with 5.4m during live coverage of the royal wedding and 6m on the first day of the 2010 World Cup. Mr Obama’s election victory generated a peak of 4.3m page views per minute, while the 2010 US midterm elections spiked at 5.7m.The first public indications of the bin Laden attack appeared on Twitter around 10.30pm eastern time, via a combination of professional media, Washington advisers and “citizen journalists” in Abbottabad – around 15 minutes before the news was picked up by TV news networks.Sohaib Athar, an IT consultant who tweets under the name ReallyVirtual, posted about the “rare event” of a helicopter hovering over Abbottabad at 1am local time and reported a “huge window shaking bang” – but did not at the time realise the significance of the events.A few hours later, Keith Urbahn, former chief of staff for former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, is credited with breaking the news of bin Laden’s death. “So I’m told by a reputable person they have killed Osama Bin Laden. Hot damn,” he tweeted.Within 12 hours of the news breaking, reports of bin Laden’s shooting had appeared on around 40,000 news stories and blog posts, according to Sysomos, which provides tools for monitoring social media, and generated an estimated 2.2m tweets.However, as news of bin Laden’s death circulated around social networks, inaccuracies and gossip mingled with the official version of events. A photograph purporting to show the face of the dead bin Laden turned out to be a fake dating back to 2009, but not before it had been published by several major newspaper websites.In the past, Twitter has “also [been] first with deaths of many people who didn’t die”, noted Dan Gillmor, director of the Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at Arizona State University’s journalism school. Baseless rumours of the untimely demises of celebrities including actors Jeff Goldblum and Harrison Ford have spread quickly across the network in recent years.
26;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Galleon jury begins deliberations;;The jury hearing the insider trading case against hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, founder of Galleon Group, concluded its first day of deliberations without reaching a verdict.The jury of nine women and three men, a mix of school teachers and city workers, is tasked with deciding whether prosecutors proved Mr Rajaratnam traded based on secret information he obtained from corporate insiders and Wall Street associates.Mr Rajaratnam has been charged with five counts of conspiracy and nine counts of insider trading in stocks including Intel, Akamai and PeopleSupport. If convicted, he faces more than 15 years in prison. The jury began deliberations at midday following a seven-week trial. During the afternoon, jurors asked for defence exhibits related to trading in Clearwire stock.Prosecutors allege Mr Rajaratnam traded Clearwire shares after learning from Rajiv Goel, an Intel insider, that the chipmaker planned to invest $1bn in the wireless broadband company’s venture with Sprint Nextel.Three counts of the indictment – one conspiracy charge and two trading charges – relate to Clearwire.Defence lawyers presented news articles and analyst reports that they say were the basis for Mr Rajaratnam’s trades. The lawyers have maintained that the Clearwire investment was publicly known before it was announced.During the trial, prosecutors from the US attorney’s office in the Southern District of Manhattan called 18 witnesses and played 45 secretly record phone calls to try to prove their case. Prosecutors played several phone calls between Mr Rajaratnam and Mr Goel and Mr Rajaratnam and Rengan Rajaratnam, the defendant’s brother, related to the Clearwire deal.Prosecutors allege Mr Rajaratnam bought over 100,000 shares of Clearwire the first trading day after he learnt from Mr Goel that Intel’s board had approved a $1bn investment in the venture.Earlier Monday, Jonathan Streeter, an assistant US attorney, implored the jury one last time to find Mr Rajaratnam guilty. He said the defence didn’t call any witnesses to counter the allegations or anyone who could provide the reasons behind Mr Rajaratnam’s trades.“The defence has attempted to distract you …divert you from the evidence,” Mr Streeter said.Mr Rajaratnam’s legal team have sought to discredit the government’s witnesses, including three associates of Mr Rajaratnam who pleaded guilty.Aside from the recorded calls the government used to show his “greed and corruption”, the jury didn’t hear from Mr Rajaratnam or learn a lot about him during the trial. He didn’t testify in the case and there was no sign of his wife in the courtroom.A spokesman for Mr Rajaratnam said family members have attended portions of the trial but declined to identify them by name or association.Mr Rajaratnam’s lawyers called one character witness, Geoffrey Canada, the head of the Harlem Children’s Zone, a non-profit educational organisation, who said Mr Rajaratnam was generous. A witness who pleaded guilty also testified that Mr Rajaratnam was a good friend.The jury also heard from a former employee who said Mr Rajaratnam arrived later than most to the Galleon office each morning so he could have breakfast with his daughters.
27;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-04-12T01:21:34Z;Level 3 to acquire Global Crossing;;"Level 3 Communications has agreed to acquire Global Crossing in an all-paper deal for $1.9bn that will significantly expand Level 3’s reach and customer base.Level 3 provides the network backbone for online video streaming services such as Netflix, as well as a wide range of long-haul internet-based communications services for business customers and telecoms companies.The deal, just weeks after AT&T announced its $39bn proposed purchase of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA mobile unit, is a further sign of consolidation in the telecoms industry, which analysts said should lead to significant cost savings for the combined company.“The two most competitive segments within telecom have been wireless and long haul,” said Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse in a note to investors.“We have seen consolidation in wireless; with this deal we are now seeing the benefits of consolidation in long haul. The long-haul market should see more stable pricing as a consequence of this deal, which should lead to higher revenue growth, higher margins and improved returns for the industry.”Level 3’s offer values Global Crossing at $23.04 a share, a premium of 56 per cent to the company’s closing price on Friday.Under the terms of the deal, which has been approved by Singapore Technologies Telemedia – Global Crossing’s largest shareholder with a stake of about 60 per cent – Global Crossing shareholders will receive 16 shares of Level 3 common stock for each share held. Level 3 will also assume $1.1bn of Global Crossing’s debt, bringing the deal’s enterprise value to about $3bn. Once the deal closes, ST Telemedia is to nominate directors to the board, relative to the size of its stake.The combined entity will create a company with revenue of $6.26bn and earnings of $1.57bn, after taking into account projected cost savings, and will help Level 3 expand into Latin America and Europe.ST Telemedia funded the rescue of Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy protection in early 2002. Since then a management team led by John Legere, chief executive, has nursed it back to health.Level 3 has reported quarterly losses for the past two years after many businesses put on hold their plans for online-networking services. However, there have been recent signs of business spending on technology and telecoms services picking up. Similarly, Global Crossing’s quarterly results have been improving, although it reported a net loss of $176m last year on revenues of $2.61bn.Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley advised Level 3 on the deal.Shares of Global Crossing soared 79 per cent to a four-year high while Level 3’s shares were up 12 per cent in early afternoon trading."
28;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-04-08T19:15:56Z;Chiesi steals spotlight in Rajaratnam case;;Heard but hardly seen, Danielle Chiesi, a former hedge fund trader and ex-beauty queen, has stolen the spotlight in the government’s insider trading case against Raj Rajaratnam.Over the past five weeks, jurors listening to the government’s evidence against Mr Rajaratnam have heard dozens of recorded phone conversations between the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund and his male friends and colleagues.Yet the most striking voice is that of Ms Chiesi, a former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader who pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading. Her voice, inflected with a New York accent, has been broadcast into the courtroom, describing trading strategies with Mr Rajaratnam and doling out company secrets, which prosecutors allege she obtained from senior executives at technology groups Advanced Micro Devices and IBM.She does not bother to disguise the names of these companies in the phone calls, which were secretly recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of its probe into Galleon. Prosecutors have relied heavily on the recorded calls in building their case against Mr Rajaratnam, who is accused of reaping $63m in illegal trading profits or averted losses.Ms Chiesi, the only female voice on the calls, is brash and blunt. Before the judge allowed prosecutors to play certain recordings, he edited out what a prosecutor referred to as “blue” language – a show business term for comedians whose acts contain sexually explicit content.Though her voice is familiar, the jury has only had a single glimpse of Ms Chiesi, from a photograph of her that prosecutors have affixed to a board. In the picture her platinum hair is swept into a loose bun with her head tilted to the side. In the calls Ms Chiesi flaunts her contacts in the upper echelons of corporate America. She mentioned “Hector” when discussing Hector Ruiz, the former chief executive of AMD, and Robert Moffat, a senior IBM executive, who she said had visited her mother’s house one Sunday.Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey consultancy director, testified during the trial that Ms Chiesi had “intimate” relationships with Mr Moffat and Mr Ruiz.Mr Moffat has pleaded guilty and Mr Ruiz has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Mr Ruiz, has previously said: “Any suggestion that the relationship was intimate is untrue.”On the recorded calls, Ms Chiesi calls her friends “baby”. On one call she tells Mr Rajaratnam that Akamai, an internet infrastructure group, is “gonna guide down. I just got a call from my guy. I played him like a finely tuned piano”. She begs the Galleon boss to hold off trading so she can make the trade.Prosecutors allege Ms Chiesi was tipped off by Kieran Taylor, a former Akamai marketing executive and friend of the Chiesi family. Mr Taylor has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Mr Rajaratnam made $5m in profits from the sale, while Ms Chiesi made $2.4m in profits. After receiving the tip, she said she felt like a “warrior” and the information grab was a “conquest”.But “Dani”, as she is known, also seems to seek out Mr Rajaratnam’s advice. “I’m a chick in this business with a reputation of knowing AMD and IBM. So what would you tell me to do?” she asks him on one call. Mr Rajaratnam tells her, “I would trade. I mean I would sell 250, buy 250, you know.” Another time she asks him whether she should create a trading pattern in a stock.Mr Rajaratnam also told her to be “radio silent” about IBM and Akamai to avoid any suspicion.Ms Chiesi is scheduled to be sentenced next month. Her lawyer has said she is not co-operating with the government, never traded in her personal account, and was never asked to testify against Mr Rajaratnam.
29;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-04-05T19:54:56Z;Transaction records shown to Galleon jury;;Prosecutors showed records to jurors on Tuesday they hope will prove that Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group founder, placed trade orders for stocks almost immediately after he received phone calls from company insiders and other traders.Prosecutor Reed Brodsky sought to tie phone calls between Mr Rajaratnam and his sources to trades placed on 13 stocks before public announcements. The records are the final piece in the government’s case, which alleges Mr Rajaratnam made more than $45m in illicit profits by trading on inside information.Over the past five weeks, jurors have heard testimony from Mr Rajaratnam’s long-time friends, a former Galleon portfolio manager, and several corporate executives, including Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs’ chief executive.Mr Rajaratnam has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyers, who are expected to present their case next week, may call a professor to testify about trading, but have not identified who else they will call as witnesses.Prosecutors have played audio recordings of phone calls between Mr Rajaratnam and others, but they are asking the jury to draw inferences between records of other phone calls and trades.On Tuesday, the government showed that Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund trader, called Kieran Taylor, a marketing officer at Akamai Technologies, twice on July 24, 2008. That same evening, Mr Rajaratnam called Ms Chiesi at 8:41pm and they spoke for nine minutes.Immediately after hanging up, Ms Chiesi called Mark Kurland, her boss at New Castle Partners. She then called Mr Rajaratnam at 9:14pm and was recorded telling him that Akamai was “gonna guide down” its earnings guidance for 2008. She said she had received a call from “my guy”.The next morning, Mr Rajaratnam began placing short positions, or bets that Akamai stock would drop. Ms Chiesi also began to short the stock.Several days later, when Akamai announced that it had lowered its guidance, the pair sold the stock.Mr Rajaratnam made $5m in profits from the sale, while Ms Chiesi made $2.4m in profits.Prosecutors also sought to show connections between Roomy Khan, a former Galleon trader, and Deep Shah, a junior analyst at Moody’s Investor Service, which related to earlier testimony about alleged insider trading in Hilton Hotels stock.Prosecutors allege that soon after Mr Shah learnt from his supervisor that Blackstone Group was going to acquire Hilton Hotels on July 2, 2007, he called Ms Khan three times. At 3:14pm, Ms Khan bought 550 call options, which is a contract to buy the stock at a certain price at a future date.www.ft.com/galleon
30;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2011-04-04T23:38:06Z;Rajaratnam trial told of alleged Akamai tip-off;;"A former Bear Stearns hedge fund trader told Raj Rajaratnam that Akamai Technologies was going to lower its earnings guidance in July 2008, less than a week before the company announced it publicly, according to a tape recording played on Monday at the insider trading trial of the Galleon hedge fund founder.After receiving the information, prosecutors said, Mr Rajaratnam increased his short position – a bet that the stock would decline – in Akamai stock from 300,000 shares to 875,000 shares by the time of the company’s July 30 announcement.Prosecutors played two recorded phone calls between Danielle Chiesi, the Bear Stearns trader, and Mr Rajaratnam, in which they discussed contacts at several companies and Ms Chiesi’s concerns about trading and being investigated.In a call on July 24 2008, Ms Chiesi alerts him about Akamai.“They’re gonna guide down. I just got a call from my guy. I played him like a finely tuned piano,” Ms Chiesi said.She said they planned to announce the lowered guidance on Wednesday.The following Wednesday, July 30, after the announcement, Mr Rajaratnam called Ms Chiesi and said, “I just wanted to say thank you.”Prosecutors also played recorded calls between Ms Chiesi and Kieran Taylor, a senior marketing officer with Akamai, who prosecutors allege informed her about the lower earnings guidance.In a call later that year, Mr Taylor tells Ms Chiesi he has a “major present” for her in the form of information.“I love you for that,” Ms Chiesi says.Mr Taylor has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Ms Chiesi has pleaded guilty in the case.A lawyer for Mr Rajaratnam countered by showing a Goldman Sachs analyst report and suggested anyone could draw the conclusion that the company would reduce its earnings guidance for 2008 based on the competitive pressures it faced.The government is expected to rest its case against Mr Rajaratnam this week and his lawyer said he anticipates the defence case will last one week. The defence hasn’t said if Mr Rajaratnam will testify.Prosecutors said they would not call Roomy Khan, a witness who has admitted to tipping Mr Rajaratnam with corporate secrets.Instead prosecutors said they will aim to prove she tipped Mr Rajaratnam by showing the jury phone and trading records and instant messages exchanged between them.They are also trying to play a video of Ms Khan faxing Mr Rajaratnam documents. The judge said he will rule on the video on Tuesday.Prosecutors allege Ms Khan received inside information about Google earnings from Shammara Hussain, who worked at investor relations firm Market Street Partners; information about the Hilton Hotels takeover by a private equity firm, from a Moody’s Investors Service analyst and information about Polycom from a senior official at the company. Ms Hussain has not been charged with any wrongdoing."
31;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2010-10-24T16:41:33Z;Jobs unlikely to overstretch Apple cash;;Apple chief executive Steve Jobs’s declaration last week that the technology company wants to hold on to its $51bn in cash and securities because it sees “strategic opportunities” ahead, has provoked speculation about what it might acquire.With one of the largest cash hoards in the world and a business that spans hardware, software and content distribution, the possibilities are wide.Among the most fanciful ideas being batted around by outsiders are takeovers of Facebook, the social network valued in private share sales at more than $30bn, and perhaps Disney, the media group worth $67bn, including a large stake held by Mr Jobs.But either would break Apple’s long-running pattern of investments – it has never paid more than $500m for a target – which risks straying into unfamiliar arenas. Former executives and bankers said they would be shocked if the maker of the iPhone, iPad tablet and Mac computer did anything as far-reaching.“I don’t think they will buy anything big any time soon. It is just not in their genes,” said a former Apple strategist.Instead, ex-employees and analysts noted that Apple has historically bought smaller companies with intellectual property and strong talent in areas of growing importance for the company. Modest deals in the past have resulted in the iPod – which grew out of contracts with software engineer Tony Fadell and outside design firm PortalPlayer – as well as the software behind the popular GarageBand music composition and Final Cut video editing programmes, which appear on its computers.A key emphasis for Apple now is the company’s push into internet-connected television, with its Apple TV streaming media player, relaunched in September. It is a complex, technology-intensive battleground, where Apple faces already established cable operators and well-heeled Silicon Valley competitors, such as Google.Apple last month licensed know-how in the sector from Rovi, a company that propelled the technology provider to a record $5bn market capitalisation. Apple could easily buy the company, or one of its competitors, outright.Other logical extensions of Apple’s clout would be in chip design or manufacturing, where the company has bought in the past, and desktop software and internet services, including advertising and content streaming.With a $14bn market capitalisation, Adobe Systems could be one of the largest software targets to tempt Apple, in part, for defensive reasons. In the smartphone sector, Apple is in a major fight for superiority with devices running on Google’s dominant Android operating system. A key advantage of the latter is they have the ability to display videos based on Adobe’s Flash technology.Mr Jobs has complained that Flash is “buggy” and consumes too much battery life, but he may still want to take charge of the company, improve the software, and optimise it for Apple devices.Adobe also has an enviable presence on Microsoft desktops with its free Reader document display program. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, recently discussed with Adobe possibilities for the companies to work more closely and even mentioned a possible offer, which no doubt prompted Apple to consider contingency plans.More plausible would be a deal to strengthen Apple’s shift toward streaming content for use on all its devices, rather than making consumers download shows or music for use on a particular device.For that purpose, Apple could benefit from a content delivery network with significant infrastructure, such as Akamai, which stores copies of website data at locations around the world to get the material to users faster. Akamai is worth $8.5bn, but it has smaller competitors.Apple has also sought more control over the hardware in its devices, allowing it to differentiate its products, control features and maintain secrecy. It bought Silicon Valley chip start-up PA Semi in 2008 for $278m, which helped it develop the A4 microprocessor used in the iPad, iPhone 4 and iPod Touch.That was based on a chip design by the UK’s Arm Holdings, prompting speculation that Apple could buy that company. It seems unlikely given Arm’s open business model of licensing designs to most of the world’s chipmakers.Private investors and analysts said Nvidia, the $6.4bn market cap Silicon Valley graphics chipmaker, is a more likely target.But there is a chance Apple will do nothing. Mr Jobs has often hinted at future purchases without a major move. Given Apple’s near-death in the 1990s, Mr Jobs “likes having a huge cash cushion”, a former executive said.

Credit Suisse said it estimated that YouTube was nearing profitability.“This colour should help improve sentiment around the sustainability of Google’s long-term growth,” said Spencer Wang, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Google’s shares rose 11.2 per cent to $601.45, their highest since January. It was the biggest one-day gain in two years.Akamai, maker of the video software that powers YouTube, gained 2.2 per cent to $47.09.Shares of networking equipment maker Cisco added 1.3 per cent to $23.36.Google also said paid clicks were up 16 per cent in the third quarter over the same period in 2009.Search and online ad rival Yahoo gained 2 per cent to $16.25 and Microsoft added 1.2 per cent to $25.54.Expectations also rose for Apple, which reports earnings on Monday. Its shares were up 4.1 per cent to $314.74, an all-time high.Gartner, the market research firm, estimated that the market for tablets such as Apple’s iPad could double next year.“A big fourth-quarter beat is expected …with innovation and future opportunities as strong as ever,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets.Private equity groups were said to be interested in a buy-out of Seagate, the data storage group.Its shares were marked up 22 per cent to $15.51 on the rumour that the offer by KKR and TPG would be $15 a share. Shares of rival Western Digital advanced 8.1 per cent to $31.89.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index added 1.4 per cent to 2,468.77.

Its shares were down 8.8 per cent to $12.85.Shares in rival New York Times Co retreated 2.5 per cent to $8.28.Financials were the leading fallers on the week, dropping 2.4 per cent as fears rise of possibly fraudulent mortgage foreclosures, which could cause losses for lenders.On Friday, consumers were also reported to be increasingly late on their credit card payments.Capital One Financial said charge-offs on consumer debt rose to an 8.4 per cent annualised rate in September, up from 8.2 per cent in August.Its shares, which fell 7.6 per cent to $36.86, led a drop of shares in leading lenders. Bank of America fell 5 per cent to $36.86 and JPMorgan Chase sank 4.1 per cent to $37.15.BofA led the large bank decliners on the week, losing 9.1 per cent, to its lowest level since July 1999.General Electric declined 5 per cent to $16.30 after it said sales in its core industrial businesses fell 6 per cent for the quarter.Industrials were weaker over the five-day period as producer prices rose, while the consumer price index continued to fall.Toymaker Mattel reported strong earnings growth but, excluding a one-time tax adjustment, failed to meet Street expectations.

Claims dropped by 11,000 for the week ending July 24 to a seasonally adjusted 457,000. Analysts had forecast the number of claims falling to 459,000.John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, said that it would take three more weeks of data to get a clear picture without the impact of summer factory shutdowns. He added that claims remained above the level that was consistent with sustained job creation.Comments by James Bullard Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President warning of the danger of deflation failed to move the market but confidence was shaky ahead of on Friday’s GDP announcement.Colgate-Palmolive and Kelloggs weighed on the S&P 500 Consumer Staples sector which fell 1.1 per cent. Shares in Colgate-Palmolive fell 6.8 per cent to $78.12. The company reported weaker-than-expected sales rising 2 per cent to $3.81bn, below analyst forecasts of $3.94bn.It also warned that currency devaluation in Venezuela would hit its full-year figures harder than previously anticipated. But it posted a better-than-
expected quarterly profit.The cost of recalling about 28m boxes of cereals last month weighed on Kelloggs’ quarterly results.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
35;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2010-05-22T00:12:20Z;Fund founder jailed for Galleon role;;"A US federal judge sentenced a former Bear Stearns hedge fund founder to more than two years in prison on Friday for his role in the Galleon insider trading case.The sentencing of Mark Kurland was the first in the insider trading case against Raj Rajaratnam’s Galleon fund. The investigation has ensnared more than 20 people and has been called the biggest such scandal involving a hedge fund.Mr Kurland, who founded a fund called New Castle, was sentenced to 27 months in prison by Judge Victor Marrero. He also forfeited $900,000; the proceeds from his illegal trades.“As a leader of the financial industry, he could have led by law abiding example,” Mr Marrero said in his sentencing statement. “Instead he chose to follow.”Mr Kurland pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit insider trading and to securities fraud in January and could have faced up to 25 years in prison. He had sought a lesser sentence than the term he received, arguing that he played a minor role and that he is in poor health.Mr Kurland was accused of conspiring to execute trades based on non-public information about AMD, Akamai Technologies and Sun Microsystems. He was the supervisor of Danielle Chiesi who, along with Mr Rajaratnam, has maintained her innocence.Mr Kurland and Ms Chiesi are accused of exchanging inside information with Mr Rajaratnam.Mr Marrero called Mr Kurland’s actions an example of the “corruption” and “arrogant greed” that fuelled the financial crisis. He said Mr Kurland’s argument that the sums of money involved had no material impact on the wider market was a “rationalisation”.Mr Kurland was recorded on wiretaps while directing Ms Chiesi to gather non-public information about the companies and then made trades based on that knowledge.Earlier this week, Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey director who had pleaded guilty to insider trading, agreed to pay $2.8m to settle civil charges stemming from his actions.Mr Rajaratnam is set to stand trial with Ms Chiesi on October 25."
36;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2010-03-29T23:32:13Z;Ex-IBM executive admits to Galleon tip-offs;;Robert Moffat, a former senior vice-president at IBM, admitted on Monday he provided inside information to a person involved with the Galleon Group hedge fund insider-trading scandal.“I disclosed material non-public information to Danielle Chiesi, a friend who I knew worked at a hedge fund,” Mr Moffat told Frank Maas, the judge in the federal southern district of New York court in Manhattan. “I knew that the information I provided would be helpful to her in performing her job executing securities transactions.”Mr Moffat said that in 2008 he gave Ms Chiesi, then a consultant at New Castle funds, a unit of Bear Stearns Asset Management, information about AMD, Lenovo and his own company that he learnt in the course of his 31-year career in computer hardware.Ms Chiesi was indicted, along with Galleon’s founder, Raj Rajaratnam, for passing information to the fund, which prosecutors say took in $49m (€37m, £33m) trading shares of technology companies based on the tips. Both individuals deny the charges.Mr Moffat, according to the complaint, told Ms Chiesi of the nature and timing of plans by AMD to sell its manufacturing operations to investors in Abu Dhabi. He also said he told her about disappointing sales at IBM and poor earnings at Lenovo, of which he said he learnt as a non-voting member of the computer-maker’s board.The complaint, which investigators assembled through telephone surveillance, also says that Ms Chiesi spoke to an unnamed executive at AMD and at Akamai.So far 21 individuals have been charged as part of the insider-trading ring, including former executives from other US companies, including McKinsey, the consultancy, and Intel, the chipmaker. It is believed to be the largest insider trading case.Mr Moffat is the 11th person charged by the US attorney to plead guilty. Eight others have agreed to co-operate with prosecutors.His attorney, Kerry Lawrence, of firm Briccetti, Calhoun & Lawrence, said in a statement: “While [Mr Moffat] has pleaded guilty, it is also important to understand that he never engaged in any trading …and received no money or other financial benefit from anyone relating to those transactions.”

He is the eighth person to plead guilty in the case against Raj Rajaratnam’s Galleon fund but does not plan to co-operate with authorities, according to his attorney, Peter Smith.“I received the information and traded on it,” said Mr Kurland.Prosecutors accused Mr Kurland of conspiring to execute trades based on non-public information about AMD, Akamai Technologies and Sun Microsystems. At New Castle, Kurland was the supervisor of Danielle Chiesi. Ms Chiesi and Mr Rajaratnam maintain their innocence.Appearing before Judge Ronald Ellis, Mr Kurland said that between August 2008 and January 2009 he agreed with others to receive confidential information about AMD and make trades based on that information. As part of his plea agreement, Mr Kurland said he will forfeit $900,000, which represents the proceeds from his illegal trades.Authorities have been aggressively pursuing anyone who might have been involved with what has been described as the largest hedge fund insider trading case in history.On Monday, lawyers representing the US attorney’s office, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Mr Rajaratnam wrangled over whether the SEC could have access to wiretap transcripts for its civil case that the US attorney is using in the criminal case.Seven defendants were last week formally indicted for allegedly taking part in the insider trading scheme. The case has ensnared top executives at some of the biggest and most prominent companies in the US.Mr Kurland’s plea agreement recommends a prison sentence of 30 to 37 months. He is set to be sentenced in April.
38;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2009-12-29T19:22:50Z;British TV groups grapple with VoD services;;The UK television industry is examining with renewed zeal how profitable video-on-demand services will be as free internet catch-up services move into the living room.Next year is expected to see a rise in the number of ways consumers are able to access television programme services – such as BBC’s iPlayer, ITVPlayer and Channel 4’s 4oD – through a regular TV set.However, serving up more programmes to larger audiences on bigger screens will come at a cost to the broadcasters – an outlay for internet delivery that analysts forecast will rise along with the popularity of VoD services.By some estimates, the main terrestrial broadcasters are already paying tens of millions of pounds a year to ensure the quality of their PC-based catch-up TV services. And technical advances – along with consumers’ expectations, set by YouTube and the BBC iPlayer – are forging ahead before the economics of delivering these services are clear.“In the past six months, it’s all leapt ahead,” says Nigel Walley, managing director of Decipher, a media consultancy. “Some of the internet capabilities are coming to TV faster than we thought.”Futuresource Consulting forecasts that one in five flat-panel TVs shipped in Europe next year will be ready to connect to the internet straight out of the box. By Christmas 2010, the first TV equipment based on Project Canvas– the BBC’s internet-TV joint venture provisionally approved by the BBC Trust last week – should be available.With iPlayer already available on several set-top boxes and games consoles, soon millions more households will be watching VoD on the screen for which it was originally intended – but delivered over the internet, not an aerial.“Once people discover [iPlayer] on TV they use it frequently and regularly,” says Rahul Chakkara, controller of TV platforms in the BBC’s Future Media and Technology unit. “We know most people will use [iPlayer] on TV – the question is when rather than if.”The speed of technological change could catch some broadcasters out, says Michael Comish, chief executive of Blinkbox, an independent VoD service.“Broadcasters have never had to manage distribution [themselves] before,” he says. “VoD is an attempt by the broadcasters to self-distribute and that is the reason why they will find it tough. It is not a skillset they have required …Most will end up spending a multiple of their initial budgets to try to compete, or simply exit.”Jon Gisby, Channel 4’s director of new media and technology, says that VoD “means a different set of economics than we have in linear and broadcast, particularly in distribution costs”.He says: “We need to think through carefully how our video quality evolves based on bandwidth costs, and the money we can bring in off the back of it.”The BBC is also looking at its distribution costs as part of the current strategic review into the scale and scope of the BBC’s operations.Some analysts question whether VoD can be as profitable as broadcast TV. The dual costs of piping internet video into the home and licensing content from producers – both paid out on a per-view basis – “may call into question the level of profits that can be made in the long term” from VoD, says David Cockram of Oliver & Ohlbaum, a media consultancy. “More people are taking more of the pie.”Broadcasters already have to pay companies providing “content delivery networks” to ensure their on-demand programming reaches viewers in good quality and without loading-time delays mid-video. Every time a programme is viewed online through their VoD services, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and other broadcasters pay a CDN provider such as Akamai, Level 3 or, soon, BT.“It’s different to traditional broadcast because as you get more users, the costs go up,” says Darren Waterman, a director at PwC’s media strategy unit.Today, one half-hour programme costs between 2p and 5p to stream through a CDN every time it is viewed. That may not sound much, but with the BBC iPlayer serving up almost 60m TV shows in November, a broadcaster’s CDN costs could already exceed £1m a month.“The costs scale horribly,” says Mr Cockram. “The big open question is whether individual content aggregators such as the broadcasters will be able to cap those total [delivery] costs in future. That is completely uncertain.”CDN services are expected to commoditise over time, so the cost to broadcasters for each video streamed will fall.The advertising recession has not hit internet video as hard as broadcast, with each online spot costing several times as much as a TV advert. But there are fewer ads in each show online, because broadcasters believe audiences will not tolerate as many interruptions.So the broadcasters may soon have to start charging for video services, says Mr Waterman. “The difficulty is that the BBC is giving catch-up away for free. That sets the tone that makes it harder for everyone to charge.”Although the economics of VoD are tricky for broadcasters to navigate, internet video is likely to account for 5 to 10 per cent of total TV viewing by 2020, according to Enders Analysis – meaning they are unlikely to threaten traditional sources of revenues.Nonetheless, Mr Gisby says 4oD is expected to turn a “modest profit” in 2009 for the first time since launching in 2006. “We believe there is a viable commercial business model for VoD,” he says, “but it’s still quite fragile and has a lot of risk associated with it.”

The last two quarters have been 50 per cent non-media,” said Jeremy Allaire, Brightcove chief executive. “We’re concluding that the total addressable website is every corporate website on the planet.”He added: “We are seeing the rise of video in the marketing landscape. Over the last quarter we’ve seen it pop in retail and e-commerce, where they’re using video as a core part of the buying experience. Retail and e-commerce will be very hot next year.”The new Brightcove platform offers customers more data on who is watching – a fiercely competitive area in which YouTube’s TestTube analytics system has begun offering brand owners dizzying detail on their customers’ musical tastes, holiday destinations andIt is also designed to make it easier for companies to get long-form high definition videos into social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and onto smartphones from Apple’s iPhone to handsets running Google’s Android operating system.Paul Sagan, chief executive of Akamai, which delivers one fifth of the world’s web traffic, told the Monaco Media Forum last week this year was “a tipping point for video on the internet”. Some 700m people were now using online video around the world, for an average of 3-4 hours a month, and were beginning to watch longer videos, he said.However, the estimated 14bn hours of online video consumption remain a fraction of the 242bn hours of live television viewing.Mr Allaire predicted further consolidation in the emerging online video platform market, where a recent Forrester reports showed Brightcove leading a pack composed of Ooyala, Kaltura, VMIX and others.Only a couple of strong companies would gain true scale, he said. “This market is just now getting to a size where a big company ought to be interested in doing this,” he said. “What are Google, Adobe, Akamai or Cisco going to do?”He would not comment on speculation that Google had looked at Brightcove in recent months, however, saying: “We’re focused on building a global independent company.”Brightcove’s independence could mark Brightcove out in the eyes of content partners from Google, whose YouTube video sharing site has a history of friction with media owners.“The impact of the Great Recession has not been that great,” Mr Allaire said. The group had reached profitability in the first half of 2009 but was now in investment mode, funded by the remaining proceeds of a $60m fundraising struck at a peak of investors’ infatuation with online video just four weeks after Google’s $1.65bn YouTube purchase.Brightcove could benefit from the television industry’s attempts to preserve the economics of the cable industry through an initiative called TV Everywhere which would allow pay-TV subscribers to access their full range of channels online.“There’s an opportunity for Brightcove to power everything that happens in these content companies’ websites.”He added, however, that the group had abandoned early thoughts of aggregating its customers’ videos on its own site to create an online video store akin to Hulu or Netflix. “The aggregators’ products are very well established.”
40;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;The markets’ lifeblood under scrutiny;;Late on a Friday evening in October 2008, just before 11pm, Danielle Chiesi, a consultant to the hedge fund New Castle Partners and a sometime confidant of Raj Rajaratnam, the president of the Galleon Group, another hedge fund, took a phone call at her New York apartment.According to transcripts from an FBI wiretap, it was an executive Ms Chiesi knew from Akamai, a Massachusetts-based technology company. “Danielle,” he said, “I have a major present for you.”Two weeks ago the present – information – and the alleged trades that followed landed Ms Chiesi, Mr Rajaratnam and Mark Kurland, New Castle’s founder, in the centre of the biggest insider-trading crackdown by US authorities since the late 1980s. All have since been released on bail.On Thursday, US authorities cast their net wider. Nineteen individuals have now been arrested, who US authorities allege were part of an information ring passing price-sensitive secrets to hedge funds in the biggest insider trading case in 20 years.The case against all 19 – all of whom assert their innocence – has yet to be heard, but the shockwaves from it are already being felt.Information – the subject and object of Ms Chiesi’s October phone call – is the most valuable commodity that the $1,400bn global hedge fund industry trades in.Where that privileged and often highly valuable information comes from is now bearing intense scrutiny.“Information is the lifeblood of the market,” says Christopher Miller, chief executive of Allenbridge Hedginfo, the hedge fund due diligence firm. “The [Securities and Exchange Commission] is flexing its muscles. Regulators around the world want to be feared and now they’ve started frightening people.”Such fear – or at least caution – is spreading for many because most of Galleon’s everyday way of doing business was common practice for the hedge fund industry.The fund p aid hundreds of millions of dollars a year in fees to the Wall Street banks that acted as its prime brokers. Like many other hedge funds it got market ”colour” that would not necessarily have been disclosed to regular market investors, according to people familiar with the fund.There is nothing necessarily illegal about such practices, lawyers and brokers say. Indeed, providing colour and gossip to hedge fund clients is a normal part of everyday business, say brokers. Insider-trading, by contrast, normally involves non-public information about a very specific event, such as a merger or earnings announcement that is leaked prior to its public release by an insider and traded upon.Many hedge funds are renowned for their information gathering.Legendary hedge fund managers such as Steven Cohen of SAC in the US or Alan Howard of Brevan Howard in the UK are renowned for being more “plugged in” to the market – and being able to pick up on changes in sentiment or outlook faster than other participants by reading from a wealth of up-to-date information at their fingertips.Getting extra and regular information from brokers and their analysts is not against the law so long as it remains consistent with their published public research reports.GLG Partners, one of London’s largest funds, takes tips from analysts it rates – one from each broker – on a daily basis. The tips are stored on a database at the firm and used as a resource for its traders to tap.On a grander scale, the hedge fund Marshall Wace uses daily share calls from hundreds of analysts to drive trading for its Trade Optimized Portfolio System (Tops) fund.The fund receives up to 900 trading ideas a day in London alone – submitted via an online portal by brokers, analysts and salespeople at the city’s trading houses. It then uses computer algorithms to sort, grade, and derive trading themes from the advice.At its peak in 2006, Tops alone was estimated to have accounted for 2-3 per cent of daily trading on Europe’s stock markets.Lansdowne Partners, one of the most successful hedge funds to have emerged from the credit crisis, meanwhile owed at least a small part of its trading edge to focus groups it used to try and gauge consumers’ views of UK banks.Others use more esoteric approaches. Man Group, the world’s largest hedge fund company, established a research institute with Oxford university in 2007 to help develop cutting-edge ideas to trade with. Research at the institute has ranged from modelling techniques used in computer game graphics to artificial intelligence.The arrangement means “sharing ideas with some of the most prominent quantitative finance academics in seminars, in the halls and by the watercooler,” said a person at the firm. “We have to innovate or die.”Winton Capital – another highly-successful computer-driven trader – recently had 300 years of commodity price data added to its vast computer mainframe.The data first had to be translated. In its original guise, it was written – or rather carved – in Babylonic cuneiform.
41;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2009-10-30T22:52:01Z;Moffat leaves IBM after Galleon affair;;Robert Moffat, the IBM senior executive charged with illegally passing on inside information, on Friday became the first tech industry executive known to have left his job in the wake of the Galleon affair.His departure, two weeks after charges were filed, brings an abrupt end to a 31-year career that took him close to the top of one of the world’s best-known companies.A senior vice-president and trusted lieutenant of Sam Palmisano, IBM’s chief executive officer, Mr Moffat had himself been mentioned as a possible candidate for the top job.IBM refused to comment on the circumstances surrounding his departure, confining itself to a brief statement: “Bob Moffat, who had been placed on a leave of absence as a result of a US federal investigation into his personal activities, is no longer an employee of IBM.” A spokesman added that the company did not discuss “personal matters regarding employees or former employees”.Kerry Lawrence, Mr Moffat’s lawyer, said that the executive had “retired from IBM, he was not terminated or fired”. He had left the company “so he could devote his time and energy to defending himself against the charges,” Mr Lawrence added. He reiterated that the former IBM executive was “still asserting his innocence”.Mr Moffat’s quick departure, and IBM’s decision to characterise the matter as a purely personal one, contrasts sharply with the approach taken by other companies whose executives have been drawn into the insider trading case.An executive at Intel and a partner at McKinsey, who have also denied insider trading charges, are both on administrative leave, according to the companies.These companies have also been public about launching internal investigations into the affair, as has Akamai, where an executive is alleged to have passed on inside information though not been charged.Some of the companies caught up in the affair have also moved to reassure their staff and customers by promising reviews of – and potentially changes to – their ethical codes of conduct for executives.While acting quickly to suspend Mr Moffat after the charges were laid two weeks ago, IBM has not disclosed any other action.The decision to depict the matter as a purely personal one and refuse further comment risks falling short of the transparency needed when a scandal hits a company at the highest levels, according to some corporate ethics experts.IBM said that Rod Adkins, who had already been named acting head of its hardware and semiconductor operations in place of Mr Moffat, had now taken on the role full time.
42;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2009-10-19T20:03:11Z;Observers see wider hedge funds crackdown;;What prosecutors call the biggest insider trading case involving hedge funds is likely to implicate far more people than the six individuals who were charged on Friday.Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon hedge fund, and present and former executives of Bear Stearns, IBM, Intel and McKinsey, were accused of either passing on or trading ahead of earnings announ­cements, acquisitions and joint venture deals involving prominent companies.But besides the unnamed person who became a government informant, the court documents describe five other people who allegedly took part in the scheme that began in 2006 by providing inside tips. They included an analyst at Moody’s Investors Services, who allegedly provided inside information related to Hilton, individuals at Polycom and Akamai, and a source at Market Street Partners, the public relations company, who allegedly provided inside information pertaining to Google.Prosecutors, who were helped by an informant who started working with the government in November 2007, say the investigation was continuing. Legal experts say the case is likely to be only the start of a much wider crackdown.“There is another shoe that hasn’t dropped. There are more of these coming down the pike,” said Tom Dewey of Dewey Pegno & Kramarsky. “It’s clear there’s an enforcement focus in going after hedge funds. This informant has opened a window to a world of unlawful hedge fund activity.”John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said Friday’s charges may have been the “first cut,” with prosecutors focusing on what they believed were the most egregious offenders. It is unclear why some of the other unnamed executives allegedly passed on information on their companies or whether they may be charged in relation to this case. In one instance, the SEC claims in the court documents, the individual at Polycom allegedly passed on information “with the expectation that Tipper A would share a portion of Tipper A’s illicit profits” with the executive.Robert Khuzami, the enforcement director of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, has criticised some of the unnamed ­executives.He said: “As tippers, we allege the senior executives of highly reputable companies stole this valuable, not-yet-public information relating to earnings guidance and corporate transactions, information that they knew belonged to their companies and shareholders, and which they knew they had a duty not to use for their own illicit purposes. But they disregarded those duties and stole information in exchange for some benefit, monetary or otherwise, bestowed on them by Rajaratnam”.Mr Rajaratnam, through his lawyer, has denied any wrongdoing and will fight the charges in court. Several of the other defendants have said the same.Moody’s said the company had strict policies against divulging confidential information, and the “alleged wrong­doing by an individual at Moody’s would be an egregious violation of Moody’s policies and values”.Polycom said it had strict rules and policies against any employee divulging confidential insider information, adding that it would “provide any and all assistance needed to the authorities to fully support this investigation”.Other companies des­cribed in the complaint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell, Francesco Guerrera, and Alan Rappeport in New York
43;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2009-07-30T20:48:52Z;S&P 500 flirts with 1,000 level;;US equity benchmarks closed at new highs for the year on Thursday, with investors optimistic that aggressive cost cutting by companies places them in a very profitable position once the economy recovers.In late trade, the S&P 500 had pulled back from testing the 1,000 level, for the first time since last November as traders awaited Friday’s report on gross domestic product for the second quarter.The Nasdaq Composite briefly breached 2,000 for the first time since last October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly rose 9,200, having been below 9,000 just a week ago.A number of earnings results, although mixed, sustained the rally as many companies continue to beat lowered estimates.“With about half of the S&P 500 having already reported, the number of upside surprises is running at a rate not seen since 1994,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Companies have exceeded bottom-up expectations by about 14.8 per cent with all major sectors beating analyst’s projections.”Concerns that companies are only beating heavily reduced estimates is being downplayed by some analysts, who are focusing on the potential benefits of tough cost cutting.“Aggressive cost cutting in this recession is positioning US companies in an extremely competitive way and a stronger economy later this year will boost revenues and directly into bottom line profits,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for JPMorgan’s Private Bank.The S&P closed 1.2 per cent higher at 986.75, an eight-month peak. All of the 10 main S&P industry sectors rose, led by a 3 per cent gain for materials and a 2.7 per cent rally in financials.After propelling the Nasdaq above 2,000 for the first time since last October, technology stocks pared gains towards the close. The Nasdaq closed up 0.8 per cent at 1,984.30, taking its gain this year to nearly 26 per cent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to close at 9,154.46.After the closing bell Walt Disney reported a 26 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings and in after-hours trade the stock was off 1.5 per cent at $25.5.Shares in General Electric, a Dow component, rallied 6.9 per cent higher to $13.11 after Goldman Sachs upgraded the conglomerate. Blue chips were led higher by Dupont, up 4.3 per cent at $30.81, 3M, firmer by 1.7 per cent at 69.90 and Caterpillar, higher by 3.8 per cent at $43.41.Stronger metal prices helped miners and Alcoa gained 4.1 per cent to finish at $11.46.Dragging on the Dow was Exxon Mobil, whose second-quarter earnings fell 66 per cent to $3.95bn and quarterly revenue dropped 46 per cent to $74.46bn. The stock slipped 1 per cent to $70.72, up from an earlier low of $69.91.Another Dow member reporting yesterday was Travelers, which posted a 21 per cent drop in earnings, below analysts’ forecasts. While the insurer, boosted its 2009 operating earnings outlook, the stock fell 1.6 per cent to $41.94.Elsewhere, Colgate-Palmolive saw its profits beat estimates for the second quarter amid cost cutting. The consumer staples company maintained guidance for the rest of the year. Sales fell 5.5 per cent to $3.75bn for the quarter and the stock lost 5.3 per cent to $71.83.MasterCard recorded a 26.4 per cent rise in net income for the second quarter, and net revenue rose 2.7 per cent to $1.3bn. Its shares rallied 3 per cent to $194.11 and the results came after Visa beat earnings estimates late Wednesday. Shares in Visa were 0.6 per cent higher at $67.21.Meanwhile, Dow Chemical recorded a loss of $486m for the quarter, due to charges stemming from its $16.5bn buy-out of Rohm & Haas and weak sales. Revenue fell 31 per cent to $11.32bn, down from $16.35bn for the same period a year earlier.The results were better than estimates and the stock rose 6.2 per cent to $21.53.Motorola reported a small profit, which surprised analysts, who were expecting a quarterly loss. Sales fell to $5.5bn from $8bn and its shares gained 9.4 per cent to $7.19.NYSE Euronext, swung to a loss in the second quarter as the exchange took a charge related to NYSE Life Clearing. The stock rose 0.7 per cent to $27.21.For the third quarter running, Kodak reported a loss, with earnings falling $189m, while sales dropped 29 per cent to $1.77bn. Kodak declined 10.4 per cent to $2.94.Shares in Symantec dropped 14.3 per cent to $14.78, after the security software maker posted weaker than forecast fiscal first quarter earnings as sales dropped 13 per cent to $1.43bn, also below estimates.Akamai dropped 19 per cent to $16.51 after the company’s revenues missed estimates.
44;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Cotendo a contender in crowded CDN market;;Cotendo is a new competitor entering the crowded market of content delivery networks, with money-saving technology that has attracted the backing of venture capital heavyweights Sequoia Capital and Benchmark Capital.“Our software does more with less,” says Ronni Zehavi, chief executive of the Silicon Valley company, about its Israeli-developed technology.That means Cotendo needs less servers to deliver content, offering cheaper services for its target market of mid-range companies, and providing them with the kind of bespoke offering that larger CDNs such as Akamai and Limelight only offer to the biggest clients.Mr Zehavi says only Cotendo and Akamai can serve the dynamic content now being demanded as websites try to serve more personalised content to users.His service offers real-time reporting on usage to customers, acceleration tools and the ability to balance easily the load on their servers to meet demand.Sequoia provided initial funding in January 2008 and has joined with Benchmark in a $7m second round.“Some areas of technology get starved for a long time. Content delivery is one of them. It has been years since fresh eyes were trained on the subject and during this period the amount of content conveyed around the Internet has multiplied at a rate that even rabbits would admire,” said Michael Moritz, general partner of Sequoia Capital, in a statement.CDNs are best known for serving video efficiently around the internet, but Mike Sawyer, who has moved from Limelight to be head of marketing at Cotendo, says this problem has been largely solved with extra capacity.“What we see as the next wave after video is that sites want an integrated approach of offering whole-site delivery. We let companies manage how they accelerate their dynamic and static content to give users faster performance and reduce the load on their own infrastructure.”Cotendo is entering a competitive market at a tough time, but it has already acquired customers, it says, suggesting it may have found itself a new niche.
45;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2009-01-04T19:24:57Z;Surfers should pay congestion charges;;Does it make sense to ban businesses from charging higher prices to some customers for giving them preferential treatment over others?That idea lies at the heart of Barack Obama’s promised policy towards the internet, a medium that had more than a passing role in his election to the White House. It is a proposal that should be dropped from the new administration’s agenda as soon as decently possible. Other countries where the issue has started to raise its head, such as the UK, should also tread carefully before attempting their own regulation.The issue in question is a central one for the information age. It concerns the rights and obligations of the companies that run the communications networks which, collectively, make up the internet. Should they be permitted to charge higher prices for giving priority treatment to some of the traffic they carry? And conversely, should they be allowed to downgrade the importance of other, lower-paying traffic, or even refuse to carry it?Under the banner of “network neutrality”, Google, Ebay and other internet companies fought this battle on Capitol Hill three years ago, to no avail. With little evidence of immediate harm, Congress chose not to regulate. At the same time AT&T, the company which had been agitating most aggressively to introduce discriminatory pricing, agreed to a two-year standstill. That period is now up, and the supposedly internet-savvy Obama administration has vowed to make network neutrality a central plank of its communications policy.In essence, the proposal would forbid communications companies from selling access to special fast lanes on the internet, while also outlawing bans on any type of internet traffic: let everyone on to the road and, if that results in congestion, make them all sit in the same traffic jams. That way, the networks remain open for all users on the same terms, and the network operators do not have an incentive to drive up demand for premium services by limiting capacity. Companies such as Google also claim that the next time two students come up with a great idea for changing the world they will get the chance to compete on equal terms with even the richest companies.This idea is well-meaning but misguided. It prevents the market from rationing a scarce resource. It ignores the fact that, in many industries, companies provide tiered levels of service without unfairly discriminating against certain classes of customer: economic self-interest leads them to try to maximise returns from each group. Also, it is worth noting that the supposed level playing field of the internet is a myth: rich companies already pay to have their services delivered faster, for instance by buying the services of a specialised “content delivery network” such as Akamai.A better option would be for politicians to leave well alone, particularly since legislation in such a fast-changing area could have unintended consequences. Some safeguards may well be needed in two important areas, but these should be left to regulators like the Federal Communications Commission in the US and Ofcom in the UK.One is to prevent network operators from deliberately slowing or blocking the traffic of particular internet services. The FCC has already shown itself up to this task, taking on cable company Comcast recently over its restrictions on file-swapping service BitTorrent. Anti-trust laws also act as a back-stop to prevent this sort of discrimination.A second area for regulatory attention will be to ensure that the quality of the internet’s “slow lane” does not deteriorate. Competition between broadband networks is the best answer, and the arrival of new high-speed wireless technologies such as WiMax should help. In the meantime, regulators need to keep a close eye on network performance: any generalised deterioration will give politicians the excuse they have been looking for to intervene.
46;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2008-09-18T22:55:28Z;Amazon has cloud content-delivery edge;;Amazon has been at the forefront of the development of cloud computing services and it moved out to the edge of that cumulus today with its announcement of a content delivery network (CDN).In a blog note, Werner Vogels, Amazon chief technology officer, explained that offering online services through the cloud of the internet should not be as nebulous as it sounds.Customers and developers need to know from what location they are being served in order to have workarounds for potential crashes and to position their data close to where it is needed to improve delivery speeds.Amazon Web Services has been expanding into Europe and Asia to address these issues and today Mr Vogels said it had now set up a network of “edge” locations on three continents that would bring it even closer to customers.An edge network has been the delivery model for CDNs such as industry leaders Akamai and Limelight and it is no surprise that Amazon is trying to emulate them.However, its model is different and potentially disruptive for the entire CDN sector. As industry analyst Dan Rayburn explains, Amazon will not offer streaming or live broadcasting initially to compete with Akamai and Limelight in winning business from big media companies.Instead, it is targeting smaller players and start-ups, thereby threatening the smaller CDNs, says Om Malik.Amazon will force much needed transparency in industry pricing with a pay-as-you-go usage model with no commitments or upfront contracts needed.Smaller companies will be happy to have Amazon hosting their content and will be able to establish the service with a simple software hook-up.Amazon is perfectly capable of upgrading its service to streaming later and taking on the big boys, but for now the service is in its beta-testing phase, with a planned launch by the end of the year.
47;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2008-07-08T15:33:07Z;Valley view: The IT world pokes its head in the cloud;;Mixed with the usual fog rolling off the Pacific into San Francisco at this time of year, there has been a heavy haze and distinct smell of smoke caused by more than a thousand fires burning in northern and central California in the tinder-dry conditions.The atmosphere is being recreated in the tech world with a smoky haze hanging over the rolling concept of cloud computing – just a buzz phrase or perhaps the biggest thing to happen in computing since e-commerce?In a report published two weeks ago, Gartner, the research firm said cloud computing heralds an evolution that is no less influential than e-business.On the same day, Yahoo announced a reorganisation that included “developing a world-class cloud-computing and storage infrastructure” and Microsoft said cloud computing was behind its acquisition of MobiComp, which offers back-up technology for mobile data.Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the Structure ’08 conference discussed how the internet infrastructure needed to be renewed for cloud computing, and start-ups were told the technology offered them pain-free scaling, as they grew into the next eBay or Facebook.If cloud computing sounds a bit nebulous, here are a couple of definitions.Gartner defines it as “a style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided ‘as a service’, using internet technologies, to multiple external customers”.Merrill Lynch, which published a 90-page report on “The Cloud Wars” in May, describes it more simply as “delivering personal and business productivity applications from centralised servers”.Sounds familiar? Yes, this is Application Service Providers (ASPs) and the Software as a Service (SaaS) model that we’ve been talking about for years.But cloud computing does not appear to be a new label pasted on an old bottle to generate fresh sales. What seems to be different this time is the far greater scale that is being attempted. Big companies are involved and they are offering not just services but platforms on which they are encouraging developers to create services and applications.What is being planned is expected to encompass everyone from major enterprises to small start-ups and individual consumers. Hardware companies will vie for the business of equipping massive data farms around the world, while fearing for their PC businesses.Merrill Lynch says the shift harks back to the days of centralised mainframe computing, implying the retreat of its successor, the client-server model.While it is easy to imagine enterprises replacing employees’ desktop PCs with dumb terminals running applications from the cloud, there are also signs of how consumers will opt for this model. Look at how everything can be done in the browser now and stored in the cloud, from e-mail to word-processing and photo and video editing and storage.Nicholas Carr, in his book The Big Switch, compares the rise of utility computing with electrification in the 19th century. Power production switched from in-house generating plants to centralised utilities.Google, with its web-based services and massive infrastructure, seems certain to be a cloud-computing leader, but there are also less likely candidates. The online retailer Amazon has shown others the way in cloud computing, selling its expertise in infrastructure through its Amazon Web Services for the past two years and developing its Elastic Compute Cloud, Simple Storage and database services.Gartner says a company such as Wal-Mart, with its supply chain expertise, could lease its core competencies as a cloud-computing service in similar fashion.Merrill Lynch says the economics are compelling, with business applications made three to five times cheaper and consumer applications five to 10 times cheaper. It sizes the market opportunity at $95bn for applications, with another $65bn coming from online advertising.Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, believes a super-group of technology companies will dominate cloud computing. He expects his company to be one of them. It has its own twist on the concept with Live Mesh, where cloud data is synchronised with every kind of device.Apple, too, hinted at its cloud ambitions when it unveiled the new iPhone last month and a MobileMe web-based service.Merrill Lynch says that only Microsoft and Google have offerings in all three core categories of infrastructure, platform and applications, but other significant players in one or two are Amazon, EMC, IBM, NetSuite, Salesforce.com, Sun and Yahoo.Then others such as Akamai, Dell, HP, NetApp and VMware are enabling cloud technologies with their hardware and software.Fears about reliability, security and performance levels remain as barriers to adoption by businesses.They are likely to be the main arguments used by IT departments to justify their continued existence and to warn their bosses not to put their heads in the clouds too soon.
48;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2008-05-05T15:00:15Z;Vusion vision is for instant-on hi-def video;;Jittr, the video delivery network, emerged from “stealth mode” today as Vusion, a name change that seems necessary given its claims of providing jitter-free high-definition pictures over the internet.The Silicon Valley company also announced its first customer: Island Def Jam Music Group, which has a roster including Mariah Carey, Kanye West, Rihanna and The Killers. The Vusion platform will deliver an online video portal of DVD-quality versions of the artists’ music videos.Jittr is entering a crowded space dominated by big names Akamai and Limelight. Other notable content delivery networks (CDNs) include Move Networks, which powers ABC television’s high-quality video, BitTorrent, Vuze, Edgecast, Grid, Level 3 and Panther Express.The Streamingmedia.com blog tracks more than 40 CDNs. It says the market is too crowded and a shakeout is inevitable.However, Grover Righter, Vusion’s marketing chief, insisted in an interview that the company was not a CDN.CDNs focused on servers on the edge of networks, http downloading, caching and serving flash video and images, he told me.Vusion was focused on longer format, high-quality video served over the regular internet but processed by its servers in data centres, using its proprietary Wide Area Rapid Propagation (Warp) protocol.Warp essentially is the secret sauce that allows Vusion to serve video in a way that it claims eliminates buffering – so there is an instant-on for the video plus channel-changing without delays.Mr Righter says media companies at last month’s NAB broadcasters convention in Las Vegas were so impressed with the technology that they were now planning to bring forward 2010 plans for high-definition video over the internet by 18 months.“This is a rapidly growing market, there’s room for several players and I think ours is a better machine,” he said.The San Jose start-up was founded two years ago and has under 50 employees. It has received an unspecified investment from BlueRun Ventures, the Nokia-backed VC fund.It may or may not be a CDN, but it is chasing the same customers and a lighter less-expensive infrastructure than its rivals could allow it to undercut their prices.
49;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2008-03-27T20:30:43Z;US shares fall amid earnings concerns;;Wall Street stocks fell for a second day in a choppy trading on Thursday as concerns about earnings in the technology and financial sectors overcame initial enthusiasm at better-than-expected data on employment and growth.On Wednesday night Oracle posted disappointing results which knocked sentiment in the whole sector, analysts said.Third quarter sales at the software company were $5.35bn, undershooting analysts’ forecast for $5.42bn, while net income climbed 30 percent to $1.34bn.Oracle, which is often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector and of the broader business environment, said an increased threat of a recession had made customers more prudent in their technology spending.“[The results] put salt in the wound and reminded people that tech earnings are not going to be as ebullient as was hoped,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The market had a big rally last week and when you are consolidating you are vulnerable to almost anything - good news, no news or bad news.”Oracle shares dropped 7.2 per cent to $19.43. Fellow software companies Microsoft and Akamai Technologies also slipped - 1.8 per cent to $28.05 and 6.4 per cent to $30.06, respectively.Meanwhile, Google stocks dropped, 3.1 per cent to $444.08, after the internet search company said it had seen slower growth in clicks on text ads, adding to worries about an economic slowdown.The Nasdaq composite index closed down 1.9 per cent at 2,280.83 points while the benchmark S&P500 index - which rose as much as 0.3 per cent before falling back - dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,325.78 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 per cent to 12,302.70 points.Banks remained in focus after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said that Merrill Lynch and UBS may post losses this quarter on write-downs of $6bn and $11.1bn, respectively, due to escalating credit problems.Merrill shares fell 5.7 per cent to $41.90 and an index of investment banking stocks slid 5.1 per cent.On Wednesday Ms Whitney slashed her earnings estimates for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 by an average of 84 per cent for a number of related banks including Citigroup, Bank of America and Wachovia.Citigroup lost 1.2 per cent to $21.79, Bank of America fell 3 per cent to $38.64 and Wachovia lost 3.4 per cent to $27.07.Lehman stocks were worst hit by the sector sell off, slumping 8.9 per cent to $38.71.Ms Whitney noted that further downward revisions were likely and that banks’ capital ratios could come under serious strain going forward as ratings downgrades to securities forced banks to hold more capital in reserve.In February over $370bn of securities were downgraded – more than three times the amount downgraded in October which was previously the single most disruptive month for the debt market in terms of selling pressure from ratings.“As many expected the fourth quarter to be the ”kitchen sink” for the industry, we believe first quarter results, to be reported in two weeks time, will be a rude awakening,” she said.Markets initially rallied after new data showed that initial jobless claims fell unexpectedly and revised growth figures suggested that the US consumer was not quite ready to give up spending.But by mid-afternoon that enthusiasm had for the most part petered out.Results from Lennar however, provided some unexpected momentum for housebuilders. The company reported $88.2m losses in the first quarter due to write downs in asset value.Sales plummeted 62 per cent to $1.06bn compared to last year and average selling prices, deliveries of new homes and new home orders also dropped, while the cancellation rate hit 26 per cent.Still, moderately optimistic outlook statements from Lennar executives helped the stock gained 1.8 per cent to $17.90.Housebuilders proved particularly resilient given data released on Tuesday painting a bleak picture of a sector stung by declining house prices.Pulte Homes added 1.6 per cent to $14.42 and DR Horton rose 2.2 per cent to $15.53.Utility stocks were the only other bright spot as upgraded earnings forecasts helped drive shares Sempra Energy higher, and peers benefited from investors looking for a safe haven.Sempra shares added 3.9 per cent to $53, while Teco Energy rose 2.8 per cent to $15.74.
50;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2007-10-25T20:44:37Z;Writedown concerns weigh on Wall Street;;US stocks were weaker on Thursday during another volatile session in which concerns about further writedowns linked to credit market losses spooked the market.American International Group fell on concerns about its exposure to subprime mortgages.

The investment bank index fell 1 per cent at 195.21.During a volatile session AIG fell as much as 8.5 per cent, and was the weakest stock on the Dow, as rumours circulated about its exposure to sub-prime mortgages. The company reports quarterly earnings after the market closes. The stock rebounded in late trade and closed 3.2 per cent lower at $61.79.Merrill Lynch fell 3.7 per cent to $60.90 after a Goldman Sachs analyst noted that Merrill might have to write down another $4.5bn in the current quarter.

51;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2007-10-09T04:21:19Z;BitTorrent target service launched;;BitTorrent, whose file-sharing technology is responsible for more than 40 per cent of internet traffic, will announce a commercial service on Tuesday to improve video delivery to consumers.The San Francisco company says its Delivery Network Accelerator (DNA) will mean big savings for media companies, which are increasingly making content available online to consumers to reap advertising revenues and counter illegal downloads.There are already more than 150m users of BitTorrent’s existing peer-to-peer (P2P) software, which allows large files to be transferred by breaking them up into pieces that can be shared between the computers that are downloading them. Their simultaneous uploading of the pieces spreads the load and speeds increase as more users join the download and this process of sharing.This is in contrast to existing content delivery networks, where speeds slow as more users try to access copies of files held in their entirety on single servers. Their hosts are forced to add capacity to meet demand.“We are collecting this resource of users and adding to the capacity of the network,” says Ashwin Navin, president and co-founder of BitTorrent. “Now, with DNA, we have an interface where any company can tap into this network.”P2P can be slow and inefficient when there are few users wanting to download or stream a file and BitTorrent is pitching its product as something that can supplement content delivery networks, such as those of Akamai and Limelight.Akamai acquired Red Swoosh, a company specialising in P2P, in April, in recognition that the technology would soon play a role in commercial content delivery.BitTorrent has struck deals with 55 content providers. BitTorrent.com offers legal downloads and the company’s partners include 20th Century Fox, MTV Networks, Paramount and Warner Bros.
52;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Lossy internet video? No problem claims Digital Fountain;;"It is always good to kick off a conference – particularly a tech startup beauty show like Demo – with a splash. That is just what DemoFall’s longtime organiser, Chris Shipley, did with Digital Fountain, the kick off demonstrator at today’s event in San Diego.Digital Fountain, a privately funded Fremont-based digital video infrastructure startup, showed off itsDF Splash technology which cleans up ""lossy"" IP-delivered video guaranteeing near broadcast quality video even when a sizable number of packets are dropped.Digital Fountain demonstrated the technology’s rather impressive performance by deliberately dropping one tenth of one percent of the packets in a video stream, then half of one per cent and finally cranked the packets lost up to 20 per cent. Even with one fifth of the packets dropped, the video looked smooth and the accompanying audio was clean – pretty impressive.In theory the technology could remove the need for Akamai-style edge video servers enabling companies to host video content wherever it is cheapest and makes most sense. Digital Fountain is actually using Amazon Web Services on a pay-as-you go basis so the technology could be rather disruptive for established players like Akamai and Limelight Networks that have invested fortunes in hardware-heavy content delivery networks."
53;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2007-07-10T22:30:11Z;Wall St slumps amid subprime downgrades;;US stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, hurt by retail and housing sector earnings warnings. Financials were roiled by more bad news from the subprime mortgage market.Selling gathered pace at midday, as a speech on inflation by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, did not address current policy and failed to arrest investor gloom.The S&P 500 index fell 1.4 per cent to close at 1,510.12. It was the worst one-day slide in the index in more than a month. Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index surged 15.9 per cent. All major S&P sectors closed lower, led by telecoms and financials.Worries over banks’ potential exposure to the mortgage market and a possible credit crunch flared when S&P announced it would place $12bn in rated subprime securities under review for downgrade. That sparked safe-haven buying in government bonds and maintained pressure on the stock market.“It makes sense that financials are bearing the brunt of the S&P ratings review story,” said Doug Peta, strategist at J&W Seligman. “It’s hard to see any resolution soon and that makes it hard to love the financials. They have been lagging [behind] the market all year and will continue to do so.”The S&P financials sector is now lower by 3.1 per cent this year and is the only major group in negative territory for 2007. Among investment banks, Lehman fell 5 per cent to $71.10 and Bear Stearns was down 4.1 per cent at $137.96.The retail sector was also in focus and a bearish tone in trading was set by Sears’ second-quarter guidance that was below estimates, due to lower sales of appliances. Sears said it planned to buy back up to an additional $1bn of its stock, but at the department store chain fell 10 per cent to $154.21.Other retailers fell, led by Macy’s, off 3.7 per cent at $40.12, Wal-Mart, down 1.9 per cent at $47.58, and Costco, lower by 1.4 per cent at $60.51.Home Depot, the home improvement chain, cut its earnings outlook for the fiscal year due to a weak housing market. Its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $40.25, as the company sought to buyback 250lm shares.The bearish news on housing was underscored when DR Horton, the largest US homebuilder, said orders for new homes fell 40 per cent during its fiscal third quarter. Shares in the homebuilder fell 2 per cent to $19.40 as the company said it now expected to post a loss in its third quarter. The stock set a 52-week low of $19.16 and other home builder stocks set fresh 52-week lows on Tuesday.Technology and blue chips were not spared from worries over the upcoming earnings season. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,639.16 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.1 per cent lower at 13,501.70.Earnings expectations for S&P 500 constituents revolve around a rise of 4.4 per cent seen for the second quarter compared with the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Financial. Earnings estimates have edged up from 3.9 per cent since the start of April.“Such low expectations should be favourable for the market, since management has beaten estimates for more than three years running,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Among blue chips, Alcoa fell 1.7 per cent to $41.66. The aluminium group reported a 3.9 per cent decline in second quarter profit compared with a year ago. While the result matched estimates, sales were less than expected.Alcoa also extended its $28.6bn bid for Alcan until August 10. Alcoa’s hostile bid, which the Canadian rival has already rejected, was originally set to expire on Tuesday. Alcan fell 0.9 per cent to $86.14 on Tuesday.A bright note for earnings was Pepsi Bottling, which reported a 9.5 per cent rise in the second quarter. The stock rose 3.8 per cent to $35.74.WD-40, the maker of lubricants posted a third quarter rise of 8.5 per cent that was below estimates. It also lowered its outlook for fiscal 2007. The stock slumped 10.1 per cent to $33.25.Greenbrier, a maker of railcars, said its fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 22 per cent amid higher production. The result exceeded estimates and shares surged 15.8 per cent to $33.15.Akamai rose 4 per cent to $49.45, as S&P said the company would enter the broad S&P 500 on Wednesday. The stock will replace Biomet, which has been purchased by private-equity funds.DirecTV rose 1.6 per cent to $24.79. Jason Bazinet, analyst at Citigroup, upgraded DirecTV to a “buy” from a “hold”, amid the strong likelihood that “Liberty tenders for DirecTV within 12 months”. A likely offer price is $30 per share, said Mr Bazinet.
54;AKAM;Akamai Technologies;2006-06-12T18:13:01Z;Microsoft limits online access to Vista;;Microsoft has limited online access to a test version of its next Windows system for fear of bringing the internet to a halt.A downloadable file of Vista software, made available freely online last week, is so big that giving users unrestricted access would clog up online networks, according to the company.“It’s not that we didn’t anticipate this level of interest or demand, but that we are at the threshold of what the internet can bear,” reads a posting on the weblog run by the development team behind the software.Microsoft plans to release Windows Vista on new PCs early next year, marking the first new version of the operating system for five years. The company made a version available, in the hope that exhaustive testing by amateur geeks would find bugs that still needed to be fixed.The standard version of the software takes up 3.5 gigabytes of memory – equivalent to more than 800 digital songs on Apple’s iTunes service. A second version, designed for 64-bit machines, runs to 4.4 gigabytes and takes five and a half hours to download even on a fast cable or DSL connection, according to Microsoft.Several technology bloggers reported an instant message conversation with a Microsoft representative, who was quoted as saying: “We are literally saying that if we increased our bandwidth any further there’s a possibility of taking down the internet – people might have problems with World Cup viewing, etc.”Kieran Taylor, director of product management at Akamai Technologies, which specialises in online distribution, said the internet was unlikely to be shut down completely by any one event like this. However, he added that it could degrade internet quality for a large proportion of web users.To overcome the technical limitations associated with sending out a digital file of its software from its own servers, several bloggers called on Microsoft to release the software on a peer-to-peer system such as BitTorrent. Rather than forcing users from around the world to come to a central server to download a file, potentially clogging the internet, such systems let users copy the software from each other locally.Microsoft dismissed the idea for “legal and privacy issues,” while adding that “we can’t guarantee that they’ve got an unaltered copy, etc.” Despite that, various unauthorised copies of the software were circulating on BitTorrent on Monday.
