US-style or UK?;;While the debate rages as to whether the worst of the global recession is over, lawmakers in the US and regulators in Britain are engaged in another debate: over the rules that govern public companies.Most experts say – when comparing their effectiveness – that the Combined Code in the UK fares better than the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of the US.Indeed, many observers would like to see the US move to a model similar to Britain’s.“I think that the Combined Code is the preferred way to proceed, because it depends on voluntary action by the private sector,” says Ira Millstein, who is a renowned corporate board adviser and a partner at Weil, Gotschal & Manges, a law firm in New York.Mr Millstein thinks that the requirement for UK companies either to comply with the Combined Code or explain why they have a good reason not to is “more genteel – which is sort of the British way”.The Combined Code, written to codify board director conduct, executive compensation and auditing issues, dates back to the 1990s and was most recently revised in 2006. It is currently under review.The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK’s corporate governance regulator, asked British stakeholders for consultation on how well the Code is working. Those findings are expected to be published some time this year. Changes to the Code could follow.The principle of comply or explain only works in countries where share­holders have meaningful rights in law, such as being able to vote individual directors on or off the board, says Chris Hodge, the head of the corporate governance unit at the FRC.Without those rights, Mr Hodge explains, regulators have to play a more active role to protect investors.Conversely, shareholders feel that a principles-based approach such as that of the Combined Code produces fewer obstacles to running businesses, says Leo Martin, a corporate ethics consultant at GoodCorporation.He cites as evidence the drop in corporate listings on US exchanges since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.“Companies have voted with their feet. UK businesses are less encumbered,” Mr Martin comments.In both countries, a host of financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers and Northern Rock, failed badly at overseeing systemic risk.Yet that was not the problem the governance laws in either country was constructed to manage.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for instance, was created to assure accuracy in financial reporting.“We don’t know how much fraud did not occur because of Sarbanes-Oxley, but by and large, it’s been beneficial,” says Eliot Spitzer, who prosecuted some of his country’s largest securities fraud cases when he was attorney general of New York State.So Sox, as it is called, is likely to stay intact.Yet it almost certainly will be superseded by new corporate governance provisions such as a shareholders’ bill of rights that was introduced in Congress last month. For one thing, Sox clearly did not solve the underlying problem of excessive financial leverage that later sank many banks.“More cynical voices would say that Sarbanes-Oxley was akin to building the Maginot Line,” Mr Spitzer quips.Americans claim that creating norms of corporate behavior is easier in Britain because of the smaller community of regulators, stock exchanges, and investors such as shareholder insurance companies.“You can call a meeting of most of the institutional owners of a big FTSE company within the City of London with, perhaps, a conference link to Edinburgh,” says Jon Lukomnik, a founding member of the International Corporate Governance Network.That familiarity encourages what Mr Lukomnik calls “quiet, constructive engagement”.Thus, UK stakeholders have agreed on governance topics such as shareholders’ right to vote on executive remuneration, required separation of the role of chief executive and chairman, and the point at which directors are “overboarded” or sit on too many boards to be effective.Some US companies voluntarily govern themselves by these practices but they remain the minority. That is likely to change, however, under the shareholder-friendly Obama administration.Most observers agree on Sox’s benefits, yet point to its imposing drawbacks.Erroll Davis says that when he was chief executive of Alliant Energy, a $3bn public utility in the Midwest, he was put off by the “prescriptiveness of Sox”.He later came to appreciate it, because it forced his corporate managers to gain a deeper understanding of company internal controls and financials.Today, says Mr Davis, who is an audit committee board member on both sides of the Atlantic, at General Motors and at BP, US regulators and accounting firms are more receptive to using materiality and common sense in assessing companies’ compliance with Sox.One of the harshest critics of Sox is Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the SEC. He calls Sarbanes-Oxley “relatively ineffective” and “hastily and badly drafted.” Mr Pitt says that Sox has fostered a tick-the-box mentality in corporate managers rather than an understanding of why risks exist.“The approach of the Combined Code is superior. The most significant thing is to get businesses to be an active participant in the regulation of their own conduct,” Mr Pitt says.
1;LNT;Alliant Energy Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
