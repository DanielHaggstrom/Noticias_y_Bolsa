0;DG;Dollar General Corp;2019-11-03T05:00:46Z;Dollar stores: buck country;Bargain hunting is cool with shops doing their bit to attract middle-class consumers;The US is a country where people regularly raise money on charitable website GoFundMe to pay their medical bills. It should come as no surprise there is a massive market for deep discount stores.Dollar outlets, or “poor people’s stores”, as Texas songwriter Kevin Russell calls them, are booming. The two largest — Dollar General and Dollar Tree (which also owns the Family Dollar chain) — operate more than 30,000 locations between them, up from the 18,000 in 2010. That is more than the total for Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, CVS and Walgreens.But even as dollar stores thrive, department stores like Macy’s and JCPenney are struggling to survive. Looking at their diverging fortunes, it is tempting to conclude the American middle class is in its death throes. From this point of view, the rise of deep discounters is a sign of growing income inequality - an alternative to the Gini coefficient calculated by economists.The reality is more complicated. Shares in Dollar General and Dollar Tree have hit regular record highs this year. But so have the equities of Walmart, TJX, Costco and Target. Their success suggests money is not made just by targeting the bottom of the economic pyramid. Rather, retailers that do well are those that know how to appeal to the shopper’s desire for value and convenience.One of the lasting effects of the Great Recession is that it has made bargain-hunting cool. The internet makes it easier than ever for shoppers to compare prices on goods. The problem with department stores is that they all sell apparel brands that can be found more cheaply elsewhere. Some middle-class shoppers buy their clothes at TJ Maxx out of choice. They top up their pantries with trips to dollar stores in the same bargain-hunting spirit.Dollar stores are also doing their bit to attract this breed of shopper. Having built its business on the back of canned and junk food, Dollar General is making a push into fresh produce and healthier offerings.Ironically, while bargain shopping may be on the rise, low-income households are the least likely to reap any real rewards. Instead of selling in bulk, the big dollar stores keep prices low by shrinking package sizes. This means shoppers often end up paying more on a per-ounce or per-item basis. Being poor is an expensive business.
1;DG;Dollar General Corp;2019-03-14T15:20:47Z;Dollar General forecasts slower sales growth for 2019;;Dollar General cautioned on Thursday that sales growth would slow this year and issued a profit outlook that fell short of expectations, in a sign the company’s core lower-income customers may be turning more cautious amid a possible slowdown in the American economy.Shares tumbled nearly 10 per cent in early trading on Thursday — setting the stock up for its biggest one-day drop since August 2016 — after the discount retailer said earnings for 2019 will come in at between $6.30 to $6.50 per share, against the median analyst forecast of $6.65.The company’s predictions for a 2.5 per cent rise in full-year same-store sales and a 7 per cent increase in overall sales also mark a climbdown from the 3.2 per cent and 9.2 per cent pace recorded in 2018.Tennessee-based Dollar General has up until recently been a rare bright spot in the US retail sector, which has been battered by consumers’ pivot to online shopping. The company has bucked this by becoming a convenient stop for budget-conscious customers across the country, including in rural areas where few rivals have a physical presence.The company said it planned to spend between $775m to $825m this year on new store openings and remodelings. It is ploughing money into improving store efficiency and ramping up its frozen and refrigerated food offerings.These investments come even as fourth-quarter results showed gross margins at the company were squeezed by discounting and the push into lower margin food sales.While net sales at Dollar General rose more than 8 per cent in the three months to February 1 to $6.65bn, ahead of the $6.61bn forecast by analysts, gross profit as a percentage of total sales fell more than 90 basis points to 31.2 per cent.“This gross profit rate decrease was primarily attributable to higher markdowns, lower initial mark-ups on inventory purchases, an increase in the LIFO provision, a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, and the sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category,” the company said.Shares in Dollar General gained more than 16 per cent in 2018 and hit a record high of $121.27 on Wednesday. They fell as much as 9.9 per cent on Thursday, but remain up 1.5 per cent for the year to date.
2;DG;Dollar General Corp;2019-02-10T12:00:24Z;Dollar store customers unconvinced by proposed change to pricing;Activist fund says inflation has made the discounter’s $1-an-item strategy untenable;A Manhattan-based hedge fund manager thinks he knows what is best for Dollar Tree. Starboard Value’s Jeff Smith argues the US discount variety chain should stop insisting on pricing every item — from spatulas to sunglasses — at only $1.But 760 miles away in suburban Nashville, customers are unconvinced. “They’d lose a lot of business,” reckons Vicky Lewis, 37, laden with bags in a Dollar Tree car park. “We need more affordable stores, not less.”The nurse returned to the Nashville area recently from a lengthy stint in California and was surprised at the cost of living. She visits the Madison dollar store frequently to supplement trips to Walmart and has just spent $12 on snacks for the family.Demand from customers such as Ms Lewis has fuelled a dollar store boom. The 2008 crisis turned tens of millions of Americans into newly frugal bargain hunters and the businesses have expanded rapidly ever since — in some areas, at the expense of local shops.The rise of discount retailing is a global phenomenon: so-called 100 Yen Shops are doing well in Japan, while the UK has several pound-store chains and the German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl are opening about 100 stores between them each year.In the US, the three largest domestic brands — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — now have more than 30,000 outlets, more than double the number of Starbucks cafés. Trump-voting rural towns are a particularly favoured location, although Dollar Tree is popular in the suburbs and the dowdier Family Dollar has a foothold in gritty inner-city areas.The Dollar Tree chain alone is opening stores at a rate of about six a week. Founded in 1986, the parent group now employs more than 56,000 people and is forecast to produce $23bn in revenues this year.Despite the seemingly unstoppable rise of value-focused retailing, Dollar Tree’s recent financial performance has underwhelmed. The company has struggled to revive the fortunes of the underperforming Family Dollar, which it bought in 2015 for about $9bn. Dollar Tree shares have lost 4 per cent over the past year while its rival Dollar General is up more than a fifth.Starboard, a $6bn fund that has pushed for change at other retailers including Macy’s and Staples, took a 1.7 per cent stake last month. Along with his call for the company to explore a sale of Family Dollar, Mr Smith has made his demand for it test differently priced items in Dollar Tree a centrepiece of the activist campaign.Dollar Tree was originally known as “Only $1.00” before it changed its name in 1993, but in contrast to the two other chains it has continued to sell everything for a buck.Its store in Madison, a northern suburb of Nashville, comprises a mix of items from pregnancy tests to batteries, bandages and bin bags. It also sells food. For Valentine’s day, the shop is packed with cards and heart-shaped knick-knacks. Much of its contents has been shipped from China.Starboard argues that inflation — one dollar in 1986 is worth about $2.30 today — has made the pricing strategy increasingly untenable. In a letter to Gary Philbin, chief executive, Mr Smith says the retailer had been forced to cut package sizes, reduce quality or stop selling some products that customers would otherwise buy.Rising world trade tensions only make matters worse by exacerbating inflationary pressures, he writes. In any case, says the Wharton-educated former M&A banker, sales tax means customers do not in practice pay $1 at the checkout. In Madison, customers pay $1.09. He argues the pricing rigidity has resulted in “meaningful underperformance”.So far, the company has been diplomatic in response, saying it welcomes “constructive input from shareholders”. But a fight is brewing. Starboard is pushing for seven directors to be added to the board. Dollar Tree, advised by JPMorgan Chase, says the hedge fund made its demand “without seeking any engagement”.“It could end up being quite nasty,” says John Strong, professor of finance and economics at William & Mary university.He says the activists have a point about the sustainability of the $1 strategy. So far, it has worked in part because the company has become more influential, giving it clout to pressure suppliers to reduce package sizes and otherwise tailor their products. “But at some point they’ll be faced with making that change,” says Prof Strong. “They’ve been trying to push that date as far off into the future as they can.”But Rupesh Parikh, analyst at Oppenheimer, says the company’s real problem is the poor state of Family Dollar stores and points to the risks of a different pricing strategy. “The concept might no longer be as differentiated versus peers,” he says.Back in Tennessee, Dollar Tree regular Noman Abdullah says it is the chain’s simplicity that attracts him: he knows everything will cost $1. “It’s the whole purpose of Dollar Tree.” Asked about Starboard’s “multi-price point” plan, he adds: “Honestly, that’s not a good idea.”Dollar Tree ran a trial more than a decade ago selling differently priced items, but abandoned it. Starboard argues the results were inconclusive and the test was poorly handled. It says Dollarama, a Canadian retailer that diversified its pricing strategy, is an example of how a changed approach can pay off.“There’s no reason to think it can’t also be successful at Dollar Tree,” adds Anthony Chukumba, analyst at Loop Capital.Whether or not the activists are successful, demand for dollar stores is showing few signs of sliding. Even in Nashville itself, which enjoys the lowest unemployment rate of any big city in the country, you need not venture far from the booming downtown area to see why dollar stores are doing a roaring trade.Less than half an hour walk from a glass tower being built to house AllianceBernstein, the asset manager moving its headquarters from New York, Relonna Reid has popped in to a Family Dollar for cigarettes.Despite her job as a phlebotomist, the mother of five says she feels “a pay cheque away from being homeless”.The shop near the Cayce Homes projects in east Nashville is a lifeline for the neighbourhood, she says. The product quality is not the best, but that is to be expected, she says, adding: “You can’t get mad if your broom breaks. You only paid a dollar for it.”
3;DG;Dollar General Corp;2018-12-04T13:19:29Z;Dollar General cuts outlook amid hurricane-related losses;;Dollar General lowered its full-year outlook on Tuesday, as a particularly devastating hurricane season resulted in a bigger than expected hit to the company’s top and bottom lines.Shares in the discount retailer fell more than 7 per cent in pre-market trading after the company said it now expected 2018 earnings to come in at between $5.85 to $6.05 per diluted share, 10 cents lower than the range it gave just three months ago.Sales are also expected to increase at the bottom end of its previous guidance of 9-9.3 per cent, while operating margins will see a slight drop compared to last year. Dollar General had previously guided no change to margins.“As a result of the third quarter hurricanes and other disasters, we will record greater-than-anticipated expenses in the second half of 2018,” said John Garratt, Dollar General’s chief financial officer.Dollar General, which runs over 15,200 stores across the US, is the latest company to see its guidance blown off course by Hurricane Florence, which brought record-setting floods to the Carolinas in September, and Hurricane Michael, a category four storm that left a trail of death and destruction in the Florida panhandle.Delta warned in October that it would take a $30m hit to its third-quarter earnings as a result of Hurricane Florence.The blow from Mother Nature comes as retailers across the board are grappling with higher freight costs. The tight jobs market, which has resulted in a dearth of truck drivers, and higher fuel costs have been driving up trucking rates since late last year.Rival Dollar Tree cut its full-year outlook last week amid mounting shipping and logistics costs. Dollar General said on Tuesday that “ongoing transportation cost pressures” as one of the reasons for the 39 basis point drop in third quarter gross profit margin.The weaker guidance overshadowed what was otherwise a solid third quarter performance.Net sales for the three months to November 2 rose 8.7 per cent to $6.42bn, topping forecasts for $6.38bn. Within this, like for like sales increased 2.8 per cent, also ahead of the 2.4 per cent rise the markets had expected.Net income of $334m, or $1.26 per diluted share, came in a shade below $1.27 per share.
4;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar General sales rise but profitability measure dips;Discounter offered deeper markdowns in latest period;Dollar General posted brisk revenue growth in its latest fiscal quarter, but a measure of profitability ticked lower after a greater portion of its sales came from lower-margin products and the discount retailer offered deeper markdowns.Same-store sales, an important metric for retailers, climbed 3.7 per cent in the fiscal quarter that ran to August 3, the group said on Thursday. Net sales jumped to $6.4bn from $5.8bn in the same period in 2017, lifted by the growth in like for like sales as well as contributions from new stores.However, gross profit as a percentage of total sales dipped to 30.65 per cent from 30.72 per cent. Dollar General said the metric had taken a hit “primarily” because a larger share of sales came from consumables, like food, paper and cleaning products, “which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories.”The Tennessee-based group said the fall was also partly attributable to “higher markdowns and increased transportation costs.”It said the decline was “partially offset” by “higher initial mark-ups on inventory purchases” as well as lower “shrink”, an industry term that refers to falls in inventory due to theft and loss.Dollar General’s shares dropped 3.3 per cent in pre-market trade in New York after the release of the results. They had risen 14.7 per cent for the year to date as of Wednesday’s closing level.Net income in the second fiscal quarter climbed to $407.2m from $294.8m in the same three-month period the previous year.The group on Thursday also edged up its sales forecasts for the fiscal year ending on February 1, 2019. It now expects net sales to rise 9 — 9.3 per cent, from its previous estimate of about 9 per cent. Meanwhile, same-store sales are expected to climb in the “mid-to-high two per cent range” from “mid-two per cent” previously.
5;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar Tree, Dollar General sales chilled by cold spring;;It was a rough quarter for dollar store operators. Shares in sector leaders Dollar Tree and Dollar General are down sharply on Thursday after an unusually cold spring hit sales growth at the two discount retailers and prompted the former to cut its full-year outlook.Dollar Tree skidded 12 per cent — the most in more than two months — to $84.99, while Dollar General dropped 7.4 per cent to $89.28, putting it on track for its biggest one-day decline in 21 months.The moves come after Dollar Tree said same-store sales, a gauge of performance in stores open at least a year, rose 1.4 per cent in the three months to May 5. That is lower by nearly half than the consensus estimate for a 2.6 per cent rise. While revenue rose 5 per cent to $5.55bn during the period, it also undershot Wall Street’s forecast of $5.57bn. Net profit fell by a fifth to $160.5m as higher freight costs and a sharp rise in interest and refinancing expenses related to its $5bn debt pile ate into its bottom line. The company, which runs nearly 15,000 stores across the US under the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree brand, said it now expects full-year earnings to be $4.80 to $5.10 per share. That is down from its previous forecast of between $5.25 to $5.60 a share and well below the average analyst estimate of $5.64 a share.“We expect higher freight and diesel costs to continue,” said Kevin Wampler, chief financial officer, in a call with analysts. “These costs are trending higher than our original guidance, and we reflected that in our updated outlook.”Mr Wampler also flagged up higher wage costs as another cost pressure. Across the US, employers are struggling to fill positions amid a tight labour market and steady wage growth.Having bucked the general malaise that has roiled the wider brick-and-mortar retail sector over the past couple of years by focusing on budget-conscious Americans, some are wondering if the sector’s era of strong growth could be coming to an end as consumers, flush with more disposable income, splash out on more expensive goods.Concerns over slowing growth were heightened by results from rival Dollar General. Same-store sales at the Tennessee-based group rose 2.1 per cent during the first quarter, below the 3.24 per cent growth expected by analysts.Dollar General blamed the miss on “unseasonably cold and damp weather”, which weighed on demand for spring clothing and gardening supplies. It maintained its full-year sales and earnings targets. Revenue came in 9 per cent higher at $6.1bn thanks to new store openings. Net income was 30 per cent higher at $364.8m as the company reaped the benefit of lower corporate tax rates in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s reforms.Photo credit: AFP/Getty Images
6;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar General climbs as sales, outlook top estimates;;Dollar General shares were flying off the shelves on Thursday after the discount retailer delivered better-than-expected fourth quarter sales growth and issued full-year guidance that also topped analysts’ expectations.The stock jumped more than 8 per cent in pre-market trading. If that gain holds once the market opens, that would put it on track for its best day in more than two years.Same-store sales rose 3.3 per cent in the three months to Feburary 2, Dollar General said, as price conscious shoppers flocked to its stores to stock up on everything from cut price sodas to laundry detergents. The figure easily vaulted past Wall Street forecast for a 2.5 per cent increase.Overall net sales came in at $6.1bn, a 2 per cent rise from the year ago period. The gain was boosted by better inventory control and less discounting, both of which helped offset the effect of sales loss from store closures and one less trading week compared to last year.Net income jumped 72 per cent year-on-year to $712.1m during the quarter as the company also reaped in the benefit of US tax reforms. Stripping this out, adjusted net income was $1.48 per diluted share, in line with forecasts.Like rival Dollar Tree and off-price retailers like TJMaxx, Dollar General has benefited from Americans’ love for a good deal.Its popularity with bargain hunters helped it buck the malaise that has roiled the wider US retail sector.Looking ahead, it is forecasting net sales to increase 9 per cent for the fiscal 2018 year on same-store sales growth in the “mid-two per cent range.” Full-year earnings are expected to be between $5.95 to $6.15 per diluted share.The market was looking net sales increase of around 8.5 per cent and diluted EPS of $5.56.“As we move into 2018, we continue to build momentum behind initiatives that we believe will further enhance our strong value and convenience proposition with consumers and drive long-term success,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer.(Photo: AP)

8;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar General: buck stops here;Market value of the no-frills chain is treble that of Macy’s;To such indicators of inequality as the Gini coefficient may be added the shares of US dollar stores. Dollar General, which upgraded full-year forecasts on Thursday, has soared with the S&P 500, even as other bricks-and-mortar retailers have languished. With tax reform set to make poor Americans poorer, there is a bull case for backing stores that cater to them.Dollar General shoppers merit no mockery for asking what items cost, as they might at genuine single-price retailers such as rival Dollar Tree. Variable pricing permits a more varied range. Most homewares and foods still cost less than $10. A rural store estate covers the hinterland Wall Streeters refer to as “the real America”.Hard discounters have not challenged old-fashioned chains in the US in quite the same way as in the over-grocered UK. The contrast in their fortunes is still stark. Dollar General’s market worth of $24.8bn is treble that of department store chain Macy’s and 56 times bombed-out Sears.This reflects a position clear of the path of the Amazon steam roller. Shoppers typically spend about $12 at a no-frills local store on a few items they need immediately. That supported a 4.3 per cent increase in comparable space sales in the third quarter, emboldening folksy chief executive Todd Vasos to forecast 2017 like-for-likes 2.5 per cent higher.The Tennessee-based retailer will add 1,285 outlets to its 14,000-store estate this year. Leased occupancy will mitigate the financial strain, with forecast capex of about $725m lower than free cash flow, according to S&P Global.The finances of many Dollar General customers will be rockier. Tax reforms recently approved by the Senate would mean families living on less than $40,000 a year will be up to $550 a year worse off by 2023, according to a PBS analysis. A forward earnings multiple of 19 times is the only thing about Dollar General that is pricey. It is justified by demographics alone.Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions. Sign up at ft.com/newsletters.
9;DG;Dollar General Corp;2017-12-07T17:29:36Z;Hurricane purchases give boost to Dollar General;US stocks climb with Lululemon lifted by quarterly results;Dollar General shares perked up after it reported better than expected sales growth thanks to a bump from hurricane-related purchases.Tennessee-based Dollar General’s shares rose 3.3 per cent to $93.84 after it said same-store sales — a key industry metric — jumped 4.3 per cent year on year in the three-month period ending November 3, versus expectations for a smaller 2.3 per cent gain, according to the consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.This took its year-to-date gain to 23 per cent. Dollar General credited the hurricanes with a 30 to 35 basis point benefit, along with increases in customer traffic and average transaction amounts.Net sales rose 11 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9bn, topping estimates for $5.8bn.While the storms helped drive sales growth, they also damped Dollar General’s bottom line. The company said net income for the quarter of $252.5m, or 93 cents a share, took a 5 cent per share hit from hurricane-related expenses at its stores.That prompted Dollar General to tweak its full-year diluted earnings per share estimate to $4.37-$4.47 compared with the previous range of $4.35-$4.50.However, it raised its full-year 2017 guidance for same-store sales growth to 2.5 per cent, against previous projections for sales growth to come in at about 2 per cent. It also expected revenue growth to come in at the top of its previous 5 to 7 per cent guidance.Dollar General has been a rare bright spot in the US retail sector, which has been battered in recent years by consumers’ pivot to online shopping.The retailer, by contrast, has been expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint in the hope of becoming a convenient stop for budget-conscious customers across the country.“We continue to believe that investing in the business through our high-return new store growth is the best use of our capital to help drive long-term shareholder value,” said chief executive Todd Vasos.Dollar General’s advance came as US stocks edged up on Thursday. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 2,633.83, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 24,163.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 6,813.22.Elsewhere, Lululemon shares rose nearly 8 per cent to $72.86 after the Canadian company known for its yoga gear delivered better than expected third-quarter results and its chief executive lifted its full-year outlook, noting he was “energised” by its momentum.Net revenues rose 14 per cent from a year ago to $619m, topping estimates of $609.9m, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Total same-store sales — which include sales both online and in stores that have been open at least 12 months — rose 8 per cent.Profits slid to $58.9m, or 43 cents a share, in the three months to October 29, compared with $68.3m, or 50 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter, with the decline reflecting $22m in costs tied to restructuring of ivivva, its brand for girls. Adjusted earnings of 56 cents a share topped estimates.That prompted Lululemon to boost its outlook for full-year adjusted earnings to a range of between $2.45 to $2.48 a share, up from the $2.35 to $2.42 that it had forecast in August.Elsewhere, LendingClub shares touched an all-time low of $3.29 after the personal loan provider issued a disappointing outlook at its investor day but trimmed its losses to trade about 13 per cent lower by midday.
10;DG;Dollar General Corp;2017-12-07T15:49:14Z;Dollar General finds the silver lining in stormy quarter;;The hurricanes that pummelled the US earlier this year didn’t dampen Dollar General’s sales growth.The discount retailer saw its shares rise on Thursday after it reported better-than-expected sales growth in the past quarter, thanks to a bump from hurricane-related purchases.Tennessee-based Dollar General said that same-store-sales — a key industry metric — jumped 4.3 per cent year-over-year in the three-month period ending November 3, versus expectations for a smaller 2.3 per cent gain, according to the consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. It credited the hurricanes with a 30 to 35 basis point benefit, along with increases in customer traffic and average transaction amounts.Net sales rose 11 per cent from a year earlier to $5.9bn, topping estimates for $5.8bn.While the storms helped drive sales growth, they also dampened Dollar General’s bottom line. The company said that net income for the quarter of $252.5m, or 93 cents a share, took a 5 cent-per-share hit from hurricane-related expenses at its stores. That prompted Dollar General to tweak its full-year diluted earnings per share estimate to $4.37-$4.47, compared to the prior range of $4.35-$4.50.However, it raised its full-year 2017 guidance for same-store sales growth to 2.5 per cent, versus previous projections for sales growth to come in at about 2 per cent, and said it expects revenue growth to come in at the top of its previous 5 to 7 per cent guidance.The results helped boost Dollar General shares 3.3 per cent in Thursday trading, to $93.84, extending its year-to-date gain of about 23 per cent.Dollar General has been a rare bright spot in the US retail sector, which has been battered in recent years by consumers’ pivot to online shopping. Dollar General, by contrast, has been expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint in hopes of becoming a convenient stop for budget-conscious customers across the country, including in rural areas where few rivals have a physical presence.“We continue to believe that investing in the business through our high-return new store growth is the best use of our capital to help drive long-term shareholder value,” said Dollar General chief executive Todd Vasos.The company’s results “demonstrate that not all segments of retail are hurting”, Moody’s vice-president Mickey Chadha said.“We believe that Dollar General will continue to benefit from convenient smaller shopping locations, making it faster to shop than larger format discounters. The combination of low prices, broad assortment, and convenience will allow Dollar General to continue to grow as the income demographic primarily shopping at the stores has a limited amount of dollars to spend per visit and continues to find the value proposition very attractive.”
11;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;High and low-end shops defy US retail gloom;;The missing middle class was on display on Thursday as retail earnings showed growth at both the high and low ends of the shopping spectrum.Shares in Williams-Sonoma, an upmarket lifestyle retailer, gained nearly 4 per cent on an earnings beat. Likewise, shares in Dollar General, the discount retailer of everyday items, jumped as much as 2.5 per cent after beating estimates for sales growth.Both retailers performed well during the holiday shopping season. Williams-Sonoma chief Laura Alber said it was “one of the best” for the company, which has been hit by slower consumer spending and rising competition, forcing it to repeatedly trim the top end of its full year sales and earnings forecasts in recent quarters.The owner of West Elm and Pottery Barn reported earnings of $145m, or $1.63 a share, in the three months to end of January, compared with $141m, or $1.55 a share, in the prior year period.Higher margins on the merchandise and supply chain efficiencies drove earnings, while sales fell slightly to $1.582bn, compared with $1.586bn a year ago as growth at its kitchen retail chain William Sonoma and West Elm furniture stores helped offset some of the sales slide at Pottery Barn.“From an operational perspective, we executed one of our best holiday seasons and delivered an improved customer experience, which is at the center of everything we do,” Ms Alber said. “Entering 2017, we will continue to improve performance and increase our competitive advantage, with a focus on innovation in e-commerce, our products and service and the retail experience.”At Dollar General, where the focus is on items $10 or less, declines in foot traffic moderated in the fourth quarter. Lower discretionary spending has plagued the retailer but as consumer confidence picks up, sales at the national chain have increased.The company reported earnings ahead of expectations at $414m, or $1.49 a share for the quarter to February 3, compared with $376m, or $1.30 a share, in the period one year ago. Meanwhile, same-store sales, a key industry metric, grew 0.9 per cent, as net sales across the company also grew.Revenue increased 13.7 per cent to $6.01bn, ahead of expectations for $5.96bn.Not all retailers shared in a profitable quarter, or are expecting growth in the next quarter however. Shares in Guess fell 11 per cent, their biggest decline in a year, after the apparel maker lowered its guidance for the first quarter of 2017.Lower foot traffic has plagued the middle-market apparel brand, which has been closing stores and negotiating for rent reductions.The company expects a loss in the range of 33 to 30 cents per share in the next quarter. It reported an 86 per cent decrease in fourth quarter earnings to just $6.6m, from $47.8m in the period one year ago.
12;DG;Dollar General Corp;2016-12-01T20:11:47Z;Dollar General: be cents-ible;Chain must balance its growth ambitions with the pressure on its profitability;Forget all that market chatter about impending inflation and higher interest rates ahead of the new Trump administration, US discount stores still have to contend with deflationary pressures.Dollar General, the chain from Tennessee, reported its second consecutive quarter of earnings below analysts’ expectations. It also said that it expected full-year profits to rise only at the low end of its target range. The company needs to balance its growth ambitions with the pressure on its profitability.Management cites deflationary pricing pressures as being partially responsible. But the results also highlight that its typical consumer is in declining health and facing increasing housing and healthcare expenses. About 56 per cent of stores are in locations where food stamp benefits were cut during 2016.Dollar General estimates that price deflation and the reduction in benefit programmes contributed to 1.5 per cent lower year-on-year growth in same-store sales, resulting in a slight fall overall this quarter over last year.Total revenues rose 5 per cent, the second slowest quarter since mid-2008. The impact of pricing pressure and promotions caused gross margins to decline below 30 per cent for the first time since May 2009. Overheads were at the high end of the past five years. Costs may still increase after new rules relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act come into effect in December.The company maintains that its strategy of reducing prices started to show results during the quarter. Once prices increase in the wider economy, the incremental benefits earned by this strategy should boost earnings momentum during the recovery. That is the plan, at least.Nice in theory, but Dollar General’s expansion cannot continue regardless of margins. The company plans to add roughly 1,000 stores next year. But pushing to increase sales while margins decline is a risky path to follow.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
13;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Discount chain Dollar General posts downbeat results;;Investors soured on Dollar General shares after the discount retailer reported disappointing third-quarter results and said it expects full-year earnings growth in the low end of its range as the retail environment remained “challenging”.Shares in the Tennessee-based chain fell nearly 5 per cent in pre-market trading after the company said it expects full-year earnings growth to come in at the low end of its 10 to 15 per cent range. By contrast rival Dollar Tree, which acquired Family Dollar in 2014, lifted its profit outlook for the holiday season.Dollar General’s expectations accompanied a slump in third quarter profits to $253m or 84 cents a share, down from $253.3m or 86 cents a share in the year ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 89 cents a share, missed analysts’ estimates of 93 cents.Meanwhile, net sales climbed 5 per cent to $5.32bn, driven by a drop off in traffic that was partially offset by higher spending per average transaction. That was just shy of analysts’ estimates for $5.36bn.Like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, slid 0.1 per cent, missing expectations for a 0.8 per cent gain.“We are focused on efforts to drive traffic in our stores and to control the factors we can control as we look to overcome the issues impacting our results, many of which we believe are macroeconomic and transitory in nature,” Todd Vasos, chief executive, said.Dollar General shares are up nearly 8 per cent so far this year.
14;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US discounters rise on robust earnings;Shares in Dollar Tree and Dollar General gain on higher customer traffic;Dollar Tree and Dollar General shares climbed to all-time highs on Thursday after the US discount chains logged better than expected quarterly earnings, suggesting demand held up even as the American economy struggled early in the year.Dollar Tree, which closed its buyout of Family Dollar Stores last July, said its net profits rose to $232.7m in the quarter to the end of April from $69.5m in the same three-month period in the previous year. Adjusted earnings, which exclude certain items, clocked in at 89 cents a share, topping Wall Street estimates of 81 cents.The group also lifted its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.58-$3.80, from $3.35-$3.65.Dollar Tree added that its like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, increased by 2.3 per cent on a constant currency basis, propelled by increases in customer transactions and average ticket prices, in spite of what chief executive Bob Sasser described as a “challenging economic environment”.Rival Dollar General also benefited from higher customer traffic and sale prices, saying on Thursday that its like-for-like sales in the quarter to April 29 rose 2.2 per cent. Meanwhile, net income climbed 16.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $295.1m. Earnings per share of $1.03 beat analyst expectations of 95 cents.The bullish performance by the dollar stores is in contrast to a tough first quarter for department stores such as Sears, Macy’s and Nordstrom, which have come under pressure from e-commerce groups like Amazon and off-price retailers.Dollar Tree’s shares rallied 12.8 per cent to $88.37, while Dollar General rose 4.6 per cent to $88.01.Elsewhere, US Foods, the private-equity backed food distributor, climbed in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.The group priced 44.4m shares at $23 each late on Wednesday, raising $1.02bn in one of the biggest initial public offerings of the year. US Food’s shares climbed 8.3 per cent to $24.91.The S&P 500 utilities sector, which has struggled in recent days as Federal Reserve commentary has prompted investors to bet that a rate increase may come this summer, climbed by 1.1 per cent on Thursday.Consolidated Edison, a power company, climbed 1.3 per cent to $72.73, while Duke Energy also advanced by 1.3 per cent to $77.96.The broader market was mostly unchanged as investors reassessed their positions after two days of solid gains for US equities. At the close, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,090.1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.1 per cent to 17,828.3 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 4,901.8.The S&P 500 is back in the black for 2016, but some market strategists have warned that the US economy may need to show more signs of improvement for the rally to be sustainable. Indeed, a report on Thursday showed orders for capital goods excluding certain volatile components, seen as a gauge of business investment, missed expectations in April.“In order to reach a sustainable higher level of growth, business investment will need to increase, taking some of the growth burden off of the consumer. So far there are scant signs of an increase in capex spending,” said Dennis DeBusschere, head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI.
15;DG;Dollar General Corp;2016-03-10T21:47:35Z;Dollar General buoyed by upbeat results;Main indices lower as traders take in latest ECB rate cut;Dollar General was the best performing stock on the S&P 500 on Thursday after the budget retailer reported better than expected fourth-quarter profits as sales of sweets, food and tobacco jumped.Shares in Dollar General advanced more than 10.5 per cent to $83.21 after the retailer said profits climbed to $376.2m, or $1.30 a share, compared with $355.4m, or $1.17 a share, in the year ago period. That topped estimates for earnings of $1.26 a share.Net sales climbed 7 per cent to $5.3bn, in line with forecasts. Meanwhile, same-store sales advanced 2.2 per cent, ahead of estimates for a 1.9 per cent gain.The Tennessee-based company provided a long-term outlook for 7 to 10 per cent sales growth and 10 to 15 per cent earnings growth. Fiscal 2016 sales and earnings growth are expected to arrive at the high end of their respective ranges.Dollar General, which lost a protracted battle with rival Dollar Tree to acquire Family Dollar last year, also said it was targeting a 2 to 4 per cent same-store sales growth over the long term, with comparable sales expected to be near the middle of that range this year.The shift to longer-term guidance made sense, said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, due to “what we sense is an increasing shift towards ‘profitable growth’ as opposed to being hyper-focused on market share gains and total top-line growth”.“Given investor concerns regarding Dollar General over the last few quarters, we believe this outlook is highly favourable and should help ease some of that investor anxiety,” he added.Shares in Dollar General have advanced more than 17.7 per cent since the beginning of last year, compared with a 3.4 per cent decline in the S&P 500.More skiing on the slopes and greater spending on food at Vail Resorts, the owner of the most famous ski resort in the Rocky Mountains, wasn’t enough to lift its share price.Its shares dropped 4 per cent to $127.60 on a day in which the wider market saw choppy trading. Vail Resorts generated 20 per cent more revenue from lift passes than a year ago, helped by better snowfall at the Tahoe resort in California.Overall, revenues for the second quarter climbed to $599m in the quarter to the end of January from $463m a year earlier. Profits edged up to $117m from $115.7m.However, the resort warned that, while demand from US skiers was buoyant in the quarter, appetite from Brazil, Canada and the UK weakened. The drop in the company’s stock comes after a period in which it’s strongly outperformed the US stock market.Vail Resort shares are up 40 per cent since the start of 2015.Elsewhere, shares in mobile payments company Square fell 6.1 per cent to $11.30 after the company said its net loss widened in the fourth quarter, even as sales climbed above analysts’ expectations.US stocks were flat as traders digested the latest decision by the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest rates to a fresh low and boost its quantitative easing programme.At the close, the S&P 500 was level at 1,989, as was the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 16,995, while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 4,662.

That topped Wall Street’s estimate of $1.26 a share.Dollar General, which last year lost a protracted battle with rival Dollar Tree to acquire Family Dollar, said it’s targeting 2 to 4 per cent same-store sales growth over the long term, with this year’s number expected to be in the middle of the range.The shift to a longer-term guidance makes sense according to Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, who said “given what we sense is an increasing shift towards ‘profitable growth’ as opposed to being hyper focused on market share gains and total top-line growth”.Dollar General and other discount retailers have done well since the financial crisis. Shares in Dollar General have advanced more than 15 per cent since the start of last year.
17;DG;Dollar General Corp;2016-03-01T12:58:53Z;Dollar Tree shares slide on disappointing outlook, sales miss;;Dollar Tree shares slid out of favour with investors after the budget retailer issued disappointing full-year earnings outlook and lower than expected fourth quarter sales during a “challenging economic environment”, according to chief executive Bob Sasser.Shares in the Virginia-based retailer fell 6.5 per cent in pre-market trading, after the company said it expects to earn between $3.35 to $3.65 a share, below analysts’ estimates for earnings of $3.78 a share.Meanwhile, it expects sales in the range of $20.76bn to $21.1bn, compared with estimates for $21bn.The news came alongside fourth-quarter profits of $229m or 97 cents a share, compared with $206m or $1 a share in the year ago period. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $1.07 a share. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.01 a share also turned up shy.Net sales more than doubled to $5.37bn — the mid-point of its guidance — helped by its acquisition of Family Dollar last year but missed expectations for $5.41bn.Dollar Tree won a long-drawn battle with rival Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar last year, but analysts have warned that the benefits of the acquisition could take longer to come about.But the company is expected to do well if the US economic growth continues to slow, as dollar-stores are resilient to macro slowdowns, when consumers tend to be more thrifty.Dollar Tree shares have advanced 14 per cent since the start of last year, compared with a 6 per cent decline for the S&P 500.

Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 37 cents a share on sales of $2.4bn.Hormel, based in Minnesota, said the “strong earnings performance” in the quarter had prompted it to raise its full-year earnings forecast to $1.50-$1.56 a share, compared with its previous outlook for $1.43-$1.48. That topped expectations for $1.47 a share.The shares advanced more than 7 per cent to $44.44, taking their rise over the past 12 months to 59.5 per cent.At a time when concerns about the trajectory of the US economy are on the rise, analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded US discount retailers Dollar General and Dollar Tree, citing “the sector’s resilience to any macro slowdown”.Shares in Dollar General climbed 3.7 per cent to $73.04 after the move from “equalweight” to “overweight”. Its price target rose to $95 from $80.Dollar Tree, which last year won a drawn-out battle with Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar, rose 4.4 per cent to $78.55 after an upgrade from “underweight” to “equalweight”. Its price target was raised 38 per cent to $90.Groupon shares jumped 41.2 per cent to $4.08 after Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce juggernaut, revealed that it had bought nearly 33m shares in the US coupons company in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Friday.The purchase makes Alibaba the fourth-largest shareholder in Groupon with a 5.6 per cent stake.Financials advanced for a second trading day after JPMorgan upgraded two US banks citing their “excellent capital position”.Shares in Goldman Sachs climbed 2 per cent to $149.02 after analysts raised the stock from “underweight” to “overweight” and lifted their price target from $170 to $180.Morgan Stanley gained 2.7 per cent to $23.72 after the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” and the price target was lowered 12 per cent to $29.Shares of banks were under pressure this month amid declining expectations of US interest rate rises and concerns about their energy exposure after the swoon in crude prices.After being closed on Monday for Presidents’ Day, US markets reopened on the front foot, even as crude prices swung sharply after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to freeze oil output at January levels.At the close, the S&P 500 had risen 1.7 per cent to 1,895.58, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.4 per cent to 16,196.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.3 per cent to 4,435.96.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
19;DG;Dollar General Corp;2016-02-16T18:17:34Z;It’s time to buy US discount retailers – Morgan;;Concerns are rising over a slowdown in US economic growth … and that could bode well for discount retailers.Analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded Dollar General and Dollar Tree citing the discount sector’s “resiliency to any macro slowdown”, as consumers tend to be more thrifty in tougher economic times. They also noted that the sector is better insulated from the threat posed by online shopping.Vincent Sinisi, an analyst at Morgan Stanley said:Given greater likelihood of low or negative growth macro scenarios (positive for the Dollar Stores), with a decreased likelihood of high macro growth, we now see more favorable risk/reward skews for the stocks.Comparable sales at dollar stores climbed in 2008 as economic conditions were worsening and peaked at 10 per cent in 2009. As the economy began to recover in the years after, same-store sales in the industry began to moderate.Shares in Dollar General, climbed 4.6 per cent to $73.70 on Tuesday after the analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “equalweight” and lifted their price target on the stock to $95 from $80.Meanwhile, shares in Dollar Tree, which last year won a long-drawn battle with rival Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar, rose 4 per cent to $78.38 after the retailer was upgraded to “equalweight” from “underweight” and its price target was raised 38 per cent to $90.

21;DG;Dollar General Corp;2015-06-25T16:28:15Z;Discount retail: no passing fad;The enduring appeal of US ‘variety’ stores should settle nerves around the UK’s pound stores;"Yours for a quid: a set of five screwdrivers, a ball of purple wool, a pair of sunglasses, or a traditional pint glass with a handle. These are some of the most popular items this week at discount chain Poundland.The past few years have been good for pound stores. As supermarkets over-invested in big out-of-town sites, Poundland, Wilkinson and Poundstretcher moved into the high street slots vacated by general retailers such as Woolworths. Hard-pressed consumers poured in. Poundland and B&M floated last year and are opening new stores while supermarkets retrench. Their shares trade on above-average earnings multiples.But Poundland recently reported slowing sales growth. It blamed timing issues and unusually strong comparatives — but its shares were marked down and are not far above their IPO price. Some wonder whether the novelty of cheap has worn off, especially for consumers whose wages are finally rising again.The experience of the US, where the “variety store” sector has a long history, suggests it is premature to write off the sector as a passing fad. The big three — Dollar Tree, Dollar General and Family Dollar — together own 24,500 stores, more than McDonald's and Starbucks combined and roughly one for every 12,900 Americans. The penetration of the main UK operators is half that.US chains have also been public companies for a long time. Their stock prices display little correlation with economic output or wages. They prosper during recessions, but have also grown during boom times, and they tend to have higher returns on capital than their UK peers.Variety stores have moved into grocery, tobacco and alcohol retailing. There has been consolidation, too; Dollar Tree is acquiring Family Dollar. The same is now happening in the UK, where Poundland is acquiring 99p Stores. In the world of £1 sunglasses, no one wins by standing still.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.92bn driven by an improvement in customer traffic and average transaction amount.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 82 cents a share on sales of $4.94bn.Dollar General said same-store sales, a key industry metric, gained 3.7 per cent, missing estimates for a 4.1 per cent gain.“We were looking for slightly better sales performance given the improvements we have seen in blue-collar labour trends and modest upward pressure on wages — although the gas price tailwind is rapidly losing steam due to the rebound in gas and oil prices,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Dollar General maintained its full-year earnings guidance in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share and said it expects sales to rise 8-9 per cent.Shares of Dollar General, which have gained 39 per cent in the past year, rose 3 per cent to $74.92.PVH Corp was one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the retailer, which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, topped first quarter adjusted earnings forecasts and lifted its full-year earnings guidance on Monday.The New York-based company increased its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $6.85 to $6.95 a share from an earlier forecast for $6.75 to $6.90 a share. The projections compared to Wall Street estimates for full-year earnings of $6.86 a share.The outlook accompanied PVH’s first-quarter results, which showed profits tripled from a year earlier to $114.1m, or $1.37 a share, in the three months to May 3. Sales declined 4 per cent to $1.9bn, in line with expectations.PVH shares jumped 7 per cent to $112.13.Iron Mountain shares slid 6 per cent to $34.68 after analysts at Jefferies downgraded the US storage and information management company to “underperform” from “hold” and lowered their price target to $29 from $33.“Iron Mountain was once a beacon of stability but steepening declines in paper usage and ever cheaper cloud storage . . . should result in a further deterioration in Iron Mountain’s already battered North America storage rental organic growth,” said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies.The company agreed to acquire Recall Holdings earlier this year, but Mr Dolev said this would not resolve its “chronic cash shortfall” and that Iron Mountain would likely have to issue equity or raise debt to avoid cutting its dividend.Airlines stocks were under renewed pressure on Tuesday after Delta Air Lines warned that a key industry metric, PRASM, or passenger revenue per available seat mile, fell 5.5 per cent in May from a year earlier. Shares of the US carrier shrunk nearly 3 per cent to $43.21, while the NYSE Arca Airline index fell as much as 1.5 per cent before paring back losses.US stocks were modestly lower as Greek debt talks continues and utilities lagged behind the benchmark S&P 500.The S&P 500 declined 0.1 per cent to 2,109.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 18,011.94.

23;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar store M&A: breaking the buck;Family Dollar deal shows cash is not always king;"Cash is king; top dollar wins. These are the hard rules of commerce. The US discount retailer Dollar General may soon learn that they have painful exceptions.Last summer its rival Family Dollar announced a sale to another discounter, Dollar Tree (creative names are not necessary in the discount retail sector). Dollar General was shocked, and argued that it did not get a fair shot at its own deal with Family Dollar. However, better late than never, Dollar General showed up with an $80 per share cash offer in September. At least financially it exceeded Dollar Tree’s initial $74.50 deal in cash and shares. But instead of what might have been a clear victory for Dollar General, a deciding shareholder vote on the Dollar Tree deal awaits on January 22. The highest price will not necessarily be the winner.Family Dollar and Dollar Tree have kept their deal intact because Family Dollar does not believe a tie-up with Dollar General would survive antitrust scrutiny — regulators would worry about pricing power of retailers serving those of limited means. Dollar General has offered some comfort by saying it is willing to divest 1,500 stores if asked, and pay a $500m break-up fee.Yet Dollar General has still not offered the most compelling form of risk mitigation: a so-called “hell or high water” provision in the merger contract. That would bind it to close a deal whatever the size of divestitures regulators demand. Without such a feature, Dollar General effectively has a $500m option to decide later if it wishes to complete the transaction.Family Dollar shares now trade above $78. Dollar Tree’s cash and stock offer is worth just $77. So the market is betting that one or both suitors will sweeten its bid to claim decisive victory. A more interesting question than simple price, however, is whether the sweetener will come in the form of more shares, more cash, or better deal terms.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"

Several economists argued the data would moderate any hawkish shift at the US central bank.Since January, the S&P 500 utilities index has lagged behind only the healthcare sector, rising 14 per cent.The payroll figures moderately lowered expectations that the US central bank would increase rates by March next year, as eurodollar futures for the date rose.“While the data is a significant disappointment, most participants will want to place the numbers in the context of a string of strong numbers,” Alan Ruskin, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said. “Nonetheless, this is the kind of data that staves off risks of a more hawkish Fed at the September Federal Open Market Committee.”Barclays strategists note the utility sector is the most negatively correlated sector to higher interest rates. Investors tend to use utilities as a proxy for the bond market as most companies in the sector have stable dividend yields, Barclays says.NRG Energy climbed 2 per cent to $30.99, Xcel Energy rose 2 per cent to $32.41, PG&E advanced 2 per cent to $47.90 and American Electric Power increased 1 per cent to $53.68. In afternoon trading, the 30 utility stocks on the S&P 500 were all higher.Strategists with RBC Capital Markets added the strong August rebound, which sent stocks to record heights, was showing evidence of a peak. The benchmark S&P 500, for instance, has struggled for direction over the past four days and has ended lower on most.“Rapid sector rotation is likely to remain the dominant technical theme within the equity market, consistent with the pattern of the last few years,” RBC’s Robert Sluymer said.Michael Kors shares were under pressure after it said Sportswear Holdings would sell its remaining stake in the company.Sportswear was the largest shareholder with a 52 per cent stake when Michael Kors first went public.Michael Kors shares fell 4 per cent to $76.67, although analysts with Wells Fargo said the sale could benefit the company if it chose to purchase its Chinese licensing rights, which are jointly held by Sportwear, Michael Kors himself and chief executive John Idol.“There are fewer conflicts of interest, and it seems less likely the price paid will be biased [to be too high],” Paul Lejuez, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Gap followed Michael Kors lower, declining 5 per cent to $44.29, after the retailer said same-store sales at its Old Navy, Banana Republic and namesake chain missed Wall Street forecasts in August.Overall, same-store sales fell 2 per cent, compared with expectations for a 1.7 per cent gain. The company blamed its Gap brand for the weak results, where comparable sales fell 6 per cent – more than offsetting an improvement at Old Navy.Analysts with FBR Capital Markets warned increased clearance items could weigh on margins, despite new autumn apparel arriving in stores this September.Rival mall-based retailers also declined on Friday. Urban Outfitters fell 2 per cent to $39.27, American Eagle slipped 2 per cent to $14.16 and Abercrombie & Fitch declined 1 per cent to $40.70.US discount retailer Family Dollar slid after it said it had rejected a sweetened $9.1bn bid from rival Dollar General, citing competition concerns.Shares in Family Dollar fell 1 per cent to $79.01, Dollar General declined 3 per cent to $62.67 and Dollar Tree rose less than 1 per cent to $55.26.Overall, the S&P 500 rose 0.1 per cent to 2,000.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.1 per cent to 17,088.09. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was little changed at 4,562.66.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
25;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-09-02T20:47:33Z;Biotech stocks buoyed by bullish broker UBS;US equity markets waver following Monday holiday;US biotech stocks were buoyed on Tuesday after brokerage UBS lifted price targets for a swathe of companies in the sector on its view that new medications and potential merger and acquisition activity will boost earnings.The investment bank said it remained bullish on the sector, despite a 22 per cent advance by the Nasdaq biotech index this year, ahead of the release of new trial data this autumn.If successful, analysts with the bank say it could “trigger price-to-earnings multiple expansion” as expectations are currently low.“We continue to see new product cycles and mid to long-term growth as a strong basis for valuation despite relative outperformance of large-cap biotech over the past few years,” Matthew Roden, an analyst with UBS, said.Mr Roden added large biotech groups, flush with cash from recent drug hits, would aid shares of smaller companies in the sector.“We are more bullish on mergers and acquisitions given the inflection of cash flows in large-cap, coupled with the need for large-cap to address toughening growth comps by 2016-17, and because mid-caps have done a good job in value creation,” he said.The sector’s advance this year has been in fits and starts, cooling after US politicians, as well as officials at the World Health Organisation, voiced concerns over the price tag of a successful Hepatitis-C treatment.Strong sales results from the Gilead medication alleviated some of those concerns. Several analysts on Wall Street predict first year sales of the treatment will near $10bn.UBS increased its price target on Gilead to $125 from $115, Achillion to $15 from $11, Regeneron to $360 from $320 and Amgen to $155 from $129.Regeneron shares climbed 3 per cent to $359.50, Achillion rose 6 per cent to $12.27 and Gilead advanced 2 per cent to $109.36.Tuesday offered another lesson for investors in biotech: disappointing trial data can cut short a stock’s rally, as was the case with Exelixis.The company, which is engaged in prostate cancer research, said it would lay off 70 per cent of its staff after an experimental drug failed a late-stage study, sending shares 55 per cent lower to $1.85.Family Dollar, which has agreed to sell itself to Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, said it would review a new $80-a-share offer presented by Dollar General, lifting all three companies.In a short statement it said that its board “has not changed its recommendation in support of the merger with Dollar Tree”.Family Dollar last month rebuffed Dollar General’s first, $78.50-a-share bid, arguing that the chief obstacle was its concern that US competition regulators would quash a deal to combine the country’s two largest discount chains.Dollar General said it would divest more stores in an attempt to gain regulatory compliance.Family Dollar shares rose nearly 1 per cent to $80.22, Dollar General increased 1 per cent to $64.36 and Dollar Tree advanced 2 per cent to $54.46.Norwegian Cruise Line agreed to pay $3bn in cash and shares for smaller rival Prestige Cruises, which operates the Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Sea Cruises brands.Kevin Sheehan, the chief executive of Norwegian, said that the acquisition would provide for a “solid accretion to earnings per share and drive long-term shareholder value”.Analysts with Stifel Nicolaus said the deal “makes sense” considering Prestige’s position in the luxury cruise market.“Luxury has been the one area of cruise which has been relatively stable over the past couple of years, whereas the contemporary brands have been more impacted by economic events while also being impacted by negative press headlines about the cruise industry,” Steven Wieczynski, an analyst with Stifel, said.Shares of Norwegian soared 11 per cent to $36.99.Overall, US equity markets wavered following a Monday holiday. The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 2,002.28 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 17,067.56. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 4,598.19.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
26;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Family Dollar discount store rejects Dollar General takeover bid;;The battle to consolidate the US discount retail market turned bitter on Thursday, after Family Dollar rejected a takeover offer from Dollar General and accused its larger rival of lying about previous talks between the two companies.Family Dollar, which has agreed to be taken over by Dollar Tree for $8.5bn, knocked back Dollar General’s rival $9.7bn bid, citing antitrust concerns about a deal that would bring together two of the country’s top three discount stores.The rejection is the latest twist in a takeover scrap that could reshape the discount shopping market at a time when changing consumer habits are increasing pressure on retailers across the country.Family Dollar, which has been under pressure from activist investors, including Carl Icahn, for months, agreed to sell itself to larger rival Dollar Tree last month. The deal surprised many in the market, who had been expecting a takeover offer to come from Dollar General, the largest of the cheap retailing trinity.All three retailers sell discounted goods spanning a wide spectrum of uses, from cell phones to baby wipes, cookies to car wax.After launching its counterbid earlier this week, Dollar General wrote a letter to Family Dollar’s board on Wednesday night accusing the company of being mendacious in earlier merger discussions between the two.Rick Dreiling, Dollar General’s chief executive, said in the letter that Family Dollar had not indicated that any deal was pending with Dollar Tree when the two companies met earlier in the year and, as such, gave Dollar General no incentive to rush into a bid of its own.The letter added: “Regrettably, as a result, we are now forced to factor a $305m break-up fee into our offer – consideration that could have been better used to maximise value for the Family Dollar shareholders.”Mr Dreiling also suggested Howard Levine, his counterpart at Family Dollar, might be in favour of the Dollar Tree offer because it offered him a greater role in the combined company.In formally rejecting the Dollar General offer on Thursday, Family Dollar slammed Mr Dreiling for penning a letter that “contained blatant mischaracterisations and did nothing to address the antitrust issues in Dollar General’s proposal”.Dollar General has claimed it would extract annual cost savings of $550m to $600m by combining with Family Dollar, almost double the $300m Dollar Tree has said it would get from merging.One explanation for the higher savings expectations is the similarities in the business models of Dollar General and Family Dollar. Both retailers price goods cheaply, but are not wedded to only selling at $1 or less. Dollar Tree, by contrast, sells everything in its stores for $1 or below.Many US retailers have struggled in recent years, as they battle against the dual pressures of rising store rents and the increasing propensity of shoppers to buy online.
27;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar stores: no knockouts;Dollar General’s vacillation has led to a pricey bidding war;“Everyone’s got a plan . . . until they get punched in the mouth,” said Mike Tyson, a noted expert on the topic. Dollar General seemed to have planned on independence. Family Dollar, its wobbling competitor in US deep discount retail, looked like a juicy acquisition target. But Dollar General looked like it was going to take a pass. Its respected chief executive Rick Dreiling announced his retirement in June after a six-year reign. But then, three weeks ago, Dollar General took one right on the kisser. The second-leading dollar chain, Dollar Tree, stepped in and signed a deal to pay $74.50/share for Family Dollar.On Monday, Dollar General picked itself off the canvas to submit an all-cash $78.50 offer (20 per cent of Dollar Tree’s was in shares). Dollar General’s shareholders are left to wonder if the company’s early hesitation led to an unnecessary and costly bidding war.The company’s enterprise value of $20bn gives it the firepower for a generous, all-cash bid. If it had bid a month ago at, say, $75.00 that could have intimidated Dollar Tree enough to keep it out of the ring. The difference between a $75.00 bid and the $78.50 offered today is about $400m. Given a $305m termination fee must also be paid to Dollar Tree, $700m may have just slipped away.And do not look for $78.50 to be Dollar General’s last bid. It estimates up to $600m in cost savings by joining forces with Family Dollar. Dollar Tree estimated its deal benefits at $300m. That gap should be worth much more than the implied 5 per cent premium to Dollar Tree’s deal. And Dollar General’s shares today are up a 10th, another sign of how much more Family Dollar could extract from it.It is easy to conclude that Dollar General complacently let its gloves drop. But Family Dollar may have showed some science of its own by getting Dollar Tree to enter the ring. Retail is blood sport. Consolidation is rarely done on the cheap.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
28;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-08-18T17:01:17Z;Dollar General bids $9.7bn for Family Dollar;;Dollar General has joined the battle to consolidate America’s discount retail market, placing a $9.7bn cash bid to buy Family Dollar less than a month after its smaller rival agreed to merge with Dollar Tree.Dollar General’s offer, which eclipses the $8.5bn cash and stock deal put together by Dollar Tree, would marry two of the US’ largest discount stores at a time when changing consumer habits are increasing pressure on retailers across the country.Tennessee-based Dollar General, the largest of the country’s cheap-retailing trinity, said that it was prepared to sell up to 700 stores to win regulatory approval for the deal and also pay a $305m termination fee to Dollar Tree should the board of Family Dollar switch its recommendation.Rick Dreiling, Dollar General’s chief executive, said his company’s proposal was “financially superior to the current transaction agreement with Dollar Tree and would provide Family Dollar shareholders with a substantial premium and immediate liquidity for their shares”.Mr Dreiling added that Dollar General would be able to extract annual cost savings of $550m-$­600m by combining with Family Dollar, almost double the $300m Dollar Tree said it would get from merging.One explanation for the higher expectations is the similarities in the business models of Dollar General and Family Dollar. Both retailers price goods cheaply, but are not wedded to only selling at $1 or less. Dollar Tree, by contrast, sells everything in its stores for $1 or below.All three retailers sell discounted goods spanning a wide spectrum of uses, from cell phones to baby wipes, cookies to car wax.Analysts at Wells Fargo said they expected Family Dollar’s management to favour Dollar Tree, as a merger between the second and third-largest players in the discount retail market would face fewer integration risks.News of the $78.50 a share offer sent Family Dollar’s shares up 5 per cent to $79.81, implying the market expects an improved offer. Dollar General rose 10 per cent to $63.23, while Dollar Tree fell 2 per cent to $54.48.The emergence of Dollar General as a counter-bidder provides an unexpected twist in a long running saga to sell Family Dollar. The smallest of the three discount retailers has been under pressure from activist investors Nelson Peltz and Carl Icahn to sell itself for months.After Dollar Tree made its offer last month, Mr Icahn said he expected better offers to materialise. He then sold some of his stake, however.Many US retailers have struggled in recent years, as they battle against the dual pressures of rising store rents and the increasing propensity of shoppers to buy online.
29;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar Tree to buy Family Dollar for $8.5bn;;Dollar Tree has agreed to acquire Family Dollar in an $8.5bn cash and stock deal that will marry two of the US’s largest discount stores at a time when changing consumer habits are heaping pressure on retailers across the country.The deal comes after Family Dollar faced calls from activist investors Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz to sell itself. Mr Icahn, who amassed a 9.4 per cent stake in the company over recent months, had also been threatening to replace the retailer’s board of directors.Mr Icahn said the deal validated the “activist investment philosophy”.“While we continue to believe there are a handful of potential buyers who could realise greater synergies through a combination with Family Dollar and are hopeful that one or more of them will surface . . . we are extremely pleased with Dollar Tree’s intention to acquire Family Dollar,” Mr Icahn said.Mr Peltz’s Trian hedge fund said it was “fully supportive of this combination and has entered into voting agreement in support of the merger”.Merging the companies will create a 13,000 strong network of so-called “deep-discount” stores and a company with combined sales of $18.4bn. The deal would also appear to put paid to long-running speculation that Dollar General, the largest member of America’s cheap-retailing trinity, would buy Family Dollar.The deal price of $74.50 a share includes $59.60 in cash and $14.90 worth of Dollar Tree shares, representing a 22.8 per cent premium over Family Dollar’s Friday closing price. News of the agreement sent Family Dollar shares soaring 25 per cent to $75.74 by close of New York trading, while Dollar Tree rose 1 per cent to $54.87.Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree’s chief executive, said the acquisition would help extend the company’s “reach to lower-income customers”, while allowing it to pursue its goal of becoming the nation’s “leader in value retailing”.Mr Sasser will lead the enlarged company, with Family Dollar’s chief executive, Howard Levine, taking on a yet to be announced role. Dollar Tree said the deal would generate annual cost savings of $300m three years after the merger is completed, coming mostly from savings in the sourcing, procurement and distribution of goods.Dollar Tree and Family Dollar will continue to operate as separate brands.In spite of targeting the same market, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar operate slightly different business models. The former sells everything in its stores for $1 or less, while Family Dollar has a more varied pricing model based on the notion that its products, while not necessarily in the sub-$1 price range, will be cheaper than rival retailers.Both sell discounted goods spanning a wide spectrum of uses, from cell phones to baby wipes, cookies to car wax.Many US retailers have struggled in recent years, as they battle against the dual pressures of rising store rents and the increasing propensity of shoppers to buy online.
30;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-07-28T16:57:48Z;First Solar shines on rivals’ tariffs;;US solar manufacturers were buoyed by new Commerce Department duties targeting rivals in China and Taiwan that will see tariffs set as high as 165 per cent for some companies.The preliminary decision, which is the latest in a long-running back and forth between the US and China, seeks to close a loophole some companies used to import solar panels and components into the US without duties by shifting manufacturing to Taiwan.Commerce department officials said the move followed its findings that components manufactured in the world’s second-largest economy had been subsidised in a way that damaged American counterparts.The department estimated more than $2bn of crystalline silicon photovoltaic products were imported from China and Taiwan last year.Analysts with Credit Suisse said the new tariffs would likely pressure manufacturers to shift production out of Taiwan and into mainland China, where costs are lower.The investment bank added the anti-dumping duties were higher than expected and could benefit US manufacturers.“First Solar and SunPower stand to gain the most from the sustained elevated pricing since they are not subject to the duties, especially during the utility procurement cycle under way ahead of the Investment Tax Credit step-down,” Patrick Jobin, an analyst with Credit Suisse, said.Shares of First Solar climbed 2 per cent to $65.53 while SunPower advanced 3 per cent to $38.56.Chinese rival Yingli Green Energy fell 3 per cent to $3.40 while Trina Solar rose less than 1 per cent to $11.40 after declining initially.Gintech Energy and Solartech Energy, which are both based out of Taiwan, fell 7 per cent to NT$29.00 and NT$22.60, respectively.US homebuilders were under pressure after new figures showed pending home sales, a measure of sales in process that have yet to be completed, slipping unexpectedly in June.Pending sales fell 1.1 per cent in June from May, the National Association of Realtors said on Monday, lagging estimates of a 0.5 per cent increase.Stagnant housing activity is a concern for the Federal Reserve, which has already been forced to cut its forecasts for US growth this year.Pending sales have been in decline since September as rising prices and higher mortgage rates curtail demand.Shares of Lennar fell 2 per cent to $37.62, DR Horton declined 1 per cent to 21.49, PulteGroup slid 1 per cent to $18.54 and KB Home slipped 2 per cent to $17.06.A spate of deal announcements on Monday provided momentum for several companies, including those in the discount and dollar retail sector.Dollar Tree agreed to buy rival Family Dollar in a mixture of cash and shares that valued the chain at $9.2bn, including debt, as the industry consolidates amid intensifying competition.Investors in Family Dollar will pocket $59.60 in cash and $14.90 of Dollar Tree shares.The agreement comes less than two months after billionaire investor Carl Icahn took a stake in Family Dollar and urged its chief executive, Howard Levine, to sell the chain of just over 8,000 stores.An aggressive expansion plan by Mr Levine and slowing sales of some of its higher-margin items has knocked Family Dollar, which is already grappling with competition from the likes of Walmart and Target.Dollar Tree advanced 1 per cent to $54.87 while Family Dollar climbed 25 per cent to $75.70.Rival Dollar General fell less than 1 per cent to $55.55 and Big Lots inched 1 per cent higher to $44.27.Zillow agreed to buy Trulia for $3.5bn in an all-stock deal to consolidate its grip on the online real estate advertising market in the US.Trulia shareholders will receive 0.444 shares of Zillow’s class A common stock for every share they own, and will own about a third of the combined company.Zillow registered 83m unique users in June, while Trulia counted 54m, but in a statement the two companies said there was “limited consumer overlap”.Although already very popular in the US, the two companies combined revenues represent less than 4 per cent of the $12bn the real estate industry spends on marketing their services to consumers annually.Trulia shares advanced 15 per cent to $64.64 while Zillow rose 1 per cent to $160.32.Overall, US equity markets were little changed. The S&P 500 rose 0.03 per cent to 1,978.91 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.13 per cent to 16,982.59. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 0.1 per cent to 4,444.91.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
31;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-06-27T16:13:29Z;DuPont falls on trimmed profit outlook;UBS analysts say company hurt by shift from corn to soyabeans;DuPont, one of the largest US chemicals companies, was under pressure on Friday after the company trimmed its profit outlook for the full year amid weak sales within its agriculture business.The Delaware-based company said it was forced to take larger than expected seed inventory writedowns as corn sales moderated.DuPont now expects operating earnings between $4.00 and $4.10 a share in 2014, lagging analysts’ estimate for $4.29 and DuPont’s own earlier prediction between $4.20 and $4.45 a share.“While 2014 is a transition year in agriculture, the revisions to the outlook we made today do not meet the expectations we set for our agriculture segment or for the company,” chief executive Ellen Kullman said.DuPont’s agricultural division is by far its largest, generating two-fifths of the company’s $10.2bn of sales in the first quarter of the year.Fuelled by its acquisition of Pioneer Hi-Bred in 1999, DuPont has tapped into rising global demand for pesticides and hybrid seeds as the world’s growing population drives demand.Analysts with UBS noted DuPont was hurt by a shift from corn to soyabeans by farmers, lagging Monsanto.“DuPont pesticides are also more exposed than Monsanto to early season weather, which was unfavourable. The magnitude of these known issues was larger than expected, but should be temporary,” analyst John Roberts said.Shares declined 3 per cent to $65.44, while rivals Dow Chemical fell 1 per cent to $51.61 and Monsanto slipped 1 per cent to $125.Manitowoc rose 11 per cent to $32.93 after investment firm Relational Investors urged the company to spin off its food business, which makes refrigerators and ovens used in commercial kitchens.Manitowoc said on Friday that it had retained Goldman Sachs as an adviser and has already spoken to Relational.Manitowoc’s food equipment division is a smaller part of its overall business, generating $383m of revenue in the first quarter of 2013. That compares with the $467m in revenue from its crane business.“While there is no change in our fundamental thesis that cranes are a late cycle opportunity we believe that the entry of an activist places a floor on the shares,” Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.Nike was among the top performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the maker of athletic gear reported an 11 per cent rise in sales last quarter, topping forecasts.Meanwhile, profits climbed 5 per cent to $698m, or 78 cents a share. Analysts had predicted earnings of 75 cents a share.Although Nike was hit by a drop in emerging-market currencies earlier in the year, the US company said it enjoyed rising sales in every major market other than Japan last quarter.Future orders also eclipsed Wall Street’s forecasts. Excluding the effects of currency changes, orders for the period from June to November are $13.3bn, up 12 per cent from the same period a year earlier.Nike shares climbed 1 per cent by close Friday to $77.68.Shares of Michaels, the crafts retailer taken private by Bain Capital and Blackstone in 2006, were little changed in their debut on Friday.The Texas-based company sold 27.8m shares at $17 apiece, raising $473m. It had hoped to sell shares at between $17 and $19, which would have raised as much as $528m.Dollar General led the S&P 500 lower after the company announced its chief executive would retire.Shares fell 7 per cent to $57.19 on the news Rick Dreiling would leave in May 2015. The company will begin a search for new leadership amid potential industry-wide consolidation. Family Dollar shares declined 2 per cent to $66.84 and Dollar Tree fell 1 per cent to $53.35.Tencent, the gaming and social media conglomerate based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, said on Friday it will purchase nearly a fifth of 58.com for $736m.Tencent said it would integrate 58.com’s services into its online offerings. 58.com expects to use part of the proceeds to repurchase 27.6m shares from pre-IPO shareholders.Shares of 58.com were choppy in New York trading, falling as much as 4 per cent to $48.59 before rebounding to $54.90 by close.Overall, US equity markets continued to drift sideways despite better than expected consumer confidence figures.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 1,960.96 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 5.7 points to 16,851.84.

32;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-06-09T20:54:24Z;Time Inc shares receive cool first day reception;US publisher falls as much as 7% before paring losses;Shares of Time Inc, the publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and its namesake magazine, received a cool reception on its first day of trade, falling as much as 7 per cent before paring losses to close 1.21 per cent down at $23.20.The company, led by chief executive Joe Ripp, was spun off from Time Warner as the former parent focuses on faster-growing and more lucrative businesses like pay-TV channel HBO and its Warner Brothers studio.In its debut, Time carried a market capitalisation of roughly $2.5bn. The company generated sales of $3.35bn in 2013, a 2 per cent decline from a year earlier, while profits tumbled by more than a fifth to $201m.The results were a concern for some analysts after the company levered itself up with debt to pay a one-time dividend to Time Warner. Time said it expected to carry $1.4bn in debts after the split.“The publishing industry is in secular decline. Time’s circulation and advertising revenue has been decreasing, competition is intense and continues to increase – strategic initiatives may not result in growth,” Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan warned.The business is one of only a few available for investors seeking entry to standalone print publishers. In 2013, News Corp separated its publishing and entertainment assets. Shares in the publishing side, which includes the Wall Street Journal and HarperCollins book publisher, have climbed 17 per cent since last July.Wells Fargo offered a more optimistic view on Time, initiating coverage with an ‘outperform’ rating and $27 to $29 price target. Analyst Eric Katz noted much of the restructuring Time would need to complete was behind it and its digital businesses offered a growth opportunity.“Digital makes up 15 per cent of total advertising [revenue] today and is growing at a mid-teens pace,,” Mr Katz said.Rivals Condé Nast, which owns the venerable Vogue and Vanity Fair titles, and Hearst are both privately held.Time Warner shares closed up 1.25 per cent to $68.99.US discount chain Family Dollar may not be a natural shopping destination for a Wall Street billionaire, but a disclosure by Carl Icahn late on Friday of a 9.4 per cent stake in the company lifted shares 14 per cent to $69.08. They closed on Monday up 13.37 per cent at $68.62.After flourishing in the four years after the recession, Family Dollar has faced increased competition and scepticism over its expansion plan.Mr Icahn, one of the best-known activist investors, said that he would push Family Dollar’s management for changes. In response, Family Dollar disclosed it had adopted a so-called poison pill designed to deter any shareholder from securing a stake of 10 per cent or more.The prospect of a change in strategy at Family Dollar also helped buoy shares in rival discounters. Shares of Dollar General rose 7.35 per cent to $62.25, Big Lots climbed 2.77 per cent to $44.88 and Dollar Tree advanced 0.65 per cent to $55.50.Investment bank Jefferies upgraded Family Dollar and Dollar General to ‘buy’, citing potential cost savings of as much as $1.2bn if the two were to merge.“This upgrade is based on a potential acquisition of Family Dollar or in the absence of a combination, a material change to operations aimed at running the business better and closing the sales productivity and profitability gap with Dollar General,” analyst Daniel Binder said.The US continues to strike a sour note for McDonald’s, sending shares in the fast-food chain 0.57 per cent lower to $101.38.The company reported a 1 per cent decline in same-store sales in the US last month, underlining the struggle chief executive Don Thompson is having in the company’s biggest market. Analysts had expected US sales to rise 0.1 per cent.Alongside an uneven economic recovery that has hit its customers hard, McDonald’s is grappling with tougher competition from the likes of Yum’s Taco Bell which are pushing into the breakfast market.Apple shares also stood out in a dull trading environment, rising 1.60 per cent to $93.70 as the company began trading on a split-adjusted basis.Overall, markets were relatively tame to start the week.

33;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Casinos sink on Macau spin of wheel;;US casino operators fell broadly as the latest gambling figures from Macau, the world’s gaming hub, fell short of Wall Street expectations.Overall gaming revenues rose 9.3 per cent from a year earlier to 32.4bn Macanese patacas, or $4.1bn, according to the latest report from the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Analysts on average had expected a rise between 13 and 15 per cent.Since the year’s start, revenues have reached roughly $20.8bn, or 16 per cent higher than the year ago level.Analysts with Citigroup said much of the weakness in the sector – the Dow Jones US Gambling Index has fallen 13 per cent over the past three months – has been due to recent reports of “crackdowns on illegal use of Union Pay Cards, transit visas and junkets running away”, which they say are overblown.“Adding to pressure, in May the Macau government announced that a full smoking ban in the mass gaming areas will be implemented,” analyst Anil Daswani said.“Again, we believe these fears are overdone as the ban will not apply to premium mass or VIP.”Citi added the addition of new rooms would likely lift overall growth in the sector in the coming years.Wynn Resorts fell 4.49 per cent to close at $208.23, Las Vegas Sands dipped 2.57 per cent to $75.44 and MGM Resorts International declined almost 3 per cent to end the day at $25.83.Dollar General stuck to its profit forecast even as consumers spend more on lower-margin items at a US discount chain that has fared well since the financial crisis.The company, which is based in Tennessee, said it was generating lower profits from its sales as shoppers buy more “lower-margin consumables” such as tobacco and candy.While Dollar General stuck to a prediction that it will make between $3.45 and $3.55 a share in the current financial year, it cautioned “the volatility of the macroeconomic environment continues to pressure the consumer”.Overall, sales climbed almost 7 per cent to $4.52bn in the quarter to May 2. Net income rose to $222m from $220m.Shares in the company advanced 3.85 per cent to close at $56.39.Hillshire Brands, the US company behind Jimmy Dean sausages, said it will start talks with both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods over the takeover bids that the companies have each made.Shares in Hillshire jumped about 9.5 per cent to close at $58.65 after Pilgrim’s Pride confirmed it had raised its offer from $45 a share to $55 a share in cash.Pilgrim’s Pride shares fell 2.24 per cent to $25.34 while Tyson declined just over 3 per cent to $42.07.Tyson Foods has an offer of $50 a share, or roughly $6.8bn, on the table.The fight for Hillshire, which itself is trying to buy rival food producer Pinnacle, comes as companies seek to wrestle pricing power from retailers, global groups seek growth in new markets and conglomerates reshuffle their brand portfolios.US carmakers advanced on Tuesday as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all topped monthly sales expectations.Any reputational damage that General Motors has incurred because of its mass recall of cars has yet to reach showrooms in the US.Sales of its vehicles rose 12.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, almost double the tally that analysts had forecast.Although the figures echo the strong performance across the industry last month, they also underline that the decision by GM chief executive Mary Barra to recall more than 10m cars in the US has not put off consumers.Ford reported a 3 per cent rise in US sales in May. Ford shares rose 0.64 per cent to $16.55 while General Motors climbed 1.12 per cent to close at $35.25.Overall, US equity markets closed slightly lower. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.04 per cent to 1,924.24 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.13 per cent to 16,722.34.

34;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-05-28T21:05:57Z;Toll Brothers up on homebuilder hopes;;Optimism from one of the largest US homebuilders helped lift the wider housing sector, despite choppy performance over the past five months that has been capped by slowing mortgage applications and subdued home sales.Toll Brothers said revenues and profits topped Wall Street expectations in the three months to April 30, buoyed by the luxury homebuilder’s decision to raise prices.Sales rose 67 per cent from a year earlier to $860m while net income more than doubled to $65.2m, or 35 cents per share.Chief executive Douglas Yearley said he believed the housing market was still in the early stages of a recovery and demand would build.“Demand over the past year has been solid, although relatively flat, compared to the strong growth we initially experienced beginning in 2011, coming off the bottom of this housing cycle,” he said.“We note that last cycle’s recovery, in the early 1990s, began with a period of rapid acceleration, followed by levelling, before further upward momentum.”Investor enthusiasm for the sector has been lacklustre since the year’s start as harsh winter weather crimped new construction ahead of the key spring selling season.Economists with JPMorgan note that home prices have continued to increase due to “limited available inventory and a declining share of distressed sales available in the market”.Shares of Toll Brothers advanced as much as 4 per cent before closing 1.96 per cent up at $36.34, while KB Home rose 0.30 per cent to $16.63, and Meritage Homes rose 0.88 per cent to $40.10.PulteGroup nudged down to $19.76 while Lennar also slipped slightly to $40.37.Twitter shares jumped 10.69 per cent to $33.77 following an upgrade from Nomura as the investment bank warmed to the social network’s prospects.Nomura increased its rating to buy from neutral. Shares in Twitter have vastly underperformed the broader market since the beginning of the year, falling more than 50 per cent before Wednesday’s upgrade.Allergan led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Valeant Pharmaceuticals raised its bid on the Botox maker in its attempt to win investor backing.The Canadian drugs group said it would increase the cash component of its bid for Allergan to $58.30.Overall, Wednesday’s increased proposal valued Allergan at $166.16 a share, or $49.4bn, compared with an original offer of $152.89.“The Allergan board of directors will carefully review and consider the revised proposal and pursue the course of action that the board believes is in the best interests of the company and all of its stockholders,” Allergan said.Shares of Allergan closed down 5.39 per cent to $156.12 while Valeant declined 2.31 per cent to $126.95.GlaxoSmithKline shares trading in New York dipped on Wednesday as investors digested news that the UK’s Serious Fraud Office had launched a criminal inquiry into the drugs group.GSK revealed late on Tuesday that it had been notified that the SFO had “opened a formal criminal investigation into the group’s commercial practices”. Its shares declined 3.41 per cent to $26.90.Dollar General fell after analysts at Deutsche Bank dimmed their view on concerns it will be unable to lift same-store sales between 3 and 4 per cent while maintaining gross margins.The investment bank lowered its rating to hold from buy, sending its shares 3 per cent lower to $54.60.Overall, markets drifted ahead of key economic reports on Thursday, which include a second reading of first-quarter GDP as well as pending home sales and initial jobless claims.The S&P 500 nudged down slightly to 1,909.78, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.25 per cent to 16,633.18.

35;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-03-13T23:47:01Z;Williams-Sonoma hits record high;;Shares in Williams-Sonoma rallied at their greatest pace in a year as the upmarket home goods retailer forecast upbeat results over the coming year and lifted its dividend.Williams-Sonoma, which also owns the Pottery Barn and West Elm stores, projected full-year sales between $4.6bn and $4.7bn with earnings as high as $3.15 a share.Wall Street analysts had forecast earnings of $2.8 on revenues of $4.4bn.Fourth-quarter sales rose 4 per cent from a year earlier to $1.5bn while profits were little changed at $134m, or $1.38 per share. The year-ago figures included an extra week of trade.Results were buoyed by 18 per cent same-store sales growth at West Elm and a 15 per cent rise at Pottery Barn. The two units account for more than half of Williams-Sonoma sales.“We believe that our lifestyle merchandising approach, together with our high-touch service model, separates us from commoditised offerings as we help our customers decorate, entertain, and create the homes of their dreams,” chief executive Laura Alber said.At least half a dozen investment banks increased their price targets on the company following its results after-market close on Wednesday.Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler lifted his price target to $69 from $65, noting sales were “impressive in the light of a challenged retail backdrop”.“The strength was driven by improvement in execution at the namesake Williams-Sonoma brand in its first holiday under new leadership, strong execution across brands and, no doubt, the after-effect of a surge in housing turnover,” Mr Fassler said.Its shares rose to $65.08, a new record high, before slipping back to close 9.73 per cent higher at $64.71.By contrast, discounter Dollar General forecast full-year earnings shy of Wall Street forecasts and said severe weather continued to hamper its results.The US retailer said it expected earnings to range between $3.45 and $3.55 per share as same store sales rise as much as 4 per cent over fiscal 2014. The earnings outlook was more than a dime below analyst expectations.Same-store sales rose 1.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, trailing forecasts for a 3.9 per cent gain, while net sales were $120m below Wall Street expectations.Chief executive Rick Dreiling said he remained “cautious on the current operating environment” and the challenges facing his customers.Shares in the company fell 2.78 per cent to close at $57.64.Amazon shares climbed on Thursday as the company lifted the price on its Prime membership, a service that gives customers unlimited free two-day shipping on purchases, by 25 per cent to $99 per year.The rise takes effect next week and marks the first price increase for the service in nine years and was expected to boost the company’s annual operating income by $400m, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.In January, Amazon surprised investors and the wider public when it disclosed it was considering raising the price of Prime. Faced with rising shipping costs, executives said the company was considering lifting the fee for consumers by between $20 and $40.Mr Mahaney noted that he did not expect Amazon to see a “material increase” in the number of subscribers who cancel their memberships due to the increased price.Amazon shares advanced as much as 3 per cent during the day before closing 0.21 per cent higher at $371.43.RadioShack rose after the company’s chief financial officer disclosed he had purchased 100,000 shares in the struggling US electronics retailer.John Feray increased his position in the company by roughly $212,000, taking his stake to some 250,000 shares.Mr Feray’s investment comes as the retailer closes 1,100 of its worst-performing stores as it tries to return to profit.Shares in the company rose 2.31 per cent to end at $2.21.Overall, US stocks declined as weak Chinese economic data offset improvements in US retail sales.The benchmark S&P 500 slid 1.17 per cent to close at 1,846.34 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 1.41 per cent to 16,108.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.46 per cent to end the day at 4,260.42.
36;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Five facts about Poundland;;• Poundland opened its first store in Burton-upon-Trent in 1990 with the intention of mimicking the success of single-price stores in the US, such as Dollar General. It now operates nearly 500 stores across the UK and plans to grow to 1,000 stores over the next five to 10 years.• Its slogan is “Yes! Everything’s £1”. Unless, that is, you are shopping at one of its “Dealz” stores in Ireland, where it sells the vast majority of its products for €1.49.Poundland decided to brand itself as Dealz in Ireland in 2011 to avoid the use of the word “euro”, which its research suggested had a negative connotation for many Irish consumers because of the eurozone debt crisis.• The downturn has been good for Poundland, showing that people get a kick out of feeling they have been savvy. Between 2008 and 2013, its sales more than doubled from £330m to £880m.• Poundland is a “rediscovered phenomenon”, according to Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at Conlumino. Marks and Spencer was the UK’s original pound store, with its history dating back more than 125 years to the penny stall on Leeds market. Since then the concept of single-price retailing has expanded to the likes of Poundland, Poundstretcher and 99p stores.• Despite its origins on depressed high streets, Poundland has become increasingly popular in relatively well-to-do areas as shoppers turn to it for everything from washing powder to pasta sauce. More than one in five of its customers are in the affluent AB demographic, compared with about one in seven in 2012.Stores in towns such as Cambridge, Stratford upon Avon, Guildford and Bath generated higher sales per store in 2013 than the average Poundland store.• In 2009, it sold 185m batteries, 21m metres of aluminium foil, 1.7m umbrellas, 4m jars of coffee and 500,000 garden gnomes. Top-selling products in the past have been reading glasses, umbrellas and 12-pack Kodak batteries.
37;DG;Dollar General Corp;2014-02-06T14:37:26Z;KKR earnings surge on IPOs;;KKR declared its highest annual dividend on soaring fourth-quarter earnings, as the New York-based private equity group continued to diversify away from its core buyout operations and expand its credit, property and other businesses.KKR’s dividend of $1.40 per unit came after it more than doubled its net economic income to $790m and reported a 25 per cent increase in assets under management to $94.3bn for the last quarter of 2013.The results reflected the surge in equity markets. The fortunes of the private groups have also been lifted by the constraints federal and global regulators have imposed on banks in the wake of the global financial crisis.KKR closed its latest North American buyout fund with $9bn under management. In addition, it finished fundraising for a $1.5bn real estate fund for North America and a new $2bn global special situations fund which will provide rescue finance to cash-strapped companies around the world and will also invest in distressed debt.The big listed private equity groups are beginning to pursue differentiated strategies. KKR has been using its balance sheet more aggressively than many peers as it develops new business lines and builds a record before raising money from investors.It sold out of Dollar General, the retail chain on which it made five times its money, and continues to sell down holdings of companies such as HCA and Nielsen. However, some of its most lucrative exits, such as its sale of Oriental Brewery, will not show up until later this year when the deal closes.But the appreciation of its portfolio, up 20.5 per cent for the year, was less than the 27 per cent rise in the MSCI global index, to which it compares its results. Still, for the last quarter, KKR’s portfolio rose 8.4 per cent, while the index rose a slightly more modest 8.1 per cent.KKR’s return on equity in 2013 was 27.4 per cent. By contrast Goldman Sachs’ return on equity last year was just 11 per cent, in part because of new regulatory limits. Virtually none of KKR’s peers calculate return on equity.On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), KKR’s income rose to $277.9m for the quarter from $96.7m for the year ago period. ENI, the favoured earnings metric of the large listed private equity groups, excludes certain costs associated with listing and other technical factors.KKR, like many of its rivals, took advantage of buoyant equity markets to list and do secondary sales of many of its portfolio companies. KKR invested $8bn in private markets over the year and returned $9bn to its investors, with $3bn of that in the last quarter as KKR further sold down stakes in companies including Dollar General and HCA.
38;DG;Dollar General Corp;2013-04-25T18:13:42Z;Main investment returns decline at KKR;;KKR’s first-quarter economic net income fell 10.9 per cent to $647.7m compared to the same period last year, reflecting a fall in returns from principal investments.The weaker performance of the New York-based private equity group contrasts with rival Blackstone which this month reported a 28 per cent rise in quarterly economic net income.The KKR and Blackstone results underline the variable financial performance of the private equity groups, which can suffer from lumpy earnings as portfolio investments are sold.On the standard GAAP basis, which includes expenses associated with KKR’s listing and various technical items, net income rose to $193.4m, up from $190.4m a year ago.KKR took advantage of stronger equity markets to continue selling off stakes in portfolio companies including HCA and Dollar General. It also took profits from the sale of investments in Asia and Europe.KKR’s assets under management increased 3.7 per cent to $78.3bn, weaker than the 15 per cent growth rate recorded by Blackstone.Like peers, KKR has been diversifying away from the buyout business. It has uncalled commitments of $6.56bn waiting to be deployed in its public markets and debt business, compared with $561m in its private equity funds.KKR reported a disappointing quarter for its capital markets group, where fees dropped 50 per cent and economic net income fell 24 per cent.However, distributable earnings rose to $290.6m, up from $164m.Fee-related earnings, which include performance fees and investment income and proxy for cash flow, rose to $88m, up from $73.4m last time.KKR shares rose 4.3 per cent to $21.06 at the close on Thursday.
39;DG;Dollar General Corp;2013-04-10T21:06:38Z;US stocks hit new record high;;US stock markets rallied, reaching record highs in spite of signs from the Federal Reserve that it might be ready to slow asset purchases in coming months.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.2 per cent to 1,587.73, surpassing both its previous closing and intraday high, reached in October 2007.Investment banking stocks led the rally, with Morgan Stanley shares up 2.2 per cent to $22.22 and Citigroup adding 2.7 per cent to $45.06, while Goldman Sachs rose 2 per cent to $149.46.The S&P 500 financials index, which has gained more than 23 per cent in the past 12 months, was up 1.1 per cent on Wednesday.The latest record came shortly after the Fed released the minutes from its most recent policy meeting several hours early following an accidental leak. The minutes showed several Fed members were ready to slow the rate of asset purchases due to signs of improvement in the labour market.However, the weakness of employment growth in March, if it proves to be the start of a weaker trend rather than a blip, would disrupt that timetable, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.“Markets are extended at this point, but the rally has been led by defensive stocks, and any bad news, such as last Friday’s jobs data, will give investors incentives to take profits,” said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“We believe overall fundamentals are good and that the Fed will not slow the quantitative easing programme prematurely. Once the economy is truly improving and the stimulus is gradually withdrawn, markets will still be supported by positive growth,” he added.Broad-based gains were led by financial, technology and healthcare stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 3,297.25, led by sharp gains in its biggest component, Apple.Shares in Apple rose 2 per cent to $435.69, but shares are still 18 per cent lower than they were at the start of the year. Microsoft shares added to their sharp gains from the previous session and were up 2.3 per cent to $30.28.Google and Yahoo also attracted buyers, rising 1.6 per cent to $790.18 and 1.5 per cent to $24.20, respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies and is a price-weighted index, was 0.9 per cent higher at 14,802.24.Shares in Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut fast-food restaurant chains, sold off in after-hours trading, falling 3 per cent to $64.74. The company revealed in a SEC filing that March same-store sales in China declined by an estimated 13 per cent due to avian flu scare.Juniper Networks shares rose 4.7 per cent to $18.84 after Belgacom, Belgium’s largest telecoms operator, selected the company’s T series core routers to increase its bandwidth capabilities, which will help cope with the explosion in online video traffic and the use of mobile devices to access the internet.Thermo Fisher Scientific rose 3.8 per cent to $81.34 after it made a binding offer of more than $65 a share for genetic testing equipment maker Life Technologies ahead of a deadline on Tuesday.Shares in Life Technologies closed 0.6 per cent higher at $66.60.Bucking the trend in healthcare stocks, Tenet Healthcare dropped 5.5 per cent to $41.14 after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut its rating to “hold”.Shares in First Solar gave up some of the dramatic gains from the previous session, when the stock rose 46 per cent after the largest thin-film solar-panel maker issued full-year guidance, forecasting $3.8bn to $4bn in revenues. The stock decreased 7.7 per cent to $36.32.Taylor Morrison climbed 4.7 per cent to $23.04 on its debut. The company priced its stock at the top end of the range at $22 and increased its offering by 20 per cent due to high demand.The company raised $628m, making it the largest IPO by a US homebuilder in two decades.
40;DG;Dollar General Corp;2013-03-25T20:20:13Z;Wall Street retreats after earlier gains;;Initial optimism about a Cyprus bailout agreement faded, dragging Wall Street lower at the start of the week after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index traded within just a quarter of a point of its record closing high.The reversal came after stocks opened higher on the day, with the S&P 500 looking poised to break its 2007 record closing level on bullish sentiment after Cyprus reached an 11th-hour €10bn bailout deal. News of two competing offers to take computer maker Dell private also helped lift technology stocks initially.But the optimistic tone did not last, with investors worried that the banking crisis in the Mediterranean nation could spark wider contagion in the eurozone financial system.At the close of trading in New York, shares in Dell were still 2.6 per cent higher on the day at $14.51, as Blackstone and Carl Icahn both tabled competing offers for the computer maker, which Michael Dell and Silver Lake plan to take private in a $24.4bn deal.Blackstone made an offer of at least $14.25 a share for the whole company, while Mr Icahn is looking to pay $15 a share for 58 per cent of the company. Both offers are superior to the $13.65 a share offer from Mr Dell and Silver Lake on a per-share basis.“We believe that shareholders will benefit from the rival bids, as both bids are at offer prices above that made by Mr Dell,” said Angelo Zino, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.“We believe that Mr Dell will up his bid once more, in an effort to take Dell private should the committee decide that a rival bid is, in fact, superior.”The broad S&P 500 settled 0.3 per cent lower to 1,551.69 after trading just shy of its record close of 1,565.15 in 2007.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also erased earlier gains and closed down 0.4 per cent to 14,447.75, as the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 3,235.299.Shares in Research In Motion slid 4.6 per cent to $14.23 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the maker of the BlackBerry to “neutral” from “buy”.The Cyprus deal initially boosted financial stocks, with shares in Citigroup rising as much as 1.3 per cent before erasing gains to trade 1.6 per cent lower to $44.49. Bank of America also resumed declines to finish 1.3 per cent lower to $12.40, while Goldman Sachs slipped 0.3 per cent to $146.11.Shares in Nasdaq fell 0.7 per cent to $32.14 after the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a $62m settlement from the exchange to brokerages that lost money over the listing of shares in Facebook last May. But UBS vowed to continue fighting for a larger payout, and will seek arbitration.In earnings news, Apollo Group surged 7.1 per cent to $18.28 after the private education provider beat estimates with second-quarter earnings of 34 cents per share. Analysts had forecast 18 cents per share, with the group’s revenue of $834.4m eclipsing a forecast $822.8m.Dollar General rose 2 per cent to $51.01, after the budget retailer posted a fourth-quarter profit ahead of forecasts and indicated stronger sales growth this year from 2012. Dollar General earned $317.4m, or 97 cents per share, beating a forecast 90 cents per share. But the shares pared some of their gains later to stand little changed on the day.Shares in American Express slipped 0.2 per cent to $66.10 after the company’s board authorised the repurchase of up to 150m shares. Separately, the company said its board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 20c per common share, payable in May.Elsewhere, Best Buy gained 1.8 per cent higher to $23.20 on news the company founder and largest individual shareholder, Richard Schulze, is returning to the company as chairman emeritus. Analysts said the move could be viewed as an endorsement of the company’s turnround plan.
41;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Dollar General: when shopping lists;Retailer’s customers could be crimped by delays in tax refunds;Higher US payroll taxes and how they will affect retailers is a vexing question for investors this year. Take Dollar General, one of a few “dollar stores” that offer a hodgepodge of low-priced items, everything from packaged food to razors to clothing. On the one hand, there are fears that low income households will be the hardest hit from higher taxes, hurting sales at places such as Dollar General. On the other, most of their sales are from consumables and the company stands to benefit from the prospect of consumers with lower take-home pay “trading down”. A third factor is the improving US economy, which could cause some shoppers to trade up instead.On Monday, Dollar General reported a 3 per cent increase in same-store sales in the three months ended February 1, at the low end of in-house guidance for a 3 to 4 per cent increase. But Dollar General was able to preserve margins, in spite of some concerns late last year about heightened competition and net profit beat analysts’ forecasts.The company expects sales and profit growth in 2013, but warned that they will be stronger in the second half of the year, partly due to the rollout of cigarettes in its stores – a bid to boost traffic. It faces a tough first-quarter comparison – same-store sales rose 6.7 per cent a year ago. Cold spring temperatures versus last year’s warm weather also are not helping. And, in addition to payroll tax changes, Dollar General’s customers could be crimped by delays in tax refunds this year. Just ask Walmart.The uncertainty helps to explain the stock’s performance on Monday: a range of up 6 per cent to down 0.5 per cent. At 16 times forward earnings, it trades in line with its historic multiple. Dollar General is opening new stores, but investors had still better believe that higher taxes are neutral or will lure more dollar shoppers.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
42;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Discount retailers boost Wall Street;;Discount retailers stormed into fashion among US investors on Wednesday with advances from Dollar Tree leading stocks across Wall Street higher.The S&P 500 climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,515.99 and recorded its best single day of trading since January 2 as investors rotated back into riskier securities.All 10 main industry measures on the benchmark were in positive territory for the day, with cyclical sectors tied to the global economy performing the best.Defensive sectors, such as telecoms and consumer staples, which have been in vogue among investors in recent days, were the leading laggards and underperformed the broader market.The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5 per cent. Shares in Dollar Tree gained 10.5 per cent to $45.39 after the discount retail goods operator said it saw record customer traffic and sales in its latest sector. Rivals Dollar General and Family Dollar shared in the gains, rising 3.6 per cent to $46.56 and 2.5 per cent to $57.68 respectively.Oliver Chen, analyst at Citi, said investors were bidding up shares in discount retail operators on expectations that the payroll tax increases from the start of the year were hurting consumer spending. He said: “Consumers feeling a pinch in their incomes could be trading down and looking for better deals, bolstering the sector.”TJX Companies, which owns the low-price Marshalls and TJ Maxx chains, climbed 2.5 per cent to $44.75. The company, which has seen its shares rise 24.4 per cent over the past year, reported stronger quarterly results than expected and said it would open more stores both in the US and internationally.Mr Chen added: “TJX has seen continued customer traffic because consumers are looking for good deals in a cautious economy and the company is the premier off-price retailer.”Meanwhile, US retailer Target lost 1.5 per cent to $63.12 as it said weak sales over the holiday shopping period hurt its latest quarterly results.The day’s gains also came as fresh economic data showed that demand for long-lasting durable goods slipped last month because of a decline in aircraft orders. Despite the data, shares in aircraft manufacturer Boeing climbed 2.3 per cent to $77.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1 per cent higher at 14,075.37.Elsewhere, housing market data showed that pending home sales rose to their highest level in three months. The data helped shares in builders, including KB Home, which rose 3.4 per cent to $19.The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1 per cent to 3,162.26. Shares in the tech-heavy index’s largest constituent, Apple, fell 1 per cent to $444.57.The iPhone maker held its annual investor day on Wednesday, with one third of shareholders declining to back the company’s executive compensation.Groupon, the struggling daily deals group, plummeted almost 22 per cent to $4.71 in after-market trading as it reported earnings below analysts’ forecasts in its latest quarter.Earlier in the day, shares in the company had risen 7.8 per cent to $5.98.Coach shares were 2.8 per cent higher at $47.82 as investors considered rumours that the luxury leather goods retailer was exploring a sale.Solar-panel maker First Solar dropped 13.8 per cent to $27.04 as the company, which has struggled with a decline in panel prices, said it had swung to a fourth-quarter profit after reporting net losses in the same period a year before.Industrial sector stocks were also up strongly on the day, rising 1.9 per cent. Shares in Joy Global climbed 5.8 per cent to $63.45 as the mining equipment company reported quarterly results that were slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts.

But there were a few red sharks splashing around out there. A conspicuous number of these were shares of companies that depend on the working-class consumer. Discounter Dollar General was down 2 per cent, as was middle-income department store operator Kohl’s; big-box retailer Target lost 1.5 per cent; off-price clothing chain Ross Stores was hit too.This makes sense, given that anyone living pay cheque to pay cheque is about to see higher taxes. When the president said the compromise had prevented income tax rates on the middle class from going up, he was talking out of the side of his mouth. The deal included the expiry of the so-called “holiday” on payroll taxes, meaning the tax will rise 2 percentage points, to 6.2 per cent.Both parties have reasons to love the payroll tax cut – the Republicans simply because it is a tax; the Democrats because it is regressive. Why it was made only temporarily and then not extended is unclear. The point is that the change will hurt. JPMorgan’s economics team reckons that if three-quarters of the additional money in consumers’ pay cheques was being spent rather than saved, the hit to retail spending would be $95bn, slowing gross domestic product growth by six-tenths of a per cent in 2013.Last year, consumer discretionary stocks easily outpaced the wider market and surveys of consumer confidence are showing an encouraging trend. But hours worked and wages have not been growing at all. Now wages will, in effect, shrink. Back in November Barclays’ strategists pointed out that the payroll tax increase posed a particular threat to middle-tier retailers. As of today, that looks like a prescient call.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
44;DG;Dollar General Corp;2012-07-27T13:19:02Z;KKR bucks trend in weak market;;Buyout group KKR bucked the trend of weak markets during the second quarter as the deal struck last month to merge Alliance Boots with the pharmacy chain Walgreens boosted its balance sheet.The jump in the value of KKR’s stake in the high street retailer and pharmaceuticals distributor, taken private in a roughly £12bn deal at the height of the private equity boom, pushed the value of KKR’s investment portfolio up 5.1 per cent in a period when the MSCI world index declined almost 6 per cent.The complex deal that will initially see Walgreens buy 45 per cent of Alliance Boots was largely responsible for a rise in the value of KKR’s investments, and came as the group also sold down its stake in another 2007 buyout, Dollar General.Economic net income, a measure of performance that captures such balance sheet moves and excludes certain non-cash accounting charges associated with a corporate reorganisation prior to listing, rose 73 per cent on the same period last year to $546m.Assets under management for the New York-based investment firm dropped 1 per cent to $61.5bn, as the return of capital to investors in its funds outweighed fundraising and the rise in value of its investments during the quarter.“We completed or announced transactions which are expected to return over $4bn of capital to our private equity investors, continued to grow our Asian private equity and energy and infrastructure platforms,” Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-chairmen and chief executives, said in a statement.However, the total does not include $6bn committed so far to KKR’s 11th private equity fund, $3bn raised for its next Asian fund and the $7.8bn managed by Prisma Capital Advisors, a fund of hedge funds purchased during the quarter for an undisclosed sum.KKR also announced an expansion of its capital markets activities as part of a joint venture with fellow private equity group Stone Point. Each will commit $150m to the new entity, Merchant Advisors, which will aim to provide investment banking services to medium-sized companies.Distributable earnings of $406m were almost triple that of the second quarter last year, reflecting proceeds from secondary stock offerings at Dollar General.Income from fees was $69.8m in the quarter, down from $76.1m a year ago as incentive fees paid by KFN, a listed vehicle managed by KKR, declined.KKR will distribute 13 cents to holders of shareholder units, up from 11 cents in the same period last year. Over the past year the group has distributed 70 cents, in effect a yield of 4.9 per cent. KKR’s stock rose 6.3 per cent to $15.15 in pre-market trading on Friday.
45;DG;Dollar General Corp;2012-04-03T16:41:54Z;Buyout groups bolster IPO activity;;Private equity firms are using buoyant equity markets to take more of their portfolio companies public, including some of the more highly leveraged holdings that investors balked at in the past.Such “exits” are on track to represent the highest proportion of US and global IPO deals in at least a decade, according to Dealogic. The 36 private-equity backed deals globally so far this year, raising $6bn, represent 35 per cent of all IPO deals globally so far. That is the most since 2000.In addition, secondary sales of shares in recent private-equity backed IPOs, such as Dunkin Brands and Dollar General, are also tracking at unusually high levels, with 55 deals globally raising $18bn, or 14 per cent of all secondary proceeds, according to Dealogic, also the highest share in over a decade.Buoyant equity markets, where investors have begun to take on previously shunned riskier sectors, such as banks and highly indebted companies, have given private equity firms a window to exit current holdings and raise more funds for new investments.“We expect to see a continued wave of private equity-backed IPOs, given the improved market environment and how well recent IPOs have traded,” says Frank Maturo, head of Americas cash equity capital markets at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.According to Preqin, the private equity data provider, there are currently 68 firm-backed companies that are filed to make initial public offerings in the US. At the same time, firms are raising $126bn in US buyout funds this year, the most since 2009.The deals also come as two private equity firms, The Carlyle Group and Oaktree Capital Management, are set to go public. Oaktree has filed to raise up to $517m in a share sale this month, and Carlyle is expected to launch its roadshow this year.The biggest IPOs in the US and Europe, both private equity exits in March, have seen strong post-IPO trading. Ziggo, the Dutch cable company backed by Warburg Pincus and Cinven, is up 10 per cent since its IPO started trading to €23.40. Allison Transmission, backed by Carlye and Onex Corporation, is up 6 per cent to $24.71.As a result, more large IPOs are on the way. Oaktree’s Aleris Corporation, which had initially filed to go public a year ago, hopes to raise $531m this month. Michaels Stores, the arts-and-crafts retailer backed by Bain Capital and Blackstone, aims to raise $500m later this year.But the deals are also making concessions, such as selling fewer shares. MRC Global, an energy pipeline company backed by Goldman Sachs’ private equity arm, filed with regulators to raise $100m, sharply less than the $750m it set out to raise in 2009.“As we look at the nice run in public markets, you’re seeing private equity firms look for any way they can to get some exits,” said Scott Higbee, partner at the Partners Group, a global private equity investment manager.
46;DG;Dollar General Corp;2012-03-28T22:20:37Z;US dollar stores: in for a dime ...;The best reason to own shares is their defensive characteristics;It was no surprise how well the dollar stores did in the crisis. Looking back, owning Dollar General, Dollar Tree or Family Dollar during the recession was an obvious trade and it paid. From the equity market’s peak in 2007 to its trough in 2009, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar outperformed the S&P 500 by 50 and 70 percentage points respectively. (Dollar General was owned by private equity for much of that period.)The performance in the recovery has been more surprising: since late 2009, all three stocks have whipped the S&P again. Consumers, apparently, picked up thrifty habits that persisted. Same-store sales growth at all three chains has remained in the mid-single digits, outshining many other retailers. What to do with the shares now? The temptation is to follow the consumer, and bargain hunt.Family Dollar reported a sound fiscal second quarter on Wednesday and set the expectation that same-store growth would be in the 5-6 per cent range for the full year. At 16 times this year’s earnings, shares are at a premium to the market as a whole but a discount to peers. There is a reason for this discount, though: sales growth at Family Dollar has been the lowest of the three, as has sales per square foot, and it has suffered gross margin pressure in recent quarters not evident at the other two. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Group has been agitating for changes that would close this gap, and the company is shifting its sales mix towards food and other consumable goods, and refurbishing stores. If this approach works, the upside could be meaningful.But the best reason to own the dollar stores is their defensive characteristics, should the recovery go sour. If the downturn does come, though, it will pay to own the ones that are executing well, not the one that is trying to refashion itself.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
47;DG;Dollar General Corp;2012-03-22T18:17:03Z;Customer loyalty lifts Dollar General sales;;Dollar General posted higher than expected quarterly earnings as more consumers went through the US discount retailer’s doors over the holiday season and spent more per visit.Shares in the Tennessee-based company, which is controlled by private equity firm KKR, rose 3.3 per cent to $46.24 in mid-afternoon trading in New York.Net sales increased 20.1 per cent to $4.19bn in the three months to February 3, compared to the same period a year earlier.Dollar General, which sells items from household goods and beauty products to toys and food, prices most of its merchandise below $10. The retailer has done well against a backdrop of high food and fuel costs and persistently high unemployment that has pushed people to cut back on discretionary spending.“The strategies and investments we have put in place over the last four years have helped us capture the market share, customer loyalty and operating efficiencies that are driving our results,” said Rick Dreiling, chairman and chief executive.Net income rose to $292.5m, or 85 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $222.5m, or 64 cents per share the year before.Dollar General said this year’s same-store sales would rise 3 to 5 per cent and total sales would rise between 8 and 9 per cent. It forecast earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75, up from $2.22 last year. Analysts expect it to earn $2.71 per share.The company, which floated in November 2009, has nearly 10,000 US stores and plans to open another 625 this year.
48;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-12-07T00:03:28Z;Boomtime buy-outs face further distress;Moody’s report highlights mediocre performance;Large leveraged buy-outs struck at the height of the credit boom face more distress after underperforming the wider market in terms of ratings, default rates and revenue growth, according to a report from Moody’s.The rating agency struck a gloomy note in its analysis of 40 large buy-outs completed between 2006 and 2008, arguing that, even after a slew of restructurings, nearly a quarter of the groups remain at a high risk of further problems. Another three have already filed for bankruptcy.“A number of companies have done a series of distressed exchanges and may do more,” said Lenny Ajzenman, senior vice-president at Moody’s. “We have questions about whether they will be able to refinance these large maturities.”High-yield bonds for Clear Channel and Harrah’s Entertainment, now renamed Caesars, both of which have already restructured, are trading close to 70 cents on the dollar and slumped lower earlier in the year as debt markets seized amid the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In the most recent quarter, TPG, which owns a big chunk of Caesars alongside Apollo, valued its equity at 60 cents on the dollar.The senior bank debt of the largest LBO ever, that of Texas utility Energy Future Holdings, is trading at 60 cents on the dollar. But its owners, KKR and TPG, value the equity at 10 cents on the dollar. Generally, however, the equity in LBOs only has value when the debt trades at par.The mediocre performance of large leveraged buy-outs is not the only legacy from the credit-fuelled bubble years between 2005 and 2008, when the sector raised nearly half of the $3.9tn in equity capital it accumulated since 1969.Even the best-performing buy-out funds have so far only returned about 30 per cent of investors’ capital, according to estimates by Triago, which advises private equity groups on fundraising.The vast majority of the remaining capital is locked in their portfolio companies or unspent.The Moody’s report does not address the wide variation in performance among the largest private equity firms. For example, TPG’s flagship TPGV global fund is valued at 84 cents on the dollar, below cost and far worse than comparable funds at its main competitors Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR.Aside from rare success stories – such as HCA, the US hospital operator taken private by KKR, Bain and Merrill Lynch for $31bn, which floated earlier this year or KKR’s Dollar General – private equity groups have struggled to exit large deals.Only seven companies in the Moody’s group have managed an initial public offering, sometimes after paying dividends to their backers, while two more have distributed a pay-out to sponsors.The 40 deals have suffered more downgrades than the wider corporate universe since being taken private, said Moody's. While they have also lagged behind the wider market in terms of median revenue growth, they have kept pace in terms of profit expansion – a sign that private equity’s laser-like focus on costs and efficiency may have borne fruit.Private equity firms have, however, been a big part of refinancings in the past two years. For example, in 2009, borrowers were looking at $430bn in high-yield debt coming due, according to data from JPMorgan. But today that figure has been almost halved to $220bn.
49;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-11-04T12:18:30Z;KKR reports $592m loss on writedowns;;KKR reported an economic net loss of $592m for its third quarter, which largely reflects marked-to-market writedowns on its investments on the back of plunging stock markets, but the buy-out group still outperformed analysts’ expectations.By contrast, in the same period of last year KKR registered a gain of $317m using its standard measure of economic net income which excludes certain expenses associated with going public.KKR’s private equity investments registered a paper loss of 8.5 per cent for the three months to September.Still, for the first nine months of the year, KKR managed to outperform the S&P by over 10 percentage points and registered an increase in fee-related earnings of 35 per cent to $301m. While the S&P index has been down 9 per cent for the first three quarters, KKR’s private equity funds are still in positive territory, up 1.5 per cent.KKR has $58.7bn under management. All of its funds were valued above cost except one of its European buy-out funds. Its shares were down 2.8 per cent at $13.15 in early New York trading.The performance of some of its biggest deals from the bubble years remains mixed. For example, Energy Future Holdings is being carried at about a 10th of its original value , while Dollar Generalis up more than four times cost.Like its great rival Blackstone, KKR expects a better fourth quarter, largely because the S&P which was down 14 per cent in the quarter just ended, has risen 11 per cent since the end of September.KKR’s diversification into the capital markets business is also gaining traction as banks, hampered by regulatory requirements and the uncertain economic outlook, increasingly curb their lending.“A lot of providers of capital are gone,” said Scott Nuttall, head of capital markets at KKR and one of the firm’s rising stars. “There is a big imbalance between demand for funds and the supply of funds and alternative investment firms like KKR can fill that gap.”That means that KKR is doing everything from syndicating out the equity of its deals through its US broker dealer to operating a non-bank finance company in India. For example, when KKR bought Academy Sports, a $2.4bn deal, it wrote an equity check for $800m. Rather than bringing in other private equity firms in a ‘club’ deal, it then syndicated out a portion of that equity to investors in its funds and to a group of mutual funds and hedge funds, improving its own economics in the process.While KKR has returned $5bn to investors this year, it still lags behind another rival, Carlyle, which has returned almost three times as much to its limited partners year to date. Selling out of investments has become critical both in determining the attitude of limited partners in funds and in influencing dividends paid to public shareholders.KKR declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10, the same as Blackstone.
50;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-10-23T23:28:05Z;Books: disruptive influence;Strategy can help innovators sidestep heavyweight opposition;Innovation is the hottest topic in business these days, and a doctrinal gulf is now opening up between the key thinkers on the subject. On one side are those who embrace the ideas of collaborative consumption and fast failure, who argue that innovators need to experiment with their potential consumers until they find a product or service that succeeds. These are the doers, the tinkerers who see innovation as a kind of performance art, to be done in full public view and modified according to the cheers and jeers of the crowd.On the other side are the strategists, those who still believe in thinking through an innovation before leaping in. Michael Raynor, a management consultant and protégé of Clay Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor, is one of the most articulate and interesting of the strategists.In The Innovator’s Manifesto, he takes us on a highly analytical path, weighing and testing Prof Christensen’s most famous idea of “disruptive innovation”, and seeing if it is a useful tool for analysing a business opportunity and creating an appropriate solution.Raynor’s purpose is to unpack the ideas around disruption to such an extent that one should feel comfortable using the theory to predict, explain and implement innovation. He is not an easy read, which is a shame because he has many interesting things to say.Disruption’s central claim, he writes, is that “an innovation has the best chance of success when it has a very different performance profile and appeals to customers of relatively little interest to dominant incumbents, and the organisation commercialising it enjoys substantial strategic and operational autonomy”.In the music industry, for example, digital downloads crept up on the big record labels. At first, they were just for people on the technological fringes. But slowly they became more popular, as such companies as Apple and Amazon made it easier to download and play digital music. What began as a low-cost entrant into the music industry ended up overturning the high-cost, high-profit CD business. Companies from outside the music business led the revolution. They created not just a new product in an existing market, but a new business model to upend the dominant companies.Raynor draws on a diverse set of examples, from Southwest Airlines to Holiday Inn, and Apple to the Dollar General retail store. He writes that disruption is only possible when an “enabling technology” or process comes along to allow a company to break the trade-offs made by everyone else in a sector.Raynor writes convincingly that the current enthusiasm for “fast failure” and corporate “cultures of learning” is unrealistic. Corporate pathologies, such as “long memories, the jockeying for position, decision making by consensus”, he writes, lead to “risk aversion and incrementalism”, which make such innovation processes unworkable.It is much more realistic for companies to strategise their way to innovation by focusing on areas where they might have a disruptive effect and designing processes and teams to exploit them. This requires a high degree of self-awareness and self-criticism.Raynor cites a set of experiments done on MBA students, in which they were asked to rate the likelihood of success of a group of businesses before and after studying the theory of disruptive innovation. Their success rate went up by 50 per cent after learning about disruption.If companies could think their way to similar levels of improvement, then innovation might not seem such a frightening prospect.‘The Innovator’s Manifesto’ is published by Crown Business ($23)
51;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-09-01T17:58:09Z;Discount clubs lead way with sales boost;;Discount warehouse clubs, which cater to middle-income Americans under pressure to save money, posted strong sales figures for August even as other some retailers and less wealthy consumers continue to struggle.BJ’s Wholesale Club, which is being taken private by two buy-out groups in a $2.8bn deal, posted an 11 per cent jump in August sales from a year ago, while Costco, the sector leader by revenue, posted a 6 per cent rise in US sales.The strong performance of discount warehouse clubs in recent months is a sign that middle-income Americans continue to search for ways to economise on groceries as they face persistent economic worries over jobs, debts, house prices and inflation.Overall, retail sales from 25 companies that report monthly figures were up 5.5 per cent from last August, but the companies represent only 20-30 per cent of total sales and do not distinguish the impact of higher ticket prices from changes in sales volumes.For consumers, last month was marked by extreme stock market volatility – which tends to unnerve people with investment portfolios – and bookended by the US debt ceiling impasse at the start and Hurricane Irene on the east coast at the end.The discount warehouse clubs let fee-paying members pay low prices to bulk-buy products – such as 2kg jars of mayonnaise and 36-packs of toilet roll – which they stack on towering shelves in their industrial-style outlets.John Long, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm, said: “Consumers are looking at higher food, fuel and apparel prices and these warehouse clubs offer them an opportunity to stock up on staples that they may use for three or four months. That’s a way of protecting yourself against inflation.”Costco announced late on Wednesday that Jim Sinegal, its chief executive and co-founder, would step down at the end of this year to be replaced by Craig Jelinek, currently chief operating officer.“He’s leaving the company in tip-top shape,” said Daniela Nedialkova, analyst at Atlantic Equities, who said Costco’s success was built on offering a limited range of select products and negotiating hard with suppliers to secure the lowest possible prices.Costco’s August net sales at its US and international businesses combined were $6.9bn.The second-biggest warehouse chain is Walmart’s Sam’s Club, which last month reported a 9.5 per cent rise in sales to $13.6bn in the three months to July 31, even as Walmart-branded stores reported a ninth consecutive decline in quarterly like-for-like sales.Sales at BJ’s Wholesale last month hit $901m. The company’s acquisition by two buy-out groups, Leonard Green and CVC Capital Partners, is expected to close by the end of this year.Rather than warehouse clubs, Mr Long said that low-income Americans continued to shop at dollar stores such as Dollar General and Family Dollar, because they were deterred by the clubs’ membership fees.“People who are living pay cheque to pay cheque have to assess whether they feel they’re getting a return on that subscription,” he said.
52;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-08-07T16:10:16Z;Big US chains begin to ‘shrink’ their stores;;American shops are getting smaller as retailers seek to reach consumers through new compact formats in the face of a stagnant economy, demographic shifts and a growing demand for convenience.Retailers including Walmart, Office Depot and Best Buy are introducing smaller stores in urban areas, a departure from the “big box” stores on which they built their success at out-of-town sites in the past three decades.Tesco, which has forged into the US with stores that are smaller than traditional supermarkets, is shrinking its format further with convenience stores that might be dubbed “micro-boxes” by US standards.“The cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all doesn’t seem to work that well any more,” says Ira Kalish, director of global economics at Deloitte Research, who links the shrinking of stores to the diversification – or fragmentation – of consumer profiles and preferences.But the convergence of so many retailers on small formats is creating stiff competition and exacerbating the difficulties of operating on expensive and unfamiliar plots, squeezed between the offices, car parks and apartment blocks of big cities.Walmart, the discounter that dominates US retail, has opened three Walmart Express test stores in recent months and says it wants to open 15 to 20 by the end of next year.At about 15,000 sq ft, the Walmart Express stores are just 8 per cent the size of Walmart’s trademark Supercenters, which are 185,000 sq ft and cover the same ground as two-and-a-half standard football pitches.Tesco of the UK began its move into California under the Fresh & Easy brand with stores of between 7,000 sq ft and 10,000 sq ft. But to push deeper into urban areas it plans to open stores as small as 3,000 sq ft, roughly the size of a UK convenience store.“We are always looking at different sizes of stores,” says Tim Mason, chief executive of Fresh & Easy.The shrinking of stores is partly borne of the “age of convenience”, says Ken Berliner, president of Peter J Solomon, a boutique investment bank. “Consumers want more choices. Retailers need to offer whatever the consumer wants to buy, however they would like to buy it, whether in stores, through a catalogue or online.”Cash-strapped shoppers are also less willing to fund long drives to big boxes given high gas prices.That helps explain the post-crisis popularity of small-format dollar stores – Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and 99 Cents Only – which between them already have more than 20,000 stores. They, too, are building more.Consumers’ expectations for convenience have been raised by online shopping, an option that has harmed Best Buy, the US’s biggest traditional electronics retailer.Part of its response has been to create small-format Best Buy Mobile stores, which sell telephones and tablet computers and will expand in number this year by 150 to 325.Target, a Walmart rival, is next year planning to open five experimental City Target stores, which will be between 60,000 sq ft and 100,000 sq ft, compared with the typical 135,000 sq ft.The downsizing also signals that retailers are adjusting to a higher concentration of people in urban areas – one result of the housing bust, which emptied new developments in the Sunbelt states of the south-western US.John McIlwain, senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute, says two deeper demographic trends are also at play.First, people in their 20s and 30s are living in urban areas longer than previous generations because they are marrying and having children later.Second, baby boomers are moving back into city centres because they want to be able to walk to shops and entertainment.But, in spite of retailers’ plans, city-centre stores are “typically not their first choice”, says Mark Keschl, national director of retail at Colliers, a property agency.Retailers can run big-box stores off a single blueprint for inventories, staffing and fixtures.But in each city location, they must adapt to a different set of constraints, ranging from narrow lanes for their trailer trucks to the existence of labour unions, he says.Some retailers are not keen on the idea. Safeway, a grocery chain whose typical stores are half the size of a Walmart Supercenter, has two small shops in California but they are “a labour of love”, says Melissa Plaisance, head of investor relations.“We are profitable in both, but it’s very hard … Hard to do enough volume to cover the costs.”
53;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-08-01T22:30:40Z;Poundland to expand in Europe;;"Poundland, the discount retailer that has grown rapidly on the high street in recent years, is poised to become the first of the UK’s growing ranks of pound stores to expand abroad.The retailer, which has 347 stores in the UK, is to open six stores in the Irish Republic in a €2m ($2.8m, £1.7m) deal, which it says will form the stepping stone to a potential network of several thousand stores to span mainland Europe.In Poundland’s UK stores, everything from toothpaste to sandwiches and Shakespeare DVDs is sold for £1. However, the fixed-price format will be adapted for its European stores, which will trade as “Dealz”. Shunning the obvious choice of “Euroland”, the new name gives the retailer flexibility to vary price points.“Research we’ve conducted with consumers in Ireland and Europe shows the name Dealz transcends the language barrier,” said Jim McCarthy, chief executive of Poundland.Describing the Irish stores as “the logical first step”, he added: “We will go into mainland Europe, and we’re currently researching which countries would be most suited to our retail proposition. There are countries in eastern and western Europe which test ­positively.”The first four Irish stores will open by early October, with two more to follow by next March, creating 120 jobs. Mr McCarthy said there was potential for “four figures of stores” throughout Europe in due course.Poundland claims to have a 14 per cent share of the UK’s £36bn discount general merchandise market, making it the largest player in a fragmented sector.Reporting an 81 per cent rise in operating profits last June to £21.5m on a £510m turnover, it is on course to report record results this month.The potential for the discount store model to work over a wider territory has been shown in the US, where three chains – Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree – have 20,000 outlets between them.In Europe, discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl perform well, but European “pound shop” equivalents tend to be localised businesses which operate much smaller stores offering a limited range of products.Poundland’s rapid expansion has been fuelled by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which took a 75 per cent stake in the company in a £200m deal last year. The retailer’s strong cash generation has enabled it to self-finance its expansion with low levels of debt.“The discounters Poundland, Home Bargains and B&M Retail are among the most impressive, entrepreneurial retailers we have in the UK at the moment,” said Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital. “If the proposition is right, there’s every reason to believe they could have a go at France, Benelux and Spain.”Noting Germany’s high exposure to discount supermarkets, he disputes that this could be a barrier for Poundland in the same way it has been for supermarkets Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour, who are notably absent. “Primark went into Bremen last year, and the Germans are organising coach parties to visit the store,” he added.Nick Bubb, retail analyst at Arden Partners, added; “Pound stores aren’t just a UK phenomenon”.“Even the more affluent economies like Germany have a big discount sector, and the Aldi carparks are famously full of Mercedes cars. Poundland performs strongly in the north and Midlands, yet upmarket Twickenham is one of its best-performing stores. Considering where consumer spending and the retail property market is heading, it is bound to be a successful sector,” he said."
54;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-03-22T20:35:09Z;US stocks pause for breath after 3-day rally;;Walgreen tumbled after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings, while in the wider markets traders paused for breath following three straight sessions of strong gains.Shares in Walgreen, the largest pharmacy chain in the US by sales, lost 6.6 per cent to $39.21 after reporting earnings that only met analysts expectations.Investors had been hoping for better margins and same-store sales growth, but this failed to materialise. The stock suffered its sharpest one-day fall since December 2008 and was the worst performer on the S&P 500 index.CVS Caremark, another pharmacy chain, was down 0.9 per cent to $33.41 while the S&P retail index was down 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 edged 0.4 per cent lower to 1,293.77 in a low-volume session, as traders paused to take stock of the recent rally that has seen the S&P index pare nearly all of the losses sustained following the earthquake in Japan.Fears of a nuclear catastrophe following the natural disaster left the S&P 500 down 3.2 per cent in the first three days of last week. But as these worries subsided traders sought to pick up bargains pushing the S&P close to pre-tsunami levels.“The market wants to climb higher as the data show the US economy is largely on the right track,” said Harvey Neiman, manager of the Neiman Largecap Value Fund. “But every time we get a good run some disaster hits and we see a lot of volatility,” he added.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the markets, spiked up 46.4 per cent early last week following the earthquake and tsunami, but has also calmed down as fears have eased. The index was down 2.4 per cent in the session, adding to the 29.9 per cent decline in the last few days. The measure of fear on Wall Street is back where it was before the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan.US equities have largely recovered from the effects of Japan, but the S&P 500 is still down 3.7 per cent since before the turmoil began in north Africa and the Middle East in February. The Vix is up 22.5 per cent in the same timeframe.The 3.7 per cent loss on the S&P has been the first substantial retreat since Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his speech at Jackson Hole in late August 2010, where he hinted that the Fed would support financial markets with a renewed bond-buying program.The market subsequently gained 28 per cent in 5½ months until the rally was derailed by the turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East. “The market was in a position where it needed a correction,” said Robert Haber, the chief executive officer of Haber Trilix Advisors. “But there is a pretty good chance we have seen the short-term lows,” he added.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent to 12,018.63 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3 per cent to 2,683.87.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Jefferies Group, the investment bank, reported first-quarter earnings up 21 per cent in what the bank said was the second most profitable quarter on record. Shares in the company had added 4.6 per cent in early trading, but ended just 0.2 per cent higher at $24.48.Anadarko Petroleum signed a $1.55bn deal with the Korea National Oil Corporation for one-third of its interest in the Maverick Basin assets in Texas.The deal, which is the second-largest purchase of US oil and natural gasfields this year, will see KNOC pay all of Anadarko’s 2011 capital costs in the basin and then 90 per cent of costs subsequently until the $1.55bn is spent. The news sent shares in Anadarko up 1 per cent to $80.79.Elsewhere in the sector Newfield Exploration, the US oil group, was up 0.5 per cent to $75.58 while EOG Resources added 1.8 per cent to $113.36.Shares of Dollar General, the retailer, rose 1.5 per cent to $30.84 after the retailer reported that fourth-quarter earnings per share had more than doubled to 64 cents from 26 cents in the same period last year.Netflix gained 4 per cent to $221.39 following a note from Credit Suisse entitled “Don’t Stop Believing,” which upgrades the stock from “neutral” to “outperform”.Sprint Nextel, the number three US wireless carrier, was up 2.3 per cent to $4.47 following a 13.6 per cent loss in the previous session on news that AT&T was buying T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom.
55;DG;Dollar General Corp;2011-02-16T03:26:21Z;Peltz makes buy out offer for Family Dollar;;Trian, the investment group headed by Nelson Peltz, has made an offer to acquire Family Dollar, the US neighbourhood discount store chain, that values the retailer at up to $7bn.News of the cash offer of $55 to $60 per share sent the company’s shares soaring in after-hours trading in New York. The shares were trading at $55.35, up 25.9 per cent.In a regulatory filing, Trian said it had contacted Howard Levine, chairman and chief executive of Family Dollar, on Tuesday and advised him that it beneficially controlled 8 per cent of the retailer’s shares, which it believed made Trian the company’s largest shareholder.Trian said it had also “offered Mr Levine the opportunity to participate as an investor” in the proposed buy out, which follows a series of smaller deals for US speciality retailers including Jo Ann Stores, Gymboree and J Crew.But Trian also said that it believed a decision on whether or not to accept an offer should lie with the company’s shareholders.Mr Levine is the son of the founder who launched the chain in 1959.Trian, whose partners include Peter May and Edward Garden as well as Mr Peltz, said it may seek board representation.Family Dollar has more than 6,800 small stores in 44 US states targeting mainly low income customers. Together with rivals Dollar General and Dollar Tree, it saw its sales largely outperform mainstream retail competitors during the depths of the US recession, and it was one of the strongest performers on Wall Street last year, with its shares rising more than 60 per cent.After peaking above $50, its shares had lost ground this year, closing at $43.96 on Tuesday before the Trian announcement.Trian first disclosed a 6.6 per cent stake in Family Dollar in July last year, saying it believed the shares, then trading less than $40, were undervalued.Trian focuses on consumer investments and has in the past used its stakes to push for strategic changes at companies including Kraft, Cadbury Schweppes and Heinz, the food companies, as well as engineering the merger of Wendy’s and Arby’s fast food chains. It is the largest shareholder of the combined group.Dollar General, Family Dollar’s larger rival, was taken private by investors led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity fund, in 2007 in a $7.3bn deal, including debt. KKR sold a portion of its shares in Dollar General in an IPO last year.Both Family Dollar and Dollar General have been pursuing similar strategies aimed at improving their performance, including increasing the share of packaged groceries and other consumables that they sell, introducing refrigerators for milk and other products, expanding private label offerings, and refurbishing stores.Family Dollar, which operates stores of about 10,000 sq ft in neighbourhood shopping plazas, says that 55 per cent of its customers have annual incomes of less than $40,000, and about a quarter have incomes of less than $20,000.
56;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-12-06T21:50:25Z;US stocks edge lower despite deal activity;;Deal activity and changes at the top of Pfizer and Kellogg failed to stop US stocks following global markets slightly lower.US investors were preoccupied with eurozone negotiations about how to create a safety net for countries with sovereign debt troubles.Traders were also mulling over comments at the weekend by Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the central bank could end up increasing its commitment to buy $600bn of US Treasuries if the economy failed to respond.Mr Bernanke also said it could be four to five years before the unemployment level returned to a more normal 5-6 per cent.“It may not be a forgone conclusion yet, it seems, but best market money is not about questioning ‘if’ the Fed will pile in with a second round of quantitative easing but when,” said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC partners, who added that he thought the Fed could increase the existing bond-buying programme to more than $600bn as early as January.The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,223.12, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to close at 11,362.19 but the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,594.92.“We’re coming off a week where we were up 3 per cent, the market is at the top of its range for the year so I think there’s going to be a lot of these quiet days,” said Paul Brigandi, senior vice-president of portfolio management at Direxion.Barnes & Noble soared 10.6 per cent to $14.69 after Pershing Square Capital Management, William Ackman’s hedge fund, offered to finance Borders Group’s purchase of the bookstore chain, in a deal which would be worth $16 a share, or $960m. Ackman’s company owns shares in Borders. Shares in Borders surged 28.7 per cent to $1.39.Verigy jumped 41.7 per cent to $12.95 after the maker of semiconductor testing equipment said it had received an unsolicited bid from Tokyo-based Advantest Corp.Verigy said its board would discuss the offer with Advantest but that it did not think the bid was superior to a pending transaction with LTX Credence Corp. Shares in LTX-Credence Corp sank 12.4 per cent to $7.40.3M nudged down 0.1 per cent to $86.88 after the industrial conglomerate agreed to buy Winterthur Technologies, a Swiss maker of grinding tools, for $448m or SFr62 per share, above the Friday’s SFr58 close.3M said that the market for Winterthur’s diamond-grinding wheels and abrasive tools was expected to grow at more than 4 per cent a year.There was a series of senior US job moves with Pfizer gaining 0.5 per cent to $16.81 after the drug maker appointed a new chief executive.Ian Read, former head of global biopharmaceutical operations, was named chief executive, replacing Jeffrey Kindler who has retired. Mr Kindler had held the job since July 2006.“Although Kindler was a controversial figure with the Street, his departure is unexpected,” said analysts at JPMorgan. “From our point of view, while this management change will likely introduce some near-term disruptions, the move could accelerate strategic actions such as more aggressive repurchase or dividend policies as well as business development or divestitures priorities that we believe would be viewed as a positive by the Street.”Kellogg was almost flat at $49.30 after the cereal maker appointed John Bryant, previously chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. Mr Bryant follows David Mackay, who has retired but will work on the transition until March.The food company also reiterated its forecasts for 2010 and 2011, expecting operating profit to be flat in 2010 but between flat and a 2 per cent decline in 2011.Massey Energy added 2.4 per cent to $51.63 after the coal miner said Baxter Phillips Junior, its president, would succeed Don Blankenship as chief executive when he retired at the end of the year.Dollar Generalfell 7.3 per cent to $30.99 after the discount retailer reported 25m shares will be sold by members of senior management and an entity tied to the directors of the company.
57;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
58;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-11-23T20:42:27Z;Dollar stores’ revamp attracts richer shoppers;;Shopping carts are not usually part of the bare bones business of shopping at one of America’s small dollar stores, with their minimal staffing levels and super low overheads. So the yellow and black trolleys outside the Dollar General store in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, are a sign of change – as are the automatic sliding doors, installed to make life easier for elderly customers.The store, opened last year, is one of 500 in the chain’s 9,000 stores in 35 US states that reflect a range of design and merchandising changes carried out by the management put in place after the chain was taken private in 2007 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.Inside, the food in its expanded grocery section includes both leading national brands, and redesigned packaging for its Clover Valley private label foods. Small codes on each aisle reflect the planograms – visual diagrams used in retail to plan where every product should be placed – introduced to create more consistency and analysis of sales performance. The health and beauty section includes L’Oréal brand beauty products, introduced this year, and other more premium items.Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, says the overhaul of the chain – planned before the recession – ended up coinciding with increased visits from more affluent customers as the recession deepened, as part of the “trading down” phenomenon. “The radical change in the economic environment meant people came into Dollar General, and they go, ‘Oh my! That’s not the Dollar General I remember’,” he said.Tony Nieves, manager of the store, says it has been bringing in a wide range of customers since it opened in September 2009, with income far above the $45,000 of a typical Dollar General customer. “You see it in the parking lot: the Mercedes, the BMWs, the Hummers – we are bringing in new people,” he says.Dollar General’s stores typically cover about 7,200 sq ft, compared with traditional US supermarkets of about 45,000 sq ft, or an average Walmart Supercenter of 185,000 sq ft. Already able to claim to have more locations than almost any US retailer – more than the 8,046 of Walgreens, the largest US drugstore chain by sales – it argues there is room for growth. Another 8,000 potential store sites have been identified in states where it has a presence and about 4,000 in states where it does not have a presence.
59;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-11-23T20:08:11Z;Cut-price retailers take the limelight;;"Dollar stores, hard discount supermarkets and “off price” clothing stores have long lived in the shadow of America’s top retail names.But just as Walmart supercentres and big box “category killers” such as Best Buy rose to national prominence in the 1990s, so stores such as Save-A-Lot, Big Lots and Dollar General are becoming the new stars of a rapidly changing retail environment.“I do believe that there is a new consumerism,” says Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, which operates more than 9,100 small hard discount general stores in 35 US states. “People are conscious about saving money.”At a time when mainstream retailers have slowed growth in the long months of the recession, or stopped it altogether, the value-focused retailers have continued to expand.By the end of this year the three leading “dollar store” chains – Dollar General, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree – will have opened about 1,000 new locations this year, with an annual square footage growth rate of 5 per cent that exceeds Walmart, Target and Kmart, their far larger rivals whose growth rates are either flat or below 3 per cent.TJX Companies and Ross Stores too, “off-price” stores that sell seasonal leftovers and end of line brands, have maintained their pre-recession annual growth rates, sometimes moving into retail spaces vacated by bankrupted businesses including Circuit City, the electronics business, and Mervyn’s, the west coast department store chain.“Hard discount” grocers, which offer a highly limited selection of foods dominated by their own private label brands, are also far outstripping the rest of the supermarket business.The US unit of Aldi, the hard discount grocer, plans to expand this year at just under 10 per cent a year, adding another 100 stores to its 1,100 strong chain. Save-A-Lot, a US hard discount supermarket owned by Supervalu, is growing at a similar rate, but wants to double its store network to 2,400 stores by 2015. On the West Coast, the UK’s Tesco has continued to open up more locations for its fledgling Fresh & Easy stores, also a hard discount format.Bill Shaner, Save-A-Lot’s chief executive, says his company’s ambitious expansion plans reflect the view that it is “perfectly positioned in today’s economy”, with an Aldi-like high percentage of private label food goods, and stores with low overheads stocking a limited collection of about 1,800 product lines, including fresh items. This compares with a supermarket industry average of 48,750 product lines, according to the Food Marketing Institute.Executives at all three types of store claim they are managing to hold on to customers they acquired during the recession, and are continuing to see sales growth. Both Dollar General and Family Dollar have been remodelling stores and revamping their own label food brands, in a bid to change perceptions of what to expect in their aisles.Mr Shaner says that the Save-A-Lot stores, which are aimed at households earning less than $45,000, “are seeing new faces”.“I think that is really our opportunity, to communicate a great shopping experience …so that we do manage to keep them when the economy does get stronger.”Dollar General’s Mr Dreiling says the recession sales success of the dollar stores has also helped change perceptions among suppliers, who may initially have been loath to see their brands on the shelves of a dollar store. “When we started our journey there were a lot of people who were looking at us and raising an eyebrow,” he says of the days after the company went private in 2007.But that changed as the recession gathered momentum in early 2008, “when we began to seriously start clocking some serious sales growth”.“Tell me another retailer that’s in a mature channel in a mature business that has basically raised their average store sales volume by 25 per cent over 3 years.”US hard discount grocery sales have room for more growth, currently accounting for less than 2 per cent of total national grocery sales; in Europe market penetration for the same segment ranges from the high teens to about 44 per cent in Germany.Todd Hale, head of retail and shopper insights at Nielsen, the consumer research company, includes the growth of low-cost grocery stores as one of his predictions for changes in the retail landscape by 2015. “Consumers have fundamentally changed their habits,” he said recently.Bob Sasser, Dollar Tree chief executive, says that his chain is “positioned squarely in the cross hairs of what consumers are looking for today”, combining both low costs and accessible local stores. “Middle America is seeking value, and we are the destination.”"
60;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-08-31T20:59:15Z;US stocks flat as early gains erased;;US stocks were flat on Tuesday after fears that the Federal Reserve may have ruled out large scale asset purchases erased earlier gains made on the back of positive consumer spending and housing data.The S&P 500 closed a fraction higher at 1049.32, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1 per cent to close at 10,014.72 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.3 per cent to close at 2,114.03.An onslaught of weak economic data pushed the S&P 500 down 5 per cent over the month, making it the worst August in nine years. The financial sector led the month’s fallers, down 7.9 per cent in August, followed by industrials, which fell 7.3 per cent and information technology stocks, which declined 7.2 per cent. Telecoms and Utilities were the month’s only risers.Investors were disappointed on Tuesday after the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Committee showed members would only consider large-scale asset purchases if the outlook for the economy weakened “appreciably”.Markets had been cheered on Friday when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke suggested a greater willingness to act.“It is clear that the focus of discussion at the FOMC is on what further measures may be implemented to support the economy, and that those arguing that a “do nothing” approach is the best strategy are increasingly in the minority,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR. “Still, the minutes reveal enough difference of opinion to suggest that nothing substantial is in the cards anytime soon barring a complete economic collapse.”Before the minutes, US equities had flipped between positive and negative territory in response to mixed economic data.Both the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index and the S&P/Case Shiller home prices index were slightly better than expected but the Chicago purchasing manager’s index came in just under economists’ estimates.The consumer confidence figures dominated, cheering investors for much of the day, but the S&P 500 retailers closed flat with earlier risers Gapdown 0.1 per cent at $16.89 but JC Penney climbing 2.5 per cent to $19.98.The homebuilders also gave up earlier gains to end down 0.1 per cent. Analysts said the rise in home prices was distorted by the first homebuyer’s tax credit which has since expired.Monsanto lost 5.8 per cent to $52.65 after it became the latest company to revise down its outlook for the full year.The seed company said earnings would be towards the lower end of its previous forecast and below the consensus projection of $2.49 per share. IIn deal news, Saks, the lossmaking luxury retailer, jumped 19.7 per cent to $7.90 after it was reported that it could receive a bid of $11 a share, or $1.7bn, from a consortium of US and UK private equity groups.Shares in Lions Gate Entertainment, the film and TV company that makes the hit series Mad Men, jumped 10 per cent to $7.14 after activist investor Carl Icahn announced his intention to raise his bid for the shares in the company that he does not already own.The recent spate of acquisitions continued as 3M, which bought its last company Cogent Technologies on Monday, said it would acquire Israel-based Attenti Holdings.Attenti, which is being bought for about $230m, provides technology that tracks prisoners on parole. Shares in 3M edged down 1.4 per cent to $78.55.Deere & Co, the world’s largest maker of farm equipment, said it would sell John Deere Renewables, its wind energy business, to electricity supplier Exelon Corp for $900m. Shares in Exelonadvanced 0.5 per cent to $40.72 while Deere & Co shares also pushed higher by 0.5 per cent to $63.27.AIG, the bailed-out insurer, fell 0.2 per cent to $33.93 after the sale of its Taiwan life insurance unit to a Hong Kong-based consortium was blocked by local regulators.In earnings news, Dollar General, the discount retailer majority-owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, beat expectations and raised guidance for the full year. However, the shares fell 0.3 per cent to $27.31.
61;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-08-10T01:36:02Z;KKR withdraws plan for $500m offering;;KKR has decided to withdraw its proposed public offer of $500m, less than a month after finally listing in New York.The private equity group made the announcement as it reported economic net income of $433m for its second quarter, down 29.4 per cent from $613.5m on a pro forma basis from a year ago.KKR did not elaborate on its decision not to proceed with its stock offering.“They missed the window of opportunity, they don’t need the money and they still have the option at a later date,” said one person familiar with the matter.KKR attributed the drop in income to “lower levels of gains relating to KKR’s principal investments and lower net carried interest in its private equity portfolio”.Still, in a quarter in which the stock market dropped 11.5 per cent, KKR managed to increase the value of its private equity portfolio between 5 per cent and 10 per cent, analysts said.Meanwhile, fee-paying assets under management totalled $41.6bn, a slight drop from the second quarter of 2009, as a result of distributions, redemptions and currency movements in its euro-denominated commitments.Since listing in New York on July 15, KKR’s shares have fallen, as investors have viewed private equity firms as proxies for the financial markets generally.By some measures, KKR remains undervalued in comparison to its rival Blackstone, which listed at the peak three years ago. Blackstone’s market capitalisation is about twice KKR’s.Still, KKR’s results for the quarter compare favourably with the performance of Blackstone, which reported economic net income of $205m, a measure that excludes certain compensation expenses – a factor which has also weighed on the share price of listed private equity firms.KKR, which was among the most aggressive private equity firms in taking advantage of cheap debt during the boom years, has been among the most aggressive in taking advantage of the recovery of the markets. It has taken companies like Dollar General and semiconductor company NXP public. On a GAAP basis, which includes compensation costs, KKR recorded earnings of $29.9m for the period and said it would pay investors a distribution of 8 cents.
62;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-07-14T20:47:07Z;Weak retail sales data leave Wall St flat;;US stocks closed mostly flat on Wednesday after a six-day winning streak, in spite of a relatively strong start to the earnings season, as a report showed that retail sales had fallen more than expected last month.Headline retail sales fell 0.5 per as car sales dropped 2.3 per cent, the second consecutive month of declines. However, core retail sales, which exclude petrol, building materials and cars, increased by 0.2 per cent, the first gain since March.There has been a steady decline in bullish sentiment on the sell-side, said John Horcher, director of sell-side sales at First Coverage, a research group that tracks market sentiment. “We are seeing the sell-side get a little more scared of the market as it’s been rising recently. Sentiment is trending downward.”After a choppy morning, the S&P 500 closed flat at 1,095.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also flat, at 10,366.72, while the Nasdaq Composite had risen 0.4 per cent to 2,249.84.Yum Brands, a fast-food chain operator that owns Taco Bell among others, was 1.2 per cent lower at $41 following the release of its second-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday.The company said it expected to earn $2.43 per share this year, below the average analyst estimate of $2.48.However, its earnings for the past quarter beat expectations, coming in at 58 cents per share compared with the average estimate of 54 cents.Intel added 1.7 per cent to $21.36 after reporting the best quarter in its history. Its corporate customers increased information technology spending, boosting hopes that businesses are engaged in a long-awaited “refresh” of both hardware and software in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 1.1 per cent to $7.44.But the disappointing retail sales data weighed on retailers. Department store chain JC Penney fell 0.9 per cent to $22.99, rival Dillard’s was down 1.3 per cent at $22.11 and Macy’s dropped 0.5 per cent to $18.38.However, a number of thrift stores inched upward. Dollar Tree added 1 per cent to $42.06, Family Dollar Stores was up 1.5 per cent to $37.08 and Dollar General advanced 1.9 per cent to $28.23.Homebuilders were among the day’s laggards as the sector was downgraded from “attractive” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs, who cited a lack of immediate catalysts to boost the stocks’ performance. A rise in new home sales last month was smaller than the analysts at the brokerage had expected.Lennar Corp led the sector lower as it dropped 4.3 per cent to $14.59. Pulte was down 3 per cent at $8.54, Toll Brothers fell 2.3 per cent to $17.16 and DR Horton dropped 0.9 per cent to $10.34.Annaly Capital Management announced a common stock offering of 60m shares, sending its shares down 4.1 per cent to $17.52. The mortgage real estate investment trust said it expected gross proceeds of $1.1bn from the offering.RadioShack, a consumer electronics goods retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, as it fell 5.5 per cent to $21.17, on reports that an ongoing “soft” auction for its sale had seen a fall in interest from potential buyers.Northrop Grumman, a global security company, rallied 3.1 per cent to $56.99 after it said it was considering a possible sale or spin-off of its ship unit, in a deal that could be worth as much as $4.5bn.Caterpillar inched down 0.1 per cent to $66.70 even as estimates for its second-quarter and full-year earnings were revised upwards at RBC Capital Markets, citing evidence suggesting better than expected end-markets. The broker sees earnings per share in the quarter of 85 cents, up from its prior estimate of 72 cents. Caterpillar will report its second-quarter earnings on July 22 before the open.JPMorgan Chase lost 0.3 per cent to $40.35 a day before its second-quarter earnings release. Analysts’ average earnings per share estimate is 71 cents per share.Marriott International, due to report earnings on Wednesday after the market’s close, rose 0.9 per cent to $32.16. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of 29 cents from the hotels group.
63;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-07-13T19:15:01Z;Citi sells interests in private equity fund;;Citigroup is selling most of its interests in its private equity fund of funds and other investments to Lexington Partners in a deal affecting about $5bn in assets, as part of chief executive Vikram Pandit’s plan to streamline the bank.StepStone Group will buy Citigroup’s management platform and will manage the assets on Lexington’s behalf as part of the transaction.These so-called Citi Private Equity operations were part of Citigroup Holdings and were earmarked by Mr Pandit for disposal. But the sale also shows how banks are trying to comply with rules, expected to be passed soon as part of Washington’s overhaul of financial regulation, that limit fund investments to 3 per cent of a bank’s capital.Citigroup, however, is not divesting other private equity operations, held under its Citi Capital Advisors arm, which has $14bn under management. That includes Citigroup’s Metalmark Capital, which invests primarily in commodities, iCiti Venture Capital International and its infrastructure funds.That Citigroup plans to keep these operations reflects the views of many Wall Street banks that the 3 per cent figure is more of a mandate than a constraint.Lexington Partners will acquire Citigroup’s stakes in some of the biggest funds of buy-out firms such as Apollo, Blackstone and KKR. It also gains interests in other funds and co-investments Citi made alongside major buy-out firms in deals such as KKR’s purchase of Dollar General. The stake includes part of the bank’s investment in GMAC.StepStone began as an adviser to pension plans and sovereign wealth funds on alternative investments and has recently expanded into providing private equity asset management services. It has been an adviser to Citigroup’s own pension plan. It is not clear how much – if anything – StepStone is paying to acquire the Citigroup platform.A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the transaction price.There may be further sales. The Citi Private Equity business invested some $2bn of Citi’s own capital – the deal will reduce Citi’s own assets by $1bn for financial reporting purposes – and about $8bn on behalf of third party clients, most of whom were high net worth clients of Citi’s private bank.“The transaction is part of Citi’s strategy to reduce the assets and businesses within Citi Holdings, its portfolio of non-core operating businesses and assets in an economically rational manner while working to generate long term profitability and growth from the core businesses within Citicorp,” Citi said in a statement.
64;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-06-08T23:18:43Z;Dollar General poses threat to Walmart;;Dollar General, the US hard discount retailer, on Tuesday demonstrated a growing competitive threat to Walmart, the largest US retailer, as its almost 9,000 small local stores reported robust sales that outstripped its far larger rival.The retailer, which like Walmart aims primarily at low income customers, reported a 6.7 per cent increase in comparable store sales during its first quarter. Walmart, in contrast, saw a 1.4 per cent fall in its same store sales during the same quarter.Dollar General’s quarterly sales of $3.3bn were only a fraction of Walmart’s $62.32bn for the quarter but its stronger growth suggested it is winning low income customers away from Walmart.Rick Dreiling, chief executive of Dollar General, argued that during the quarter customers shopped “on a more regular basis”, with higher spending per visit and more visits.“We also believe that we are continuing to attract new customers. It is evident that consumers continue to make significant behavioural changes in their spending habits …I think it’s fair to say that consumers have reset their spending norms.”Dollar General’s small stores sell a highly targeted selection of 10,000-12,000 items of packaged food, health and beauty products, with most items priced at less than $10.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Walmart’s US stores, said last week that Walmart was losing some business to more convenient rivals, as high fuel prices discouraged customers from driving to its stores for “fill up” shopping trips.Mr Dreiling on Tuesday echoed Mr Castro-Wright in expressing concern about the impact of unemployment and noted his customers’ continued caution over discretionary spending.In contrast, US department stores and Target, the more upmarket discounter, reported continued signs of a recovery of spending by their more middle class customers during the first quarter.Dollar General has been controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, since 2007. Under Mr Dreiling it has overhauled its operations, while moving to increase sales by expanding its grocery business and remodelling stores.It plans to add 600 new stores to its network this year.Dollar General raised its full-year earnings forecast to $1.62 to $1.69 per share before one-time items, up from its previous forecast of $1.55 to $1.63.
65;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-06-08T20:59:35Z;US stocks gain after choppy session;;The bulls staged a moderate rally late in the session on Tuesday but the main indices remained near their closing lows for the year so far.Comments by Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, after markets closed on Monday that the US recovery was proceeding, though at a “moderate” pace, provided some comfort to investors.Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners, said he expected trading to remain choppy in the near term and stay within the current trading ranges.“Two factors that could lead to a bounce-back are Libor rates coming down, indicating that banks are trusting each other more, and any sort of practical unity [of action] by European leaders,” Mr Shea said. “Currently we are seeing a lot of talking and not a lot of walking.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent to 1,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.3 per cent to 9,939.98 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.2 per cent to 2,170.57.Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 3.8 per cent to $56.94 as the deepwater oil driller was downgraded to “sell” from “neutral” at Goldman Sachs and “underperform” from “market perform” at FBR Capital Markets.US-listed shares in BP fell 5.7 per cent to $34.68. The commander of the US spill-response team said it was not known how much crude continued to leak from the company’s Gulf of Mexico well. BP faces pressure by US lawmakers to reduce its dividend payment.Caterpillar rallied 1.4 per cent to $56.61 after the construction equipment company affirmed its long-term profit target. It said it expected to earn $8 to $10 per share during 2012.Talbots, an apparel retailer, lost 9.5 per cent to $12.20 in spite of reporting better-than-expected second-quarter profit. It forecast full-year earnings that beat average analyst estimates.Dollar General gained 2.1 per cent to $29.83 after the discount retailer reported its first-quarter results and raised its profit forecast for the full year. It expects to earn as much as $1.69 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share.Fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s pushed 2.4 per cent higher to $68.38 as it reported better-than-expected May sales. Established restaurant sales were up 4.8 per cent globally.But the company said a weak euro was expected to lower full-year profit. About 41 per cent of McDonald’s revenues were recorded in Europe last year.Rival Burger King said on Monday it was also expecting unfavourable currency conversion effects to hurt its full-year results. The chain was up 0.8 per cent to $18.37 on Tuesday.Materials stocks were some of the session’s best performers as the price of gold and copper rose.Southern Copper added 6.3 per cent to $27.89, Newmont Mining climbed 2.3 per cent to $56.45 and Alcoa rallied 2.4 per cent to $10.76.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was 4.8 per cent higher at $61.48. The metals producer was upgraded to “overweight” from “neutral” at HSBC, but the broker reduced its 12-month target price to $80 from $85.“We believe that FCX’s cash flows should benefit from US dollar strength, especially at its operations in Indonesia and South America,” the broker said.Intel, a maker of semiconductors, was down 0.6 per cent to $20.18 and Nvidia, which makes visual computing technologies, fell 2.8 per cent to $11.18.Internet-based stocks were also lower, weighed down by several downgrades at Bank of America.Amazon fell 2.6 per cent to $118.84 as the broker lowered its target price to $150 from $155 and Google declined 0.2 per cent to $484.78 as its target price was cut to $630 from $685. Netflix, an online film rental company, bucked the trend to rise 1.1 per cent to $110.33 as its target price was increased to $130 from $120 at Caris.JPMorgan Chase rose 2.9 per cent to $37.78 on reports it is selling about $716m of bonds tied to commercial properties on less favourable terms than when the debt was issued.Bank of America was up 3.4 per cent to $15.33, Citigroup added 2.2 per cent to $3.72, and Morgan Stanley advanced 1.2 per cent to $25.59.
66;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-06-01T20:41:18Z;Wall Street lower on mixed data;;"US stocks bounced around the flat line on Tuesday but closed lower on the day, as the day’s mixed macroeconomic data gave support to both the bulls and the bears.Early in the session investors digested disappointing manufacturing reports from China, which suggested that future global economic growth might be weaker than previously expected.However, strong US manufacturing data provided evidence that a domestic recovery remains relatively unaffected by problems in the eurozone.The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing survey index fell less than expected by economists, to 59.7 in May, just off the six-year-high mark reached in April.Jim Dunigan, executive vice-president and managing executive of investments at PNC Wealth Management, was bullish on US growth prospects.He said: “The bottom line is that, in spite of all the negative news, the recovery here remains on track.” Mr Dunigan expects sectors that are most exposed to the recovery to perform best, namely technology and industrials.The S&P 500 closed down 1.7 per cent to 1,070.71, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.1 per cent to 10,024.02 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5 per cent lower to 2,222.33.US-listed shares in BP sank 15 per cent to $36.52 as traders got their first chance to react to news that its latest attempt to cut the rate of oil leaking from its well in the Gulf of Mexico had failed.The company’s ‘top kill’ strategy failed to close the leak at the weekend, forcing it to start a long process of installing a cap on the well.There was also speculation that BP, whose shares have lost almost 40 per cent of their value since the spill begun, could be a takeover target.Transocean, the deep-water driller and owner of the oil rig, lost 11.9 per cent to $50.04 and Halliburton, a contractor on the oil rig, declined 14.8 per cent to $21.15. Among the session’s biggest fallers were oil drillers and energy-related stocks. Diamond Offshoreslumped 7.3 per cent to $58.51, Smith Internationalfell 8.3 per cent to $34.45 and Schlumberger retreated 7.8 per cent to $51.75.Construction equipment maker Caterpillar declined 2.5 per cent to $59.27 after it said its Progress Rail Services unit would buy Electro-Motive Diesel for $820m in cash from Berkshire Partners and Greenbriar Equity Group, two private equity groups.The target had $1.8bn in revenue last year.AIG fell 3.2 per cent to $34.25 as the insurer rejected a revised $30.4bn cash and shares offer by London-listed insurer Prudential for its Asian insurance business but remained in negotiations.RadioShack bucked the day’s downward trend and rallied 2.8 per cent to $21.01, making it one of the best performers of the session, on renewed rumours that the electronics retailer is in negotiations to sell itself.Reports named Blackstone Group, a private equity group, as a leading bidder. The deal may be worth as much as $3bn.Consumer staples companies were some of the strongest performers. Hershey, a confectioner, rallied 2.6 per cent to $48. The
company said it was planning to modernise and upgrade its manufacturing processes.Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola’s largest bottler, fell 0.8 per cent to $25.90 even as the stock was raised from “hold” to “buy” at Stifel Nicolaus.General Mills, a food and beverage group, added 1.1 per cent to $72, Dollar General, a discount retailer, gained 1 per cent to $30.54 and Walmart, a value retail chain, rose 0.7 per cent to $50.92.Apple gained 1.5 per cent to $260.83 as sales of its iPad portable computer device reached 2m, just two months after its launch. The target price on the stock was raised by at least two brokers.Barclays Capital and UBS, which have an “overweight” and a “buy” rating on Apple, respectively, both raised their price target from $315 to $320.Financials were lower. JPMorgan pulled back 2.6 per cent to $38.54 and Morgan Stanley lost 3.6 per cent to $26.13.Citigroup slipped 2.8 per cent to $3.85 even as Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber Al-Thani, Qatar’s prime minister, was reported to have said his government is considering buying a stake in the bank."
67;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-05-28T13:37:16Z;Toys R Us plans to raise up to $800m in IPO;;Toys R Us, the toy retailer, said on Friday it planned to raise up to $800m in an initial public offering, the latest in a series of share sales by companies sold to private investors during the private equity boom of 2005-06.The company, which runs or licenses more than 1,500 stores globally, was acquired in 2005 in a $7.5bn deal led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital Partners and Vornado Realty Trust. At the time, it was struggling with falling sales and closing stores, as it battled growing competition from Walmart and Target, the mass discounters.In a share sale prospectus filed with regulators on Friday, it highlighted performance improvements under Gerald Storch, a former senior executive at Target who took over as chief executive in early 2006, saying that 98 per cent of its company-owned stores were now profitable.Under Mr Storch, the retailer closed or relocated underperforming stores, switching some Toys R Us locations to its stronger Babies R Us banner, and creating new formats that combine both names. It has expanded its range of private label toys and sought more exclusive products offerings from the big toymakers, seeking to differentiate itself from its discount rivals.The retailer fared comparatively well during the consumer slump that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2007. US sales decreased by 1.9 per cent last year to $8.3bn, while total sales of $13.6bn were down 1.1 per cent.The company said it planned to use some of the funds raised to reduce its long-term debt, which stands at $5.2bn on operating earnings of $784m.Toys R Us benefited from the December 2008 bankruptcy of KB Toys, its smaller rival, which operated more than 350 smaller stores. Last year it also acquired the stores and brand of FAO Schwarz, the more upmarket toy retailer, which operates its own stores as well as toy departments in a number of Macy’s department stores.Other innovative moves included opening temporary stores during last year’s holiday season and reintroducing “layaway” deferred purchase schemes to support sales during the economic downturn.Bain Capital and KKR are also supporting a proposed $4.6bn IPO for HCA, the US hospital operator that they took private in 2006. KKR has also sold stakes in Dollar General, the US discount retailer, and Avago Technologies, a Singapore semiconductor maker.
68;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-05-03T17:21:29Z;Warburg Pincus acquires Poundland;;Warburg Pincus, the US-based private equity group, will on Tuesday unveil the buy-out of Poundland, the discount retailer that sells all products for £1, as it calculates that consumers will continue to pinch pennies as the UK emerges from recession.Pound stores have been among the winners to emerge from the downturn, snapping up properties left vacant by other failed retailers and attracting cash-strapped shoppers.Advent International bought Poundland for about £50m in 2002 and recently appointed Close Brothers to assess its strategic options for the value retailer.Before an auction could start, Warburg Pincus swooped on it and sealed a deal with an all-equity offer valuing the company at about £200m.Discount chains have also been boosted by the demise of Woolworths, and took about £60m of sales from the collapsed retailer during the course of 2009, according to Verdict, the retail research group.Poundland was established in 1990 with the intention of mimicking the success of single-price stores in the US, such as Dollar General. It aims to open another 50 stores over the next year, taking it to more than 300 outlets.The company is established as the UK market leader of single-price stores. Last year, it sold 185m batteries, 21m metres of aluminium foil, 1.7m umbrellas, 4m jars of coffee and 500,000 garden gnomes.Under Advent’s ownership, the company has grown its store base from 70 to 260 and increased its workforce from 3,000 to 7,000. Its revenues rose by a quarter to £510m in the year to March 2010. Advent valued the company at about 10 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which increased 27 per cent to £20m in the year to March 29 2009 and were expected to rise further last year.Poundland could one day reach 650 stores under plans drawn up by chief executive Jim McCarthy, a former managing director of J Sainsbury’s convenience stores.Warburg Pincus, tracing its roots back to the creation of EM Warburg in 1939, confirmed its place as one of the world’s biggest private equity groups by raising a new $15bn (£9.8bn) fund in 2008. It was advised by Credit Suisse on the Poundland deal.Unlike many large private equity groups, it invests in growth capital, venture capital and leveraged buy-outs from a single global fund, so is used to taking minority stakes and often invests without debt, as it has in Poundland.Last year, Warburg Pincus bought a minority stake in Premier Foods, the maker of Hovis bread and Bisto gravy. Its other retail investments include Nieman Marcus, the US luxury goods retailer, and AmRest, the polish restaurant group.Advent recently sought to replicate the success it has enjoyed with Poundland by acquiring DFS, the sofa retailer, in a £500m deal it announced last month.
69;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-02-24T23:56:51Z;Private equity giant KKR plans US flotation;;KKR sounded the starting gun on plans for a US listing and announced a return to the black with the private equity group reporting annual income of almost $2bn due to a rebound in the value of its portfolio.Buoyed by a recovery in the financial markets, KKR said that it had elected to seek a New York listing and that it would prepare and file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission “as promptly as practicable”.The decision follows KKR’s merger last year with its Amsterdam-listed KKR Private Equity Investors unit.A US listing would move the firm, founded in 1976 by cousins Henry Kravis and George Roberts, closer towards matching its great rival Blackstone.Just as the private equity industry has generally been recovering from the financial crisis by floating more companies on buoyant stock markets and finding debt more accessible for new buy-out deals, so KKR said that its performance had rebounded in 2009.Reporting its first annual results as a public company listed in Amsterdam, KKR said it had made net economic income of $515.3m for the fourth quarter and $1.95bn for the year.It wrote up the value of its $27bn portfolio by 34 per cent last year and said it would pay its first ever dividend of 8 cents per share for the fourth quarter.That contrasted with a grim performance in 2008, when it suffered colossal writedowns on many of the big buy-outs it completed at the peak of the market, and its Amsterdam-listed KPE fund reported a $2.2bn writedown.KKR said assets under management had increased from $43.8bn at the end of March to $52.2bn at the end of December, due to write-ups on the value of its portfolio and new funds raised during the year.One of the biggest write-ups was for Dollar General, the US discount retailer, which KKR took public last year. It also wrote up the value of its investment in HCA, the US’s biggest hospital operator.The company said it earned $618.4m from fees during the year, made up of $176.2m of transaction and monitoring fees and $442.2m of management and incentive fees.It said it had $14.5bn of “dry powder” left to spend on new deals.KKR enjoyed a one-third rise in fees between the first and second halves of the year as deal activity picked up. Shareholders care about fees, while investors in funds dislike fees, which they largely pay.Blackstone will today report annual results that are expected to show a similar rebound in performance and underlying activity.Investors may also ask for more detail about Blackstone’s recent agreement to refinance the debt of Hilton, shaving about $4bn off the debts of the hotel chain that it bought for $20bn in 2007 and injecting $800m more cash into the company.
70;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Booming sales spur TJX into expansion;;TJX Companies, the low-price US retailer whose sales have boomed during the recession, said on Wednesday that it planned to accelerate stores growth, citing a “paradigm shift” in US consumers’ spending habits.TJX operates more than 2,700 “off-price” stores in North America and Europe, including the TJ Maxx, Marshalls and TK Maxx chains, selling excess branded clothing lines sourced from manufacturers and other retailers.Carol Meyrowitz, chief executive, said TJX planned to add 130 new stores in 2010, on top of 91 new stores last year, saying she was confident the company could hold on to the new customers it attracted last year. “We believe that there has been a paradigm shift among customers to value,” she said. “Regardless of whether the economy is weak or strong, value is not going out of fashion. If some of our newly-acquired customers go back to shopping at their favourite high-end department stores …that does not mean they’ll stop shopping with us.”TJX’s upbeat view of the new value-conscious consumer was supported by a survey from Booz & Co, the retail consultant, that says the recession has shaped consumption patterns “in ways that will persist even as the economy rebounds”.The survey of 2,000 US consumers found that nearly two-thirds said they would shop at different stores with lower prices even if it was less convenient for them. Only 18 per cent said they intended to spend at pre-recession levels on clothing and shoes.Bob Sasser, chief executive of Dollar Tree, whose local ultra-low-cost stores have also gained customers during the recession, said on Wednesday he too expected to retain new customers as the economy revives.“We believe that as the economy recovers that we’re going to have stickiness,” he said, as the retailer reported a 6.6 per cent increase in fourth quarter same store sales.TJX reported a 58 per cent increase in fourth-quarter earnings to $395m, or 94 cents per share, on Wednesday, on a 12 per cent increase in same-store sales.Total revenues increased 7 per cent to $20bn in 2009, as its sales growth outperformed mainstream stores and discounters including Walmart and Target.TJX plans to increase capital spending to $750m in 2010, including investment in store remodelling. It also plans to open a new store concept in the US that it expects to expand into a 90-100 chain.The expansion underlines the surging fortunes of value-focused retailers. Dollar Tree is adding 245 new stores this year, while Dollar General, its rival, plans to open 600 new stores.Ms Meyrowitz said TJX, which has also expanded into Germany and Poland, could eventually double in size.
71;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-02-01T22:17:41Z;Citigroup set to sell part of investment arms;;"Citigroup is preparing to sell parts of its private equity, real estate and hedge fund investment arms, which together manage about $20bn of assets, as the bank presses ahead with plans to sell $900bn of non-core assets to repay debt.People familiar with the bank said the managers of Citi Private Equity were looking to raise capital for a management buy-out of the division, which has $10bn of assets. But no auction of the business has started yet.The move comes just weeks after US President Barack Obama announced plans to prevent banks from owning or investing in private equity or hedge funds under the Volcker Rule, which was inspired by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve.Citi said it designated Citi Private Equity, Citi Property Investors and Hedge Fund Management Group as non-core operations a year ago – before the Volcker Rule was announced – by moving them into Citi Holdings, its vehicle for assets due to be sold.Banks across the world have been reconsidering whether to keep their in-house private equity and hedge funds arms, as their performances have fallen and pressure has increased to put more regulatory capital against such investments.Citi has decided to sell the parts of its Alternative Investments business that rely most heavily on its own proprietary funds.It is keeping the parts that invest mainly on behalf of its clients, making them more acceptable under the Volcker Rule.The US bank is closest to completing the planned sale of Citi Property Investors, its real estate arm, which has about $12.5bn of assets under management and has attracted interest from Apollo Management and Macquarie.Citi Private Equity manages investments in other private equity funds, a portfolio of minority co-investment stakes in buy-outs, and mezzanine debt investments.It invests about $2bn on behalf of Citi’s proprietary accounts and about $8bn
for third-party clients.A person close to the bank said the managers could find it tough to raise money to buy the business themselves.It was not clear if Citi would sell its proprietary share of the funds or just the management company that earns fees for running the investments.Citi plans to keep some of its other private equity businesses.It is also looking to sell its Hedge Fund Management Group, which allocates money to hedge funds on behalf of its own investors."
72;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;KKR snaps up Pets at Home for £955m;;KKR, the US private equity group, has agreed to acquire Pets at Home in a deal valuing the UK’s leading supplier of dog collars, cat flaps, rabbit hutches and fish tanks at £955m.The takeover by KKR follows an intensely competitive auction between some of the world’s biggest private equity groups for Pets at Home, which persuaded its owner – Bridgepoint – to ditch plans for an initial public offering.Bridgepoint will make more than an eight-times return on its initial equity investment in the chain, which it bought for £230m in 2004. The price paid by KKR was at the top end of the IPO valuation range.The decision highlights a trend of private equity groups swooping for companies being readied for an IPO by rival buy-out groups. Similar bids are expected for Kabel Deutschland, the German cable operator, and New Look, the UK clothing retailer.It also suggests a recovery in credit markets is encouraging private equity groups to be more ambitious after a two-year slump in buy-outs.KKR’s own capital markets business teamed up with Nomura, Calyon and Commerzbank to underwrite a £450m debt package for the deal.Pets at Home has enjoyed resilient growth amid the recession, with like-for-like sales rising 6.7 per cent in the six weeks to January 7.The retailer has expanded from 147 stores in 2005 to about 250 stores today. KKR intends to work with Matt Davies, chief executive since 2004, to accelerate its growth rate of opening 20 stores a year and expand its own-brand pet food range.John Pfeffer, the executive who led the deal, said: “It is a rare case in UK retail – a sizeable business that is still growing fast.”KKR owns several big retailers, including Toys R Us and Dollar General in the US and Alliance Boots in the UK. It will advertise heavily and roll-out pet grooming and veterinary services to more stores.The US private equity group saw off competition froms TPG, Apax Partners and Bain Capital. The chain is expected to see £84m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the year to March.Separately, KKR on Wednesday made a pre-IPO investment of several hundred million euros for a 35 per cent stake in the flavours and ingredients business of Rudolf Wild, a German food company, run by its eponymous billionaire founder.
73;DG;Dollar General Corp;2010-01-26T05:43:21Z;Retail body forecasts 2.5% US sales rise;;Retail sales in the US are set to rebound this year, according to the National Retail Federation industry group.The NRF said it expected “positive signs” from the housing market and employment levels to strengthen consumer confidence throughout the year.It forecast a 2.5 per cent rise in retail sales for 2010, excluding spending on cars, petrol and restaurants, compared with a 2.5 per cent fall last year. Rosalind Wells, chief economist, said shoppers were expected “to continue to be frugal with discretionary spending” but retailers would start to benefit from “leaner, smarter inventories” and 18 months of “pent up consumer demand”.“As we continue to see signs of improvement throughout the US economy in 2010, overall sentiment will begin to lift, making way for slight increases in consumer spending,” she said.Other positive contributions will come from trade, especially strong exports, a turnround in the inventory cycle, and federal government spending.The NRF also expected consumer spending to continue to lag behind overall growth, as households pay down debt levels.Sales in the November to December holiday season were at the high end of conservative expectations, up 1.1 per cent according to the NRF against its forecast of a 1 per cent fall.Most leading US retailers say they are maintaining a conservative approach to inventory levels, and expansion plans, focusing investment on improving returns from existing stores.Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive of Target, the discounter, told investors last week that consumers “are still …considering each purchase more carefully than they once did”.But Target believed improving customer confidence meant the retailer was now being more aggressive in seeking to gain market share in discretionary categories, he said.Reflecting the subdued mood, the roster of national retailers with significant new store opening plans for the year includes Dollar General and Family Dollar, the hard discounters, which plan to open 600 and 200 small stores respectively.In contrast, Target plans to add 10, and Walmart, the largest US retailer, is halving square footage growth from pre-crash levels. Both are focusing capital spending on store remodels.Target also said last week it expects its store-brand credit card business to continue to contract during the coming year, reflecting tighter credit policies by issuers in response to changes in card legislation.The retailer predicted that its total gross credit card receivables could drop to about $7bn, from about $8bn currently, after falling from $9bn in early 2009.
74;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-12-10T21:56:21Z;Strong trade data lifts Wall Street;;A surprise improvement in the US trade deficit helped Wall Street shrug off lingering concerns over foreign sovereign debt, pushing stocks higher on Thursday.Although fresh claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected, the number of Americans seeking extended benefits fell. Separate data showed that the US trade deficit had also unexpectedly narrowed to $32.9bn.“The market is acting positively because of the trade balance but the real movement will probably come [today] on the retail sales numbers,” said Thomas Nyheim, portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust. Data is expected to show that retail sales growth, excluding cars and petrol, has slowed slightly to 0.2 per cent in November.The S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,102.35, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 10,405.83. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,190.86.Concerns over the restructuring of Dubai World, Greece’s downgrade and the revision of Spain’s outlook had weighed on the market this week.Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Some of the fears surrounding sovereign debt continue to ease for now, although lingering concerns over debt issues and treaty negotiations may continue to overhang the market in coming sessions.”The consumer discretionary sector also helped push the market higher throughout the day. AOL, the internet group, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, drawing to a close its controversial links with Time Warner.In 2000, AOL bought Time Warner, one of the world’s largest producers of entertainment and news. The acquisition ended up destroying more than $100bn in shareholder value and came to epitomise the excesses of the dot com era.Time Warner climbed 4.2 per cent to $30.45 on Thursday but AOL was less popular, falling 0.6 per cent to $23.52 in its trading debut.Gannett, which publishes USA Today, jumped 7 per cent to $12.84 after the group said profits from the fourth quarter would be higher than analyst estimates due to an improvement in advertising revenues.Dollar weakness lifted commodity-based groups higher in early trading. But even after the dollar flattened, Chevron closed up 0.5 per cent to $77.42 and Peabody Energy gained 2.1 per cent to $43.01.Anadarko Petroleum also rose 2 per cent to $58.23 after the oil and gas producer announced a discovery in the Gulf of Mexico.Citigroup was in focus after it emerged that the bank was in advanced talks with regulators over plans to raise more than $15bn in an equity offering. The capital raised will help the bank repay $20bn in bail-out funds. The shares see-sawed wildly in early trade before closing 0.3 per cent higher at $3.87.General Electric announced it had won a $1.4bn contract to supply wind turbines for what will become the world’s biggest wind farm. A total of 338 turbines are to be built at the the Shepherds Flat wind farm in Oregon by 2012. After early strength, the group’s shares closed 0.3 per cent lower at $15.61.United Technologies, which makes power generation equipment, bought a 49.5 per cent stake in Clipper Windpower, the British wind-turbine maker. United shares were up 0.8 per cent to $67.93.In the retail sector, shares in Costco Wholesale edged 0.2 per cent higher to $58.76 after strong international sales helped the group increase profits. The weaker dollar helped flatten its sales abroad, compensating for declining revenues from its petrol stations.Dollar General, the recently listed discount chain, fell 1.3 per cent to $23.70 after the group swung to a profit in the third quarter but disappointed analysts’ estimates. Budget retailers operating at the very bottom of the market such as Dollar General, which sells a quarter of its stock for less than $1, have thrived in the recession.The company, which was bought by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007, went public last month. The offering raised $716m and ranked as largest US retail IPO in more than 12 years. Since its listing, the shares have risen more than 10 per cent.
75;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-11-24T21:30:05Z;Mixed data weigh on US stocks;;"Wall Street struggled to recover its early losses on Tuesday as investors evaluated a barrage of economic data and a surprise quarterly loss from Warner Music.The Commerce Department reduced its reading of the country’s gross domestic product, consumer spending proved to be weaker than previously thought and data showed that home prices had risen less than expected in September. Declining oil prices also weighed on commodity-based stocks.Although the S&P 500 edged into positive territory in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve reduced its unemployment forecast, the benchmark index finally closed down 0.1 per cent at 1,105.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2 per cent to 10,433.71 and the Nasdaq lost 0.3 per cent at 2,169.18.“Thanksgiving week, despite typically having low volumes, normally ends up being a very positive week,” said Randy Frederick, director of active trading at Charles Schwab. “When the preliminary GDP number came out it was a surprise to the market that it was so strong and I think there was an expectation there would be a revision.”A series of corporate results also dragged the market lower.Strong international sales helped Warner Music, the world’s third-largest music company, posted higher revenues for its fourth quarter than analysts had been expecting.However, restructuring costs eroded profits and the group made a net loss for the period. The company also warned declining CD sales were likely to reduce future revenues, pushing the shares down 12.2 per cent to $6.20.Barnes & Noble dropped 5.4 per cent to $22.25 after the largest US bookstore chain reduced its full-year forecast. Borders, the second-largest bookseller also posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday, sending its shares 13.4 per cent lower to $1.74. Both retailers have faced greater competition from online booksellers such as Amazon.Hewlett-Packard posted a 14 per cent rise in quarterly profit thanks to surging demand from China and aggressive cost-cutting at home. But the computer maker’s total revenue was still down from the previous year and the shares dropped 1.6 per cent to $50.19.Discount retailers, however, continued to out­perform the sector.Dollar Tree, which sells items from magic tricks to cleaning fluids at heavy discounts, posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit.Earlier this month, Dollar General, one of its biggest rivals, launched the largest initial public offering in the US retail sector for more than 12 years. Retailers operating at the very bottom of the discount market have thrived in the recession. Shares in Dollar Tree rose 4.5 per cent to $51.33. Dollar General gained 0.4 per cent to $23.50, trading almost 7 per cent above its offer price.DSW, the footwear chain, said it had doubled its profits in the third quarter, sending its shares 10.6 per cent higher to $22.71. The retailer, which sells branded shoes at discount prices, has experienced strong demand in the recession and has also cut costs.Heinz, the consumer group, posted a lower quarterly profit due to falling sales in North America and Europe. The company has faced increasing competition from cheaper brands in the recession. But Heinz still raised its full-year profit forecast, saying it was confident that shoppers would continue to cook at home. The shares were up 0.1 cent at $43.23.American Eagle Outfitters, the clothing chain that caters to teenagers, posted higher-than-expected quarterly sales and said it expected to see conditions continue to improve next year. The shares climbed 3.2 per cent to $15.01.In the technology sector, Brocade Communications Systems denied previous reports that it was putting itself up for sale, sending
its shares down 9 per cent to $7.10. The largest maker of computer networking equipment said it was seeking to expand through partnerships instead.Shares in Iowa Telecommunications Services surged 26.1 per cent to $16 after the telephone and internet services provider said it had accepted Windstream’s offer to buy the company for $1.1bn. Windstream lost 0.5 per cent to $10.08."

77;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-11-20T02:44:16Z;Rising portfolio value bolsters KKR;;Improving value at its portfolio companies helped private equity firm KKR report economic net income of $356m for the third quarter compared with a loss of $479m a year ago.KKR’s performance underscores the extent to which private equity firms have benefited from the rally in the stock and debt markets.The firm merged on October 1 with KKR Private Equity Investors, its Amsterdam-listed unit.Reporting for the last time as a standalone unit, KPE said its net asset value rose almost 16 per cent to $3.5bn. At some point in the first half of next year, the combined firm will leave Amsterdam and relist on the New York Stock Exchange.Mark-ups in the value of portfolio companies partly reflected improved performance and partly reflected the value of comparable companies that are publicly traded.KKR bought aggressively in the boom years, seeking companies such as Dollar General which would hold up in economic downturns. Dollar General recently went public, one of many KKR-owned companies that are in line to take advantage of buoyant share prices.KKR’s results were presented in a way to appeal to shareholders. The earnings release stressed an 8 per cent growth in assets to almost $55bn, producing fee related earnings of $61.5m for the quarter. Shareholders care about fees, while investors in funds dislike fees, which they largely pay for.KKR’s results come as buy-out activity is increasing dramatically.So far this month, private equity firms have spent more than $8bn, the best month since May 2008, according to Standard & Poor’s.That figure includes KKR and General Atlantic’s $1.65bn purchase of Northrop Grumman’s TASC consulting unit.“The mix of KKR’s asset management with KPE created a leading public alternative management firm with significant embedded earnings power which we think is undervalued,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs on Thursday ahead of KKR reported its results.“We believe KKR’s franchise provides significant embedded earnings power at an attractive valuation.”The report noted that KKR is trading at 9.9 times projected 2010 earnings. That compares with Blackstone, KKR’s great rival, which is trading at 13.3 times 2010 earnings.The Goldman report added that relisting in New York “should be a positive catalyst” for KKR shares.
78;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-11-13T23:00:29Z;Dollar General makes strong debut after IPO;;Shares in Dollar General rose 8.2 per cent on Friday in the first day of trading after the discount chain raised $716m in the largest US retail initial public offering in more than 12 years.Shares in the company, which was bought by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007 and sells everything from diapers to chocolate bars at heavily discounted prices, closed at $22.73. The shares were priced at $21, which was at the lower end of estimates.The offering came the same day as an IPO from Rue21, the low-price clothing chain. While Rue21’s debut was worth only $129m, the shares proved to be even more popular, soaring over 30 per cent during trading.Budget retailers operating at the very bottom of the market such as Dollar General, which sells a quarter of its stock for less than $1, have thrived in the recession.Similar chains in the UK, such as Poundland and the 99p Store, have also widened their customer base as more middle-class shoppers cast aside their prejudices and rummage for bargains.However, Scott Krugman of the National Retail Federation said the offerings on Friday also highlighted the sector’s long-term growth prospects.“Right now, discount retailers are strong because people are depending on them for necessity items such as grocery and certain types of apparel,” he said. “But a lot of these discounters are also selling electronics and a variety of other items that would be considered discretionary and those are the items that they’ll start selling more of when the economy improves.”Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz & Associates Inc, a national retail consulting firm, said he viewed the offerings as evidence of a permanent shift away from grocery stores.“Traditional supermarkets have already gone bankrupt this year and the discount sector will continue to grab a bigger share,” he said.For decades since its conception in 1939, Dollar General focused on private label brands but the lure of the low-cost market has persuaded leading names such as Procter & Gamble to produce customised versions of their brands for the chain.Last year, Dollar General brought in $10.5bn in sales, dwarfing the 2008 revenues of Family Dollar Stores, its publicly listed US rival, by more than $3bn.Dollar General, which has 8,700 stores across 35 states, went private in 2007, when KKR bought the Tennessee-based chain for $7.3bn.According to Thomson Reuters, the offering by Dollar General was the sector’s third-largest after the IPO in 1995 by Intimate Brands, the lingerie group, and by American Stores, the food and drug retailer, in 1997..
79;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-11-13T21:34:37Z;Disney helps Wall St shrug off confidence blow;;Encouraging results from Walt Disney and Abercrombie & Fitch helped Wall Street edge higher on Friday, offsetting data showing a surprise drop in US consumer confidence. .Sentiment among American shoppers fell in early November to the weakest in three months, according to the index compiled by the University of Michigan.But the S&P 500 turned negative for less than a few minutes after the report, and closed 0.6 per cent higher at 1,093.48. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent to 10,270.47 and the Nasdaq was up 0.9 per cent to 2,167.88.“Overall trading suggests that sentiment appears indecisive heading into the weekend and that investors may look to Monday’s US retail sales report to set direction for next week,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.US stocks hit fresh highs for the year this week after assurances from the Federal Reserve over low interest rates lured in more investors.A rush of deal activity also raised hopes that corporate America was returning to health.Kraft launched a hostile bid for Cadbury on Monday, which the British chocolate-maker promptly rejected.After the closing bell on Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard announced that it had struck a deal to buy 3Com, sending shockwaves through the rest of the networking gear industry.Over the week, the S&P gained 2.3 per cent, the Dow was up 2.5 per cent and the Nasdaq 2.6 per cent.“It’s been a slow news-week and volumes have been light but we expect economic data to continue to drive this market higher,” said Ryan Detrick, senior strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research.Positive surprises from the consumer discretionary sector helped to lift the market further on Friday.Shares in Walt Disney rose 4.8 per cent to $30.44 after the world’s largest media and entertainment group reported an 18 per cent jump in fourth-quarter profit.The company also lifted the mood across the industry after optimistic comments about the prospects for television advertising over the next six months.Abercrombie & Fitch, the fashion retailer, also surprised analysts by reporting a smaller decline in profit than had been expected, mainly due to aggressive cost cutting. Its shares rose 10.7 per cent to $40.68.Elsewhere in the retail sector, Goldman Sachs upgraded PetSmart to “buy” from “neutral”, citing the prospect of improved margins. Its shares gained 3.9 per cent to $25.67.Nordstrom, the department store chain, warned that its gross margin would not increase in 2009 as much as analysts had hoped. Its shares slid 1.5 per cent to $33.99.Shares in JC Penney, the third-largest department store in the US, gained 6.2 per cent to $31.21 after the retailer raised its annual profit forecast.In its market debut, Dollar General, the discount retailer that is almost entirely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, rose 8.2 per cent to $22.73 after pricing shares at the lower end of estimates.Goodyear Tire & Rubber also added to the market’s optimism after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”.Earlier in the week, the group said it would raise prices on consumer replacement tyres in North America by up to 6 per cent to help offset higher raw materials costs. Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $14.34.Blockbuster, the largest movie rental chain in the US, posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss after the closing bell on Thursday. Its shares fell 6 per cent to 78 cents.Lime Energy was one of the day’s biggest fallers after the engineering company reduced its sales forecast.Shares in the group, which specialises in energy-efficient products, plunged 23 per cent to $4.88.
80;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-10-26T09:19:54Z;Private equity exits;;Investors may think that private equity bosses have been sunning themselves on the beach during the credit crunch. In fact, many have been busy primping their portfolio companies for sale. Some of the world’s largest funds, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone and Permira, are all looking to exit investments. KKR has already filed for the listing of Avago, a Singapore-based semiconductor business, and Dollar General discount stores.The motive for many, though, is not just a desire to return value to their shell-shocked investors. About 20 per cent of private equity funds have only one year until expiry and one-third will expire within two years. To raise a new fund, a proven track record of successful exits is mandatory. Europe-based BC Group’s most recent fund expires in November 2010 and new fundraising will be heavily influenced by planned public offerings worth perhaps more than €10bn. But for many mature funds the waters ahead may be choppier still.For the average five-year-old to seven-year-old fund, the majority of its investments were made during the private equity boom and their returns may suffer as a result. Looking back at the dotcom boom, investments made in 2001, after the bust, reported an average return of 13 per cent by 2007 compared to 6 per cent for investments made at the top of the market in 1999, according to Thomson Reuters’ investment benchmark report.Those who fail to produce winning results will end up in the private equity graveyard, but the fittest will survive, leaving future investors with a better quality choice of managers to choose from. Indeed, the Boston Consulting Group estimates that 20-40 per cent of the largest 100 private equity houses will disappear. This grim forecast is why investment realisations are on their way. The public market should buckle its seatbelt for a raft of private equity-backed offerings in the year to come.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
81;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-10-01T22:00:53Z;KKR listing;;A public private equity company may be an oxymoron, but the Dutch listing of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts marks the start of its European reconnaissance mission. Desperate for a New York listing in 2007, plans were shelved as the credit crisis erupted. Sneaking through the back door, via a merger with Amsterdam listed co-investors KKR Private Equity Investors, is an interim step.The 30 per cent slice of the overall group that KPE investors now own provides a lower profile testing ground for the inevitable New York listing. Since the announcement in July, KPE shares have charged ahead 75 per cent to $9.43. Over the same period, listed rival Blackstone’s stock has increased by half that amount. If KKR achieves some good exits, as it expects to with its Dollar General discount stores, investors will feel more confident come the full listing of the firm itself.Like Blackstone, KKR is no longer just a private equity firm. For investors in a public listing the diversification into debt investing and backwards integration into investment banking offers alternative revenue sources while private equity remains in the doldrums.KKR’s bread and butter though remains private equity, and global markets continue to offer no favours. Faltering investor demand pushed third-quarter fundraising to $38bn, the lowest level since 2003 and about a fifth of 2007’s high, according to Preqin. And it now takes about 18 months to raise a fund, half as much time again as in 2007. KKR’s biggest deal this year was the $1.8bn acquisition of Oriental Brewery which pales compared with the 2007 purchases of Alliance Boots for £11.1bn and Texas utility TXU for $44bn. Mr Kravis and Mr Roberts have much to prove to investors expectant of a return to the swashbuckling deal closing days.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter

83;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-09-28T17:51:03Z;Buy-out groups face fight over fees;;Private equity groups and their investors are squaring up for a battle over fees as the world’s largest buy-out groups face pressure to lower the cost of their next fundraising.Investors, such as California’s public employees retirement scheme, the biggest US pension fund, are pushing private equity funds to improve transparency and cut the fees that eat large chunks out of investors’ returns.In the wake of the financial crisis and losses suffered on their private equity investments, 220 investors with up to $1,000bn invested in private equity have grouped together to demand funds apply a framework of best practice and align their interests more clearly with investors.Several private equity groups said some of their biggest investors had contacted them about new guidelines they have adopted as members of the Institutional Limited Partners Association.While most private equity groups already comply with many of the ILPA guidelines, buy-out houses are already bristling at some of the demands being made by their investors, especially on the fees they charge. The biggest area of debate is expected to be the ILPA’s demand that buy-out groups should return all extra fees beyond the basic management charge – including transaction, monitoring, advisory and exit fees – to investors.Another sticking point may be its call for buy-out bosses to earn carried interest – a 20 per cent share of profits – only after investors have been paid back all their money, rather than on a deal-by-deal basis.It comes at a pivotal moment. Scores of private equity groups are gearing up in the hope that the fundraising market will re-open next year, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Carlyle, Blackstone, BC Partners, Cinven and Permira. With fees taken out by private equity groups running into many hundreds of millions, fund managers want to establish the ILPA principles as best practice before private equity groups begin their next round of fundraising.One private equity executive said: “I hope they aren’t expecting us to sign up to all of this.”One example of fees is the $75m in transaction fees that Dollar General paid to KKR and Goldman Sachs when the retailer’s $7.3bn buy-out was completed in 2007. Dollar General has also paid its private equity owners $13m in monitoring fees and will pay a further $64m if its planned listing goes ahead.
84;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-08-14T17:36:42Z;Private equity IPOs;;Scramble, scramble! The rally in equity markets has caused a frenzy inside private equity firms, with plans aplenty for initial public offerings. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts wants to offload six portfolio companies, perhaps including its Dollar General retail chain, to the public. The discount store is an obvious first choice, having performed well during the credit crunch. However, with top-end IPO markets hibernating for the past two years, questions remain about just how welcoming investors will be to new equity offers.In June, CVC and TPG tested the waters with a £323m share issue in UK retailer Debenhams. Although the owners offered a 13 per cent discount to market, shareholders only took 30 per cent of the issue, which the sponsors themselves did not participate in. When the IPO gates do open, private equity exits are likely to be among the first issues. Their performance will set a precedent for the broader market.In the past, private equity groups have priced aggressively when taking their companies public. In the UK, for the 12 years to 2006 private equity listings rose on average 9.4 per cent on the first day of trading. Non-private equity offerings, however, leapt by 19.6 per cent, according to Cass Business School. Admittedly, private equity listings outperformed the broader market 12 months later, but today’s nervy investors won’t necessarily care. And they have the pricing power. In return for reopening the market, investors will demand discounted offerings, meaning smaller returns for private equity companies.Buy-out funds drew down $100bn more than they distributed during 2007 and 2008, estimates Preqin, a research firm, but soon cash will need to move the other way to appease limited partners hungry for returns. Generous IPO pricing may prove critical. The worst thing that could happen to an infant exit market is for an over-aggressive listing to dent its fragile confidence.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
85;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-08-10T19:42:50Z;Alarms on Wall St as KKR edges in;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts’ capital market unit, launched at the height of the buy-out boom two years ago, is raising its profile on Wall Street, and creating friction with investment banks in the process.When KKR, the private equity group, founded its capital market unit, it insisted it would complement the Wall Street banks that had served as the group’s advisers and financiers. But as banks become more familiar with KKR Capital Markets, they are increasingly seeing it as a competitor, executives say.A case in point came last week when KKR Capital Markets worked as part of the underwriting syndicate for an initial public offering of Avago Technologies, a semiconductor company.Underwriter fees are allocated by the company, which in this case was owned by KKR and Silver Lake Partners, another private equity firm. In the Avago deal, the fees earned by KKR Capital Markets increased as the size of the deal grew.Originally, the underwriters sought to sell $400m of shares, with KKR Capital Markets due to receive 3 per cent of the money raised. The fee grew to 6 per cent, and then 9 per cent as the deal was increased to $500m and then $648m.The higher fees for KKR Capital Markets, while not outsized by Wall Street standards, had the effect of reducing returns for the other underwriters, creating inevitable tensions with those Wall Street banks.The KKR Capital Markets group was created during a period of frenzied dealmaking in private equity that saw KKR buying ever-larger companies. At the time, KKR hired Craig Farr, then a senior executive at Citigroup’s equity capital markets division.Because KKR did not want to team up with other private equity buyers on the expensive acquisitions it made in 2006 and 2007, Mr Farr was responsible for approaching KKR’s investors, who then co-invested alongside the firm. He thus helped raise $8bn from investors for KKR’s big deals such as Dollar General, First Data and TXU.In addition, the capital markets arm helped KKR identify target companies for deals. In the past, the ability of investment banks to source deals for private equity firms had been their main leverage over the latter. Alarms are therefore sounding inside firms such as Goldman Sachs, according to executives there.Mr Farr is working to further reduce KKR’s dependence on Wall Street as regards financing new deals. Banks are becoming more careful with their capital and are less willing to commit their own money to help finance deals.So, Mr Farr and his team are working with investors to provide the debt financing that the banks have traditionally provided to private equity buyers. This is especially the case with bridge financing – which the banks provide from their own balance sheets while they arrange bond offers. Pension funds such as the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board are also now beginning to hire teams to do similar private debt deals.By lining up sources of finance before KKR even bids for a company, the firm can fine-tune purchase prices, knowing in advance the cost of its capital.
86;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-08-02T22:04:28Z;Buy-outs act early on debt mountain;;Most people assume private equity bosses are taking long summer holidays and waiting for credit markets to recover so they can embark on another debt-fuelled acquisition spree.But much of the energy they spent on buying some of the world’s biggest companies during the credit bubble is now being devoted to finding ways of refinancing the mountain of debt that falls due in the next few years.The size of the challenge is daunting: almost $400bn of debt must be repaid by private equity companies in the US and Europe over the next five years while demand for leveraged loans from banks and investors has dried up.A shrinking global economy and weak corporate earnings make the task even tougher.Yet there have been some encouraging signs for buy-out bosses. The high-yield bond market is recovering and stock markets are re­opening for initial public offerings.While most of the debt raised for big private equity deals does not mature until 2013 or 2014, buy-out bosses say they are determined to act early. “The sooner you start work on it and the more you discuss it internally before you start, the better off you are,” says Tom Lister, co-managing partner of Permira.“Time is a very important criteria in all this,” adds Mr Lister, who worked on a debt exchange – swapping unsecured loans for a smaller amount of more senior, secured paper to reduce leverage – at Free-scale, the US chipmaker.This cut Freescale’s debt from about $8bn to $6bn and its interest bill by $150m.Already, private equity groups are drawing on a growing menu of options for refinancing their portfolio companies.Stephen Grabiner, head of Apax Partners’s media team, says: “We have to be slightly more creative about finding new money to refinance these companies, which will come from us in private equity, from public markets and from strategic groups.”The latest buzz among private equity bosses is about harnessing a recent rally in the high-yield bond market as investors regain their appetite for more risky borrowers.HCA, the US hospitals group bought for $33bn by a private equity consortium of Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Merrill Lynch, last week issued $1.25bn of bonds to replace bank debt due in 2013 with notes maturing in 2020.There are fewer examples of this in Europe’s less mature high-yield bond market. But EMI, the music group owned by Terra Firma, is working on a £200m-£280m ($334m-$468m) high-yield bond issue to repay debt.Wind Telecomunicazioni, the Italian mobile phone operator, which is backed by several private equity groups, sold €2.7bn ($3.8bn) of notes last month in Europe’s biggest junk bond sale for many years.Another option is debt exchange. NXP, the private equity-owned Dutch chipmaker, recently cut its debt by $1bn with such a move.But this approach does not always work. Some lenders have baulked at a recent proposal from BC Partners to use the cash of Regency Entertainment, the Greek casino group, to buy back debt while asking to reset covenants.Some private equity groups are counting on a stock market rally to sell new shares in over-indebted portfolio companies.IPO candidates include Birds Eye, the UK frozen food group, Dollar General, the US retailer, and TDC, the Danish telecoms group.Other private equity-owned companies may raise funds by selling stakes or non-core assets to strategic groups.Last month, UK buy-out house Duke Street sold a 43 per cent stake in Groupe Proclif, its French hospitals company, to a Crédit Agricole unit.Sceptics, however, remain unconvinced that private equity can solve all its debt problems, especially as many recession-hit portfolio companies are struggling to keep pace with ambitious growth targets set during the boom time.“These [business plans] now need to be redesigned – you need revenue growth in order to deleverage,” says Ed Eyerman, managing director of European leveraged finance at Fitch Ratings.Others argue that banks are becoming more aggressive in taking control of over-indebted companies rather than leaving the upside for their private equity owners.Paul Hemming, partner at restructuring specialist Zolfo Cooper, said: “The kings are no longer the private equity groups, the kings are now the banks – they are in control.”
87;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-07-31T22:31:28Z;KKR eyes market blitz of up to six IPOs;;"Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the world’s biggest buy-out group, is preparing up to six companies for initial public offerings worth billions of dollars, including Toys R Us, as it sells some of its most valuable groups back to the stock market.There have been virtually no IPOs in the past two years, but as the worst of the financial crisis recedes and stock markets start to rebound, investors are eagerly waiting to see if private equity firms such as KKR will start listing companies bought in the boom years.A person familiar with KKR said the companies it was preparing to float included US toy retailer Toys R Us; HCA, one of America’s biggest hospital groups; First Data, the credit card processor; TDC, the Danish telecoms group; and Dollar General, the discount retailer.“We think there are five to six companies in the [KKR] portfolio that can be taken public in the next 12 months,” said a person familiar with KKR’s plans.The New York-based group has already filed for an IPO of Avago Technologies, the Singapore-based semiconductor company formerly known as Agilent, which it bought with Silver Lake for $2.66bn in 2005.The new IPOs would be a boost for KKR, which was founded by cousins Henry Kravis and George Roberts in 1976 and shot to fame 20 years ago with the $30bn takeover of RJR Nabisco, immortalised in the book Barbarians at the Gate.HCA was one of the biggest ever buy-outs when KKR, Bain Capital and Merrill Lynch paid $33bn for it in 2007. It runs 163 hospitals and 112 outpatient centres, generating $28.4bn of revenues last year. KKR in March valued its stake at $1.1bn.As HCA still has $26bn of debt, KKR is considering selling new shares to repay loans, rather than cashing out itself.It may do something similar with First Data, which it bought for $26bn in 2007 and has held up well in the recession, increasing adjusted earnings by 5 per cent last year.The listings will be welcome news in an industry that has suffered two poor years because of falling stock markets and the crisis-hit banking sector.KKR underlined the woes of the buy-out sector by reporting a $1.2bn loss last year."
88;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-07-08T17:52:40Z;Customers flock to US discounter;;The strong performance of low-cost discount chains – or so-called “dollar stores” – during the US recession was underlined on Wednesday by third-quarter results from Family Dollar.Shares in the discount retailer rose more than a tenth after it said the number of customers had increased, as had spending per visit.The retailer, which operates more than 6,000 small stores mostly in neighbourhood plazas, reported a 35 per cent year-on-year increase in net earnings to $87.7m, or 62 cents per diluted share.Comparable sales of consumable items, including food and household goods such as soap and paper towels, increased by about 11 per cent during the quarter.It had previously reported an 8.3 per cent increase in overall sales in the quarter ending May 30 to $1.84bn, and a 6.2 per cent increase in overall comparable store sales. The increases contrast with the low single-digit or negative sales growth experienced by leading US supermarkets, but are in line with the robust growth reported by Wal-Mart and by its rivals Dollar General and Dollar Tree.Family Dollar’s core customers are poorer households with an income of about $40,000 a year. But Howard Levine, chief executive, said there had been particular growth in sales to customers with incomes of up to $70,000.The retailer has invested substantially in improving the layout and look of its stores, while also increasing the amount of food it sells, including installing equipment to process electronic food stamp benefits.Mr Levine said in a call with Wall Street analysts that “we believe we have a unique opportunity to increase our market share as value becomes a strong driver of shopping trips among customers of all incomes”.The retailer also reported a 2 per cent increase in comparable sales in June, better than analysts expected, given that sales last year were boosted by customers’ spending federal tax rebate cheques.In contrast, comparable June sales at leading chain stores and department stores are expected to be down sharply when an­nounced on Thursday.Bad wea­ther in the north-east and mid-Atlantic states added to economic pressures on retailers during the month, on top of the difficult comparison with last year’s tax rebate spending.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, says the consensus of analyst estimates points to a 6.6 per cent decline in its monthly index, excluding data from drug store chains and from Wal-Mart, which no longer reports monthly sales numbers.
89;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-06-08T03:08:42Z;Fidelity teams up with KKR in listings deal;;Mutual fund group Fidelity is teaming up with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm, in an unusual deal that will give Fidelity’s huge retail client base access to future public listings of KKR-owned and underwritten companies.The exclusive arrangement will give KKR guaranteed retail distribution for its initial public offerings, and will allow Fidelity to offer its brokerage customers an equity investment they might not find elsewhere.It is the first such deal between a fund group and a buy-out firm, although Fidelity has had similar arrangements in the past with investment banks, most recently with JPMorgan.KKR owns almost 50 companies, including Hospital Corp of America, Dollar General, First Data, SunGard, the former TXU, a Texas utility, and Alliance Boots.There have been virtually no IPOs in the past two years, but as conditions and sentiment improve in the stock market, KKR and its peers are expected to list many of the companies they bought in the boom years.Mark Haggerty, the head of Fidelity’s capital markets group, told the Financial Times: “The KKR guys initiated it and we thought it was a great idea . . . we have massive distributive powers.”Under the deal, when KKR underwrites an IPO, it will give Fidelity’s 12m brokerage customers exclusive access to buy the retail shares KKR is allocated from the IPO. Broker/dealer customers of Fidelity, which collectively employ 85,000 brokers, will be able to receive the shares for their customers alongside Fidelity’s 3,500 investment advisers. Fidelity would receive a fee as part of the selling group for the IPO.The deal with Fidelity represents a step forward in KKR’s plan to build a capital markets business that will partly free it from dependence on Wall Street.KKR has gone a long way to sourcing its own deals rather than relying on ideas from investment banks and buying through auction processes, when prices tend to be steep.
90;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Shoppers lift sales 13% at Dollar General;;Dollar General, the ultra low-cost US store chain owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, reported a 13.3 per cent increase in its comparable sales during its first quarter, underscoring its position as one of the success stories of the US recession.The retailer operates 8,460 small neighbourhood stores that sell an assortment of foodstuffs, household goods, clothes, toys and other items.A quarter of its stock sells for $1 or less, and most of the rest of it is priced below $10.In a regulatory filing the company said that “during this challenging economic period, value-conscious customers are relying on our stores for value and convenience more than ever”.The strong performance compares with the negative sales numbers being reported by most US retailers and to the flat to low growth seen by leading supermarkets. Wal-Mart, the largest US mass discount retailer, reported a 3.3 per cent increase in comparable store sales in its first quarter.Dollar General’s overall sales for the three months ending May 1 rose 15.7 per cent to $2.78bn.Sales of “highly consumable” items such as food and household goods were up by more than 18 per cent, as it increased its offerings of convenience foods, drinks and expanded its low-cost private-label brands.The recession has encouraged leading consumer goods companies to seek an ever-closer embrace with Dollar General and other low-cost dollar stores, which they once largely shunned.The retailer’s current weekly newspaper advertising insert, for instance, is dominated by special sale offers on food brands from companies such as Kraft, and on brands from Procter & Gamble, including Tide detergent, Olay hand-wash and Gillette razors.While other retailers have been cutting back on capital investment, Dollar General opened 104 new stores during its first quarter, and expects to open more than 400 by the end of the year, while also remodelling 400 others.Rival dollar store Family Dollar, which has been investing in remodelling its 6,600 stores and expanding its grocery offering, reported a 6.4 per cent increase in comparable sales in its most recent quarter.The retailer, which describes its core customer as “poor to just getting by” and earning less than $40,000 per year, says it has also seen an increase in visits from more middle-income customers.Dollar Tree, which has more than 3,600 stores selling everything for less than $1, last week reported a 9.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its first quarter.
91;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-03-03T19:10:33Z;Target’s mass store opening to create 3,000 jobs;;Target, the US discount chain, on Tuesday said it would open 27 new stores in 15 states on Sunday, in what may be one of the last simultaneous retail launches for several years.The mass openings will add an additional three million square feet, expanding Target’s network to 1,699 stores and creating more than 3,000 jobs.But the rush of new stores will also make up more than a third of the 70-75 stores that Target is planning to open this year, compared with the 114 stores it opened in 2008, which included launching 43 in a single day.Doug Scovanner, chief financial officer, warned last week that in 2010 the number was expected to drop to as low as five new stores, and no more than 30.Looking ahead, he said future growth “all depends on how soon and to what extent we are able to return to a profit formula that makes it a very interesting proposition to invest more aggressively in new store openings.”Wal-Mart, Target’s larger rival, is also paring back store-openings this year, while continuing to expand. It has said it plans to open 125-140 Supercenters and 17 of its smaller Neighborhood Markets, down from 191 new stores last year and 218 in 2007, when it announced it was slowing its US growth rate.Wal-Mart, with more than 3,500 stores, is one of the few US retailers to continue to deliver sales growth during the downturn.There are signs that the retailer is also hoping that the prospect of new stores and jobs may ease some of the political opposition that has previously blocked its attempts to expand into Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.The retailer is reported to have stepped up lobbying directed at members of Chicago’s city council, which currently has only one Wal-Mart within its city limits. It is also developing smaller versions of its Supercenters – at around 100,000sq ft – that can be more easily located in already developed areas.Other retailers still expanding include Kohl’s, which operates 1,004 low price department stores. The retailer will open 55 new stores this year, including 36 locations acquired in October following the bankruptcy of Mervyn’s, a California-based rival. It opened 75 stores last year – including over 40 on one day – and 112 in 2007.But the most dramatic expansion will come from Dollar General, which operates more than 7,000 small neighbourhood hard discount stores. It is planning to open 450 new stores this year, up from 210 in 2008, as its ultra-low cost foods and household goods pull in cash-strapped customers.Dollar General’s fourth quarter sales increased 11.2 per cent ito $2.85bn, while its comparable-store sales improved by 9.4 per cent.
92;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-03-03T01:10:30Z;KPE reveals crisis scars with $2.2bn writedown;;KKR Private Equity Investors, the Amsterdam-listed vehicle of buy-out firm KKR, reported a 47.5 per cent writedown in the value of its investments for 2008, offering further evidence of how private equity-owned companies have been scarred by the market meltdown.KPE’s total writedown for the year totalled $2.2bn.KPE wrote down the value of its investment in some of the biggest companies KKR bought at the top of the market in 2006 and 2007, including First Data and Alliance Boots, by 40 per cent in dollar terms. Other companies such as NXP, a semiconductor group, and Capmark Financial were worth only ten cents on the dollar at the end of 2008. ProSiebenSat would have been worth zero if KPE had not invested more money in the German broadcasting group during the fourth quarter.A rare bright spot was discount retailer Dollar General, which was valued at a higher level at the end of 2008 than when KKR bought it.When KKR listed KPE in 2006, it raised $5bn and set off a financial arms race with competitors. What KKR will do with KPE is not clear. A plan for KKR to merge with KPE and list on the New York Stock Exchange looks unlikely. “KKR and the independent directors of KPE are evaluating the impact of changes in the financial world and markets on the continued advisability of the transaction,” the company said, adding that a decision would be made in coming weeks.Some of KKR’s competitors suggest that principals of KKR may ultimately buy in shares personally, given just how cheap those shares have become. KPE closed on Friday at $2.25. “If they really have confidence that most of the investments really will recover, they could drive it down and buy it cheap,” said a senior executive at a rival buy-out firm.“Given that we have control over when we exit these companies, these values represent only a snapshot in time,” Henry Kravis, KKR co-founder, told investors.Mr Kravis also noted that new regulation “could materially impact our portfolio”.Separately, KKR-owned Masonite International is expected to file soon for a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after reaching an agreement with its senior bank lenders, led by Centerbridge Partners and Oaktree Capital.The bank group will receive 97.5 per cent of the common equity and $300m in new debt while bondholders will receive the remaining 2.5 per cent of the equity and some warrants. KKR’s equity now goes to zero.
93;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-01-01T17:00:52Z;Cost-cutters move into mainstream;;"No sooner had the champagne corks popped to welcome in the new year, some of Britain’s leading consumer businesses – from retailer Asda to pub chain JD Wetherspoon – announced that they were marking the beginning of 2009 with more price cuts.It has become a familiar story. After a torrid year in developed economies around the world, consumers are being far more considered about how they spend their cash.This nervousness is hurting scores of retail companies, who are seeing their margins suffer as customer numbers fall away.But the flight to frugality has left the discounters well and truly in vogue, as their cut-price turkeys and cheap cashmere have been snapped up by cost-conscious shoppers. The march of the grocery discounters in Europe is not a new phenomenon. They have been steadily increasing market share since the early 1960s when the Albrechts, Germany’s richest men, founded Aldi. Now chains such as Aldi, Lidl and Netto operate throughout Europe, with discounters accounting for 17.6 per cent of grocery spending across the continent according to the IGD, the industry research body.In Germany, where the population’s penchant for parsimony is well documented, discounter chains account for 43.2 per cent of the €142.7bn ($199bn) Germans spent on food in 2007.But their appeal is growing in tandem with the economic downturn. From the US’s Dollar General, a discount variety store, to Uniqlo, Japan’s cheap and chic clothing chain, the conditions are perfect for those promoting thrift.In the UK, discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, which have been kept at bay by rivals such as supermarket chains Tesco and Asda, are now in the throes of a growth spurt, with Aldi growing its market share from 2.6 per cent to 3.1 per cent in the three months to December 2, according to TNS, the market research company.The rest are taking note. Tesco, the UK’s biggest retail chain, this autumn launched an aggressive price-cutting strategy – marketing itself as “Britain’s biggest discounter” – in an effort to stem a flow of shoppers out of its doors into those of cheaper rivals.The IGD says in a report that this growth spurt is likely to be sustained not only in the UK but the continent. “The historic perspective provides insight into key growth periods for discounters; namely times of economic uncertainty.”The discounters had a strong year in 2002 when the introduction of the euro prompted consumers, in search of greater reassurance over prices, to turn to the discount stores.The IGD believes that the coming three years will offer another growth spurt for the sector.The discounters are expected to grow their market share from 18 per cent in 2008 to 19.5 per cent by 2012 as they move more firmly into the mainstream of people’s lives."
94;DG;Dollar General Corp;2009-01-01T16:55:04Z;Dollar shops are at heart of consumer sentiment;;Rick Dreiling has had a good year since taking over in January as chief executive officer of Dollar General, the 8,000 store, hard-discount variety chain.Amid the pervasive gloom, Dollar General reported a comparable sales increase of 10.2 per cent in its third quarter – more than three times the 3 per cent growth reported by Wal-Mart, the largest US discounter.“We’re seeing pretty consistent growth in every region we are in …we are seeing really, really solid performance everywhere”, Mr Dreiling told investors last month. “We are seeing new customers and old customers coming in more often.”Dollar General, taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2007 in a $7.3bn deal traces its roots back to 1939. Its stores stock packaged foods, health and beauty items, toys and household items with an average price of about $10. The product mix, 25 per cent of which sells for less than a dollar, includes its own private-label brands and leading national names such as Tide, Pepsi and Crest.With sales of more than $9bn annually, it leads the rapidly transforming US extreme discount sector.Family Dollar, Dollar General’s closest rival, has annual sales of about $7bn from more than 6,600 similarly sized and similarly focused local stores and reported a 2.1 per cent increase in comparable sales for its third quarter.Dollar Tree, the smallest member of the national dollar store trinity, takes an even more extreme approach to pricing, selling everything at its stores for less than a dollar. It delivered a 6.2 per cent increase in comparable sales in its last quarter.All three retailers were already expanding their food selection before the economy worsened over the summer, introducing freezers into their stores to sell milk and eggs, products that drive customer traffic. Dollar Tree has also moved into frozen food, selling products such as Hormel sausages and Green Giant frozen vegetables for a dollar a packet.Bob Sasser, chief executive, told investors this month that Dollar Tree had found itself “squarely in the bull’s eye of consumer sentiment”.Dollar General and Family Dollar reported strong increases in sales of consumables such as packaged foods and toothpaste, which were up 13 per cent at Family Dollar, and 16.6 per cent at Dollar General.Mr Dreiling at Dollar General argues that its strong performance in the downturn is also strengthening its ability to negotiate promotional deals with the leading consumer packaged good companies.
95;DG;Dollar General Corp;2008-10-09T19:56:09Z;Consumers forced to rethink buying patterns;;"For much of the past century, there has been no better place to live comfortably than the US. In the world’s richest economy, air conditioners, microwaves and refrigerators that spit out ice cubes are common household goods, seen more as necessities than a luxuries.But as the country teeters on the edge of recession, life is becoming harder for the average American. With the purchasing power of the US dollar in sharp decline – it takes $2.66 to buy the same amount of goods that $1 would have bought in 1980 – and household incomes dropping, Americans are being forced to cut back on some of the products that have made life good. In western Europe, consumers are in a similar quandary, with France last week becoming the first large economy to acknowledge it had fallen into a recession.But in Asia, eastern Europe and South America, where many economies are still growing, life has been getting better for emerging middle class consumers, as more people than ever can afford to buy basic consumer products such as toothpaste, televisions and shampoo.“In developed markets [such as the US] consumers are still trying to preserve their buying power, which is all about trading down,” says Jeffrey Palma, an equity strategist at investment bank UBS. But in emerging markets the story is different,” he adds. “Incomes are rising…the phenomenon of trading up is still very much in place.”In the US, people are changing the way they shop as makers of branded household products and packaged foods put their prices up to recoup higher transportation and raw material costs. Last month, Jeff Rein, the chief executive of Walgreens, one of the largest US drug stores, noted that there had been a slowdown in the growth of the number of prescriptions being issued in the US.“We believe the biggest impact has been the very tough economy,” said Mr Rein, noting that a July survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners found that 22 per cent of Americans are reducing visits to the doctor to save money. Eleven per cent were found to be scaling back on medication.Sales of discretionary food and drink items, including bottled water and non-carbonated juices, and other drinks, are also dropping. Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said recently that consumers who might have previously left a screw top bottled drink unfinished, now finish it off. Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola’s largest bottler, has reported falling sales of larger, more expensive 20oz bottles of Coke that are a staple at petrol stations.But sales of cheap foods, such as cold, sliced meats as well as soups and frozen vegetables, are rising as people take thier lunches to work and look for cheap alternatives to fresh fruit and vegetables.US consumers are consolidating shopping trips to save money and spending more time at big stores that sell lots of different products at relatively cheap prices. These include: Wal-Mart, the low-cost chain; Costco and BJs, so-called “club” stores that charge membership fees; and discount chains, such as Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Consumers are also buying more so-called “own brand” goods.In Europe, consumers are cutting back on grocery purchases in all countries except Denmark and Norway, according to research group Nielsen, which tracks supermarket sales. “The second quarter revealed a clear and present pullback in consumer consumption,” the group says.To stop consumers “trading down” to cheaper own-label products, companies have begun making cheaper versions of their core products. In France, dairy group Danone has recently put a new kind of yoghurt into supermarkets. Labelled the “Eco Pack”, shoppers get six yoghurts for one euro. The yoghurt tubs weigh 115g each, compared with the 125g tubs the company usually makes, and Danone has also used less packaging, launched fewer flavours and spent less on marketing to keep the price down.But while companies are having a tough time making money in the US and western Europe, doing business in emerging markets has been getting easier. Whereas inflation is rising faster than wages in western markets, in emerging markets it’s the other way around. “In most emerging markets consumers are seeing increases in their real purchasing power, despite higher rates of inflation,” Clayton Daley, Procter & Gamble’s chief financial officer, told an investment conference last month .P&G, like other multinational western consumer goods companies, has been able over the past year to use strong demand in emerging markets to offset slowing sales in the US and Europe. In 2001, P&G’s emerging market sales were some $8bn annually. Today, they are $25bn, and the fastest-growing part of the company’s business.However, there are some initial signs that consumers in India, China, Russia and Brazil will not be immune to events unfolding in the US and Europe.At the end of September, Pepsi Bottling Group, which bottles and distributes PepsiCo products, was one of the first US companies to point to signs of the slowdown in the developing world spreading – as it blamed macroeconomic issues for a slump in sales over the summer in both Russia and Mexico.In Russia, Eric Foss, Pepsi Bottling Group CEO, cited “some near-term uncertainty and financial market volatility” that had led to the soft drinks market’s annual growth slowing to the range of 3 to 4 per cent, down from the low double digit growth rates seen previously. But he stressed the company’s belief that Russia “remains an attractive place for PBG to play over time”.In China and India, which have lower levels of income per head than Brazil and Russia, a big swing to upmarket brands has yet to happen outside of the countries’ biggest cities. But economists are confident it will.India has a lower gross domestic product per capita than Russia, Brazil or China, with less than 20 per cent of homes owning a microwave, refrigerator or washing machine compared with more than 50 per cent in China and nearly 100 per cent in Russia.But with India on track to have more people than any other country in the world by 2030, and incomes rising, consumption is expected to rise at faster rates than other countries.Meanwhile in China, companies say there is plenty of room for growth. Although people still spend just one-thirtieth the amount of money per head on P&G’s products than they do in the US, the time will come when the amount of money they spend will be the same, according to Bob McDonald, P&G’s chief operating officer. “It’s irrefutable.”"
96;DG;Dollar General Corp;2007-07-05T18:49:38Z;Uncertainty over investor demand for loans;;Debt investors are facing the second half of the year “dazed and confused”, according to a new report from Standard & Poor’s LCD, the loan market research group.The uncertain tone follows a turn in credit conditions that has seen a string of relatively aggressive financing deals, mostly for leveraged buy-outs, postponed or sweetened in recent weeks.The shift raises questions over the outlook for the second half, with the most highly leveraged and aggressively structured deals struggling to find buyers.Investors are resisting, in particular, “covenant-lite” loans that allow borrowers more flexibility than traditional loans and “payment-in-kind” or Pik bonds in which borrowers can pay interest in the form of new bonds rather than cash.“Pik debt arguably is the hottest of the hot-money trends,” said S&P LCD in its review of second-quarter leveraged loan market activity. “Thus, it has met the cruelest fate in recent weeks, as the market has cooled.”At least four deals had Pik components reduced or cancelled in recent weeks, namely Thomson Learning, ServiceMaster, Dollar General and US Foodservice.Both Pik bonds and cov-lite loans featured strongly in a record-breaking first half for issuance, however.The global volume of junk-rated loans in the first half of the year was $545bn, up 62 per cent compared with the first six months of 2006.Almost 35 per cent, or $104bn, of US loans sold to non-bank investors lacked traditional covenant protections, almost seven times the volume in the same period last year. Meanwhile, Pik features appeared in $12bn of bonds and loans, up from less than $1bn.The fate of cov-lite and Pik structures is unclear, as is investor appetite for the most highly-leveraged deals. One factor allowing buyers to become more discerning is the huge supply of big deals on the way to the market. As of last week, S&P LCD reckons a record $215bn of US non-bank loans were in the pipeline, compared with $120bn-$140bn earlier in the year.Heavy supply has been accompanied by broader credit market volatility, partly inspired by losses at hedge funds that invested in complex structured instruments that were, in turn, invested in subprime mortgage-related debt.These collateralised debt obligations have structural similarities to the collateralised loan obligations (CLOs), that have been a strong source of demand for new loans.“The CLO window has remained wide open, at least so far,” S&P LCD said. Second-quarter issuance was more than $29bn, up from $25bn in the first quarter. The combined first half total was up 29 per cent on the same period last year.But scrutiny of CLO structures and loan market lending standards had made CLO demand more fragile, the group said.“Many participants expect CLO volume growth to slow in the second half from the sizzling pace of the first.”This combination of factors should give US investors their “day in the sun” after a long period of conditions that favoured borrowers, S&P LCD noted.Weight of supply in Europe could be shifting dynamics in favour of investors there too, with big deals such as Alliance Boots, EMI and Tata Steel in or near the market.“For the first time in many months there has been a question mark regarding European demand,” S&P LCD said.
97;DG;Dollar General Corp;2007-06-29T00:44:31Z;London fund latest subprime victim;;The retreat from risk in global credit markets gathered pace on Thursday as investors demanded stricter terms for high-yield bond issues and a London hedge fund said it would wind down after suffering big losses on US subprime mortgages.Caliber Global Investment, a London-listed fund, said it would sell its assets and return capital to investors after a review found “insufficient demand currently” for exposure to the subprime mortgage market. The review was triggered by an $8.8m (£4.4m) net loss from subprime investments.The $900m fund will wind down over the next 12 months. It is managed by hedge fund Cambridge Place Investment Management, whose founders included Martin Finegold, founder of subprime lender Kensington Group.Carlyle Group, the US private equity company, also delayed– at the last minute – the flotation in Amsterdam of an investment fund dealing in residential mortgage-backed securities in order to cut the offer price because of market volatility.Carlyle said the fund had no exposure to US subprime mortgages. However, people familiar with the plans said the intended flotation had suffered knock-on effects of volatility. The company said it was confident the IPO would go ahead next week.The developments follow the cancellations or postponements of several other debt offerings this week and come amid questions about whether the cheap debt that has fuelled the buy-out boom is still as easily available.Dollar General, a leading US retail chain, was on Thursday forced to shelve its planned offering of $725m in “payment-in-kind toggle” notes – an aggressive financing structure that allows borrowers to choose whether to pay investors back in cash or additional debt. The company also added protective covenants to sell $1.2bn of high-yield debt.Separately, CanWest MediaWorks, a Canadian media company, downsized its own high-yield offering from $650m to $400m.“The balance between sellers of debt and buyers of debt is evening out,” said Eirik Winter, co-head of fixed income capital markets at Citi. “Investors are taking a step back and saying that we have a lot of cash, but we are going to be more cautious and will not buy just anything.”Reporting by Joanna Chung, Peter Thal Larsen, Martin Arnold in London, Ian Bickerton in Amsterdam and Saskia Scholtes and James Mackintosh in New York
98;DG;Dollar General Corp;2007-03-20T22:42:07Z;Claire’s Stores accepts $3.1bn Apollo offer;;Claire’s Stores on Tuesday became the latest US retailer to go private as it accepted a $3.1bn takeover from Apollo Management, the US buy-out group run by Leon Black.The deal caps an auction for the Florida-based jewellery and female accessories store chain that lasted about three months and included Apax Partners, the British private equity group, in the final round.Private equity groups have found fertile ground for investments in all corners US retailing, from luxury department stores to discount chains and specialty stores.This month, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed to buy Dollar General, the Tennessee-based discount retailer, for $7bn. That deal followed in the wake of private equity takeovers of Michaels Stores, the arts-and-crafts chain, Neiman Marcus, the owner of Bergdorf Goodman, and Toys R Us, the toy store group, in the past two years.Apollo, which has participated in the sector’s dealmaking frenzy by acquiring Linens N Things, the bedding store chain, and General Nutrition Centers, the vitamin retailer, is offering to pay $33 per share in cash to buy Claire’s. The price was slightly above expectations, as shares in Claire’s, which has 3,000 stores around the world, rose 3.6 per cent to close at $31.86.Members of the Schaefer family – which founded Claire’s – run it, and still have a stake in the company, are supporting the deal. Bonnie Schaefer and Marla Schaefer, co-chief executives, said the sale was agreed after “an enormous amount of soul searching over time”. They added that Apollo would “create an abundance of opportunities to leverage the strong US brand that we have created over the years.”Goldman Sachs advised Claire’s, with Peter J Solomon providing a fairness opinion. Tri-Artisan Partners advised Apollo. The deal is being financed by Bear Stearns, Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers.
99;DG;Dollar General Corp;2007-03-12T21:48:46Z;US stocks up on M&A activity;;Wall Street rallied on Monday as a burst of merger and acquisition activity offset anxiety about a stronger yen and the suspension of trading in shares of a big subprime mortgage lender.Fears about the implications of New Century Financial’s slide towards bankruptcy dragged down other mortgage lenders and homebuilders.But investment banking and brokerage groups staged a sharp recovery in the afternoon to recoup their early losses and help lift the big market indices into positive territory. Shares in Goldman Sachs, which releases its results on Tuesday, recovered from a low of $198.86 to close 0.5 per cent up at $202.60.Intel helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 0.3 per cent to 12,318.62 by mid-afternoon, and the Nasdaq Composite gain 0.6 per cent to 2,402.72. Intel stock was 2.4 per cent higher at $19.48 on signs of better demand for computer-chips.The S&P 500 was 0.3 per cent higher at 1,406.60.Trading in New Century stock was suspended after the troubled lender said it could not meet its creditors’ demands to repurchase defaulting mortgages. Its shares plunged 48 per cent to $1.66 in electronic trading ahead of Monday’s opening, and were no longer quoted by the time the market opened. New Century stock was trading at more than $30 a month ago. Shares in rival lender NovaStar fell 19 per cent to $4.50.“The subprime sector alone is not the issue,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The concern is that this problem spreads – and that is a big if.”Countrywide admitted on Monday that its earnings may be more volatile this year because of problems in the subprime market. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $35.14.The mortgage worries also hit shares in homebuilders, with DR Horton down 5.1 per cent to $23.17.In deal news, Schering-Plough fell 0.4 per cent to $23.95 after it said it would buy Organon BioSciences, the medicines business of Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, for $14.4bn.Shares in Dollar General jumped 25.6 per cent to $21.07 after the retailer said it had agreed to be bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity group, for about $7.3bn.Meanwhile, Dow Chemical rose 2.1 per cent to $43.89 on persistent rumours that KKR may make the chemical group its next target.United Health, the US health insurance company, said that it was to buy Sierra Health Services for $2.6bn. Shares in Sierra rose 15.8 per cent to $41.57.Express Scripts said it would not raise its offer for Caremark unless the rival US drug benefits manager allowed Express to examine its books. Shareholders vote this week on an alternative bid agreed between Caremark and CVS, the pharmacy group. Shares in Caremark slipped 1.9 per cent to $60.70 while Express rose 4.6 per cent to $80.59.
100;DG;Dollar General Corp;2007-03-12T21:09:55Z;KKR snaps up Dollar General for $7.3bn;;Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US private equity group, on Monday agreed to pay $7.3bn for Dollar General, a Tennessee-based discount retailer whose stores have sold merchandise for $1 or less since the 1950s.The deal extends the reach of private equity in US retailing, where large companies such as Toys ’R’ Us, Neiman Marcus and Michaels Stores have in recent years left the public markets through leveraged buy-outs.It also raised speculation that some of Dollar General’s peers and competitors may also fall to private equity. Shares in North Carolina-based Family Dollar Stores, which has a market capitalisation of $4.8bn, ended 6.1 per cent higher at $30.42 on Monday.Dollar Tree Stores, a Virginia-based company worth $3.8bn, closed up 2.8 per cent at $36.66.Private equity groups often find retailers attractive because their predictable cashflows make it easier to service higher levels of debt, and their real estate portfolios can often be reshaped or broken up for extra profits.KKR is offering to pay $22 per share for Dollar General, or a 31 per cent premium over the company’s market value on Friday. Dollar General shares, which rose nearly 26 per cent to $21.07 on Monday, have not traded above $22 since the middle of 2005.Michael Calbert, a director of KKR, on Monday said Dollar General had a “strong market presence and a rich legacy”.David Perdue, chief executive of Dollar General, said the deal would lead to the “continuity of a solid business plan and new investments in the future of the business”.Dollar General’s minimally staffed small stores are targeted at low-income consumers, and stock a range of packaged goods, including food items, which are sold at a range of fixed prices.Only about 30 per cent of all items are priced below $1 today.While the business was built around private label brands, the growing lure of the low-cost market has persuaded leading brands including Procter & Gamble’s Tide to produce customised versions of their brands for the retailer.The company has also experimented with introducing milk coolers and fresh fruit and vegetables into some of its stores.Mr Perdue has in the past argued that the hard-discount sector in the US has significant room for growth, and is less developed than in Europe where its growth has been driven by Germany’s Aldi and Lidl. He has led a period of rapid expansion of the store network, opening more than 700 outlets in 2005.Lazard and Lehman Brothers advised Dollar General, which received legal advice from Wachtell Lipton. Bankers at Goldman Sachs and lawyers at Simpson Thacher worked for KKR.
101;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
102;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Pressured US shoppers grow more selective;;August sales figures from leading US retailers on Thursday suggested that middle- and lower-income consumers were responding to higher energy prices and interest rates by making selective spending cutbacks.Retail Metrics, which tracks the monthly figures, said its index for the month rose 3.1 per cent, slightly better than forecast. But Ken Perkins, president, noted that the 52 per cent of retailers who exceeded market forecasts represented a fourth consecutive month in which the number had fallen.Mike Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, noted that overall sales growth had slowed over the first six months of the year.“We have seen some moderation: not dramatic and it’s very uneven. But there’s enough to say there’s something going on and that something is likely to continue for the rest of the year.”In possible signs of the stress on middle-income consumers, Target, the second largest US discounter, missed Wall Street’s sales target for the second consecutive month. Target, whose customers have a median family income of $58,000, reported a 2.8 per cent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, against the 3.1 per cent expected by analysts.The company said home decoration items as well as women’s clothing, costume jewellery and accessories were its weakest categories.JC Penney, the mid-range department store with a similar customer demographic to Target, also surprised analysts with a 0.5 per cent fall in August comparable store sales, citing slow sales of big-ticket items, including furniture - echoing comments from Costco, the warehouse shopping club.Dollar General, which operates 8,000 small-format discount stores across the US, gave one of the starkest indications of the state of the battle for the hard-pressed lower income consumer. The retailer said lower sales of home products and clothing had contributed to a 40 per cent fall in its profits during the second quarter.“We also expect consumer discretionary spending to continue to be negatively affected by high fuel prices and by higher interest rates as well,” the retailer said. It added that it expected “aggressive marketing and discounted pricing by competitors” to continue.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said its overall August sales rose 2.5 per cent at its US discount stores and 3.5 per cent at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores.But the continued strength of the higher end of the market was demonstrated by Nordstrom, the fashion department store, which recorded a 7.1 per cent increase in August comparable store sales, against the 3.6 per cent expected by analysts.
103;DG;Dollar General Corp;2006-08-25T20:57:57Z;Wall Street lower on slowdown fears;;Wall Street finished the week lower on Friday as oil prices ticked higher again and sentiment remained depressed by weak economic data.Crude prices continued to climb during the week as diplomatic uncertainty continued surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme.Markets were also put on edge by fears of a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, which might threaten supply from offshore oil rigs. ExxonMobil rose to an all-time high, adding 1.9 per cent to $70.43, and Marathon Oil gained 5.6 per cent to $92.13. Anadarko Petroleum gained 3.5 per cent to $46.91.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent, or 0.97 points, on the day and 0.6 per cent for the week at 1,295.09.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2 per cent, or 3.18 points, higher on the day at 2,140.29, to finish the week down 1.1 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent for the day, down 20.41 points at 11,284.05, a loss of 0.9 per cent for the week.July sales of both new and existing homes fell more than analysts had expected, reinforcing the picture of a slowdown in housing and putting equity markets on edge. Durable goods orders in the month also fell more than forecast, adding to gloom over prospects for economic growth.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the market had made the switch from welcoming poor economic news – because it lessened the chance of rate hikes – to fearing such news because it heralded a slowdown.“We’ve gotten to the inflexion point where bad news is back to being bad news,” he said.The home sales fall was felt acutely by home improvement retailer Lowe’s, which tumbled after it reported second-quarter profits that fell short of expectations, and lowered its full-year sales guidance. Its shares dropped 9.4 per cent to $26.75, its worst week in more than three years.KB Home fell after it said the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal probe into its stock options practices. It closed the week down 7.8 per cent at $40.94.Unsettling news in the housing sector prompted fears of an attendant slowdown in consumer spending. Electronic retailers Circuit City and Best Buy both sank, losing 12.2 per cent to $22.50 and 7 per cent to $45.57 respectively.Online auction site Ebay tumbled 7.2 per cent to $25.30, depressed further by a brokerage downgrade from Piper Jaffray. It is down over 40 per cent this year.Even discount retailer Dollar General suffered, losing 12.8 per cent to $12.28 after it lowered guidance for the coming quarter, blaming slow back-to-school sales.Mr Hogan said oil prices were finally beginning to take their toll on the consumer. “This is the first time we’re seeing a pullback in consumer prices because of higher energy prices.”The slump in durable goods orders depressed heavy industry stocks. Boeing was the heaviest drag on the Dow, slumping 4.8 per cent to $73.93. Caterpillar, maker of earth-moving and construction equipment, dropped 3.4 per cent to $65.99.The prospect of cooling economic growth also made investors nervous about the outlook for recruitment. Monster Worldwide lost 6.8 per cent to $40.07 and Robert Half International shed 7 per cent to $30.49.The S&P Human Resources index dropped 7.2 per cent during the week. It has fallen 32 per cent since May.Sandisk rose 6.3 per cent to a 10-week high of $54.61 after it was upgraded from “above average” to “buy” by Caris & Co. Earlier this week, the maker of flash-memory products introduced a new digital music player to compete with Apple’s iPod Nano.Forestry products group Weyerhaeuser leapt 4.7 per cent to $60.69 on the week after Deutsche Bank said the group was open to potential buyout bids and restructuring pressures. Shares were also boosted by news that the company would merge its fine paper unit with Canadian paper maker Domtar in a deal worth $3.3bn.A report on sales of computer servers showed that Sun Microsystems was the only company to increase share in the worldwide server business during the second quarter. The news pushed Sun up 3.6 per cent to $4.85. It has risen more than 27 per cent in the past month.

The company lowered its full-year sales guidance. Its shares tumbled 4 per cent to $28.35. The stock is down 15 per cent since the beginning of the year. Home Depot followed Lowe’s, shedding 1.4 per cent to $34.30.Ford Motor lost 7.5 per cent to $7.47 – its worst day since April – following Friday’s announcement of production cutbacks, including the mothballing of 10 assembly plants, to reduce inventory and speed up its turnround plan.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent, or 4.78 points, at 1,297.52. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8 per cent, or 16.20 points, at 2,147.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, or 36.42 points, to 11,345.05.Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors, attributed the falls to investors taking money off the table following the strong gains of last week. “It’s a pullback, but its predictable,” he said. “We had a pretty unusual week [last week] and so it’s natural to expect some profit-taking.”Energy stocks bounced back as crude pushed higher on geopolitical concerns. Exxon Mobil added 1.1 per cent to $69.83 and Marathon Oil rose 3.1 per cent to $89.94.Transport stocks were hit by the gains in crude. Burlington Northern Santa Fe fell 3.5 per cent to $66.07 and Norfolk Southern lost 4.1 per cent to $42.46.Gold and related stocks benefited as investors sought a safe haven in the geopolitical unease. Newmont Mining gained 3.6 per cent to $52.55, while Barrick Gold rose 4.2 per cent to $33.00.Fading hopes for an immediate resolution to a strike by Chilean miners at the Escondida copper mine pushed copper stocks higher.

Some investors had forecast a better price for the sale and shares fell 5.7 per cent to $62.55.Discount retailer Dollar General dropped 9.6 per cent to a three-year low of $12.74 after it lowered its earnings guidance for its fiscal second quarter."
105;DG;Dollar General Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Higher fuel prices add to cost of hurricane damage;;US businesses continued efforts to assess the damage to their regional facilities in hurricane-affected states on Thursday and to gauge the likely impact of higher US petrol prices on their national operations.Major retailers, including Wal-Mart, Target and Federated Department Stores, warned that store closures in the region were likely to depress sales this month, while high fuel prices as the result of shortages are likely to increase pressure on low- income consumers in particular.Dollar General, the hard discounter which that operates more than 7,000 stores across the US targeted at low- income consumers, said it believed that some that 200 of its stores in the region were still closed, mostly as the result of power cuts.“Some of these stores may have been permanently destroyed, although the company is not yet in a position to make that determination,” the company said on Thursday.Hotels groups were largely focused on getting in touch with employees and locating guests at properties in the affected areas.But early signs indicated a similar pattern seen in Florida last year when hotel rooms filled with evacuees and emergency workers in the wake of four hurricanes that pounded the state.InterContinental Hotels, the owner of the Holiday Inn brand, said about a dozen hotels in New Orleans were hit by Katrina.However, nearby hotels outside the affected area in cities such as Shreveport, Louisiana, Memphis, Tennessee, Pensacola, Florida and Jackson, Mississippi were fully booked.Cendant, the owner of the Days Inn and Ramada brands, also reported that evacuees were filling hotel rooms in surrounding states. Its reservations centre was working with FEMA to identify vacancies and book rooms for emergency and utility workers travelling to the affected region.Hilton Hotels dispatched 45 buses to evacuate 1,600 employees and guests from downtown New Orleans and to take them to hotels in Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.Marc Falcone, lodging analyst with Deutsche Bank, wrote in a research report: “If these large hotels are able to escape significant damage, we believe it is possible that they could experience a surge in demand for rooms from displaced residents and FEMA emergency officials.”Analysts also warned of the impact on telecommunications companies. Analysts at CIBC estimated that BellSouth, with 1.75m customers without any phone service, will incur expenses of about $300m and forgo revenue of about $150m.However, shares of house builders and other companies seen as likely to benefit from reconstruction efforts climbed on Thursday, including Cemex, LaFarge and Caterpillar.Many big US airlines were on Thursday ferrying extra fuel to likely bottlenecks, including destinations in Florida, which relies on barge traffic from the Gulf Coast for much of its jet fuel supply.The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday said current information indicated that airports and airlines have enough jet fuel to support continued full commercial operations, Reuters reports. Roger King, analyst at CreditSights, said: “It could take a week or two before [extra fuel] supplies can be shipped in from Europe or south-east Asia, but it is a good bet that an armada full of gasoline and jet fuel is heading this way.”Analysts said the financial impact of higher jet fuel prices would be far more damaging for the airlines than regional fuel shortages.Reporting by Kevin Allison, Amy Yee and Jonathan Birchall in New York and Kevin Allison in New York
