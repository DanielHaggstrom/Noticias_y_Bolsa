0;ALL;Allstate Corp;2018-09-10T23:51:18Z;Insurance shares sink as Hurricane Florence looms;Category 4 storm menaces US east coast;Insurance shares took a hit on Monday as officials warned on the “potentially catastrophic” impact of Hurricane Florence, a major storm that could hit the east coast of the US as early as Thursday.But the likelihood of the rebuilding effort that could follow such a storm propped up home improvement companies such as Home Depot and Lowe’s.The National Hurricane Center upgraded Florence to a category 4 storm on Monday and described it as an “large and extremely dangerous hurricane”. Data showed its maximum sustained wind speed at 140 miles per hour (220km per hour) and the NHC said further strengthening was anticipated.A “life-threatening storm surge” is likely along portions of the coastlines of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, the NHC said, with a storm surge watch likely to be issued for some of these areas by Tuesday.“On the forecast track, the center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday,” the NHC said in an update on Monday afternoon.The S&P 500 insurance subsector was down 0.7 per cent during lunchtime trading in New York, weaker than both the broader financial sector and the benchmark S&P 500, which were both up about 0.3 per cent.American International Group and Travellers finished down by 1.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively while Progressive was off 1.6 per cent and Chubb dropped 0.8 per cent. The worst performers, though were Torchmark and Everest Re Group — which saw declines blow out to 4.5 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively, by the closing bell.Benefiting from a predicted need for homebuilding materials in any repair efforts, Lowe’s was up 2.6 per cent and Home Depot gained 2.2 per cent.
1;ALL;Allstate Corp;2018-07-19T18:15:20Z;Insurers hit by mounting US storm costs;Catastrophes cut nearly $1bn from profits at two of the sector’s largest companies;Two of the biggest US insurance companies have racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses from recent storms as extreme weather across the country continues its costly run.Travelers disclosed on Thursday that catastrophes had cost it $488m in the second quarter, a fifth more than a year ago. Weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings sent shares in the $34bn-market-cap company down 3.2 per cent by late morning in New York.Allstate, meanwhile, estimated ahead of its second-quarter results that catastrophe losses last month alone cost it $417m due mainly to hailstorms in Texas and Colorado.The hailstorms and thunderstorms in June followed a series of other costly disasters earlier in the year, from mudslides in California to cyclones in the north-east of the country.Catastrophe losses in recent quarters “have exceeded our historical experience and our expectations”, said Alan Schnitzer, chairman and chief executive of Travelers. Referring to a list of catastrophes, he added: “We haven’t seen a string like that in the last decade.”Last year was the costliest on record for the industry. Hurricanes in Florida and the Caribbean, earthquakes in Mexico and wildfires in California cost insurers about $135bn, according to estimates from Munich Re earlier this year.Colorado was particularly hard hit by recent hailstorms, striking urban areas of Denver, Boulder and Colorado Springs, according to the insurance broker Aon.Combined economic losses from hail and windstorms last month were anticipated to cost almost $4bn. Of that, insurers expected to cover more than $3bn.“When these storms hit they can be quite severe,” said Randy Binner, analyst at B Riley FBR. “The severity of some of these storms and the damage they’re causing are running higher than we think they would.”He added: “It’s partly a function of the economy being good. There’s a lot of insured property out there.”The updates from Travelers and Allstate could signal weakness across the sector as earnings season gets under way.
2;ALL;Allstate Corp;2017-12-19T19:49:50Z;Insurers see tax plan hitting Bermuda and Lloyd’s of London;Foreign-owned groups say they will be forced to raise premiums by billions of dollars;Multinational insurers with US operations have hit out at the Republican tax plan that is on the brink of becoming law this week, claiming the reforms will make them victims of “America first” protectionism.With the House of Representatives approving the finalised bill on Tuesday, Lloyd’s of London and companies in Bermuda and continental Europe have emerged as big potential losers from a new tax on cross-border payments.The tax package gives corporations a generous cut in the headline corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent, but the insurers’ predicament highlights how some sectors have been left facing perceived penalties that frantic lobbying could not avert.Foreign-owned insurers say the tax on cross-border flows of insurance cash will make it harder for them to reduce their US tax bills and force them to ramp up premiums for consumers by billions of dollars a year.The regime, part of the set of tax laws hammered out by the House of Representatives and Senate, would also hit global banks and has prompted protests from European finance ministers.If the tax bill passes the Senate as expected, it will go to President Donald Trump’s desk to be signed into law as early as this week. Republicans are pursuing tax reform without any Democratic support and operating on a razor thin Senate majority.Kevin Brady, the lawmaker who chaired the committee that finalised the bill, gave foreign banks and insurers a glimmer of hope this week by saying he would listen to their concerns and advocate a future bill to make any necessary revisions.“We’re going to let businesses analyse the new tax approach, give us their feedback and we’ll listen from there,” he said in response to a question from the Financial Times.The winners of this debate are US insurers — they had the home court advantage, and they wonThe tax bill is a victory for domestic US insurers including Allstate, Berkshire Hathaway and Travelers, which argued that their international rivals — especially in Bermuda — had an unfair tax advantage. The Coalition for American Insurance said the package “helps to close the tax haven loophole in the current tax code that unfairly rewarded the transfer of profits and jobs overseas”.However, overseas-based insurers complain the new rules will make it more expensive for them to do business, and say that the added costs would have to be passed on to customers.Bradley Kading, president of the Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers, said studies funded by the association had found the reforms threatened to wipe out at least an eighth, or $18bn, of global reinsurance supply and would push up consumer premiums by $5bn to $20bn a year.“It’s quite a dramatic change,” he said. “The winners of this debate are US insurers — they had the home court advantage, and they won. The losers are US consumers.”The changes will impose a tax on premiums that US subsidiaries pay to their parent companies overseas. The premiums will be taxed at 5 per cent next year, rising to 10 per cent in 2019 and 12.5 per cent in 2026.Critics of the reforms include Evan Greenberg, chief executive of the insurer Chubb, which is listed in the US but headquartered in Switzerland. He has said “protectionist US insurers” were “seeking to upset the global insurance market that is working well for US consumers.”Insurance executives in London meanwhile said the reforms could slow down the flow of business to insurance centres outside the US. “It limits the amount of capital available and drives prices up,” said one.Domestic US companies complain the structures targeted by the reforms — so-called affiliate reinsurance — are designed to avoid taxes on business their foreign rivals conduct in the US. International insurers counter that there are sound non-tax reasons for such arrangements and that they help spread risk globally.Joseph Calianno, international technical tax practice leader at BDO, said there was a chance the measure could provoke retaliatory action from other jurisdictions.“There are a lot of different deductible payments that could be picked up here to related foreign parties,” he said. “There is a thought that they are discriminating against them.”In a statement Lloyd’s said: “At this point it is too soon to speculate on the impact of proposed US tax reforms on the Lloyd’s market. Ultimately this will vary considerably depending on the nature of a particular business.“Lloyd’s remains fully committed to the US market and ready to manage the impact of these reforms.”One senior executive at a European bank said the tax reform was “an irritant” but one that would not change the economics of having a US presence.The banker said the hit to foreign lenders seemed to be “an unintended consequence” of the tax changes, adding that it was “quite confident” of finding a way of structuring the capital instruments it had issued to its US arm from its European parent in a way that could allow it to avoid being hit by the changes.Additional reporting by Martin Arnold in London
3;ALL;Allstate Corp;2017-10-02T19:31:43Z;Global Bankers Insurance to buy Lincoln Benefit from Cowdery’s Resolution Life;;Global Bankers Insurance said on Monday that one of its affiliates has agreed to acquire Lincoln Benefit Life Company and certain other affiliated entities from British insurance entrepreneur Clive Cowdery’s Resolution Life.The acquired entities support a life and annuity business with more than $9.5bn in policy reserves and $572.4m in capital and surplus as of June 30.Lou Hensley, co-Ceo of Global Bankers said:Lincoln Benefit Life is our largest acquisition since our inception and we are excited for the future opportunities this transaction brings. Resolution Life’s management team, along with the Company’s employees, have built an impressive business with scalable operations. Although the Company has recently been in run-off, Lincoln Benefit Life is a strong brand name that we can leverage for new sales.The decision to sell Lincoln Benefit Life comes as Mr Cowdery’s Resolution Group has moved to consolidate its insurance activities across the US, UK and continental Europe into a single holding company.Mr Cowdery’s Delaware-incorporated vehicle first acquired Lincoln Benefit Life from AllState for $600m in 2013, when it was placed into run-off — accepting premiums on existing policies only.The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.
4;ALL;Allstate Corp;2016-10-06T18:39:19Z;Florida insurer shares feel full force of Hurricane Matthew;;Shares in Florida insurance companies came under heavy selling pressure on Thursday as the industry braced for multi-billion dollar losses from Hurricane Matthew.By early afternoon in New York, Heritage Insurance was down 13 per cent and Universal Insurance 14 per cent. Both companies provide property and casualty cover in the state, writes Alistair Gray in New York.Authorities have warned of “catastrophic” damage if Matthew, classified as a category four storm, hits Florida directly. In a note on Thursday, analysts FBR Capital Markets said they were assuming losses for the insurance industry of between $3bn and $7bn.“This level of event will likely be notable for earnings of exposed insurers, but it is not a large event in terms of industry capital capacity,” wrote analyst Randy Binner.The most costly catastrophe in US history, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cost the sector $49bn, according to the Insurance Information Institute. Sandy, which devastated the eastern seaboard in 2012, cost almost $20bn.Shares in larger, diversified insurers tracked down only modestly. Allstate, Travelers and Progressive were all down less than 1 per cent.
5;ALL;Allstate Corp;2014-04-28T16:48:16Z;Investors place bet on insurers’ catastrophe bonds;;Yield-starved investors are gambling that mother nature will be kind this year as they flock to a risky type of insurance-linked debt known as catastrophe bonds.Sales of “cat bonds” have hit a record level in the first four months of 2014 as insurance companies take advantage of investor appetite for a type of debt that offers higher yields as well as returns that are uncorrelated to other types of securities.The bonds allow insurers to transfer some of the risk that they will have to pay out billions of dollars in the event of a natural disaster taking place. While the debt offers juicy returns, investors are at risk of losing their principal if catastrophes such as earthquakes or hurricanes do occur.“The spreads on these bonds have been incredible and so that has attracted a number of investors,” said Jeff Mohrenweiser, senior director at Fitch Ratings. “There’s been greater demand, and insurance companies are now meeting that demand with increased supply.”A new deal offered last week by Allstate, the biggest publicly traded home and car insurer in the US, helped push year-to-date issuance of cat bonds to $4.75bn, according to figures from Artemis.bm, which collects data on insurance-linked markets.That is the highest amount sold in the first four months of the year since at least 1996, and takes the amount of cat bonds sold over the past 12 months to $8.4bn – not far from the $8.5bn 12-month record recorded in late 2006 and early 2007.The Allstate sale followed a $1.5bn offering by Citizens Property Insurance, in what will probably be the largest cat bond sale on record, according to Artemis.bm. The bonds cover citizens’ losses in the event of a hurricane in Florida.“The market has a lot of potential right now, definitely helped by the continued low pricing,” said Steve Evans, owner and editor of Artemis.bm.Allstate said last week that it would offer at least $600m worth of catastrophe bonds – more than twice the $250m the company sold last year.The new bonds, issued as part of Allstate’s Sanders Re shelf programme, cover lage storms in most of the US, as well as earthquakes in a handful of states.Losses on cat bonds have so far been relatively rare but can occur even if natural disasters do not materialise. A $250m cat bond sold by Allstate back in 2007 defaulted because of a derivatives agreement struck with Lehman Brothers, the failed investment bank, for instance.While cat bonds remain a small portion of the overall amount of net premiums written by the insurance industry, transferring some risk to investors through the debt has clear benefits for insurers, according to Mr Mohrenweiser at Fitch.“Typically insurance companies are going to get catastrophe coverage from the large reinsurers,” he says. “Cat bonds provide a little bit of a diversification benefit. They also help keep people honest because there are competing forces on pricing.”tracy.alloway@ft.comTwitter: @tracyalloway
6;ALL;Allstate Corp;2013-07-18T13:32:14Z;Timing good for Clive Cowdery’s first US deal with Resolution Life;;The list of British institutions that have failed to crack the US is a long one, but where Tesco and Marks and Spencer have fallen in the past, Clive Cowdery believes he has a successful future.In sealing his first deal in the US, the British entrepreneur signalled his ambition to do stateside what he first managed in the UK, namely to buy up and roll together a number of life assurance businesses and to run them for cash instead of hunting for new customers.Whether his new Delaware-incorporated company Resolution Life will be able to meet these expectations may come down to the force of Mr Cowdery’s personality as much as to the raw mathematics of insurance finance, says industry veteran Jim Sutcliffe.“What Clive is, apart from anything else, is a superb salesman,” says Mr Sutcliffe, a former chief executive of Old Mutual and now chairman of Sun Life Financial of Canada.The pair have known each other since the 1990s when Mr Sutcliffe was head of the British company Prudential’s UK arm and Mr Cowdery was an executive in Dublin. “He works bloody hard building relationships, and he is a great networker.”Resolution Life was revealed on Wednesday as the successful bidder for the Allstate subsidiary Lincoln Benefit Life, fighting off private equity bidders in what may be the first evidence of Mr Cowdery’s famous persuasiveness. Private equity deals are facing scrutiny from regulators, amid fears the new owners could take a more aggressive approach to investing the assets and put policyholders at risk – so Mr Cowdery’s task has been to persuade sellers that his deal is less likely to get gummed up in the approval process.Allstate was at pains to highlight Resolution’s “long-term view of the market” and its commitment to running Lincoln as a traditional life business rather than financial engineering.It is a record cheered by early investors in Resolution Mark One, though one experienced industry analyst argued the record of returns for public investors has been more mixed, and Mr Cowdery’s star has fallen in the UK.Public shareholders gained access to the first Resolution Life when in 2005 it mounted a reverse takeover of the listed group Britannic, and ultimately sold the enlarged company to Hugh Osmond’s Pearl Group in early 2008. But the share price return merely tracked that of the sector and the market.The second iteration was listed straight away, and a series of rights issues and corporate governance problems proved unpopular with investors.“It’s not a huge record, but as in all things timing matters,” the analyst says. “Cowdery was well ahead of anyone else. He identified in the life market that it was better to consolidate and merge the dead and the dying rather than focus on trying to win new business.”What Clive is, apart from anything else, is a superb salesmanIn the US, Mr Cowdery will not be a pioneer. A Birmingham, Alabama, company called Protective Life has been acquiring and running off life assurance businesses for more than three decades and has dramatically increased the size of its dealmaking in recent years as bigger owners have decided to exit the life industry.John Johns, chief executive of Protective, called Mr Cowdery “a very able fellow” and said the timing was good for Resolution’s arrival in the US.“If you look at the financial performance of traditional businesses here, even though interest rates are improving, it has not been very exciting from an investor standpoint,” he says.“There are strong parallels between the UK and the US markets, though consolidation is happening in smaller pieces and a bit more gradually here. The US is more fragmented than the UK was before Resolution came along.”If anything, with interest rates potentially on an upward path and investment returns set to improve, more of the 400-plus US life companies could be encouraged to hoist a “for sale” sign if management think they will not be accused of selling at the bottom. Add to that new, more onerous solvency regulations on financial companies, and foreign owners could be particularly keen to divest their US divisions, Mr Johns says.Mr Sutcliffe of Sun Life is among those who regards it as a tough sell to persuade US life company managers that their businesses are better off closed and sold than open and growing, since US investors are already focused on returns on equity. But he also predicted Resolution would have little trouble finding financial backing for deals from pension funds and, ironically, life assurance funds seeking a low double-digit return.He puts Mr Cowdery’s chances of success in the US at “60/40 in favour, and the reason it would work is because of his forceful personality”.
7;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Cowdery in $600m deal for US insurer;;Clive Cowdery, who has twice set up companies called Resolution to consolidate the UK life insurance industry, embarked on a third act in the US with the $600m acquisition of Lincoln Benefit Life.Mr Cowdery’s Delaware-incorporated vehicle, Resolution Life Holdings, beat private equity bidders for the 75-year-old insurer, which was put up for sale by its parent Allstate.In a clue to Mr Cowdery’s transatlantic ambitions, Allstate said Resolution expected the deal would be the first of several. “Its strategy is to acquire a number of life insurance businesses in the US and focus on the needs of existing customers over the long run, rather than actively seeking new sales,” it said.In its statement announcing the deal, Allstate highlighted Resolution’s “consistent track record of establishing businesses in the UK” and its commitment “to retaining in-force customers and providing excellent customer experiences and support”.The vehicle is separate from Resolution Ltd, the UK-listed group which bought Friends Provident. It will be run by Weldon Wilson who, as head of the Swiss Re arm Admin Re, was a competitor to Mr Cowdery as he bid for life businesses.The Lincoln business being sold represented about 15 per cent of Allstate’s premium and contract charge income last year, totalling $341m.Resolution and Mr Cowdery declined to comment on Wednesday night.Allstate is remaining in the life insurance business, but focusing on policies sold by its own salesforce rather than indirectly through financial advisors. The company said it would take a $475m-$525m after-tax loss on the deal but it would free up $1bn in capital to deploy elsewhere.Sales of life businesses have come under the political and regulatory microscope in the US since private equity bidders began winning auctions, particularly for fixed annuity businesses, amid concern that financial buyers would increase risks to policyholders through more aggressive investment strategies.The sale of Sun Life Financial of Canada’s US life business to Guggenheim Partners has been delayed by an investigation into the deal by New York state superintendent of financial services Benjamin Lawsky, which has also raised nerves over Aviva’s sale of its US arm to Guggenheim Partners.The first Resolution project began in 2004 with the purchase of Royal & Sun Alliance’s life business and public shareholders gained access to the company when in 2005 it mounted a reverse takeover of the listed group Britannic, which had already closed to new business two year’s previously.The company was ultimately sold to Hugh Osmond’s Pearl Group in 2008 for about £5bn.The current Resolution Ltd has achieved less significant returns for shareholders and attracted the ire of UK regulators, who insisted Mr Cowdery drop a structure where the company was managed by his personal offshore company, Resolution Operations LLP.It bought Friends Provident, most of Axa’s UK life assurance operations and part of Bupa, but cancelled a plan to return £250m to shareholders and abandoned its acquisition strategy.

The investment was supported with £4.5m grant aid from the government development agency, Invest Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland’s economy has fared worse than other regions because of the economic crisis in the Republic of Ireland and civil unrest sparked by Loyalist protests over the flying of the Union flag at Belfast city hall. Unemployment rose last month to 8.5 per cent, the same level as 1998. Youth unemployment is at record levels, with almost a quarter of those aged 18 to 24 out of work.The Northern Ireland executive is focusing on using the G8 summit, which is being held in Lough Erne, Co Fermanagh, as a means of attracting inward investment. It plans to ask G8 leaders to send trade delegations to an investment conference planned for the region in the autumn.Peter Robinson, First Minister in the Northern Ireland executive, welcomed the investment, which will bring AllState’s total workforce in Belfast, Londonderry and Strabane to more than 2,000 people.“This announcement of hundreds of new high quality jobs by a top Fortune 100 company sends out a clear and unequivocal message to international investors to have confidence in Northern Ireland as a competitive location from which to grow their business,” he said.AllState Northern Ireland, which was formerly known as Northbrook technology, develops software and technology solutions to its US parent AllState Corporation, a home and automobile insurer.
9;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;ALL;Allstate Corp;2013-01-09T19:00:46Z;Banks lead rush to US debt markets;;Banks and financial institutions are leading the pack of global borrowers that have rushed to the US debt markets at the start of the year.Global corporations began 2013 with a wave of issuance that pushed total bond sales in the US over the $40bn mark in less than a week. But no group of borrowers has been more aggressive than banks and financial institutions.Citigroup, Allstate and MetLife, among others, were joined by the UK’s Standard Chartered and Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo, sending dollar-denominated sales of bank debt to $14.3bn so far this year, according to Dealogic. In a single blockbuster sale, Bank of America offered $6bn in three parts on Tuesday. That was the largest bond sale so far in 2013.Banks are rushing to squeeze in as many sales as possible ahead of the so-called quiet period, which precedes the release of their quarterly earnings reports, analysts said. Wells Fargo kicks off the US bank results season on Friday, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs coming next week.“Banks tend to come to markets earlier in the year, but they are certainly being more aggressive,” said Jason Brady, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “It’s a sign they are growing more comfortable with their balance sheets and in a position to take more debt.”A recent rise in Treasury yields may also be contributing to the banks’ rush to lock in new funding sooner rather than later. The yield on the 10-year note moved close to 2 per cent from 1.7 per cent in a matter of days, before paring some of its advance.“Any jump in rates tends to kick borrowers into action,” Mr Brady said.Bank sales have also dominated the issuance calendar in Europe. Northern European issuers such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC France, BNP Paribas and Société Générale have all tapped the euro market in the past few days, but much of the focus has been on higher-yielding assets from the eurozone periphery.BBVA, Spain’s second-largest bank by assets, reopened the region’s bond markets last week with a €1.5bn deal. But there have since been sales from Portuguese, Italian and other Spanish lenders, including Banco Espirito Santo, UniCredit, Caixabank and Banco Popular.“Investors would prefer higher beta issuance just to get some decent yield in this low-rate environment,” said Suki Mann, head of credit strategy at SG.European banks have also taken advantage of huge demand for dollar transactions. The $3.5bn Yankee offering from Italy’s Intesa was almost six times subscribed.For investors, bank debt is appealing as supply is still recovering from a sharp drop in issuance in 2010 and 2011. Barclays analysts expect total sales by investment grade financial institutions to reach $290bn this year, in line with 2012.Average yields on the securities are also higher. Yields on US investment-grade financials stood at 2.55 per cent this week, compared with 0.91 per cent for US Treasuries, according to Barclays indices.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway in New York
11;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Investment-grade groups rush to sell debt;;Global corporations rushed to raise the first batch of funds in 2013, taking advantage of a jump in risk appetite this week in the wake of a political deal in Washington that averted the fiscal cliff.Investment-grade borrowers including Ford Motor Company, General Electric Capital and insurers MetLife and Allstate tapped the US debt markets on Thursday in combined deals that reached roughly $13bn by late afternoon in New York, according to data tracker Dealogic and Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data, a research group.The flurry of new bond sales came after a slowdown in the past couple of weeks and zero issuance on Wednesday in spite of a broad rally in risk assets.“After a slowdown and all the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff negotiations, we were bound to see a pick-up in debt sales, especially from the most well-recognised names,” said Adrian Miller, director for fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“Some of the large, multi-tranche deals now coming to markets have been in the pipeline probably since December,” he said.Companies were also trying to squeeze in as many debt sales as possible on Thursday ahead of a key report on US monthly payrolls on Friday. A weaker than expected reading could spark a rebound in volatility after a sharp drop earlier this week, analysts said.“We can expect most of this week’s supply [on Thursday] as payroll numbers come out on Friday,” said Ed Marrinan, head of macro credit strategy at RBS Securities.Mr Marrinan said he expected sales of high-yielding debt also to pick up next week as junk-rated borrowers waited for “the investment grade credit markets to get things started”.The combination of record low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher-yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds pushed US corporate debt sales to a record $1.4tn last year, according to Dealogic.But while yields on corporate debt have rebounded since touching record lows and inflows into bond funds have slowed, demand for the securities was expected to remain high in coming months, analysts said.That, in turn, could help companies sell $1tn in investment grade and high-yield debt this year, according to Barclays estimates.“We may not see new records being broken in the fixed income markets this year, but demand for corporate bonds is still high, and may even increase as the economy improves later in the year,” said Mr Miller.Average yields on US investment grade corporate bonds stood at 2.74 per cent on Thursday, while those on US Treasuries were at 0.9 per cent, according to Barclays indices.Of Thursday’s sales, Ford Motor’s offering of 30-year senior notes marked the company’s first long-bond deal since regaining investment-grade status last May. It was also the first long-dated offering by the automaker since 1999.

Estimated costs to insurers range from less than $10bn to more than double this level.Insurers often struggle to pinpoint the costs after such an event, but underwriters say Sandy has proved especially awkward.“This is a complicated storm with complicated issues,” says Dinos Iordanou, chief executive of Arch Capital, the insurance group.Catastrophe modellers highlight the direct hit on the southern end of Manhattan, which has an unusually large concentration of high-value property.“It’s going to behave differently from the simplest stuff to model,” says Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at RMS, one of the main disaster forecasting companies. “A lot of office space is out of commission, including some of the biggest office buildings in New York.”RMS says it is too early to provide reliable estimates of the damages.Eqecat, another modelling company, has estimated insured losses for Sandy at between $10bn and $20bn and economic losses at between $30bn and $50bn. However, the company has cautioned: “There are still sections of the country without power from the storm and that is affecting the business interruption numbers.”Another question insurers have raised is whether Sandy was indeed a post-tropical cyclone, as classified by the National Hurricane Center. This has put them on the line for billions of dollars of additional claims.Wordings of typical residential policies in the US mean homeowners must usually stump up for a greater sum themselves, before their insurer pays out, when the storm in question is a hurricane.Mr Iordanou says not being able to use the hurricane deductibles will push losses for insurers up by between 30 and 50 per cent. Analysts say the region affected was so wide that wind speed measurements varied in different areas – prompting insurers to question the definition of the storm when it made landfall.“Usually it’s a bit more clear cut,” says Dennis Sugrue, director at S&P Insurance Ratings. “This one was on the threshold [of being a hurricane]. There’s going to be a debate on that.“That’s going to result in a lot of uncertainty. It’s hard to model that kind of stuff.”A lot of office space is out of commission, including some of the biggest office buildings in New YorkAnother big question in determining the costs to insurers is the number of homeowners who decide to pursue legal action against their insurers.Flood damage is not usually covered by standard residential policies – although some households may be protected by a government-funded insurance scheme.Disputes about whether wind or flood caused losses prompted several lawsuits after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Paul Berger, attorney at the Hurricane Law Group, says: “It’s going to be the big sticking point – it’s going to tie up the courts for years.”“2020 is my prediction” for when the law suits will be resolved on this issue, he adds.However, Mr Muir-Wood of RMS downplays this particular threat to the insurance industry because the balance between storm surge and wind damage was unusual in the case of Sandy. “The wind damage is relatively quite light,” he says, which should minimise the risk of widespread disputes about prospective flood claims. Meanwhile, analysts caution that initial estimates have a tendency to rise in the weeks following such catastrophes. Yet they concur that whatever the final tally, the industry overall should be able to withstand the hit without too much pain.Business interruption payouts may well account for the greatest chunk of the losses the insurance industry endures from Hurricane Sandy, underwriters have warned.Such claims have historically tended to account for about a fifth of overall insurance losses in past US hurricanes such as Katrina. But analysts are expecting greater supply chain disruption in the case of Sand y.“The massive storm is affecting a wide variety of businesses in densely populated areas, including retail, corporate offices, transportation, manufacturing, and energy plants,” Fitch said on Thursday.The rating agency said that in the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and Thailand floods last year, modellers underestimated the risks arising from business interruption.See full storyIn third-quarter results released in recent days, European insurers and reinsurers have brushed aside concerns about the cost of Sandy. Munich Re and Hannover Re lifted their profit forecasts while Swiss Re said it might pay a special dividend.Analysts say the biggest hits will be taken by primary US insurers including Allstate, State Farm and Travelers. Yet even among these companies investors have been mostly cool-headed. Since markets reopened, shares in top US property and casualty insurers have lost only 0.2 per cent more than the benchmark S&P 500 index.Some analysts have suggested that Sandy could benefit the insurance industry overall, although given the human cost of the disaster executives are reluctant to say so publicly.Insurance rates have tended to rise after the industry makes big payouts because weaker insurers exit the market, reducing competition among the remaining underwriters. Rates strengthened after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, for example.However, even though the industry last year endured one of the costliest on record for natural disasters, rates have risen only modestly since then because the industry remains well capitalised.Fitch said: “Hurricane Sandy is not likely to tip the balance to a hard property market, but is more likely to promote continuation of favourable pricing trends in 2013, particularly in US property markets.”
13;ALL;Allstate Corp;2012-11-04T18:32:42Z;Insurers – sizing up Sandy;This time it is different for investors in the sector;The storm has passed and people along the northeast coast of the US are slowly starting to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. One of the first calls will be to the insurers. Traditional wisdom has it that now would be a good time to buy in to the insurance sector, as big losses are swiftly followed by higher premiums and, eventually, higher profits. According to Credit Suisse, US reinsurers outperformed US non-financials in the year after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, the Northridge Earthquake in 1994 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.This time is different, though. It is early days, but risk modellers are estimating the insured loss to be between $7bn and $20bn, well ahead of the $4bn-$5bn suffered after Hurricane Irene last year. That will not worry the reinsurers too much – their coverage only tends to start once the loss has passed $10bn so their portion of the total will be relatively low. The primary insurers are more exposed, so the likes of State Farm, Allstate and Travelers, which have big market shares in the affected areas, will be the ones to watch. Much will depend on how much damage was caused by wind (covered by insurers) and how much by floods (covered by the government).Prices have already been rising, driven by global catastrophe losses and poor weather in the US in 2011. US property catastrophe insurance prices are up 7 per cent this year according to insurance advisory group Guy Carpenter. On top of that, the sector as a whole is well-capitalised thanks to rising earnings (until Sandy, 2012 had been a relatively benign year for weather losses) and a more conservative investment attitude across the sector.Sandy-related losses will dent earnings this year – Morgan Stanley has cut fourth-quarter earnings per share estimates for the property and casualty sector by 26 per cent – but are not likely to damage materially the industry’s capital position. And the more capital there is chasing business, the less scope there is for premiums to rise, and share prices to follow them.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
14;ALL;Allstate Corp;2012-10-30T17:44:42Z;Sandy unsettles outlook for insurers;;Before the arrival of hurricane Sandy, the global insurance industry had been enjoying one of its more benign years.Granted, the sector was facing multibillion-dollar claims arising from the worst drought to hit the US in more than half a century.Yet the traditional peak of the Atlantic hurricane season had passed with only one big hurricane, Isaac. Losses arising from Isaac – an estimated $2bn – paled in comparison to many storms in years gone by.However, after Sandy struck on Monday at the heart of a densely populated area that is home to some of the world’s most valuable property, 2012 is shaping up to be not such a merciful year after all.Sandy may well prove more expensive than hurricane Irene, which cost insurers about $5.6bn after it hit a similar region last year, according to RMS, the catastrophe modellers.Sandy “is much more severe and has impacted New York City to a much worse degree than Irene”, RMS said. There was $2.1tn worth of insured property in New York City alone, it added.The forecaster added the event was “fairly unusual” in that it hit the coast directly and travelled far inland, rather than “skirting coastline”.Still, the reinsurer Munich Re highlighted that Sandy was ranked as a Category 1 hurricane, the lowest category out of five, with lower wind speeds than some of the storms that have hit the Gulf of Mexico.Fitch, the rating agency, said the worst of the losses would be borne by primary underwriters rather than reinsurers.Based on their shares of the insurance markets in the mid-atlantic and New England regions, Fitch said the most affected insurers would include State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual Group, and Travelers.Eqecat, one disaster modelling company, has given a range of the estimated losses for insurers of between $5bn and $10bn but more precise reliable estimates are unlikely to be available for several days.
15;ALL;Allstate Corp;2012-02-02T18:29:23Z;Allstate shifts to alternative assets;;Low interest rates are prompting Allstate, the US consumer insurance group, to “get creative” in its portfolio to generate returns in its investment products business.The company on Thursday told analysts that it is shifting some of its fixed-income security investments into alternative assets such as resources, infrastructure, real estate and stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds, in order to generate the yield necessary to match its long-term liabilities.“We have to get creative in the way we manage the investment portfolio,” said Matthew Winter, chief executive of Allstate Financial, the company’s annuity and life insurance business, on an earnings call.Allstate has been shrinking the balance sheet of its financial unit by shifting out of annuities, a retirement product that pays out cash over time and generates interest rate risk for the insurer, and more toward life insurance products that do not have interest rate, or “spread”, risk.The move matches a broader shift by US insurers, which have struggled to earn returns on annuity products. MetLife, the US’s largest insurer by market capitalisation, has said it plans to reduce variable annuity sales by 35 per cent this year, and Canada’s Sun Life has said it will discontinue new sales on the products in the US.“[We] feel pretty confident that with the change in the mix of business, growing the mortality and morbidity non-spread related businesses, as well as the alternative kind of pension investment strategy for long-term liabilities on the pay-out side, it leaves us with …some targeted good return investment assets,” said Mr Winter.Allstate’s $95.6bn investment portfolio returned 6.6 per cent in 2011, versus 8.6 per cent in 2010 and 10.8 per cent in 2009, in part reflecting Allstate Financial’s smaller balance sheet.The biggest change in the portfolio in the fourth quarter versus a year ago was a 5 per cent decline in holdings of US Treasury and other government notes, plus a 2 per cent drop in other short-term paper. By contrast, the allocation to corporate bonds rose from 38 per cent to 46 per cent.This tracks with the Federal Reserve’s move hold core rates near-zero until 2014, in order to generate investment activity while the global economy languishes.Allstate’s net income in the fourth quarter doubled to $724m as it raised rates on homeowners and auto owners and released reserves. Insurers are broadly enjoying the relief of better weather, as they recorded massive losses in the first half of the year amid a record number of $1bn disasters.“With a sustained low interest environment, it means that core returns on underwritten products need to offset that headwind,” said Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays Capital.
16;ALL;Allstate Corp;2011-10-11T23:54:08Z;Most hedge funds to escape tighter oversight;Planned threshold of $50bn exempts many groups;US regulators will examine non-bank financial groups with more than $50bn in assets to decide whether they are dangerous enough to merit tougher supervision and higher capital requirements – a threshold that will be a relief to most hedge funds and private equity firms.The Federal Reserve, Treasury and other regulators on the Financial Stability Oversight Council voted on Tuesday for criteria to designate companies as “systemically important”, a category that the industry has been lobbying hard to escape because of the potential hit to profits.The rule’s focus on size is likely to be good news for hedge funds – which typically fall below the $50bn threshold – and private equity firms such as KKR and Blackstone, but bad news for the insurance industry, where institutions from Prudential Financial to Allstate exceed the threshold. All banks with more than $50bn in assets are automatically included.Non-banks with more than $50bn in assets then have to fall foul of one out of a list of metrics to be designated, according to the proposed rule. They would have to be leveraged at more than 15 to 1, have a short-term debt to assets ratio of 10 per cent, have more than $20bn in total debt, more than $3.5bn in derivative liabilities or have more than $30bn of credit default swaps written against their failure.Officials stressed that the thresholds were intended as a guide and not all companies that breached them would be included, while regulators would retain the power to designate a company that they consider risky even if it did not meet these criteria.The rule was ordered by the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress last year, in a bid to subject more financial companies to stricter regulation in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the near-collapse, and ensuing government rescue, of American International Group.Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, noted that the 2008 crisis proved that companies “outside the formal banking system” could cause “a lot of tensions and trauma across financial markets, amplifying the pressure on the broader financial system”.He has said he favoured a short list and suggested AIG and GE Capital are obvious candidates. Daniel Tarullo, governor of the Federal Reserve, has also said publicly that he favours a short initial list. According to people familiar with inter-agency talks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has argued for a broader range.Ben McKay, senior vice-president of federal government relations for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said: “Property casualty insurers are not highly leveraged or interconnected and have a fundamentally different business model than banks, a fact that warrants different regulatory treatment.”Additional reporting by Helen Thomas in New York
17;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US authorities assess hurricane’s aftermath;;Hurricane Irene left at least 35 people dead and nearly 5.5m businesses and homes without power, as states along the US east coast began the massive clean-up effort.The eastern seaboard of the US from South Carolina to Maine suffered the main brunt of the storm with widespread flooding, power outages and property damage.Although New York City was mainly spared, millions were unable to return to work due to road and rail disruptions. New York subways and buses resumed service on Monday morning but the Long Island Rail Road remained partly closed. The Metro-North Railroad expects to restore limited service in the afternoon.By Monday morning, many analysts had downgraded their forecast losses devised before the hurricane hit. Kinetic Analysis Corp halved their initial estimate of total storm damage from $20bn to less than $10bn.The Consumer Federation of America forecast that wind damage could total $5bn in personal claims, with a further $2bn in claims related to widespread flooding.The Associated Press reported at least 35 deaths in 10 states.Claims may rise in the coming weeks, however, as compiling losses from flooding and wind damage will take some time.After falling at the end of last week, insurance stocks rose on Monday morning, as the extent of damage did not reach anticipated levels.Two insurance companies listed in New York, Hartford Financial Services and Allstate, both saw their share prices rise sharply on Monday.“Claims are starting to come in,” said Dick Leudke, spokesman for State Farm, the largest insurer of cars and homes in the US. “But we’ve learnt not to have expectations. It’s impossible to predict.”But some analysts said that much of the damage would not be covered by private insurance. Robert Hunter, insurance analyst at the Consumer Federation of America said: “A lot is flooding which they don’t cover, and other infrastructure, which the municipalities self-insure for.”“I don’t think impact on insurance industry will be huge, maybe $5bn,” he said.Clean-up efforts were in full force as Irene left a trail of destruction including mass flooding, toppled trees and fallen debris. The US Department of Energy reported that 5.48m customers were without power as of 10am local time on Monday.Utility companies whose transmission lines had been thrashed by the storm fought to restore power to homes on Monday. Meanwhile, oil and gas refineries, such as those operated by ConocoPhillips and Sunoco, have battled to return to normal production patterns.Robert McDonnell, Virginia’s governor, said his state suffered the second-largest power outage ever and warned that electricity might take a week to be restored. Heavy flooding was reported in Vermont, while waters continued to rise in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.Barack Obama, US president, warned on Sunday that recovery efforts would take weeks, saying “this is not over”.“Response and recovery efforts will be an ongoing operation,” he said.Mr Obama declared a federal state of emergency in several states, which means federal funds will cover much of the cost of the disaster clean-up.Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, said on Monday the cost to the state would be high, although it would be alleviated by the federal disaster relief declaration. “It’s my guess costs will be in the tens of millions,” he said to ABC News.Much of the focus as Irene neared the mainland was on its trajectory, which had New York City in its sights, making it the first named storm to hit the nation’s financial capital since 1985.While the majority of Manhattan dodged the most damaging effects of the storm, coastal neighbourhoods in Staten Island and Queens were hit with flooding and power outages.Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor, had come under criticism last year for his handling of the post-Christmas blizzard in New York. He was a much more visible presence this time around. He said on Sunday that he “had made exactly the right call”.“Bloomberg was making up for his failures during the blizzard last year,” said Doug Muzzio, professor of public affairs at the City University of New York. “I think he did it successfully – he was on the television constantly, he directed the city’s response. Overall an ‘A’ for effort, an ‘A’ for performance. He pulled up his grade substantially from the winter semester.”

Irene had been downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before it made landfall, and markets opened as usual Monday morning. Hartford Financial Services was up 13 per cent at $19.42. Allstate rose 8.5 per cent to $26.30.Bank of America was up 8.1 per cent at $8.39, after it announced the $8.3bn sale of half of its 10 per cent stake in China Construction Bank. Some analysts had expected the bank to dispose of its entire stake in CCB to raise capital, but analysts were pleased with the price, which represents a premium over the $7.3bn received for 6 per cent of CCB in 2009.“The price seems good to me, and BofA are shrinking their balance sheet and disposing of non-core assets, which is what markets are telling them to do,” said Paul Miller at FBR Capital Markets.The S&P 500 closed up 2.8 per cent at 1,210.08, above the 1,200 barrier at which bears have offered resistance. But trading was lower than on any other day this month, leaving traders cautious about reading too much into the rally.“Technicians will tell you they want the S&P 500 to reach 1,200 on strong volume,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential. “In a rally, more than percentage rises, volume is important.”Media groups dependent on advertising for revenue outperformed the S&P 500. The sector suffered losses last week after Citigroup downgraded several stocks citing expected sluggish growth in consumer spending.Cable company CBS was up 5.6 per cent at $24.47 and Gannett, which owns magazines and newspapers including USA Today, was up 8.1 per cent at $11.56.James Dix at Wedbush said an economic slowdown would not necessarily hurt media companies immediately. “Large companies are not as highly levered as they were in 2008. That gives them some flexibility to keep spending on advertising to gain market share, in the hope that any downturn will be short,” he said.But he said he preferred to hold advertising agency stocks over advertising-dependent media groups.“Advertising agencies have exposure to emerging markets, because companies will still be looking to grow their brands there by deploying marketing budgets. But if you are looking for growth in China, you won’t advertise on CBS.“Margins are also tougher for media groups. Advertising companies can lay off staff in a downturn, but media companies have high fixed costs. They have already invested in their content and need to sell advertising to make a profit.”Advertising agencies had a mixed day. Omnicom Group was up only 2.1 per cent to $40.01. Rival Interpublic Group, a big advertising agency, was up 7.2 per cent at $8.66.Micron Technology, the semiconductor manufacturer, gained 8.6 per cent to close at $6.15.The group has rallied almost 20 per cent since a dramatic fall last Wednesday, when the company warned it would miss revenue expectations because of falling demand for the Dram components it makes for computers.Since then the Dram spot price has unexpectedly risen almost 5 per cent, continuing gains today, despite a report by business research group IHS, which predicted “free-falling prices are in store in the third quarter”.Other semiconductor stocks also gained. Applied Materials was up 3.7 per cent to $11.39.Based on the quarterly earnings reports of the main semiconductor manufacturers, Citigroup analyst Timothy Arcuri estimated orders had fallen 50 per cent to $20bn during the quarter.But Mr Arcuri said current stock prices reflect depressed demand sufficiently, and said the sector may have now troughed.Monsanto shares fell 1.3 per cent on reports that one of its genetically modified corn crops may have developed resistance to pesticides.Zillow rose 5.3 per cent to $33.04, after Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney initiated coverage with a $36 target and recommendation to “buy”. Mr Mahaney cited the company’s first mover status in online property search and the size of the US property market.Citi, which was the main underwriter of Zillow’s IPO, becomes the first major bank to cover the stock.Youku shares were up 7 per cent at $24.95 after the Chinese video-sharing website announced an online distribution agreement for rights to the DreamWorks Animation Kung Fu Panda franchise films in mainland China. The deal marks the first time DWA titles will be made available through an online platform in China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.7 per cent at 11,447.49 and the Nasdaq index of tech shares rose 2.5 per cent to 2,542.86 at midday.

Although Citi analysts said this was not as bad as the industry had expected, the cuts were not yet final and could increase.Citi said it expected “there to continue to be some overhang on defence names until a deal gets done”, but the key details of defence spending would probably be released in the strategic review due in September.After the bell, the S&P 500 index fell 0.4 per cent to 1,286.95, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.4 per cent to 2,744.61, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,132.49.Last week, the S&P 500 registered its worst weekly performance in a year and markets fluctuated on the news of the negotiations and the growing possibility of default.The indices were also hit by weaker-than-expected Institute of Supply Management figures indicating that the pace of US manufacturing growth was slowing.Some analysts saw some hope, at least over the short term, for bulls.“Over the near term, a solution to raising the debt limit will probably result in a strong rally, given stocks are deeply oversold and near support, which is at 1,250 to 1,270 using the S&P 500,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird. “But the ramifications of GDP growth of less than 1 per cent for the first six months of the year will linger.“Looking further out, the question now becomes whether the weak economy can endure the austerity programmes planned for the second half of the year,” he said.Healthcare facilities were some of the biggest losers after Friday’s after-market news that nursing homes lost a lobbying fight with Medicare that will cost the industry more than $3.8bn next year. The federal government’s healthcare programme for the elderly is cutting its payment rate by 11.1 per cent to help compensate for overbilling.Sun Healthcare Group lost 52.14 per cent to $3.35, Skilled Healthcare Group fell to $5.06, a 42.5 per cent drop, and The Ensign Group slid 22.2 per cent to $22.09.US insurers slipped on news that the US department of health and human services had signed off on recommendations to include contraception in preventive care.While not slated to go into effect until next year, analysts said it would force insurance companies to increase premiums. The S&P healthcare sector was down 1.71 per cent.Concerns that some of the spending cuts from the debt deal will affect Medicare and other healthcare services also hit the sector.Among health insurers to fall were Cigna, down 4.3 per cent to $47.63, Aetna, off 2.9 per cent to $40.29, and United Healthcare, 3.2 per cent lower at $48.02.Humana, the US health insurer, also fell despite forecast-beating results. It reported a second-quarter profit and raised its earnings forecast by more than 10 per cent but shares fell to $72.36, a 2.9 per cent loss.The company would have raised its full-year guidance further, Citi analysts said, but plans to increase non-production spending in the second half could have an impact on results.Allstate, the home and car insurer, reported a second-quarter net loss of $620m after a spring of tornadoes, flooding and other natural disasters, but the loss was less than markets had anticipated. In the quarter, losses from catastrophes reached more than $2bn, the most disclosed by any publicly traded US insurer. Its shares gained 2.2 per cent to $28.34.Shares in Ford Motor rose despite news that the US car company was recalling 1.1m pick-up trucks because of a risk of the gas tank falling off and causing fires. Shares were up 1.1 per cent to $12.35.Late on Sunday, HSBC agreed to sell 195 branches in upstate New York to First Niagara, the Buffalo-based bank, for $1bn in cash. Shares in the regional bank, which merged with NewAlliance Bancshares for $1.5bn last year, fell 2.7 per cent to $11.92.Loews, the US insurance and property group, was hit by higher catastrophe losses and lower income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial.Missing market expectations, it reported earnings per share of $0.62 versus an expected $0.74. Its shares fell 1.9 per cent to $39.11.
20;ALL;Allstate Corp;2011-08-01T20:26:41Z;Allstate weathers the storm as shares hold up;;Allstate, the largest publicly traded US home and auto insurer, reported a second-quarter loss of $620m after five tornadoes and three wildfires caused a sharp increase in catastrophe losses.But the company, whose shares were hit last month by the sudden departure of a senior executive, saw its stock rise 2.24 per cent to $28.34 after beating market expectations.The $2.3bn hit from catastrophe losses was up almost fourfold from the same period last year but had been previously reported. Revenues rose 5.6 per cent to $8.1bn, ahead of analysts’ forecasts, and net profits swung from $145m, or 27 cents a share, in the second quarter last year to a loss of $620m, or $1.19 a share.Allstate’s combined ratio, a measure of insurers’ profitability, rose to 123.3 per cent in the quarter from 96.8 per cent a year ago, meaning the company paid $1.23 in claims for every dollar it collected in premiums. Catastrophe claims made up 36 cents of that total.“While the reported numbers were painful, there are signs that the firm’s core business results are improving,” said Drew Woodbury, an equity analyst at Morningstar. He noted that, excluding catastrophe losses, Allstate has improved profitability in recent quarters by raising prices for homeowners’ insurance and changing auto policy pricing in states where fraud was more likely.That helped lift revenue despite a decline in the number of policies in force in both the home and car insurance businesses. An average 6 per cent boost in homeowners’ premiums in 18 states helped offset the fall in policyholders, lifting the value of homeowners’ premiums by 2.6 per cent.The drop in standard auto policies was concentrated in Florida and New York, with 30 states showing growth in policies. But many customers chose cheaper coverage, leading to a 0.9 per cent decline in the total value of auto premiums.Thomas Wilson, chief executive, said on Monday that some staff would report directly to him after Joseph Lacher, who ran the car and home insurance businesses that make up most of Allstate, left on July 18. “The decision was made and we’ve moved on,” he said. “We have a strong management team in place – a blend of talented individuals from both inside and outside the company.”Asked by analysts to characterise morale at Allstate following the departure of Mr Lacher, Mr Wilson said insurance agents were “highly supportive of our strategy” and he had received “an ovation by agency owners” at a recent meeting to discuss compensation changes.Mr Wilson revealed that the group had taken action to see off any negative effect from the US debt ceiling crisis and adjusted its investment portfolio. “We sold our long Treasuries and put some additional hedges in place …we underweighted equities and we continued our shift into corporate credit,” he said.
21;ALL;Allstate Corp;2011-07-21T22:02:57Z;Insurance: unnaturally disastrous;Capital strains could transform the current “soft” market into a “hard” one;It is disastrous but not yet tragic. The global insurance industry remains resilient after enduring a half year that was costlier than its worst-ever full year. Led by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and supplemented by tornadoes in the US and New Zealand’s quake, economic and insured losses so far are estimated by Munich Re to have been $265bn and $60bn, respectively.Unfortunately, the second half carries more risk due to the timing of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June through November and peaks in around seven weeks’ time. The widely-watched annual forecast from Colorado State University sees 16 named Atlantic storms this year, down from 19 last year though still above average. Of course, the key variable is how many of these make landfall. Last year saw the second highest number of hurricanes on record but a piddling $500m in losses after all major storms died at sea. This year, CSU says the odds of at least one major one making landfall are a disconcerting 72 per cent, well above average.Fitch Ratings reported in May that a hurricane causing big losses could strain some companies’ capital positions. US insurers might be particularly exposed after the freakish weather in the spring. Travelers, which stayed in the black even through the year Hurricane Katrina hit, just registered its first quarterly loss in seven years. Allstate said it lost more in April and May than in all of 2010.But, believe it or not, many in the industry are upbeat. Capital strains could transform the current “soft” market into a “hard” one, allowing anaemic premiums to rise. That is something that natural disasters since the annus horribilis of 2005 and even manmade ones such as the financial crisis have failed to do.Every cloud, even those funnel-shaped ones, has a silver lining.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
22;ALL;Allstate Corp;2010-12-01T03:24:34Z;AIG returns to bond market;;AIG paid a premium on its return to the credit markets with its first bond sale since its rescue by the government two years ago.The insurer sold $2bn of bonds with a $1.5bn tranche priced at a spread, or risk premium of 362.5 basis points over US Treasuries.The bond sale comes after its $180bn bail-out at the height of the financial crisis and after the company this year unveiled a plan to reclaim its independence.The insurer has raised considerable cash through the sale of businesses and other assets.In the third quarter, the company had a net loss of $2.4bn after recording more than $3bn in writedowns on assets that are being sold to repay US bail-out funds.Bond investors said the deal was well received, but that AIG offered yields that were much higher than those of similarly rated insurers.“It is definitely cheap for the rating, but the rating implies a certain level of government support,” said Derrick Wulf, head of interest rates at Dwight Asset Management. “Without the government support, some would put it as below investment grade.”AIG is rated single A minus by Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service. S&P says that its credit rating on AIG includes a five-notch uplift from its assessment of the company’s standalone credit profile, which is junk-rated double B.Bonds due in 2020 issued by Prudential Financial trade at a spread of 180bps over Treasuries, while debt due in 2019 issued by Allstate trades at a risk premium of 135bps over Treasuries, according to investors. Prudential is rated single A and Baa2 while Allstate is rated single A minus and A3.“There are still a lot of moving parts, not the least of which is big government ownership,” said Lon Erickson, managing director at Thornburg Investment Management. “For a lot of different reasons, they are paying a nice premium.”Robert Benmosche, AIG’s chief executive, said in November that the company planned to sell stock as well as bonds.At the end of September, the federal government owned $95.6bn of AIG debt and equity. Since then AIG has raised $37bn in asset sales.The yields appeared to be enough to compensate investors for lingering concerns about AIG’s future and the stigma of its dramatic collapse.A person familiar with the deal said that orders totalled $8bn and that the bonds were priced at risk premiums that were less than that which the company initially offered.“Despite the formal rating, we view the risk profile as more high-yield, which is how this deal is being priced,” said Sabur Moini, portfolio manager for the Payden High Income Fund.A US Treasury spokesman said: “AIG’s ability to access private financing is an important step for the company toward future independence. It demonstrates growing market confidence in the progress AIG has made both in stabilising its operations and in putting itself in a position to repay all of its obligations to US taxpayers.”Additional reporting by Justin Baer in New York
23;ALL;Allstate Corp;2010-10-20T19:53:12Z;Case study: Allstate;;The story.In the early 1990s, Allstate had kept its competitive advantage due to its sophisticated pricing model for auto insurance.At the time, the insurance industry largely developed products and services by focusing on price correlated to risks for a profitable return. As a result, the only differentiator for consumers between companies was price.The challenge.Allstate’s advantage began to erode as competitors developed stronger models. The company needed to identify a new way to maintain its lead.The solution.Allstate decided to study consumers more closely. Meeting the needs of different customer segments was widely used across many industries but was not common practice in the insurance sector. Instead, the industry tended to treat consumers as a set of undifferentiated groups and the primary consideration was pricing risk for profitable return.Allstate simply adopted this approach and put consumers with their individual differences at the core of its product and service planning. This was transformational in the insurance industry.Tom Wilson, the company’s chairman, chief executive and president, directed efforts around understanding what consumers would be willing to pay more for if they received incremental value on the product. How individuals made decisions became the key metric for determining how Allstate designed and priced its products.Rethink the model.Allstate decided to create a new product called “Your Choice Auto” in 2005. This created several tiers for consumers that would offer different features and prices depending on what customers wanted.For example, Allstate had learnt that while some consumers wanted their deductibles reduced for being safe drivers, others did not want to have an automatic rate rise if they were in an accident, and some wanted a “good driver” rebate.Tell the world.Mr Wilson believed that product innovation had to be supported by changes across the entire value chain.This included changing Allstate’s advertising message. The new marketing communicated a value proposition other than price alone.At the same time, new conversations were created for sales agents with customers. For example, they were given new price and features options to offer consumers, which were based on their specific economic circumstances as well as wants and needs. The result was a menu from which the agent could lead a conversation offering an Allstate auto insurance product. “Your Choice Auto” resulted from the effort to get closer to consumers, and the need for Allstate to be flexible in responding to them.The economy has, of course, changed dramatically since the roll-out of the product five years ago. During the economic downturn, “Your Choice Auto” allowed customers to shift within the different tiers of the product and still maintain their relationship with Allstate.Those who were price sensitive purchased the “Value” tier, while others seeking greater features continued to purchase the more premium offers.Since its roll-out in 2005, Allstate’s “Your Choice Auto” has sold more than 4.5m policies.Key lessons.Innovation is often based on the simplest ideas and often this means learning from the example of other sectors and industries. For Allstate, this meant learning to redefine the relationship with customers to better understand what they wanted out of an insurance product.Just as in other sectors, many consumers expect more features from providers and are willing to pay for them.Leadership was also essential. Without the deep involvement of Mr Wilson, such strategic changes could not have happened. The insurance industry did not focus on consumer wants and needs.The change reflects Mr Wilson’s consideration of segmented demand among consumers that is a multi-dimensional versus a one- dimensional look at the marketplace.The writers are founder and CEO of The Cambridge Group, and chairman of the executive board and CEO of The Nielsen Company, respectively.

Claims climbed by 19,000 to 479,000 last week, the most since April. Economists had forecast claims would fall to 455,000.Chain stores reported mixed sales figures for July, with 61 per cent missing expectations, 7 per cent in line and 32 per cent beating forecasts. Teen stores suffered from shoppers reluctant to buy before August’s back-to-school discounting season. Wet Seal fell 1.5 per cent to $3.28 and Hot Topic was down 5.1 per cent to $4.99. Also disappointing were drugstore Walgreen, which fell 1.1 per cent to $28.20, and clothing retailer JC Penney, which slid 5.9 per cent to $22.54.But Abercrombie & Fitch and Macy’s beat expectations. Abercrombie and Fitch rose 2 per cent to $39.58 and Macy’s was up 1.3 per cent to $19.69.Also in retail, shares in Limited Brands were weaker by 0.5 per cent to $26.16 in spite of raising its forecasts for second-quarter earnings.Agricultural companies advanced after Russia announced an export ban on grain and grain products because the country is suffering its worst drought in half a century.Archer Daniels Midland rose 5.2 per cent to $30.09, Monsanto increased 4.3 per cent to $61.98 and CF Industries Holdings gained 3.9 per cent to $86.16.In earnings news, News Corporation, owner of the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and Fox News, rose 3.9 per cent to $14.39 after it followed Time Warner and CBS to post quarterly earnings buoyed by an increase in advertising revenue.Reporting after the bell on Wednesday, the media company said it had swung into profit of 33 cents a share compared with a loss of 8 cents a share for the same period the year before, when it took an impairment charge.Clearwire Corporation, the US broadband wireless company majority-owned by Sprint Nextel, fell 5.5 per cent to $6.77 after it announced a quarterly loss of 61 cents per share. Its losses deepened from 38 cents per share a year ago. Revenue of $122.5m missed analysts’ estimates of $131.93m.Regis Corporation, the world’s largest operator of hair salon chains including Vidal Sassoon and Supercuts, said that its board was looking at ways to enhance shareholder value which may include the sale of the company.

26;ALL;Allstate Corp;2010-02-10T01:40:47Z;US car insurers questioned over recalls;;Democratic lawmakers are seeking information from the five biggest US car insurers, including State Farm and Geico, about what the companies knew about incidents of unexpected acceleration in Toyota vehicles.In a move that is expected to turn up the heat on safety regulators, Henry Waxman, chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, said he wanted details about what warnings the insurance companies may have provided the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) about defects in Toyota vehicles.The insurance companies, which also include Allstate, Farmers Insurance, and Progressive Group, have until February 17 to give Mr Waxman’s committee any reports, briefings or presentations they gave to the NHTSA about Toyota since 2000. He is also seeking communications, including e-mails, to and from NHTSA regarding the insurers’ reports.The move followed a report in Tuesday’s Washington Post that revealed that State Farm, the largest car insurer in the US, had alerted federal safety regulators on “numerous occasions” beginning in 2007 about a rise in reports of unexpected acceleration in Toyotas.The insurers’ response to the query could turn the political spotlight from Toyota to US regulators, who have been criticised for missing red flags. According to the Washington Post, regulators received warnings from State Farm more than a year before they pressured Toyota to issue a recall of millions of cars and trucks.Separately on Tuesday, Akio Toyoda, Toyota’s chief executive, said he would travel to the US to explain to consumers the company’s response to its quality problems, as he announced a global recall of 437,000 hybrid vehicles, including the flagship Prius.At a news conference, Mr Toyoda said the world’s biggest carmaker would recall the petrol-electric hybrids built between April 2009 and this month to fix their braking software.

BNY Mellon’s shares picked up 2.3 per cent to $28.71.Insurer Allstate was one of the steepest climbers in the financial sector, rising 6.3 per cent to $28.42 after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch recommended buying the shares, saying the company’s fundamentals remained strong and that the shares were undervalued following recent falls.Equities saw a turbulent afternoon as investors responded to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).The announcement that there would be no increase in quantitative easing and that the Fed saw economic activity “levelling out” saw stocks slip, before jumping, and then selling off shortly before the close.“The language was pretty optimistic, although with a note of caution,” said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets.But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, said: “I think ‘levelling out’ confused the market a little bit, and it points to a divided Fed.”The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1,005.81 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 9,361.61 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.5 per cent to 1,998.72.“We may be in for some bouncing around as investors decide whether to trust in the recovery and take the plunge into equities,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank.Homebuilders were especially strong after Toll Brothers, which builds luxury houses, said cancellations fell and orders rose during the previous quarter, although it added that its units were selling for cheaper prices.Toll Brothers’ shares jumped 14.4 per cent to $23.42 and gave a boost to others in the sector.DR Horton gained 2.6 per cent to $13.45, while Lennar rose 4 per cent to $13.52.There was some optimism on consumer activity after department store Macy’s kicked off the retailers’ earnings season by beating earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast.The shares were volatile, however, with some concern over the company’s warning of a “very difficult” trading environment as well as the fact its forecast remains at the lower end of analyst expectations.After a brief fall during the pre-market session, the shares rose 6 per cent to $16.40 during the day.Shares inSara Lee also bounced around after the company made a narrower loss than expected after one-off charges. There was strength in North American sales, which helped boost the shares before the bell, but they subsequently fell and finished 10 per cent down at $9.72.Meanwhile, Applied Materials, which produces equipment to make microchips, reported a narrower loss than predicted on relatively strong sales. Its shares rose 3.3 per cent to $13.66.The IPO market has shown signs of life in the past few days, culminating on Wednesday with what is likely to become the biggest US offering this year from Starwood Property Trust.

The Nasdaq Composite closed 1 per cent lower at 1,973.16.Shares in Cisco recovered from early losses and rose 0.6 per cent to $22.31. John Chambers, chief executive of the IT networking company, forecast another drop in quarterly revenue, even though it announced better results than expected.Early trading was choppy as investors reacted to news on unemployment and retail sales.Figures showed that fewer people than expected claimed jobless benefits for the first time last week, but the effect on stocks was hampered by a rise in the number of people continuing to claim benefits.“The jobs data show we are going in the right direction, and that we have hit the bottom, but we think earnings are going to be the driver of the next bull market as things return to normal,” said Frank Ingarra, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds.Poor same store sales in July among 30 major retailers and mixed earnings, along with a JPMorgan downgrade of healthcare stocks, were factors in pulling the major benchmarks lower. Thomson Reuters reported a drop of 5.1 per cent in same store sales last month.However, amid the gloom, several retailers raised their full-year profit guidance.Gap, the clothing retailer, jumped after beating its forecasts for July sales and increased its outlook on quarterly profits.

Its shares climbed 5.6 per cent to $15.01.Target slipped 0.2 per cent to $41.71 after reporting lower sales than analyst estimates. The company said the dip in comparable sales from last year was in line with its own forecasts.BJs Wholesale Club, which has shown strength during the recession as customers snap up goods at wholesale prices, saw sales drop more than expected, hurt in part by lower petrol prices.

The company revealed a steep drop in new customers and a rise in the number of subscribers leaving its service and its earnings fell well short of Wall Street’s estimates.Financial shares were generally lower, although Citigroup continued its recent run and closed up 6.2 per cent at $3.80.In the insurance sector, Prudential and Allstate both fell after reporting quarterly results.Prudential easily beat analysts’ profit forecasts but failed to raise the upper end of its full-year outlook and the shares slipped 2.7 per cent to $45.63.Allstate’s shares dropped 3.4 per cent to $27.27 after it missed Wall Street’s expectations, suffering from unexpectedly high pay-outs following recent storms in the southern states.Elsewhere Comcast, the cable company, was able to cut costs sufficiently to bring quarterly profits above analyst estimates. After a warning that the company was seeing a continuing slowdown in the growth in new customers this quarter, the shares slipped 0.1 per cent to close at $15.05.Rival satellite television provider DirecTV’s stronger-than-expected revenues failed to translate into a rise in profits after one-off charges.

29;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-08-03T23:02:49Z;AIG names former MetLife head as chief executive;;American International Group has filled one of the hottest seats in corporate America, naming Robert Benmosche, a former head of rival insurer MetLife, as chief executive.The appointment of Mr Benmosche, who left MetLife in 2006, fills one half of the void left when Ed Liddy, AIG’s current chairman and chief executive, decided to leave the government-controlled insurer after less than a year in charge.AIG is still looking for a chairman, whose primary job will be to manage the troubled company’s fractious relationship with the Obama administration, lawmakers and regulators.Mr Liddy, a former head of Allstate, the insurer, and director of Goldman Sachs, is leaving partly because of the constant barrage of criticism from lawmakers and regulators over AIG’s use of billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money.Mr Benmosche will have to steer AIG through a complex series of disposals aimed at returning the $80bn in funds the insurer owes the US government while trying to salvage at least part of the once-sprawling company.“We will focus on this mission: maximising the value of the company’s assets and meeting all of our stakeholder obligations,” Mr Benmosche said on Monday.One of Mr Benmosche’s first tasks will be to lead negotiations with his former employer over the sale of American Life Insurance Company, one of AIG’s crown jewels. As first reported by the Financial Times last month, MetLife is in talks to buy Alico in a deal that could raise around $15bn for AIG.AIG has not said how much Mr Benmosche would be paid but Mr Liddy said his successor would earn more than the $1 a year he himself accepted to defuse a political furore over executive pay at bailed-out financial groups.The pay package awarded to Mr Benmosche will be closely scrutinised by Congress and regulators.The appointment, which is believed to have been approved by the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve, will lead to the departure of Paula Rosput Reynolds, AIG’s chief restructuring officer. Ms Reynolds – a close ally of Mr Liddy’s – was the leading internal candidate for the top job.Mr Benmosche joined MetLife in 1995 from PaineWebber, the investment bank, and became CEO three years later. He was credited with changing the company’s sleepy corporate culture and overseeing its transformation from a mutual company into a listed entity.Since leaving MetLife, he had remained on the board of Credit Suisse, which he joined in 2002.

The Hartford Financial Group said on Friday it would take its full $3.4bn allowance.Six big US life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries gained approval to receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds in May, after concerns grew about the financial stability of the sector.However, four of these groups turned down the funds after raising capital through other routes – Principal Financial, Prudential Financial, Allstate and Ameriprise Financial.The US life industry has been hard hit by a combination of tumbling stock and bond markets, which have hurt the value of investments, and the high cost of making good on guarantees promised to individual policyholders in variable annuity products.These are long-term savings products where the consumer is able to reap some of the benefit from rising investment values, but is protected against steep declines.Lincoln said on Monday that it intended to pay $1bn of the proceeds of its capital-raising exercise into its principal insurance unit, The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, and keep the remaining $1bn for general corporate purposes, including repaying short-term debt.“These actions supplement dividend reductions, cost cuts, and other actions previously taken to strengthen the company’s capital,” Lincoln said.The company will issue $600m of new shares in a public underwritten offering and up to $500m of senior debt.The sale of its Lincoln National UK life insurance operations to Sun Life Financial of Canada has already secured about $320m in its capital raising efforts.Both the Sun Life and Lincoln National operations in the UK are in effect closed books of life assurance business, which means they sell few new policies.However, such businesses can still generate strong cash flows, which has attracted some colourful entrepreneurs to the sector in the UK to buy up such businesses.Sun Life said the deal would increase its UK assets under management by about 60 per cent to £10.6bn ($17.2bn) and add between C$0.08 and C$0.10 to earnings next year.“The combined operation is expected to generate attractive returns and serve to position Sun Life for future growth in one of the world’s largest life insurance markets,” said Donald Stewart, Sun Life chief executive.
31;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-05-16T01:43:12Z;Life assurers to receive bail-out cash;;Life assurance groups with banking subsidiaries will receive billions of dollars in US government bail-out funds, officials confirmed on Friday, a move experts hope will damp concerns about the financial stability of this sector.Six companies have been approved for capital injections: Hartford Financial Services, Prudential, Allstate, Ameriprise, Lincoln National and Principal Financial, although Ameriprise turned down the money on Friday. Officials said the insurance groups could receive much of the $22bn (£15bn) remaining in the capital purchase programme, part of the wider $700bn troubled asset relief programme, but cautioned that not all the money would necessarily go to them.“This has the potential to be a meaningful, material contribution to capital for certain companies,” said Kevin Ahern, an analyst at Standard and Poor’s, the credit rating agency.The companies eligible for bail-out funds all own or have recently acquired banks. They applied for capital months ago and received approval through the normal process for bank recapitalisation. Nonetheless, the capital injections, which can be used to support their insurance operations as well, come as policymakers are paying increasing attention to risks emanating from the life assurance sector, as well as property and casualty insurers and pension funds.Officials have no specific or immediate cause for concern. But while they think they have a very good handle on risks within the banking system following the stress test of the top 19 US banks, they are less confident that they have identified all the dangers within the insurance and pension industries.Insurance groups are regulated state-by-state by 51 regulators, meaning that federal authorities do not have as good a line of sight into their operations as they do with the biggest banks.Moreover, they operate under actuarial principles that allow them to smooth their operating performance and do not need to mark all their assets to their current market values – practices that make them less vulnerable in the short term to market disruptions but also mean that problems may take longer to come to the surface.Opinions differ on how opaque these groups are. Matt Carroll, a second analyst at S&P, said there was “pretty good visibility in real time on both the asset side and liabilities side”.Nonetheless, a number of policymakers believe that if there is a further relapse in the financial system, it is more likely to be caused by problems at the insurers than at the banks.Many life assurance groups issued a lot of annuities that offered clients the better of a fixed return or a rise in the stock market. Analysts suspect that some of these were imperfectly hedged. Meanwhile, life assurance groups – and other insurers, as well as pension funds – face losses on their portfolios of commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate whole loans and corporate bonds.In a report published in February, S&P said the economic downturn would put “unprecedented stress” on these portfolios. Since then, analysts have become even more concerned about commercial real estate loans in particular.Lower credit ratings and counterparty concerns in turn have raised the cost of financing for life insurers and made it harder for them to raise capital if needed to shore up their finances.The rally in the stock market since its March lows has provided a strong boost to life assurance companies, other insurers and pension funds. But concerns about asset quality remain.Life assurers are historically very stable, with predictable outgoings and a strong cash flow from the sale of new business. However, in theory at least, they could be vulnerable in extremis either to a funding crisis or to a fear-induced rush to cash out policies with surrender values early.Life assurers do not have access to Federal Reserve liquidity, though their banking subsidiaries do.With defined-benefit pension funds, meanwhile, the main danger is that large accumulated losses could create a need for large top-up payments from the sponsoring companies. That would put a drag on profits, in effect forcing an increase in corporate saving that is likely to come at the expense of some investment, sapping growth. Losses on defined contribution plans fall directly on households.In depth: US banks

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
33;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-05-08T16:57:35Z;David Schwartz: Monday afternoon blues;;"What a funny year 2009 is turning out to be. Many investment funds are struggling to turn a profit. But many small investors are making oodles of money. It is often the other way around.The indices explain why. Thanks to last week’s rally, the FTSE 100 finally crept slightly above the breakeven line for 2009. This is the arena in which institutions must concentrate because of their need for large liquidity pools.By contrast, the FTSE Fledgling index, which tracks the 197 smallest UK-listed companies, hit its bear market low on December 5 and has been rallying ever since. It has gained a whopping 41 per cent since the start of the year.Some investors blame banks for the Footsie’s underperformance. They are wrong. Banks currently have a low index weighting. The Footsie’s problem is more widespread. Just one in five of all FTSE 100 companies gained more than 10 per cent since 2009 began. Double this figure for the fledglings. Some fledgling gains were eye-popping. Advances in excess of 100 per cent were turned in by almost two dozen small companies since the year began.My own trading has been profitable in recent months because of my small company focus. A 1940s American bank robber once remarked that he robbed banks because “that’s where the money is”. His comment obviously pre-dated the current banking crisis. Even so, I follow the spirit of his advice.One issue that concerns me is the huge level of Monday morning trading triggered by weekend press comments. This is a perennial issue but recent volume spurts for some shares are larger than I have ever seen. Some investors appear to be blindly following weekend press leads without thinking through the consequences of their actions.I fear that many Monday morning trades are money-losers.Monday traders often forget that marketmakers read the same weekend newspapers. Opening price quotes are frequently boosted and then reduced later in the day after buying volume tapers. The result is that many Monday morning trades are in the red by the end of the day.Another point often ignored is the trading philosophy of the weekend columnist. My column last week about Innovation Group is a good example. The company is involved in a legal wrangle with one of its clients, the Canadian insurance affiliate of US giant Allstate.I gave little weight to this issue last week for two reasons. I assumed that worried investors had already fled when news of the conflict broke. I also thought it curious that Allstate continues to do business with Innovation. My conclusion was that the litigation posed no significant short-term threat.Things might change in a few months or years from now if and when the conflict comes closer to trial. But I am a short-term trader and will be long gone by then. A longer-term investor might have a different perspective about Innovation.The moral of the story is an obvious one. Think twice before rushing on Monday morning to follow someone else’s lead.Turning to my recent trading activity, I made a speculative bet last week on Sinclair Pharma. I usually avoid long shots, especially if there is a wide gap between the bid and ask price. But the Fledgling index has been red hot lately so I decided to chance it.Sinclair shares were badly beaten in the last two years, losing more than 90 per cent of their value at one point. The City feared the company would run out of cash. These fears were recently addressed with a successful fundraising but no one took any notice.Private investors also have little interest in Sinclair. Daily trading volume is low and there are no recent comments to be found on any online bulletin board. This company is off everyone’s radar screen.But in spite of this lack of investor interest, the chart suggests to me that the price trend may be bottoming out.Sinclair is a niche player in the pharmaceutical industry with two dozen products in the dermatological and oral health categories. It also has a batch of new products in late-stage development.It recently broke into profit (excluding a further £3m of foreign exchange gains) and is optimistic about its future.Revenues come from three categories: licensing agreements with larger
drug companies, sales by its own sales force and independent distributors in 80 different countries. Roughly one-third of the revenue stream comes from each source.The company will issue an interim management statement on Thursday May 14. I shall read it with great interest. Licensing revenues are sporadic and unpredictable so my main focus will be on the other two more predictable revenue streams.Given that inventory de-stocking has hit many companies recently, I would not be surprised if Sinclair suffers as well. But it recently stated that revenues from third-party distributors are rising at a rapid rate.I shall judge the company to be on a long-term growth track if revenue growth from foreign distributors compensates for any de-stocking problem. Hopefully, next Thursday’s statement will shed light on this important issue.Stock market historian David Schwartz is an active short-term trader.

34;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-04-02T02:31:26Z;Carlyle withdraws from bid for Innovation;;Another approach for Innovation Group, the software group, has been called off as Carlyle, the private equity group, was forced to withdraw its offer after falling foul of Takeover Panel rules.The US-based private equity group made an approach to the insurance outsourcing software group two weeks ago about a potential offer.Innovation later confirmed to the market it had received the expression of interest from Carlyle but its inclusion in the statement of the potential price of 15p per share meant, under Panel rules, Carlyle was bound to the price as a minimum in a formal offer.On Wednesday Carlyle confirmed it had withdrawn for a minimum of six months and Innovation confirmed that the two parties had not met, nor had Carlyle started any due diligence. The news sent Innovation shares down more than 30 per cent.However, Carlyle, which estimated in its proposal letter that Innovation needed a £10m ($14m) cash injection, said it could return if Innovation undertook a fundraising or more than 20 per cent of the group’s share capital.“Do they need a fundraising to be properly capitalised? Absolutely in my view,” said Ian Spence, of IS Research. “First half working capital is going to be poor as they’ve already said they’re going to see cash outflows. In my view it’ll see them in a net debt position.”Innovation has repeatedly attracted private equity interest in recent months. The group rejected a series of informal approaches of about 15p-20p, thought to be from HgCapital and Silver Lake Partners, in December. However a deal may depend on the outcome of a C$75m (US$60m) lawsuit from Allstate, a Canadian customer.At this stage Innovation was not an “investment grade story”, said Roger Philips, an analyst at Evolution Securities. While he admitted that the recent appointment of Andy Roberts as chairman was “a step in the right direction, we are a long way from being assured in the fundamental quality of the business and the strength of the balance sheet”.
35;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-03-24T20:49:14Z;M&A returns to small cap tech sector;;Mergers and acquisitions showed signs of life in the small cap technology sector as AT Communications offloaded an underperforming subsidiary at a loss, while Innovation Group received a further bid for £100m.Shares in AT Communications rose 2½p to 14½p after it sold Rocom while its chief executive and founder, Alex Tupman, announced plans to step down.AT bought Rocom in August 2006 for £17.6m to engineer a “step change in scale” but has proved to be a thorn in its side as it contributed to the group’s net debt rising from £19.5m to £22.2m at the end of June 2008.Its brokers Cenkos estimates it has consumed cash in each of the past three years, and £2m in 2008. On Tuesday , it sold Rocom for just £12.5m to Nimans Holdings, the telecom and data distributor.Mr Tupman established the company in 1999 – his initials form the first part of the company name – and will step down when a replacement has been found.Scott Kean, chief operating officer, will take over as chief executive in the interim.Meanwhile, Innovation has received a further approach from Carlyle, after it a rejected a series of informal approaches of around 15p-20p, thought to be from HgCapital and Silver Lake Partners, in December.Carlyle made its expression of interest of a bid at 15p per share, valuing the share capital at £100m, last week.Innovation said discussions were “at a very preliminary stage” and it is expected to make a decision on its next move after a trading update for the half year to March 31, due in early April.Carlyle’s bid is likely to be dependent on Innovation defeating a C$75m lawsuit from Allstate Insurance Company, of Canada. Allstate started proceedings in December against Innovation over the design and implementation of customised software for Allstate. Innovation has called the claim “speculate in the extreme” and said it would defend itself vigorously.Shares in Innovation rose 3.05p to 7.35p.
36;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;BofA stages turnround amid the gloom;;Banking stocks swung violently between spectacular losses and gains on Wednesday as traders scrambled to assess where the Obama administration’s rescue plans leave shareholders.The KBW bank index lurched from losses of as much as 7.6 per cent to gains of 7.1 per cent. The index finished 2.4 per cent higher on hopes that existing equity would at least not be wiped out altogether under further intervention from Washington.The wider market had a downbeat start to the wild session after National Association of Realtors data showed an unexpectedly steep fall in sales of previously owned homes as low prices failed to attract buyers.Yet stocks later rallied after Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, again sought to calm nerves that a leading bank would be nationalised. “He has reinforced the message,” said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The government wants to take preference shares rather than common shares because it wants to give banks an easy way out if the worst doesn’t happen.”However, a strong afternoon rally gave way to a significant sell-off in the last half hour of trading and the wider market finished in the red.Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said: “The bottom line is that we are still lacking any confidence and there is a fear factor the markets can’t seem to get rid of. On top of that, the market just isn’t buying the message coming out of President Obama’s White House at the moment.”At the end of the wild session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index all closed 1.1 per cent lower at 764.90 points, 7,270.89 points and 1,425.43 points, respectively.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, said: “People are buying on a rumour and selling on the subsequent news.”Among the volatile performers, Bank of Americaat one point was down 11.2 per cent after Merrill Lynch disclosed that ineffective internal controls had caused the bank to understate losses last year by $500m.The shares closed up 9.1 per cent at $5.16, as investors focused on the pledge from its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, that the lender would pass the government’s so-called stress test.Citigroup lost 16.9 per cent in the morning session, but rallied to stand 3.1 per cent lower at $2.52.The energy sector – down as much as 2.7 per cent in the morning session – later rallied to close 0.7 per cent lower.Although banking stocks finished higher, the financial sector overall lost ground, weighed down by insurers.Lincoln National reported its first loss in six years and slashed its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 1 cent. The shares sank 14 per cent to $11.21.The news had a knock-on effect on the rest of the life assurance sector.Prudential fell 2.7 per cent to $19.86, while MetLife lost 5.4 per cent to $22.05.Allstate shed 5.7 per cent to $17.57 after the home and car insurer also slashed its dividend by more than half, after two consecutive quarterly losses.But even though the market fell, the Vix – an index of anxiety – also eased 1.9 per cent to 44.6.Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said: “Would lower equity index prices be synonymous with a higher degree of investor fear? The answer turned out to be a resounding ‘no’.”Earlier in the session, the market had sold off heavily after investors overlooked the speech by President Obama the previous evening and focused on data that showed home purchases fell by 5.3 per cent to an annual rate of 4.49m, the fewest since 1997. The S&P fell 1.2 per cent in the 10 minutes after the figures were issued.Homebuilders shed 0.8 per cent overall in choppy trade.Industrials was the worst performing sector of the day, off 2.9 per cent overall. Boeing lost 4.3 per cent at $33.91 and Lockheed Martin 5.4 per cent at $70.46.Telecommunications was the only sector to find positive territory after JPMorgan analysts upgraded their view of AT&T to “overweight”.“Wireline guidance assumptions are conservative,” they wrote. The shares bucked the downward trend, up 2 per cent to $23.71.
37;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-02-05T18:26:25Z;RBS scraps sale of UK insurance operations;;Royal Bank of Scotland has scrapped the sale of its UK insurance operations, almost 10 months after it put the businesses on the block in an effort to raise capital.RBS said on Thursday it had ended the discussions after concluding that a recent joint bid from buy-out groups BC Partners and Apollo, working with Patrick Snowball, the former head of Aviva’s UK arm, which would have valued the whole operations at £5bn ($7.3bn), did not value the business highly enough.RBS executives had doubts about the structure of the deal, which would have left the bank with a large minority shareholding, and about the ability of the private equity groups to finance their offer.The decision marks another reversal of RBS’s previous strategy by Stephen Hester, chief executive, who took over last year after the bank received a £20bn capital injection from the UK government. It also underscores the bank’s renewed determination to shrink its overseas operations in order to concentrate on the UK market. Last month, Mr Hester agreed to sell RBS’s shareholding in Bank of China for about $2.4bn.Mr Hester said: “Given RBS’s broader considerations, it was important to test the market for this business, which has demonstrated that a sale on terms currently available would destroy value for RBS’s shareholders.“RBS Insurance benefits from a leading market position, strong cash generation and low capital requirements. It does not absorb funding or risk-weighted assets and is not closely connected to the credit cycle. It is an impressive, well-run business with great people and excellent customer franchises. It can play an important role as we return the RBS Group to standalone strength.”The rejection of Mr Snowball’s offer came after RBS failed to reach agreement with CVC on the private equity group’s acquiring a 51 per cent stake that would have valued the whole of the business at up to £6bn. Allstate, the US insurer, had also been looking at the assets.RBS’s insurance assets were originally put on the block with a £7bn price tag but the auction was plagued by difficulties and suffered from the early stages from a lack of competitive tension.The bank originally shut out private equity and sent the sales memorandum to eight strategic bidders, including Allianz, Zurich Financial Services, Generali, Berkshire Hathaway, Allstate, Travelers, Ping An and AIG, but almost all of these dropped out.
38;ALL;Allstate Corp;2009-01-29T22:18:38Z;Wall St falls on glum data and earnings;;"Insurers were among the biggest losers on Wall Street on Thursday as a sharp retreat led by financials ended the market’s four-day winning streak.State regulators late in the session voted down a proposal to loosen capital requirements on life insurers, sending the sector down 11.1 per cent overall and contributing to a 8.4 per cent decline in financials overall.Allstate did particularly badly among non-life insurers, hurt by worse than expected earnings that led Standard & Poor’s Equity Research to downgrade its view of the stock from “hold” to “sell”. The shares sank 20.7 per cent to $23.50, also hurt by fears that the dividend was at risk.Economic data that were worse than expected prompted investors to take profits from the market’s longest run of gains since the government rescued Citigroup in November.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 3.3 per cent at 845.14 points, near the session low and back beneath its 50-day moving average, a key technical level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.7 per cent lower at 8,149.01 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.2 per cent weaker at 1,507.84 points.Banks had enjoyed a strong rally over recent sessions amid mounting hopes that Washington would set up a so-called bad bank to take on their toxic assets and thus avoid outright nationalisation.But the financial sector – which had climbed 28.1 per cent since hitting its lowest level since 1995 last week – was the worst performing on Thursday.“There are only so many times you can rally the market on the same piece of news,” said David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch.“Just like the Tarp [Troubled Assets Relief Program] last fall, which induced a couple of huge relief rallies before recession realities and their implications for corporate profits sank back in, we are seeing the market give back part of the hard-fought gains.”Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo were off 7.1 per cent to $3.90, 8.3 per cent to $6.78 and 11.4 per cent to $18.78, respectively.The sell-off was broad-based and all 10 main economic sectors finished in the red. Telecoms was among the worst performing sector outside financials, down
3.8 per cent overall after downbeat earnings in the week.AT&T lost 4.6 per cent to $24.71 after JPMorgan analysts cut their price target to $24 and reiterated their “neutral” view.Homebuilders tumbled 9.9 per cent after US Commerce Department data showed new homes sales fell to the lowest level on record.Weighing heavily on the wider market, separate figures showed continuing claims for unemployment benefit rose to the highest level since records began in 1967, while durable goods orders fell more than expected.Among energy stocks to do badly, ExxonMobil lost 2.8 per cent to $77 after Goldman Sachs removed the company from its Americas “buy” list. The wider sector tracked the oil price lower to finish 3.8 per cent lower.A profit warning from Nintendo put video game stocks under additional pressure. GameStop, the retailer, fell 6.5 per cent to $26.32.3M, the diversified manufacturer that makes Scotch tape, was a bright spot among losses in the industrial sector.The shares added 2 per cent to $56.55 after the company unveiled a fall in profit that was not as much as expected, along with plans for a 30 per cent cut in capital expenditure.Elsewhere in industrials, tool stocks lost ground on a host of downbeat results.Among the most high profile, Illinois Tool Works fell 3.2 per cent to $33.80. Black & Decker tumbled 20.9 per cent to $30.65.Aerospace stocks came under pressure after Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook on Boeing from “stable” to “negative” a day after the aircraft maker disclosed a big order cancellation. The shares lost 5.9 per cent to $40.71.The technology sector was off 3.2 per cent overall. Dell dropped 8.6 per cent to $9.95 after Standard & Poor’s downgraded its view of the stock from “buy” to “hold”.Defensive stocks in the consumer staples, utilities and healthcare sectors outperformed the market as investor risk appetite abated."
39;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-12-21T19:15:43Z;Assured in a turbulent market;;When Edward Liddy was a young college student he would perch on a steel beam 80ft above ground without a harness or safety net.In his summer job at a construction company that built prefabricated warehouses, his role was to climb to the top of the building’s frame to ensure everything was in order. He took the job because it paid three times the minimum wage and he needed the money.“You had two days to learn. If you could not do it by day two, you were fired…there was a certain element of conquering your fears,” Mr Liddy recalls in his deadpan, softly spoken delivery.Since September, when his old friend Hank Paulson, the US Treasury secretary, plucked him out of semi-retirement to become chief executive of AIG, Mr Liddy has been performing a high wire act of a different kind.The 62-year-old has to rebuild the US insurance behemoth after the near-death experience that forced the government to bail it out twice in two months – the last time, in November, with a $150bn (€110bn, £100bn) rescue package.Pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by reckless bets on mortgage derivatives, AIG had lost two CEOs in rapid succession before Mr Paulson decided on Mr Liddy.They had first got to know each other in the late 1980s in Chicago, where Mr Paulson headed Goldman Sachs’ regional office and Mr Liddy was chief financial officer of the retailer Sears, Roebuck. Years later, when Mr Paulson ascended to the top of Goldman, he appointed Mr Liddy to the bank’s board.But even with Mr Paulson’s backing, Mr Liddy’s task is daunting. He must resurrect a company that Hank Greenberg had built into a corporate titan that made $100bn a year in revenues and has since become the epitome of the excesses that caused the financial crisis.Mr Liddy, a former CEO of Allstate, the insurer, has to oversee a vast programme of disposals in order to repay the government and persuade it to sell its 80 per cent stake in AIG.But he also has to run the operations AIG wants to keep – whose $40bn in sales outstrip the turnover of Allstate and many other rivals – in the hope of restoring the company’s fortunes as an independent, albeit much smaller, entity.“The challenge, in a nutshell, is: how do you keep people in the on-going businesses motivated, calm and focused while at the same trying to sell assets and [all] in a fairly turbulent market?” says Mr Liddy, speaking in the executive library of AIG’s austere building in downtown Manhattan.“Fairly turbulent” is a decidedly understated description of capital markets and economies that have not been in such bad shape since the Depression. But then Mr Liddy seems to take a glass-half-full attitude to many things. Avuncular and low-key, he does not appear fazed by the pressures he is under. “When you run a large organisation, you have to be optimistic,” he says.Does he ever despair? “I have my good days and bad days,” he replies, unperturbed. “Some days you can’t breathe because the challenges are so tough and overwhelming…but despair is too dark a word.”Mr Liddy maintains his stoic attitude when reminded that AIG and its management have become whipping boys for politicians keen to castigate the financial industry’s reliance on taxpayers’ money.“I understand that we live in a political world,” says Mr Liddy. His first business mentor was Donald Rumsfeld, who as head of G.D. Searle, the pharmaceuticals company, recruited Mr Liddy in the late 1970s. “The American people are nervous. They are uncomfortable with what is going on in the economy and when that happens it is very predictable that people lash out,” he says.But he argues that AIG is different from other financial groups. “We are the only company that has said we are going to repay all the money the government invested in us…and to do that we are going to sell some of our rock-solid assets.”Phil Purcell, the former Morgan Stanley CEO who worked with Mr Liddy at Sears, Roebuck, says his skills are badly needed at AIG. “Ed’s two outstanding qualities are his objectivity and his honesty. What AIG needs right now is a leader focused on returning the funds the government injected into the company,” he says.Mr Liddy expresses confidence he will pull that feat off, in spite of having inherited a dysfunctional and disjointed company from his predecessors.“I think this organisation was built for a different era. It was built around decentralisation and to value entrepreneurship, and those are good things,” he says. “But it was not built for the contemporary era of governance and transparency. Better risk metrics, much better succession planning – that is what delineates contemporary companies…We have yesteryear’s model.”The not-so-veiled criticism of Mr Greenberg, who shaped AIG as a loose collection of independent businesses during his 37-year reign, prompts a further question. Mr Greenberg left five years ago but remains AIG’s largest investor after the government and would dearly love to buy some of its pieces: has Mr Liddy sought advice from the man who knows where all the bodies are buried?“I have not,” Mr Liddy says. “I have talked to him. I have known Hank for 15 years. I have had dinner with him but it was not necessarily: ‘What would you do in this situation?’”And then, for the first and only time during the interview, Mr Liddy shows a harder side. “I think his day has passed,” he says.His focus is on the present. “I did not grow up with much in life,” he says, recalling his modest background and the premature death of his father. “I know what it means to worry about your job and your life. It is painful to see so many of our employees thunderstruck by what happened.”Mr Liddy becomes almost lyrical when describing his reasons for taking the job, for which he is getting paid $1 this year – less than he made as a youthful construction worker four decades ago.To him, it is civic duty of the highest order. “This is my way of helping the country…It’s not exactly what I thought I would be doing in retirement [but] you have to answer the call.”
40;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-11-26T23:41:42Z;AIG to pay retention bonuses to executives;;One day after announcing strict limits on salaries and bonuses for its top tier of executives, AIG revealed that some of those executives will receive millions in “retention bonuses” next year.In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, the insurance group disclosed that Jay Wintrob, an executive vice-president, had put off receiving the first instalment of his $3m retention bonus from December to April 2009.He will receive the second instalment, originally scheduled to be paid out in December 2009, in April 2010. David Herzog, AIG’s chief financial officer, also opted for the later payment schedule.The retention bonuses for 130 key executives were disclosed by AIG in September, after the US government rescued the firm from bankruptcy by purchasing 79.9 per cent of the company for $85bn. After the government takeover, Edward Liddy, the former Allstate chairman, was named chief executive and AIG offered retention bonuses to Mr Wintrob, head of AIG’s retirement services division, among others.In October, AIG’s management was embarrassed by the disclosure that the company spent $440,000 on a weekend retreat in California for senior performers.The company announced on Tuesday that Mr Liddy would be paid a salary of $1 for 2008 and 2009, and that Paula Rosput Reynolds, who joined AIG as chief restructuring officer in October, would receive no salary or bonus for 2008.The company said the other five members of AIG’s seven-member leadership group would not receive annual bonuses for 2008 or salary increases through 2009.AIG also said that the company’s senior partners, about 60 executives, would not earn long-term performance awards in 2008, not earn salary increases in 2009, and that the group’s annual bonuses would be limited.An AIG spokesman said on Wednesday that retention bonuses were different from the annual bonuses included in Tuesday’s statement. In September, Mr Liddy pledged to sell off significant portions of AIG’s international operations in order to pay back the government loan. The company said at the time that retention bonuses would be necessary to maintain continuity and value at various AIG units.“Retention bonuses are a better alternative for the repricing of option awards so long as they are reasonable, fully disclosed and truly needed to retain talent,” said Richard Ferlauto, director of corporate governance and pension investment at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union.“But in this market we don’t see much clamour for executives who made big bets, cannot make risk and were paid more than they are worth,” he added.
41;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-11-21T23:22:49Z;CVC enters exclusive talks for Direct Line;;The sale of Direct Line has reached a critical point after CVC entered into exclusive negotiations with Royal Bank of Scotland, which has put its insurance assets on the block with a price tag of up to £6bn ($9bn).CVC is understood to have been granted a period of exclusivity to acquire a 51 per cent stake in RBS’s insurance businesses, which include Direct Line and Churchill. CVC’s bid is fronted by Fred Watt, the buy-out group’s chief operating officer, and former finance director of RBS’s insurance operation.RBS is hoping to achieve a sale price of up to £3bn for the controlling stake.The buy-out group, which is working with Swiss Re, the world’s biggest reinsurer, had been hoping to buy the business for less, given RBS’s urgent need for cash.Swiss Re could also reinsure a portion of Direct Line’s policies as part of the deal.However, the bank which was last month bailed out by the UK government, may still decide to keep the business, particularly if its ambitious valuation for the business cannot be reached.Allstate, the US insurer, is still interested in the business and has yet to formally withdraw from the bidding. Its hand has been strengthened recently by the slump in the value of the pound.Patrick Snowball, the former head of Aviva’s UK insurance arm, is still talking to private equity groups about forming a consortium. But this is at an early stage, and with credit markets seized up, financing remains a challenge.The auction has been plagued by difficulties since it was kicked off in April. RBS had originally shut out private equity, and sent the sales memorandum to eight strategic bidders, including Allianz, Zurich Financial Services, Assicurazioni Generali, Berkshire Hathaway, Allstate, Travelers, Ping An and American International Group. But almost all of these dropped out.CVC’s bid, with RBS holding the remaining 49 per cent of the assets, could be less palatable to shareholders than a clean sale.
42;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-11-14T23:28:43Z;Snowball eyeing RBS’s insurance business;;Patrick Snowball, former head of Aviva’s UK arm, is eyeing Direct Line amid continued doubts about Royal Bank of Scotland’s ability to offload its insurance businesses.Mr Snowball has been talking to private equity groups, including BC Partners, which has a possible interest in Royal Bank of Scotland Insurance, which includes Direct Line and Churchill.The situation is complicated by the fact RBS is in advanced talks with the private equity group CVC, which is working with the reinsurer Swiss Re about CVC buying a 51 per cent stake in the business – a deal that could value RBSI at about £6bn.A person familiar with the situation said: “It would be premature to talk of an imminent bid for RBSI by BC Partners and Snowball.”Although CVC is in pole position, recent reports have suggested that it could be looking for a price below the implied £6bn originally suggested. Allstate, the US insurer, also remains in the race, with its hand strengthened by the sharp fall in the pound against the dollar.Allstate had been the only serious bidder, in part because RBS initially shut out private equity groups from the auction over concerns that they would not be able to raise the necessary finance amid the collapse of global credit markets.However, the bank was forced to let buyout firms into the auction after a lack of competition in the process created by strategic bidders – including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group, Zurich Financial Services and Generali of Italy – walking away over the summer.Mr Snowball was at the helm of Aviva’s non-life insurance operation, which trades under the Norwich Union brand.He quit Aviva after he lost out on the group chief executive’s job. He joined Towergate, the privately owned insurance broker, where he was seen as being a conduit to private equity involvement. However, he stepped down from Towergate’s board earlier this year after a stock market flotation was postponed.He remains chairman of Towergate Financial Services, which is consolidating the regional independent financial adviser market.BC Partners and Mr Snowball declined to comment.

Its role could take the form of re-insuring some of the policies that RBS Insurance writes. It could also participate in the equity portion of any potential deal.This would mirror a similar deal between Munich Re and Admiral, the motor insurer. Munich Re has had a longstanding re-insurance arrangement with Admiral.CVC is competing for Direct Line with Allstate which tabled a bid for the assets earlier this year. The US insurer had been the only serious bidder, in part because RBS initially shut private equity groups out of the auction over concerns that they would not be able to raise the finance for the bid amid the collapse of global credit markets.A third party, which has not yet been named, is also interested in bidding for RBS insurance assets.The structure of CVC’s bid, which would involve offloading only part of Direct Line with RBS holding the remaining 49 per cent of the assets, could be less palatable to shareholders than a clean sale. It could also raise less money for RBS which participated last week in the government’s £37bn bail-out scheme.The bank had to let buyout firms back into the auction after a number of strategic bidders – including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group, Zurich Financial Services, and Generali of Italy – walked away over the summer.

Ford, whose rating S&P may also cut, dived 21.8 per cent to $2.08. The duo have already reported declining sales and JD Power and Associates warned on Thursday world-wide automotive demand could “collapse”.The market had earlier swung from losses to gains but major indicies dived beneath yet more psychologically significant barriers in heavy selling towards the close.The S&P 500 closed down 7.6 per cent at 990.92. Its longest losing streak in 12 years has taken the index’s decline since the collapse of Lehman Brothers to more than a quarter.“It’s just relentless, day in day out, regardless of the news,” said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rydex.The Dow Jones Industrial Averages sank 7.3 per cent – its biggest percentage decline since 1987 – at 8,579.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 5.5 per cent lower at 1,645.12.Traders said that shorting was not in large part responsible for the heavy losses, in spite of the SEC’s lifting of the ban before the session began.Energy and financials led the declines, each down by more than 11 per cent.Insurance company XL sank 53.8 per cent to $4.01 while Allstate fell 8.2 per cent to $27.50 after losses of more than a fifth in the previous session.Hartford Financial lost 19.1 per cent at $20.11 after UBS slashed its price target from $70 to $26 and on speculation that talks between it and Metlife had fallen through. Metlife, which priced new shares at a discount during the previous session, found positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $28 after heavy losses on Wednesday.Investors were also examining reports that the US government could take stakes in banks. Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, on Wednesday stressed that rescue legislation allowed the authorities to recapitalise financial institutions.Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley fell 25.9 per cent to $13.32 and 25.9 per cent to $12.45 respectively. Bank of America stood 11.2 per cent lower at $19.63 while JPMorgan rose 2.1 per cent to $40.14.Federal litigation on the dispute between Citigroup and Wells Fargo over the fate of Wachovia was extended by two days. Citigroup lost 10.2 per cent to $12.93 while Wells Fargo sank 14.6 per cent to $27.25. Wachovia dropped 28.9 per cent to $3.60.National City had earlier bucked the downward trend but closed down 3.6 per cent to $2.15 on reports it might sell itself. Energy producers were sold off sharply as oil fell below $85 a barrel on heightened fears of global recession. ExxonMobil lost 11.7 to $68Materials earlier found positive territory but later closed down 6.9 per cent. Steel stocks were hit after Goldman Sachs cut its steel price forecast by 29 per cent, due in part to the slowdown in emerging markets and cut its recommendation on a slew of stocks.Technology had clung onto gains for much of the session, rising as much as 3.3 per cent, but later also succumbed and was down 3.4 per cent by the close.Earlier, relatively positive results from technology bellwether IBM provided a glimmer of hope that corporate earnings may not be as dire as the worst five-day sell-off for stocks since 1987 had implied.IBM, which also reaffirmed its profit forecast, fell 1.7 per cent to $89 after earlier gains.Quest Software jumped 5.1 percent to $11.12 after the group unveiled plans plans for a $400m share buy-back.Elsewhere, Abercrombie & Fitch continued a string of poor performances in the retail sector with a sharp drop in like-for-like sales last month. The shares tumbled 14.8 per cent to $27.69.
45;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-10-08T20:53:25Z;US stocks slide despite rate cuts;;Wall Street stocks on Wednesday extended their worst five-day run of losses since 1987 after the co-ordinated global interest rate cut failed to calm nerves during a highly volatile session.Initial euphoria over the move dissolved and the market subsequently swung between gains and losses throughout the day. Further developments underlined concerns that the financial crisis was already hurting US companies by damping global demand and denting their ability to raise funds.Insurance stocks were particularly hard hit after Metlife became the latest big American company to announce plans to raise capital in the midst of the credit freeze. Metlife shed 26.8 per cent at $27, while peers Allstate and XL Capital sank 21.2 per cent at $29.96 and 27.7 per cent at $8.68 respectively.Similarly, Bank of America shed another 7.7 per cent to $21.95 after the group priced 455m shares at $22 each.Meanwhile, Alcoa kicked off the earnings season in downbeat fashion by announcing, after the close of the previous session, a lower-than-expected profit that sent the shares down 12.7 per cent on Wednesday to $14.59. The aluminium group has suspended its share buy-back programme.In volatile trading, the S&P 500 was by up as much as 2.5 per cent and down by the same margin.Stock futures jumped immediately after global central banks announced the cuts. “At last, a co-ordinated show of force,” said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. “The move is to be applauded but there is more to come . ”Yet the S&P closed 1.1 per cent lower at 984.86, further below the psychologically significant level of 1,000 that was breached in the previous session for the first time in five years.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent at 9,256.11, having slid by 3.7 per cent in the last half hour of trading. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8 per cent to 1,740.33.The decline came even after a slew of stocks hit new lows for the year. The overall material sector overcame Alcoa’s difficulties, up 2.6 per cent. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and US Steel gained 10.1 per cent at $42.60 and 4.1 per cent at $53.37, respectively.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped another 7.3 per cent to 57.58, the highest level since the credit crisis began.The SEC confirmed that its short ban imposed last month would be lifted last night, as planned. The index compiled by Bloomberg of stocks placed on the list fell 2.4 per cent, taking the loss since the ban was introduced to more than a quarter.Some in the market have blamed the ban for exacerbating volatility. “A lot of these liquidity providers [such as hedge funds] have just walked away from these stocks,” said Peter Bottini of optionsXpress.Legg Mason fell 13 per cent on Wednesday to $25.25, after Moody’s cut the debt rating on the money manager. American Express was among the biggest winners earlier in the session after Sanford C. Bernstein initiated coverage on the stock with a “market perform’’ rating and said the credit card group stands to increase market share. It later reversed the gains to stand 4 per cent lower at $27.12.Morgan Stanley – which sank as much as 39.9 per cent in the previous session on speculation that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group’s planned $9bn investment might not materialise – rose 4.8 per cent to $16.80. Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi reiterated that the deal would go ahead.Bank of New York Mellon climbed 7.9 per cent to $24.45 after agreeing to buy JPMorgan Trust Bank in Japan.Elsewhere, a host of retailers disclosed poor September sales. Escaping the declines, defensive stock Wal-Mart eased 0.5 per cent to $54.55 after the discount retailer was one of the few to report a positive like-for-like performance.Office Depot was one of biggest drags on the S&P, sinking 18.8 per cent to $3.67 after Credit Suisse cut its “neutral” recommendation to “underperform”.In automotives, Ford and General Motors shed 8.9 per cent at $2.66 and 8.6 per cent at $6.91 respectively – even as oil slid – after Citigroup cut its recommendation on the duo from “hold” to “sell”.
46;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-09-17T18:45:17Z;Rescue kickstarts sale of AIG assets;;The US government’s unprecedented takeover of AIG and its extension of an $85bn loan aimed at staving off imminent bankruptcy will place some of the strongest assets in the insurance business on the market.The two-year bridge loan from the Federal Reserve, made at a punitive interest rate, is supposed to be repaid as early as possible. It is expected to kickstart the sale of AIG’s businesses and the complex task of unwinding billions of dollars of derivatives trades.“AIG has accumulated some of the best assets in the insurance business and should be able to get significant value,” said Bijan Moazami, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. He said a n estimate of the company’s break-up value was “well over $150bn [€107bn, £85bn]”.AIG’s shares fell sharply on Wednesday, down 45 per cent by midday in New York, to $2.06. This reflects the significant dilution to AIG shareholders after the Fed received an 80 per cent equity interest in the company in exchange for the loan.However, there remain numerous practical questions, not least about who will be in charge of the insurance group, once the world’s biggest insurer. One requirement from the US government was that the company’s existing management would be replaced. Many new executives are as yet unnamed. Edward Liddy, the former Allstate chief executive, will replace Robert Willumstad, the chairman brought in to replace ousted chief executive Martin Sullivan last year.“There are still many questions, not least who we should be dealing with,” said one banker.AIG is a huge multinational insurer – but unlike many other insurance companies it expanded into financial services, a division which now lies at the centre of its problems.The task of unwinding AIG’s derivatives contracts, which have a nominal value into the hundreds of billions of dollars and on which it has made billions of dollars worth of losses, is now only just beginning.One of the biggest issues for AIG – and the source of its collapse into government ownership – is the $440bn of insurance it has provided on complex debt products.Potential payouts on this insurance – made in the form of credit default swaps (CDS) on collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) – have soared following the collapse of the value of mortgages which back many of the debt products. AIG expected the insurance to be on low-risk, highly rated debt, but the securities have turned out to be high risk.In addition to these CDS contracts, AIG is a counterparty to billions of dollars worth of other derivatives, such as interest rate swaps.Dealers in the derivatives market said they believed the US government’s deal did not trigger any default, but there were still a range of legal opinions in the market, where there is no precedent for the US government’s takeover of AIG.“While there are few details so far, the deal seems to have been intentionally structured to avoid any of the buzzwords – default, receivership, conservatorship – that could trigger a credit event,” said analysts at CreditSights.AIG’s US assets could appeal to domestic rivals in a consolidating market, or foreign insurers wanting to build up their presence in the immense insurance and savings market.Warren Buffett can also not be discounted as a possible buyer for some of AIG’s assets, although Berkshire Hathaway declined to comment yesterday. Neither can interest from Maurice “Hank” Greenberg who built AIG over four decades before being ousted in 2005.Outside the US, Munich Re may be interested in parts of AIG. Nikolaus von Bomhard, the chief executive, ruled out a move for AIG’s reinsurance operations, but said it could be interested in AIG’s operations in eastern Europe. It could also be interested in niche businesses in industrial insurance.Allianz also indicated it was not interested in AIG’s reinsurance, leasing and finance businesses but might look at other units. Other big reinsurers could be interested in AIG’s reinsurance operations. AIG’s operations in Asia could appeal to a range of potential buyers, including the UK’s Prudential and Aviva. Prudential has also been on the hunt for US-based acquisitions.
47;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US to take control of AIG;;The US Federal Reserve announced that it would lend AIG up to $85bn in emergency funds in return for a government stake of 79.9 per cent and effective control of the company – an extraordinary step meant to stave off a collapse of the giant insurer that plays a crucial role in the global financial system.Under the plan, the latest dramatic intervention by the US government to combat the global credit crisis, the existing management of the company will be replaced and new executives - as yet unnamed - will be appointed. Reports on Wednesday suggested Edward Liddy, the former Allstate chief executive, will replace Robert Willumstad, the chairman bought in to replace ousted chief executive Martin Sullivan last year.Eric Dinallo, New York Insurance Superintendent, told CNBC on Wednesday morning that AIG’s assets had already attracted strong interest but that the company might need more capital. AIG shares fell heavily in pre-market trade on Wednesday and were trading down 43 per cent at $2.13.The authorities, which will retain veto power over major decisions at the company, will receive equity giving them a 79.9 per cent stake in AIG. In return, the insurer would receive a bridge loan of $85bn to keep it afloat until it could dispose of billions of dollars in assets. The Fed said the loan was expected to be repaid by the proceeds of selling AIG operating companies. A senior Fed staffer said the most likely outcome was an orderly liquidation of AIG, though it was possible that the firm could survive as an ongoing business.The loan is at a punitive interest rate of three-month Libor plus 850 basis points, giving AIG a strong incentive to repay it as soon as possible. It will be secured on all AIG’s assets, including those of its subsidiary companies.The Fed said in a statement it was acting to prevent “a disorderly failure of AIG” which would “add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance”.The issuance of the equity participation note to the government is designed to prevent existing shareholders from profiting from a rescue of the company, which has been hobbled by the losses on complex securities backed by mortgages and other assets.President George W. Bush said the rescue was “to promote stability in the financial markets”.The emergency moves came after earlier plans for a private sector bail-out were dashed by a further 21 per cent slump in AIG’s shares, reducing the market capitalisation of one of the biggest insurance companies in the world to just over $7.5bn (£4.2bn).The AIG crisis fuelled another day of turmoil on global markets on Tuesday sparked by the weekend failure of Lehman Brothers and the rushed takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. Despite the turbulence, marked by brutal conditions in European money markets, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 2 per cent on Tuesday night.“We are working closely with the Federal Reserve, the SEC and other regulators to enhance the stability and orderliness of our financial markets and minimise the disruption to our economy,” said Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary. “I support the steps taken by the Federal Reserve tonight to assist AIG in continuing to meet its obligations, mitigate broader disruptions and at the same time protect the taxpayers.”But even as the plan was being being mapped out, there were already signs of political opposition. “I hope they don’t go down the road of a bailout, because where do you stop?’’ Richard Shelby, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, told Bloomberg Television.Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat who chairs the congressional Joint Economic Committee, said: “The administration is approaching an unprecedented step, but unfortunately we are living in unprecedented times.”You have to stop to catch your breath. But upon reflection, the alternatives are much worse.’’During a day of emergency meetings at the New York Fed, the Treasury and Fed reversed initial reluctance to bail out another financial institution.In March, the Fed helped JPMorgan Chase buy Bear Stearns by providing a $29bn credit line. Earlier This month, the Treasury seized control of troubled US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.But at the weekend the authorities refused to back Lehman Brothers and encouraged Merrill Lynch to sell itself to a rival. Lehman filed for bankruptcy early Monday morning, rocking the financial system, while Merrill announced a $50bn takeover by Bank of America the same day.AIG’s plans for a private sector capital infusion were dashed by a further slump in its shares on Tuesday after sharp cuts in the insurer’s credit ratings on Monday threatened to fuel a liquidity crisis and push it into bankruptcy.Tim Geithner, president of the New York Fed, skipped the Fed’s interest-setting meeting to focus on AIG – a sign of the regulators’ heightened state of alert over the insurer’s plight.Amid increasingly desperate lobbying for government help, David Paterson, New York governor, had said the beleaguered insurer which lost billions of dollars on derivatives and mortgage-backed securities, had “a day” to solve its problems.AIG’s fight for survival came as Hank Greenberg, AIG’s former chief executive and the company’s biggest shareholder, announced he was considering a bid to take over all or part of the company.Mr Greenberg has sent a letter to AIG’s board and its chief executive, Robert Willumstad, complaining about its refusal to take up his repeated offers to help the company group he ran for decades.In a letter published in Wednesday’s Financial Times, Mr Greenberg urged the US government to step in to provide a loan if private lenders could not be found. He said AIG needed a temporary bridge loan in order to prevent further ratings cuts “which would likely prove fatal” and “pose systemic risk to the US and international financial systems”.
48;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-08-13T08:25:39Z;RBS fails to offload Australian and NZ assets;;Royal Bank of Scotland’s efforts to offload businesses suffered a setback on Wednesday when the UK banking group scrapped the sale of its operations in Australia and New Zealand after the last remaining bidder dropped out.Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s biggest mortgage lender, blamed uncertainty in world financial markets as it withdrew from talks to buy the business.RBS, which acquired the businesses through its role in the break-up bid for ABN Amro, the Dutch lender, had earmarked them for disposal as part of a programme designed to boost its capital reserves by £4bn ($7.5bn).However, RBS said the decision to keep the assets, valued by analysts at up to A$1bn (US$870m), would have little impact on its balance sheet ratios because it was not expected to generate a large capital gain. Executives are now reviving plans to integrate the Australian and New Zealand businesses in RBS’s global investment banking operations.Nevertheless, the scrapped sale underlines the difficulties facing banks that are seeking to raise capital by selling subsidiaries. RBS is already facing questions about the sale of its UK insurance operations after several bidders dropped out.Allstate, the US insurer, has made an offer for the business, which includes Direct Line and Churchill. However, the bid is below the £7bn price tag put on RBS Insurance when it was put up for sale in April. Allianz and Travelers showed interest earlier in the auction, but Allianz said last week that it had “refrained from making an offer”, and there are doubts about Travelers’ commitment to the process.Last week Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS chief executive, said the insurance operations were still up for sale but insisted the bank would not sell at any price. Shares in RBS dropped 15¾p, or more than 6 per cent, to close at 229¾p.CBA’s withdrawal comes only three weeks after the bank said it was in exclusive talks with RBS for the businesses, and follows National Australia Bank’s exit from talks at the end of July. Nomura, the Japanese bank, dropped out of talks months ago.Speaking as he delivered the bank’s full-year results on Wednesday, Ralph Norris, CBA’s chief executive, said the recent write-downs announced by NAB and ANZ had damaged the reputation of Australian banks, making it more difficult to raise funds in the international wholesale markets.
49;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-08-01T22:32:09Z;Allstate eyes RBS insurance assets;;Allstate, the US insurer, was on Friday expected to submit a bid for Royal Bank of Scotland’s insurance arm, put up for sale in a multi-billion pound auction.The expected offer for RBS Insurance, which includes Direct Line and Churchill, is a fillip for a bank that could next week report the biggest loss in recent British banking history.Allstate was expected to submit a bid by the deadline for second-round offers, which was set at the end of the day yesterday. But its offer was likely to be pitched below the £7bn price tag attached to the insurance businesses when they were put on the block in April.The US insurer may also be the only serious bidder for the assets, with a lack of competitive tension raising questions about whether RBS will ultimately sell its insurance businesses.Allianz, the German insurer, and Travelers of the US, submitted first-round bids. Doubts have intensified about their commitment.Some banking analysts expect the sale to be shelved but RBS has insisted it is still on track, with the intention of announcing a deal in September.RBS needs to raise £4bn by disposals to reach its target capital ratio. It expects to achieve that amount by the year end. The bank has already raised about £1bn by the sale of a stake in Tesco Personal Finance and its sale of Angel Trains.The bank has said it wants to have a core equity tier one ratio – a measure of financial strength – of 6 per cent by year end. But it may not reach this level in its interim results due to be published next Friday.Some observers reckon that the Tesco deal could give the bank more leeway about the price it accepts for the insurance assets.These developments take place as the UK’s second-largest bank, which completed a £12bn rights issue to restore its battered balance sheet, is expected to take writedowns of £5.9bn on its structured credit portfolio which will wipe out profit in the first half.Analysts expect RBS, which made £5bn in the first half last year, to report losses of £1bn to £1.7bn in the first half. Underlying pre-tax profit on a proforma basis is about £4.9bn.RBS is under pressure from investors who ask if there should be management change at the bank.Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS chief executive, and Sir Tom McKillop, chairman, continue to resist calls for their resignations.The bank is in the throes of recruiting a new senior non-executive director as well as two other non executives.Some investors hope the senior non-executive director might replace Sir Tom as chairman.
50;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;RBS exit from Tesco Personal Finance imminent;;Royal Bank of Scotland could announce the sale of its stake in Tesco Personal Finance to the supermarket giant as early as next week.The UK’s second-largest bank expects to raise £950m from the sale of its 50 per cent share of the personal finance joint venture, in a move that will help repair its battered balance sheet.Benny Higgins, ousted from HBOS last year as head of retail banking, is expected to be brought in by the retailer to run the operation. Mr Higgins left HBOS after implementing a controversial mortgage pricing strategy.This is one of a number of disposals planned by RBS, which wants to raise £4bn as part of plans to bolster its balance sheet.So far RBS has raised £12bn in a rights issue and sold Angel Trains, its train leasing subsidiary, to a consortium led by Babcock & Brown for an estimated profit of £200m-£300m.RBS is in talks about selling the the Australian and New Zealand assets it acquired as part of last year’s break-up bid for ABN Amro. Commonwealth Bank of Australia is seen as the frontrunner to buy the business.It is also selling its insurance operations. However Allstate, the US insurer, could be the only serious bidder for RBS’s insurance assets, raising doubts about whether the bank can offload the businesses.Final bids are due around the end of this month, with preferred bidder status expected within the next few weeks.RBS wanted to raise £6bn-£7bn from its insurance arm.Most analysts think it cannot get more than £5bn, leading to increasing speculation that Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS’s chief executive, will decide to keep the business.Tesco and RBS declined to comment.
51;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-07-25T21:27:33Z;Investors fear worst from bank results;;When the UK bank reporting season kicks off this week, investor fears will be focused on just one thing: the threat of more capital raisings.Although four of the country’s biggest banks, including HBOS and Barclays, have raised about £21bn to repair battered balance sheets through rights issues and placings, analysts are questioning whether this is enough.Tom Rayner, banks analyst at Citigroup, says he is “increasingly concerned” that the big amounts raised will be insufficient to cushion losses from a forthcoming UK recession that will see spiralling consumer and corporate bad debts.Alex Potter, analyst at Collins Stewart, says: “This results season is likely to be characterised by a myopic obsession with the balance sheet and capital ratios.”If the UK economy deteriorates, banks will have to set aside more capital against rising bad debts as mortgage arrears rise and large corporates lurch into difficulty. Even Barclays, which has been diversifying in recent years, derives almost half of its profits from the UK. For Lloyds TSB and HBOS, the proportion is much higher.But the banks are also exposed to the slowing US economy, particularly Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns Citizens in the US, and HSBC, which wrote down $12.2bn on its North American unit last year.The question is how bad it will get. Investors are braced for the worst. Bank shares are pricing in a severe economic recession plus further writedowns on structured credit portfolios.The FTSE All-Share banks index has fallen 35.5 per cent over the past year. Some banks have suffered even more, with HBOS and Alliance & Leicester both falling 67 per cent during the past 12 months.Citigroup analysts are predicting a UK recession in the second half of this year, which will depress bank earnings until 2010 at the earliest.Mr Rayner estimates that in a “worst case” scenario, banks will have a £24bn capital deficit if the UK were to face a 1990s-style recession, assuming bad debts at mortgage lenders rise to a similar level to 1992.In such a scenario Citigroup believes that to maintain a core equity tier one ratio of 6.5 per cent – now seen as the industry benchmark of adequate capital – Barclays might have to find an extra £9bn.It says HBOS might have to raise £3.4bn of additional capital. Even Lloyds TSB, which is seen as well capitalised, might have to raise £1.9bn of additional equity. It estimates RBS would need to raise a further £9bn.Michelle Brennan credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s says the rating agency does not expect to see significant increases in loan loss provisions for the first half of 2008.“But we expect to notice early signs of rising delinquencies, tighter underwriting, slower loan growth and increased resources in credit units and therefore the expectation of higher impairments,” she says.Many are cautious about forecasting earnings, given the current volatility.“It is difficult for analysts to forecast earnings at the moment as no one believes the numbers,” says one banker. “Banks were being valued on a price/earnings basis and that has now changed to valuing them on a price to book value basis.“But now some investors even prefer to value banks by looking at credit default swaps and what the debt markets are saying about the likelihood of these companies defaulting.”The question is how bad will it get. The results in the next fortnight will provide some insight into whether banks are seeing an upward rise in bad debts and whether consumers are starting to struggle.Unemployment is expected to tick up this year which means that consumers will start to default on mortgages and credit card debt although many analysts say this will be seen in 18 months time.They will also give some insight into whether corporate bad debts, which have been low, are starting to rise.Another key issue affecting capital is whether all banks have come clean and written down their toxic structured credit portfolios.Analysts question whether Barclays, for example, might have to do writedowns in areas such as its leveraged loan portfolio where, against net exposure of £7.3bn, its markdowns of £190m are less than 3 per cent.James Eden, banks analyst at BNP Exane, says: “Many do not believe that the level of writedowns taken by Barclays is adequate, notwithstanding the company’s constant and extremely robust defence of its methodology and approach.”If banks do need more capital, they may face difficulty in raising it. Sovereign wealth funds, the preferred route of US banks in need of capital, may be reluctant to have so much exposure to financials. Another option for banks scrambling for capital is to sell assets. But this poses certain problems given the paucity of buyers for these assets.RBS has been trying to raise £4bn in an asset sale, partly through selling its insurance operation but the auction might have to be shelved as only one serious bidder, Allstate, remains.Rights issues are also looking like a tough task in the wake of the flop of the capital raising by HBOS, which was taken up by just 8.3 per cent of shareholders, leaving billions of pounds with the underwriters and sub-underwriters. This will make investment banks wary of doing similar deals without charging higher fees for the risk involved.The outlook for the sector is also hardly an attractivebackdrop to attract funds.“We expect the decline in profitability to prove longer lasting than the credit crisis itself,” Mr Rayner says. “Involuntary balance sheet expansion, higher funding costs and the need for stronger capital ratios are likely to result in a permanently lower return on equity for the industry.”
52;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-07-11T20:01:16Z;NAB in talks to buy RBS assets;;Royal Bank of Scotland is in talks with National Australia Bank, Australia’s largest bank by value, to sell the Australian and New Zealand assets the UK lender acquired as part of last year’s break-up bid for ABN Amro.The business, which could raise as much as A$1bn ($960m), is the latest asset to be put up for sale by RBS as the bank attempts to rebuild its capital reserves, which have been stretched by the credit crisis and its role in the ABN takeover.Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Japan’s Nomura are also vying to buy the Australian investment and corporate banking units.News of the talks with NAB comes amid dwindling interest in the sale of RBS’s UK insurance operations, Direct Line and Churchill. On Thursday Zurich Financial Services pulled out of the auction process, leaving just two bidders – Allstate of the US and Allianz of Germany – in the running for the businesses, which analysts value at more than £6bn ($11.9bn).The withdrawal of ZFS has raised concerns that RBS may be forced to shelve the sale of the insurance businesses, casting doubts on its target of raising at least £4bn in additional capital from disposals. RBS insists the sale process remains on track, though the bank argues it does not have to sell if the final bids do not match its expectations.“The most likely outcome is that they hold on to these businesses for a while,” said Leigh Goodwin, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton.RBS shares on Friday fell 17.2p, or almost 9 per cent, to close at 182.7p – below the 200p level at which the bank priced its £12bn rights issue earlier this year.So far, RBS has sold Angel Trains, its train leasing subsidiary, to a consortium led by Babcock & Brown for an estimated profit of £200m-£300m. It is also expected to sell its 50 per cent share of a personal finance joint venture with Tesco to the supermarket group for around £1bn.The disposal target is a key part of RBS’s plan to lift its capital reserves. The bank has set a target for core Tier One capital – a key measure of balance sheet strength – of more than 6 per cent.A deal between NAB and RBS was flagged last month shortly after the Australian lender shelved plans to buy Citigroup’s local retail broking arm. Both foreign banks are trying to offload non-core assets to strengthen their balance sheets.At the time there was also speculation that NAB had looked at buying local rival BankWest, owned by HBOS of the UK. NAB is trying to cement its position as Australia’s largest bank in the face of a proposed tie-up between local rivals Westpac and St George. The two plan to merge in a A$14bn transaction that will create Australia’s second largest bank.

FPK analysts believe that RBS will meet its target by the end of the year even without the benefit of disposals.However, this assumes that RBS, which has written down the value of complex debt assets on its balance sheet by £5.9bn so far, does not need to take any further writedowns.A deal between NAB and RBS was flagged last month shortly after the Australian lender shelved plans to buy Citigroup’s local retail broking arm.

54;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-06-11T15:23:03Z;RBS confident on insurance sale;;Royal Bank of Scotland on Wednesday said it remained confident of selling its insurance arm for a healthy price, as the bank confirmed its trading performance had not changed since it launched its £12bn rights issue in April.Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive, said there was no need to rethink the auction, which RBS launched in May as part of an effort to rebuild its capital reserves.“We have a price in our own minds and that hasn’t changed,” Sir Fred said. “We’re working our way forward in a constructive manner, but it’s not something that we’re doing against the clock.”RBS has said it is looking to raise an additional £4bn in capital by selling businesses including its insurance arm, which operates under the Direct Line and Churchill brands. The disposals are a key part of the bank’s plan to rebuild its capital reserves, which have been stretched by the acquisition last year of ABN Amro, the Dutch lender, and losses on complex debt securities.The insurance division has attracted bids from a number of insurers, including Zurich and Allstate. However, others decided not to bid, prompting suggestions that RBS had set the price too high.Sir Fred’s comments came as RBS issued a trading update saying its first-half results would be “satisfactory”, after allowing for the losses related to the turmoil in the credit markets. It said the write-downs were expected to “remain within” the bank’s estimates of around £5.9bn.However, Sir Fred acknowledged that conditions remained uncertain. “We are open for business, but it’s not business as usual. It’s clear that things are changing out there,” he said.RBS shares, which have tumbled since the bank unveiled its rights issue, reversed early gains to stand 7.3 per cent lower at 216.2p, as bank shares generally fell amid concerns about the outlook for the UK economy.RBS confirmed that its core Tier One equity – a key measure of balance sheet strength – would be more than 5 per cent at the end of June, rising to more than 6 per cent by the end of the year. Each additional £1bn of capital raised through disposals boosted the core Tier One by 0.18 per cent, executives said.The bank said bad loan provisions had fallen in its UK consumer business, but provisions in the US had risen – largely due to deterioration in an $8bn portfolio of mortgages with a higher loan-to-value ratio than the rest of RBS’s loan book.Sir Fred said the integration of ABN Amro remained on track, and that the businesses it acquired were performing slightly better than the increased targets which RBS set earlier this year.
55;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

But the deadline was put back after two potential bidders asked for more time. Some parties, however, still submitted their bids last week.People familiar with the process said Zurich and Allstate were among those that have submitted indicative proposals. Both companies declined to comment last night.There were also suggestions Wednesday that Allianz, the German insurer, and Travelers of the US had submitted bids.The prospect of a competitive process will be a relief to RBS after a series of possible bidders walked away from the auction.RBS had been working on the assumption that Allianz and American International Group would not submit bids for the assets.Sales memoranda were sent to eight trade buyers last month. Those that were sent the information also included Ping An, the Chinese insurer, Generali, the Italian insurer, and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Last week, Generali dropped out of the bidding, while there were also increasing doubts about Ping An’s intentions. This came hard on the heels of a decision by Warren Buffett, the sage of Omaha, to walk away from the process.RBS shut out private equity early in the auction, amid the continuing difficulty in financing leveraged buy-outs.However, some bankers have suggested that private equity firms were trying to get back into the race.The wisdom of shutting private equity out of the auction has been called into question given doubts about the level of competitive tension.RBS is looking for a net £4bn from disposals, which analysts have interpreted as the bank seeking between £6.5bn and £7.5bn from the insurance businesses. RBS Insurance has a book value of £3.3bn including goodwill.Separately, the bank is expected to sell its 50 per cent stake in Tesco Personal Finance, to the supermarket in a deal worth about £1bn.

AIG is also seen as unlikely to make an offer because it is grappling with its own issues, having been hit by the credit crisis.Expectations of waning interest from Ping An come hard on the heels of a decision by Generali, the Italian insurer, to pull out of the race. Warren Buffett had already decided not to take his interest further.RBS is relaxed about how the auction is proceeding, people familiar with the process said.However, they emphasised that RBS would not sell the insurance businesses if it could not achieve what it viewed as a reasonable price for the assets.Bankers acting for RBS sent sales memoranda to a select group of eight trade buyers last month. These also included Allstate, Zurich Financial Services and Travelers.Private equity groups were shut out from bidding in the first round of the auction.Bankers said some private equity buyers were attempting to get back in the process, and weak interest from trade buyers could force RBS to reconsider its decision to exclude them.

RBS had previously excluded bids from private equity firms.Indicative proposals are due to be submitted for RBS Insurance, which includes Direct Line and Churchill, on Wednesday.Generali was one of a select group of eight trade bidders that received the sales memorandum this month and it was expected to submit a proposal.People familiar with the process had thought the Italian insurer was keen on the assets, based on its level of engagement with advisers.However, Generali has now decided not to take its interest forward, because of what it perceived as RBS’s high price expectations, according to people familiar with the process. It is also primarily interested in the international assets in the portfolio.RBS is looking for between £6.5bn and £7.5bn for the sale of all of the insurance businesses. However, some bankers and analysts believe the assets could be broken up.Zurich Financial Services is still expected to be among Wednesday’s bidders. There is uncertainty over whether Allianz, the German insurer that wants to build its presence in UK general insurance, will submit a bid, although some observers thought it remained interested.Private equity groups were shut out from bidding in the first round of the auction for RBS Insurance.Some bankers said private equity groups had already been putting pressure on RBS to receive their indicative proposals.Weakening competitive tension in the auction process could make RBS more amenable to the advances of private equity.KKR, Blackstone and Apax Partners were among those that had been hoping to participate in the auction, but were told by RBS bankers they could not submit indicative offers amid the continuing difficulty in financing leveraged buy-outs.RBS did not comment on Generali’s decision on Tuesday last night. However, people familiar with the process said that, at the time of Mr Buffett’s decision to withdraw from the race, it was relaxed about this move.The other trade bidders that received the sales memoranda were Ping An, the Chinese insurer, and US insurers Allstate, Travelers and American International Group. Allstate was also expected to be among those submitting proposals today.

To achieve this, the bank would have to sell the business for between £6.5bn and £7.5bn, according to analysts.Some potential bidders are concerned about the growth potential of the mature businesses in the portfolio, such as Direct Line, which revolutionised the insurance market in the 1980s.RBS has put its insurance assets up for sale as part of a wider plan to shore up its weakened balance sheet.

The sale is part of its plans to bolster a balance sheet weakened by mortgage-related writedowns.Berkshire, an insurance-to-sweets conglomerate, had expressed an initial interest in the business, which includes the general and life insurers Direct Line and Churchill, but said it had decided not to bid.“We have looked at it but we are not participating in the bidding,” Berkshire told the Financial Times. It declined to comment on the reasons for its decision. Interested bidders must submit initial bids by May 28.RBS declined to comment, but people close to the situation said the bank was not worried about Berkshire’s decision not to bid.Zurich Financial Services, which reported better than expected financial results yesterday, said it continued to look at opportunities that fitted its strategy and met its financial targets, but refused to comment on RBS.RBS had received more than 15 expressions of interest from trade and financial buyers but decided to ban private equity groups from bidding because of the problems in the leveraged finance markets.

Indicative proposals are due by May 28.Those potential bidders are: Allianz, Zurich Financial, Assicurazioni Generali, Berkshire Hathaway, Allstate, Travelers, Ping An and American International Group.RBS has said it is looking for a £4bn net gain from the sale of its insurance business. To achieve that, the bank would have to sell the business for between £6.5bn and £7.5bn, according to analysts.However, Fred Goodwin, chief executive of RBS, said he would not hold a “fire sale of assets”.RBS received more than 15 expressions of interest from trade and financial buyers, according to people familiar with the situation. RBS declined to comment.Last month, RBS announced that it would sell its insurance business as part of a wider plan to shore up its weakened balance sheet. The UK bank has launched a £12bn rights issue and earmarked several non-core assets for disposal.The move to exclude private equity from the bidding process highlights the continuing difficulty buy-out firms have had with deals valued at more than £1bn since the credit crunch slashed the amount of debt banks were prepared to lend.During the first four months of the year, the volume of deals announced by private equity firms collapsed by 71 per cent to $52.6bn (£27bn) – the lowest in four years, according to Dealogic, the financial data provider.The auction will highlight the power that strategic bidders have had over their private equity rivals since the onset of the credit crunch last summer.During the debt boom, private equity groups outbid strategic buyers by using large amounts of leverage. But now, companies with healthy balance sheets have been active again, financing their deals with a mixture of cash and their own shares.Trade buyers also tend to sign acquisition agreements directly, and are therefore liable for failure to complete a deal.
62;ALL;Allstate Corp;2008-03-25T19:09:00Z;Chicago’s star on the rise;;Older members of Chicago’s financial exchange community recall when their peers in New York looked down on them as unsophisticated traders in agricultural products such as pork bellies, cattle, corn and wheat.If any such sentiment still lingered in Wall Street, it will have evaporated last week after the CME Group struck a deal to buy Nymex, the New York energy exchange, for $9.4bn.The deal will make the CME – formed last year from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s $11bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade – the largest financial exchange in the world, controlling 98 per cent of US listed futures.Although the CME/CBoT deal was seen as a defensive move to ward off potential predators, it also bolstered the city’s standing, turning Chicago into a serious global player. The Nymex move has underlined that and cemented Chicago’s position as a global centre of risk-taking and risk-management.This reputation rests on its range of derivatives exchanges, with CME at the top of a scale that also includes the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options exchange, and smaller but more unique entities such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, the US’s first greenhouse-gas emissions exchange.The city also hosts the headquarters of large insurance companies such as Aon State Farm and Allstate.In recent months, while Wall Street has writhed in the agony of turbulent equity markets and an ongoing credit crunch, Chicago’s exchanges have been booming, as investors look to hedge their investments or bet on further volatility. That has augmented a trend of fast growth in options and futures trading, whose volumes are expanding by about 25 per cent a year.While the city’s financial star is on the rise, some locals say the traditional caricature was somewhat valid. “Historically, Chicago has not been very plugged into the economy of the wider world,” says Donald Jacobs, dean emeritus of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Chicago. “New York looked to Europe, San Francisco looked to Asia, while here in Chicago – being in the middle of the country – we were mainly looking at cornfields.”But that very perspective gave the city its focus. Richard Sandor, chairman and chief executive of the Chicago Climate Exchange, says Chicago’s success at establishing itself as the centre of risk management grew from the inherently risky grain-trading business, with its dependence on Midwest weather conditions.With the invention in the 1970s of financial futures – of which Mr Sandor was one of the principal architects – Chicago grew beyond its agricultural roots. Trading in products such as interest-rate futures and volatility options now dwarfs the volumes in agricultural derivatives.“New York became the home of investment capital, San Francisco the home of venture capital, and Chicago the home of speculative capital,” Mr Sandor says.While Chicago remains very much America’s second financial city, the CME-Nymex deal has reinvigorated a rivalry with New York. “It drove [former NYSE chief executive] Dick Grasso up the wall that Chicago was so successful in derivatives and he was never able to move into that world,” says a former CME board member. “As for Nymex, whatever pride those guys in New York have, they’re going to have to swallow. They’re becoming part of something else that they’re really tangential to.”Chicago’s ascent has also sparked a battle among media outlets to increase their business coverage from the city. CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN, Fox Business Network and other broadcasters are setting up operations in a new media centre on the CME’s trading floor. Business Week recently launched BW Chicago, its first monthly magazine aimed at a specific city.“Because of its markets, Chicago has some of the leading indicators that we want to focus on,” says Brian Jones, Fox Business’s senior vice-president for news.The fact that the CME secured the CBOT in the face of a rival bid from the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange helped retain the city’s role as an international centre for derivatives trading. “Had we not come together, there was no guarantee that either one of these institutions would have remained in Chicago,” says Terry Duffy, CME chairman.Many in the industry say the CME’s ability to gain a foothold in the backyard of exchange groups such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX resulted from its early embrace of trading technology and the development of new financial products.“We’re not just this little Chicago exchange any more,” Mr Duffy says. “We’ve done a lot of work as far as innovation goes, otherwise we’d still be trading butter and eggs.”
63;ALL;Allstate Corp;2007-10-25T20:57:46Z;Homeowners face shortfall for rebuilding costs;;Homeowners in California looking to rebuild or repair fire-damaged properties may face a funding shortfall because of out-of-date insurance policies, rising mortgage payments and falling house prices.Insurance agents warned that many Californians have failed to update their policies in line with the rising costs of building materials or to account for any modifications made to their homes.“A lot of people haven’t updated their policies in 30 years,” said John Sweet, a catastrophe adjuster with Allstate Insurance. “If [customers] have added a room or remodelled a kitchen that would increase the value of their home and [add to] rebuilding costs.”The abundance of land in southern California and large size of plots has seen a rise in the number of people developing their own homes.“If you built a house 15 years ago you might have $150,000 of coverage, but labour and material costs have increased since then,” Mr Sweet said.For some homeowners, rising mortgage payments coupled with rapid declines in the value of their homes will pose a similar problem.House prices have been falling nationwide, but de­clines have been particularly pronounced in California, with the median home price falling 7.6 per cent from August to September in the state’s six southern-most counties.Californians who hold so-called actual cash value policies will be reimbursed based on the present market value of their homes, which these days might be less than the value of their mortgage payments.“Anyone who has been having difficulty meeting mortgage payments, or who was already in foreclosure before the fires hit, will not be in a very good position,” said Peter Ogilvie, president of the California Association of Mortgage Brokers.Donald Wolfe, a real estate attorney at Foundation Law Group, said many people in the state were house rich and cash poor.“The insurance payments will go directly to the bank or the mortgage lender, and the homeowner might end up with nothing – no house and no money,” he said.Standard home and renters’ insurance policies in­clude additional living ex­penses, said Jean Salvatore of the Insurance Information Institute, New York.Generally, such coverage includes hotel bills, restaurant meals and living ex­penses incurred while the home is being rebuilt.Moreover, under California law holders of purchase-only loans cannot be held liable for any deficit between the policy payout and the outstanding mortgage balance.This is bad news for mortgage lenders, according to real estate attorney Kenneth Stipanov of Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps. “Any deficiency is a write-off for these guys,” he said.Dustin Hobbs, a spokesman for the California Mortgage Bankers Association, said: “While there is certainly precedent for dealing with corrections in the market, and precedent for dealing with natural disasters, there is little precedent for dealing with both simultaneously,” he said.“We will have to wait and see how things shake out and assess damage – lenders will be under pressure from investors and homeowners and will have to strike a balance between the two.”Additional reporting by Rebecca Knight in Boston
64;ALL;Allstate Corp;2007-10-23T16:41:38Z;Independent Insurance chiefs face jail;;Three former Independent Insurance executives were on Tuesday night facing jail over one of the highest-profile corporate frauds that emerged after the end of the dotcom boom.Mr Justice Rivlin will on Wednesday sentence Michael Bright, former chief executive, Dennis Lomas, former finance director, and Philip Condon, former deputy managing director, who together presided over the company’s calamitous fall from stock market darling to insolvency.The case shook the insurance industry and became a classic example of how a charismatic and domineering company founder and chief executive can end up helping to destroy his own creation.In mitigation, Ian Winter QC, for Mr Bright, said on Tuesday that Independent’s “corporate arrogance” may well have had something to do with his client’s belief that the company was “his baby”.“Many witnesses spoke of [his] brilliant and inspirational corporate ability, which gave rise to his building Independent from very modest beginnings into a major company,” Mr Winter said. “But with that brilliance came an overbearing, unreasonable dominance, a management style that was simply unacceptable.”After a trial of almost five months, the jury of seven men and three women at Southwark Crown Court found Mr Bright and Mr Lomas guilty of two conspiracy to defraud charges. Mr Condon was convicted on one count of conspiracy but acquitted on a second. Fraudulent trading charges against the men will be left on the case file.The prosecution alleged that the three men helped mask Independent’s growing financial problems between 1998 and 2001 by withholding crucial financial data from other executives and the company’s advisers, the actuaries Watson Wyatt and the accounting firm KPMG.The company collapsed in 2001, 15 years after it was founded, triggering £350m of successful compensation claims from its more than 500,000 policyholders. About 1,000 employees lost their jobs and 280 of them saw their company shareholdings totalling £370,000 become worthless.Mr Winter said Mr Bright – who broke down in tears at one point during the trial as he defended his conduct – was “out of his depth” as he attempted to deal with Independent’s difficulties. The case was about “manifest and gross incompetence and negligence, so bad as to become criminal”, but there had been no motive of personal enrichment.Lawyers for Mr Lomas and Mr Condon said their clients recognised the seriousness of the offences, but added that they had played lesser roles in the fraud.The case is a welcome and much-needed success for the Serious Fraud Office, which has been criticised over the failure of previous high-profile fraud prosecutions. The SFO spent four years investigating the Independent case.Rise and fallMichael Bright was the larger than life founder and former chief executive of Independent Insurance. Known as “Brighty”, he dominated the company, writes Andrea Felsted.Mr Bright founded Independent in 1986 after moving into insurance as a teenager with Royal Insurance, rising through the salesforce into underwriting management. He was then headhunted by Sir Ian Noble to set up from scratch an insurance arm for his investment banking boutique.Independent was born after it bought the UK arm of Allstate, the US-based insurer in 1986. Mr Bright floated Independent in 1993 and it quickly became one of the City’s favourite stocks. Profits rose rapidly and at their peak, the shares had risen eight-fold from flotation. But shrewd investors could see the cracks below the surface.In April 2001 Mr Bright stepped down as chief executive, but stayed on as non-executive deputy chairman. Independent went into voluntary liquidation in June 2001 shortly after a rescue share issue was aborted. The placing was pulled after four new reinsurance contracts, unfavourable to Independent, were discovered.Independent was also facing unquantifiable losses stemming from claims never recorded in its accounting systems. Another problem appeared to be that Independent did not set aside sufficient reserves for claims being processed.Mr Bright was declared bankrupt in August 2001 owing £5m.

66;ALL;Allstate Corp;2006-11-19T22:13:41Z;Shake-up of US insurance rules mooted;;"Attempts to allow US insurance companies to choose whether they are regulated federally or by individual states could receive a boost in the next Congress after the incoming head of a finance sub-committee said he would put the issue high on his agenda.Paul Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat, told the Financial Times he was “looking seriously” at creating an “optional federal charter”, a structure that has long been considered as an alternative to the current regulatory regime.He said: “It’s something I think we have to make a decision on. We can’t hold an entire industry captive to indecision. It’s time to face it.”The issue has long generated controversy as insurance companies are the only significant part of financial services that remain regulated state-by-state. Insurance companies argue that this is burdensome, requiring separate registration in each state and adding to administrative costs.Allstate, the Chicago-based insurer, argues that the system also does not take account of the increasing mobility of consumers. “Regulations that vary from state to state deny insurance consumers access to quality products that have been approved in one state but not in others because of different requirements,” it said in a recent position paper.However opponents of any change argue that offering insurers a choice between state and federal regulation would result in companies cherry-picking between the most lenient regimes, weakening overall oversight. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a grouping of regulatory officials from 50 states, believes insurance products are more local than banking and should remain
regulated by the states.Mr Kanjorski is expected to replace Louisiana Republican Richard Baker as chairman of the House financial services sub-committee on capital markets, insurance and government sponsored enterprises – such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing lenders.He said he had not made up his mind on whether there should be a change to the way insurance was regulated but was “open to all suggestions”.“What I am trying to do is discern whether we should have a federal charter on anything, and if we should what field of insurance should be covered, whether we should cover all fields and who would be the regulator,” Mr Kanjorski said."

UBS raised its price target on the stock from $39 to $42, saying Yahoo’s earnings results were solid across the board and its search results were more than respectable.Solid growth in Yahoo’s online-advertising business boosted expectations for Google’s quarterly earnings, due today. Google shares rose 1.6 per cent to $410.50. Ebay rose 3.8 per cent to $40.35.Higher than expected quarterly earnings from chipmaker Texas Instrument and technology products and service provider United Technologies sparked further optimism for growth in the technology industry.

The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 1.8 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.6 per cent to 2,370.88.However, gains in the wider market were checked by the release of higher than expected core consumer inflation data for March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a choppy session 0.1 per cent higher at 11,278.77 and the S&P 500 nudged up 0.2 per cent to 1,309.93.The advance came in spite of another spike in oil prices. Crude oil hit new highs after the Energy Department reported a drop in oil and gasoline inventories.The Amex oil index was up 0.9 per cent to 1,163.28.Elsewhere, Allstate led insurers higher after its first-quarter results topped analysts’ expectations as fewer catastrophes and less frequent claims helped increase profit. Wachovia raised its rating on the stock to “outperform”. The stock climbed 5.5 per cent to $54.82.Motorola slumped 6.6 per cent to $22.49 after the mobile phone maker reported a slight dip in first-quarter profit.Amgen reported higher first-quarter earnings, but revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts, pushing shares down 3.8 per cent to $68.30.Coca-Cola, which narrowly beat Wall Street forecasts with its 10 per cent jump in quarterly profit, rose 0.9 per cent to $41.69.JPMorgan Chase, which reported a 36 per cent rise in first-quarter net income, edged up 0.1 per cent to $42.62.Interest in exchange stocks continued after International Securities Exchange, the options exchange, said it was launching its own stock exchange. The move sent ISE shares up 8.5 per cent to $45.27.CBOT Holdings, the futures exchange, delivered a 69 per cent jump in first-quarter profit, but its shares reversed earlier gains to trade 3.9 per cent lower at $115.30.
68;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;US insurers call for federal disaster assistance;;US insurance regulators are poised to make detailed proposals to Congress, calling for the US government to shoulder some of the financial burden of future natural disasters.The plan has the backing of Allstate, the US’s largest listed personal lines insurer, and follows the unprecedented damage in this year’s hurricane season – expected to result in losses to the entire insurance industry of up to $80bn.It has been drawn up by a special working group of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of state regulators, and is expected to be put to a full meeting of the associationin February.Kevin McCarty, Florida’s insurance commissioner, who chairs the working group on catastrophe insurance, said he was hopeful the plan could be put before Congress in the spring. Under the current system, the US government would throw billions of dollars at the victims of August’s Hurricane Katrina “without having any rational plan to prevent this[series of consequences] happening in the future”.Calls for the national plan come amid predictions of an active hurricane season in 2006.Under the plan, private sector insurers and reinsurers would be encouraged to provide as much cover as possible for natural disasters. State or regional pools would provide cover up to a higher threshold. The final element would be a federal reinsurance mechanism whereby state pools would buy reinsurance from the federal government.However, the American Insurance Association, a trade association for property and casualty insurers, said it saw no reason for government intervention when capacity was available from private insurers.
69;ALL;Allstate Corp;2005-11-02T21:27:10Z;Tobacco lawsuit victor takes on insurers over Katrina;;As insurers began assessing their liabilities in the days following Hurricane Katrina, the identity of one claimant should have raised alarm bells.Richard Scruggs, whose seafront home in Pascagoula, Mississippi, was washed away by the storm, is a renowned trial lawyer best known for winning a $250bn (€207bn, £141bn) class action lawsuit against the tobacco industry.Within a month, Mr Scruggs had filed a lawsuit against several large insurers, including State Farm, Allstate and Nationwide, on behalf of Gulf coast residents whose Katrina-related damage claims had been rejected.The case – which followed a similar lawsuit filed by the Mississippi attorney-general, Jim Hood – highlighted the bitter dispute raging over who should pay for the estimated 275,000 homes dest-royed by Katrina. Both aim to force insurers to pay for damage caused by the 25ft storm surge that inundated the Mississippi coast, despite the industry’s claim that it is not liable for water damage. Lawyers in Louisiana are preparing similar cases.Should the lawsuits be successful, insurers would be faced with an estimated $15bn payout for flood damage, on top of the $60bn of losses already expected from Katrina. But if the insurers prevail, tens of thousands of homeowners who were not covered for flood damage will be left in financial ruin, forced to default on mortgages for homes that no longer exist and unable to afford to rebuild.The insurance industry believes it has a solid case. Flood damage has been excluded from almost all US home insurance policies for decades. Homeowners wishing to insure against flooding must take out a separate policy with the government-run National Flood Insurance Programme.However, fewer than a third of homes in the worst-hit parts of Mississippi were insured against flooding because the storm surge reached neighbourhoods that had not been flooded in living memory.The lawsuits argue that storm surge flooding should be categorised as wind damage because the water was driven ashore by the hurricane. Mr Scruggs accuses insurers of using “loopholes and deceptively written policy exclusions” to minimise their losses.Robert Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, insists there was no deception. Most policies clearly include “waves, tidal water and wind-driven water” among their exclusions. “These suits spread false hope among desperate people that clever lawyering can produce flood coverage where none, in fact, exists,” he told a Senate hearing.Mr Hartwig warns that the lawsuits could spark “an immediate national crisis in the availability and affordability of homeowners insurance” as insurers would withdraw from hurricane-prone regions and increase premiums throughout the country.Most analysts agree that the insurance industry has the strongest case, but they warn that the outcome could be swayed by the emotions of local jurors. Mr Scruggs has already sought to portray his lawsuit in populist terms as a clash between the northern financial establishment and victimised south.“I’m sure the insurance companies will send all the Philadelphia lawyers they can muster,” he says. “But frankly, this is the kind of battle I relish, because they tend to underestimate us down here.”Mr Scruggs is sure to seize on the record $38.7bn net profit made by US insurers last year and their $400m of capital to show that the industry can easily afford to make concessions.Insurers are also under political pressure from state and federal government to compromise. Haley Barbour, Mississippi’s governor, has distanced himself from the lawsuits but wants insurers to give policyholders the benefit of the doubt.Some Gulf coast congressmen are proposing that the government should take responsibility by allowing uninsured homeowners to buy into the National Flood Insurance Programme retroactively. But many US lawmakers are reluctant to sanction what would amount to more federal aid for Katrina victims on top of the billions of dollars already granted.In private, people involved in the debate predict that both the government and insurers will ultimately accept some of the cost. “It’s in nobody’s interest to see half the Gulf coast bankrupt,” says one policy expert.
70;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;America can prepare for what it cannot control;;Tom Wilson, the president of Allstate Insurance Company, delivered a speech to the Executives’ Forum of Houston last month and issued a critical warning: America must become better prepared to address the financial consequences of catastrophe. A week later, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf coast. and proved Mr Wilson prescient.The financial mechanisms we have in place to help families, businesses and communities repair, respond and recover after the onslaught of a man-made or natural catastrophe are inefficient, ineffective and insufficient. Additionally, we need to better educate homeowners, builders and emergency responders about ways we can prepare for and protect ourselves to reduce from potential catastrophes.As a leader in the insurance industry, Mr Wilson understands the costs, both human and financial, that the nation would face in the aftermath of a catastrophe. It is his business to think about the unthinkable and to calculate the incalculable.When I served as the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), it was my job to think about how America will recover from inevitable disasters and catastrophes – terrorism, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes. The numbers are staggering.If the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake occurred today, the replacement costs would exceed $400bn. The 1938 hurricane known as the “Long Island Express” missed Manhattan by less than 10 miles, killed 700 people, left 63,000 people homeless and caused more than $300m in damages. The costs today of a similar storm would be massive – easily in the tens of billions of dollars.When Hurricane Andrew slammed the Florida coast in 1992 it and caused $20bn in damages. If the storm had veered slightly north and made landfall in hit Miami, recovery costs would have easily doubled. The terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 cost $30bn, the most expensive catastrophe in history. The economic damage reverberated throughout the nation. Hurricane Katrina is expected to cause an estimated $25bn payout by the insurance industry.AlsoThe 10 most costly catastrophes in US history occurred within the past 15 years. There is little doubt that more are on the way. Already, our naming system for hurricanes and tropical storms has moved deep into the alphabet. In previous years we worried about hurricanes named Andrew, Donna and Floyd. Reports from the National Hurricane Center hint that, for the foreseeable future, we should worry about are going to also watch for hurricanes far into the alphabet with Tammy, Vince and Wilma.The National Geographic’s August2005 issue carried a feature on the frequency pace and severity of hurricanes in America entitled: “In Hot Water.” The story notes that one in five homes in Florida was damaged by a hurricane last year. The story warns that: “The mighty Atlantic conveyor belt is in high gear and sea-surface temperatures are up. That means we could be in for decades of coast-crushing hurricanes.”So what can America do to be better financially prepared and protected from catastrophe? From a financial standpoint, a backstop for families, businesses and communities is needed in the case of extraordinary catastrophic events. ­Florida and California have funds in place that deal with hurricanes and ­earthquakes. Legislation has been announced by a bipartisan team of New York legislators calling for the creation of a similar fund.Policymakers in disaster-prone states should follow the example of Florida, California and New York. States can move faster than the federal government and they should.But catastrophes are not a state-by-state problem. Hurricanes that hit North Carolina wreak havoc on New England. Earthquakes centred in ­California cause damage well into the Pacific north-west. Terrorist attacks on a single metropolitan area could easily affect a multi-state region or the nation as a whole.A national solution is every bit as important as the steps being taken in the states. That national solution should include a national catastrophe fund that would shore up private insurers in instances when truly catastrophic events occur. Such a fund would be a financially responsible way to assure the viability of the private market and its ability to provide coverage for other perils.We cannot control the ravages of nature or the savagery of mankind but we can be better prepared and better protected.

72;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-25T03:00:02+0000;Insurers prepare for a $25bn hurricane bill;;Insurers and reinsurers around the world were braced for the worst ever insured natural catastrophe, as experts said Hurricane Katrina could cost them as much as $25bn (£14bn, €20.5bn).The oil industry, through both offshore rigs and onshore refining facilities, was likely to generate the biggest losses, with the tourism sector and residential housing also set to be hit hard.Munich Re, the reinsurer, was one of the first companies to give a provisional view of its own exposure to the hurricane.A spokesman said on Tuesday that its early estimate was for a liability of up to €400m and an overall cost of $15bn-$20bn. It also said this year would be a tough one for the industry as there had already been 11 hurricanes and the annual average was ten.“This is a very active hurricane season right now and we are not at the end of it,” said Florian Wöst of Munich Re. Swiss Re, the world number two, and Hannover Re, number four, were expected to come up with estimates of their individual exposures imminently.Hurricane Andrew became the most expensive natural catastrophe in history when it hit Florida in 1992, causing $30bn of damage, though only $17bn of it was insured, according to Munich Re, the world's biggest reinsurer.The September 11 2001 terrorist attacks cost an estimated $30bn. Munich Re said last year's hurricanes Charley, Ivan, Frances and Jeanne among them cost the industry $35bn.In an initial estimate, Risk Management Solutions, a storm modelling specialist, put the insurance cost at $10bn-$25bn. But Eqecat, another modelling company, reduced its initial range of the cost, excluding oil rig damage, from $15bn-$30bn to $9bn-$16bn after it was clear New Orleans had escaped the worst of the storm.Reinsurance groups specialising in natural catastrophe coverage, such as the Bermuda-based groups Ace, XL and Partner Re, are set to be among the worst affected.Among primary insurers, State Farm, mutually owned, has the biggest primary exposure in Louisiana, with a market share of more than 27 per cent, according to Brian Meredith, analyst at Banc of America Securities. The publicly traded Allstate, whose profits were all but wiped out by last year's hurricanes, is the second biggest with a 16 per cent share of business in the region, while St Paul Travelers has 7 per cent market share.Allstate shares ended off 1.3 per cent on Monday at $57.18 and St Paul was down 1 per cent at $44.27.The scale of the losses from the hurricane could push up premiums for natural catastrophe insurance further. But it will not be big enough to reverse the cyclical downturn in overall property and casualty pricing, analysts said.

Prices continued to hover around $68 during the day.A slight lift in US oil companies’ shares helped push up the equity markets, even though some analysts said the weather might ultimately reduce earnings at some companies.“The threat of scarcity and the potential for infrastructure or throughput damage to refining should cause oil and natural gas prices to spike . . . that will likely buoy the stocks,” said John P. Herrlin, research analyst at Merrill Lynch.US shares in BP were up 0.4 per cent to $66.35, and Chevron gained 0.2 per cent to $59.51.Some other US heavyweights gained due to the storm, including housing products retailer Home Depot, which was up 1.8 per cent to $40.54.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 10,463.05. The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,212.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.8 per cent to 2,137.65.Insurance companies fell amid predictions they might have to pay out as much as $25bn for losses caused by Katrina, making the storm one of the most costly hurricanes to hit the US.Shares in Allstate fell 1.3 per cent to $57.18. St. Paul’s Travellers was down 1.1 per cent to $44.27.Analysts said insurers may not pay out fast enough to stop companies from losing business caused by hurricane damage.“Production disruption insurance usually doesn’t start until 90 days elapse from outage, so some companies could stand to lose meaningful cash flow if their facilities are affected,” said Mr Herrlin.Isle of Capri Casinos, which operates riverboat casinos in Louisiana and Mississippi, is one such company. Shares in the group fell 2.9 per cent to $23.47.Meanwhile, merger and acquisition activity continued on Monday when Intelsat agreed to buy PanAmSat for $3.2bn.Shares in PanAmSat shot up 20.2 per cent to $23.80. The newly formed company will become the largest satellite operator in the world.Meanwhile, Providian shareholders are expected to vote tomorrow on Wednesday on Washington Mutual’s $6.45bn takeover offer for the company. Although management at both companies believe the offer price is fair, some shareholders think the price is not high enough.Shares in Providian have risen almost 80 per cent over the past two years, and the takeover price represents about a 4 per cent premium to the current share price.Shares in Washington Mutual were up 1.5 per cent to $41.36, while Providian gained 1.6 per cent to $18.47.
74;ALL;Allstate Corp;2005-03-23T08:03:42Z;Trail blazing or just a long way round?;;Cornie Victor’s title at South Africa’s Absa Bank is general manager in charge of business intelligence. His job is to identify the holy grail of BI, the elusive single version of the truth, from data generated by a bank with $52bn in assets, 6m customers holding 9m accounts and 32,000 employees spread throughout 653 sites.Absa has implemented Oracle technology, with the software focused on four key areas of performance - finance, customers, resources and process. “The Oracle software acts as an enabler for us, but the software is nothing if you do not go through the whole business of interpretation,” says Mr Victor. This interpretation is the job of Absa’s BI competency centre (CC), although the bank calls it the business enablement department.Integration appears to be the key to understanding how the CC works. Before it was rolled into the CC, Absa used a balanced scorecard approach, but this was applied at a narrow tier at the top of the bank’s structure. The business units below were not integrated into the process.With a 25 strong team and a $3m budget for the programme, Mr Victor had to justify the CC with a strong business case. The choice of software was not a foregone conclusion, although Absa already ran an Oracle data warehouse. “We did look at comparative products, even though there was an obvious fit with our data warehouse,” he says.After 18 months the CC is still evolving as the bank’s own strategy changes, but previous manual processes have been abandoned.“Now we are measuring all the things we did not measure in the past,” says Mr Victor. “For years companies only measured financials and did not look at people and processes and customers.”Is Absa blazing a trail for other IT-savvy businesses to follow? Gartner, the IT consulting group, thinks so. It claims that nearly 40 per cent of large businesses using or intending to use BI have, or will have, a CC within the next year. This is based on a study conducted in North America, Europe, Australia, Japan and China.Not everyone is so sure. Ian Charlesworth, a senior research analyst at the European-focussed Butler Group, thinks that building a CC means taking the long way round the BI course.“In my opinion a CC is just a way of describing what good project managers do already,” he says. “CCs are all about specialisation, but the real challenge in BI is to get it embedded into the business. It should all be about finding points of integration between BI tools and the organisation. That conflicts with the CC view that you should create a hub.”While some companies are picking up the baton of centralised BI, dissidents such as Mr Charlesworth think this is the worst possible route. Boston-based AMR research is similarly sceptical.“For some people this is very faddish. In effect a BI CC is a proxy that says ‘we are at the forefront of innovation.’ If you have got your act together you probably already have the function, but it is known by another name such as the ERP implementation team,” says Paul Kirby, AMR research director.Gartner’s enthusiasm for the CC idea was reflected at a recent conference in Chicago, the home town of Mary Fontaine, the former IT boss at local retail insurance giant Allstate, who launched a CC in 1997.“The concept of finance was broadened to include anything that had numbers in it,” says Ms Fontaine. “We discovered that while every group within Allstate thought they had their own uniquely relevant data, in fact that information could be used and exploited by other groups.” The unit Ms Fontaine created grew during 1998 as silos of data were broken down and information was shared.The real achievement of this reorganisation is best measured by impressive cost savings as Ms Fontaine discovered duplication of software licences and overlapping systems. “A lot of the software you use within a large company is actually redundant.” Further savings came from obvious, but rewarding, projects that eliminated paper and report distribution costs. Over two years Allstate saved up to $10m in assorted costs.So was the much-vaunted CC really no more than a high-powered efficiency drive? “Yes, that is true. A CC is not really technology driven, it is about organisation and it evolves over several years to navigate around aspects of each organisation.”Today Ms Fontaine works as an independent consultant helping vendors and users to optimise their software investment.Edinburgh-based Merit Consulting concentrates on BI strategy, but after a long career with BI vendors Merit’s James Irving is not convinced by the fuss around BI CCs.“They are sometimes credited with turning round non-performing BI implementations. In my experience I have seen exactly the same result achieved through the experience and knowledge gained by that first ill-judged or poorly executed attempt. The BI CC is one way to approach the issue, but for most organisations it is overkill.”

The Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,858.56.The continuing fall in oil prices lifted the market's mood but led the S&P 500 energy sector to one of the session's weakest performances, flat on the day. It was one of just three sectors not firmly in the black.Market participants said a cocktail of other factors helped the day's performance, including relief that the Republican National Convention finished without a terrorist attack, as well as the return of many money managers who had been on holiday in late August.James Dlugosch, editor of the Rational Investor Newsletter, noted that cash positions had been growing through the sleepy summer season.Additionally, after a week of disappointing corporate news, investors were primed to welcome any profits surprises or climbing earnings forecasts.Hovnanian Enterprises rose 9.3 per cent to $38.50 after the luxury homebuilder topped Wall Street's third quarter profits expectations and boosted its forecast for the full fiscal year.Seagate Technology, which makes computer hard drives, rose 3.8 per cent to $12.32 after forecasting quarterly sales and earnings above Wall Street estimates amid stronger demand.Fleetwood Enterprises, maker of mobile homes and recreational vehicles, added 12.4 per cent at $15 after strong sales drove it to a fiscal first quarter profit of $6.7m, double Wall Street's expectations.However, the day also brought disappointment.Shares in US Airways sank 12.8 per cent to $2.05 after leaders of the airline's pilots union snubbed the company's latest contract proposal, denting the company's efforts to avoid a second bankruptcy filing.But the rest of the airline sector received a slight boost from the sliding oil price. Delta Air Lines rose 9.3 per cent to $4.48, AMR, parent of American Airlines added 0.2 per cent at $8.92, Continental Airlines gained 1 per cent to $9.67 and Southwest Airlines rose 1.4 per cent to $14.45.Insurers saw a mild relief rally as damage caused by Hurricane Frances appeared to be less than was feared. The S&P 500 group added 1.2 per cent. Allstate, the insurer and largest property casualty in Florida, rose 1.9 per cent to $47.91. Other insurers with personal lines in Florida include Chubb, up 1.6 per cent to $69.65; Hartford Financial Services Group, up 1.8 per cent to $62.34; and Safeco, up 1.3 per cent to $48.41.Netflix, the mail order video rental service, leapt 7.3 per cent to $15.41 after Newsweek reported the company had struck an agreement with TiVo, the maker of television recorders, to allow Netflix subscribers to download movies over the Internet to their TiVos. TiVo shares rose 14.9 per cent to $5.08.Tech stocks enjoyed a rebound from last week's sharp losses, triggered in part by a disappointing mid-quarter update from bellwether Intel.Cisco rose 1.6 per cent to $19.05, after it was upgraded by CIBC World Markets. The analysts cited a strong growth outlook, predicting “at least” six quarters of outperformance.But not all of Wall Street was so upbeat about techs. Texas Instruments slid 2.4 per cent to $18.71 after several Wall Street analysts made negative comments ahead of its mid-quarter update today. Rival National Semiconductor dipped 5.7 per cent to $12.42.International Game Technology added 6.1 per cent to $31.89 after a positive story in Barron's over the weekend. The financial weekly said the slot machine maker was poised to hit the jackpot thanks to new casino construction.Halliburton slid 2.2 per cent to $29.47 on reports that the US Army would move to break up its support services contract in Iraq."

77;ALL;Allstate Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
