One recent example is the Woodford funds scandal, and the role performed by its depositary, Northern Trust.The depositary has an important fiduciary oversight responsibility over the operations of a fund. It must act independently and safeguard the interests of investors.It is entrusted with monitoring custody processes; verifying the existence of fund assets; ensuring the manager is compliant with the prospectus and investment objectives; and overseeing cash flows, fund valuations, and shareholder dealings. Partly in response to the Woodford affair, greater emphasis will also be placed on monitoring fund liquidity.Unlike an auditor, where a fund is typically subject to annual review with results published several months after its year end, the depositary conducts daily oversight of a fund throughout the year.The depositary is a cornerstone of European investment regulations and acts as an extension of regulators’ oversight of the funds industry. Regulators expect the depositary to escalate significant issues or concerns to them should they arise.There are notable parallels here with conflicts in the audit worldDespite its ringside seat monitoring the operations of a fund, the role and value of the depositary is not widely understood. It is often regarded as a compliance necessity rather than a pivotal part of the funds ecosystem that delivers investor protection.Part of the problem lies with the options that funds face. Depositary is most commonly provided by banks or other financial service providers as part of a bundled package of services alongside banking, custody, and fund administration.In this affiliated model, the costs of the depositary service can be a fraction of the overall revenue earned from the manager and fund relationship. Few companies provide depositary as a standalone, independent service. Most will only do so as part of a broader, tied business relationship.There are clear conflicts of interest with this model. The most fundamental of which is whether the depositary will always act independently in the interests of investors and escalate an error or issue it identifies in an affiliated business unit especially if doing so might jeopardise the broader, more material relationship.Despite the existence of Chinese Walls that should theoretically separate the depositary from other parts of the group, the affiliated model will always face questions about impartiality.There are notable parallels here with conflicts in the audit world where revenues from lucrative consulting services usually dwarf audit fees. Nowadays there are increasing calls for the separation of the two business streams.Some fund management groups and fund directors insist on an independent depositary model as they perceive it to be industry best practice. But more often than not, funds opt for the affiliated model. Two regulatory developments may help change this.

First, the FCA recently introduced rules on fund governance that, among other things, require authorised fund managers in the UK to carry out value-for-money assessments. These detailed assessments, overseen by at least two independent non-executive directors, will consider the value funds deliver to investors and require companies to assess the quality of service at their third-party providers such as fund administrators and depositaries.Second, the FCA’s Senior Managers and Certification Regime comes into effect in less than a month. The FCA hopes SMCR will be a catalyst for positive change in culture within the investment industry. Groups are reviewing all aspects of their operations and recognise that an effective, independent depositary is integral to strong governance.More emphasis should be placed on the role of the depositary and ensuring that conflicts of interest are not allowed to weaken investor protection. The only effective way to remove conflicts is for regulators to require stronger independence between the depositary and other service providers to a fund.In the case of the Woodford funds, one financial institution acted as depositary, fund administrator, custodian, bank and lender to the funds. There is no reason to suggest that conflicts contributed to the outcome in this situation, but the FCA inquiry will no doubt consider the role performed by the depositary alongside other participants.If the inquiry highlights the importance of the role of depositary and leads to improvements in fund governance, then there may be long-term benefits for the fund management industry.Bill Prew is chief executive of Indos Financial, a provider of depositary and oversight services for alternative investment funds"
1;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2019-09-06T22:51:58Z;Northern Trust takes the reins on Woodford decisions;US bank to have final say on investment choices under new terms of £150m overdraft;US bank Northern Trust will have final say over any further investments Neil Woodford makes in his namesake trust, in a fresh blow to the embattled UK stock picker.The Woodford Patient Capital Trust said on Friday it had agreed to new terms with Northern Trust on a £150m overdraft facility provided by the Chicago-based bank.In exchange, WPCT, which Mr Woodford has managed since it was launched with great fanfare in 2015, will have “greater flexibility around certain obligations” tied to its borrowing from the US bank as the trust seeks to sell some of its illiquid holdings.The trust added that it had “agreed to make no further investments during this time without the prior consent of the lender”.Late last month, the trust was forced to write down the value of its holdings in Industrial Heat, a US company attempting to harness cold fusion technology. That, in turn, left the trust’s overall borrowing higher as a percentage of its net asset value.The new agreement caps another testing week for Mr Woodford, who on Monday saw a key ally step down from WPCT’s board. Steven Harris, the chief executive of Circassia Pharmaceuticals, in which Mr Woodford had a large holding, is leaving the board after four years.The board, which has the power to dismiss Woodford Investment Management as manager of WPCT, came under fire earlier this year for being too close to the former UK star investor. His poor performance led to the suspension in June of his flagship £3.1bn Equity Income fund.Earlier this week Patient Capital, whose shares have fallen more than 40 per cent this year, was ejected from the mid-cap FTSE 250.The new agreement with Northern Trust will also see the lender impose a higher level of interest on the overdraft facility. WPCT’s overall level of borrowing has dropped to £113.7m, the WPCT added on Friday.Patient Capital was the UK’s biggest investment trust launch when it raised £800m in 2015 — its market capitalisation is now just £380m. The fund was designed to invest in companies with the potential to grow significantly over the long term, leaving its holdings weighted in favour of small and unlisted companies.
2;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2019-07-03T03:00:29Z;Woodford cash calls raise doubts over £150m Northern Trust loan;Chicago bank cites ‘500% collateral’ but valuations under pressure;Neil Woodford is facing further cash calls from his investment companies, raising doubts over his ability to repay a £150m overdraft facility from Northern Trust, the Chicago-based bank.Britain’s best-known stockpicker, who has frozen withdrawals on his main fund after a liquidity crisis, has been selling down assets in a frantic effort to generate cash.After maxing out the overdraft in December, the board of Woodford Patient Capital Trust said last week that its borrowings had fallen from £149.97m at the end of last year to £126m on June 26 and it planned to cut the level to £75m within six months and to practically nothing within 12 months.Northern Trust said: “We do not expect a loss with the loan to Woodford Patient Capital Trust, partly due to the collateral supporting the exposure, which is currently valued in excess of 500 per cent of the outstanding loan.”However, there are doubts over those valuations. Morgan Stanley analysts noted that the WPCT traded at roughly a 33 per cent discount to net asset value “and Woodford is a motivated seller”. They estimated that Northern Trust would increase its reserves against the loan, hitting its second-quarter earnings.At the same time, there is added pressure from portfolio companies requiring Mr Woodford to meet commitments to buy shares. On Friday, the trust spent £20m on new shares in Proton, which operates centres that deliver proton beam therapy for cancer patients.*When it was admitted to the Nex Exchange junior market in February, Proton received a binding commitment that Mr Woodford would buy new shares worth £80m over 18 months. Proton has since sold £35m of new shares leaving £45m over the next 13 months.In another example of funding demands, on June 10, a week after his flagship fund blocked investor withdrawals, Mr Woodford agreed to buy $10m worth of shares in Nasdaq-quoted Evofem Biosciences.Northern Trust’s overdraft credit facility with WPCT is set to be renegotiated in January. It currently pays an interest rate of Libor plus 1.35 per cent. The relatively low interest rate reflects the fact that lending to fund managers is generally considered a low-risk business, given that the loans are usually over-collateralised by liquid securities.Shares in WPCT, which raised a then record £800m for an investment trust when it launched in 2015, peaked at 119p four years ago. The shares closed on Tuesday at 56.10p, near their all-time low.* WPCT on June 28 stated its overdraft facility was £126m on June 26. The article has been amended to make that timing clear.
3;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2019-02-21T12:22:29Z;Fund groups nod through huge CEO pay deals, says non-profit group;Fidelity, BlackRock and Northern Trust opposed handful of 100 top packages;Big asset managers stand accused of rubber-stamping exorbitant executive pay deals in the US, as the income gap between bosses and staff grows even wider.Fund groups, including Fidelity Investments and BlackRock, opposed just a handful of the 100 biggest pay deals last year, according to As You Sow, the California non-profit group. Northern Trust, the $1.1tn manager that mainly serves pension funds, did not vote against any pay deals.“The extraordinary increase in CEO pay is contributing to widening inequalities of income and wealth in America,” said Robert Reich, the former US labour secretary, who worked with As You Sow on the report. “Shareholders can and should take action on this.”The average S&P 500 company boss is paid 361 times more than their median worker, a disparity that has come under greater scrutiny in recent years as US companies have been forced to reveal such data.As You Sow compiled a list of 100 chief executives from the S&P 500 that it said were the most overpaid, based on their remuneration compared to total shareholder return and investor votes against their packages.Top of the list was Ronald Clarke of FleetCor Technologies, followed by Mark Hurd at Oracle and Hock Tan at Broadcom.Of the top 100, Fidelity voted against the pay awards of just 7 per cent of executives and BlackRock against 11 per cent.Axa IM voted against 20 per cent, while Axa Equitable, the US business owned by the same parent, voted against 9 per cent.*Axa IM said it engaged with companies over issues such as pay and voted against them when it felt its concern was not addressed.“Our starting position in relation to CEO pay in the US is to shift US companies away from the position where incentive pay is granted without any need to satisfy performance conditions,” said Shade Duffy, head of corporate governance at Axa IM.“Our votes support those companies that have started to recognise the importance of performance-related pay within remuneration structure, and vote against those that don’t.”Axa IM said it was reviewing its voting practices on remuneration, including taking account of pay ratios and considering the inclusion of environmental, social and governance factors in its analysis.Last month Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, wrote to corporate bosses saying one of the manager’s engagement priorities would be on pay deals that promote a long-term outlook.In Mr Fink’s letter two years ago, he informed fellow CEOs that BlackRock did “not hesitate to exercise our right to vote against incumbent directors or misaligned executive compensation”.Rosanna Landis-Weaver, programme manager of executive compensation at As You Sow, said the biggest fund managers typically advocated for engaging with companies rather than voting against them.“The problem with that is engagement goes on in the background and managers aren’t clear what goals are set and whether they have been met,” she said. “Engagement and voting are not mutually exclusive. Engagement with voting makes a lot more sense than without.”Fidelity and BlackRock declined to comment. Northern Trust did not respond to a request for comment.At the other end of the scale, Royal London Asset Management voted against 89 per cent of pay awards, Allianz Global Investors against 78 per cent, BNP Paribas against 69 per cent and Schroders against 63 per cent.*A previous version of this article attributed Axa Equitable’s voting record to Axa IM due to an error in the source data
4;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2018-09-16T04:00:00Z;Marie Dzanis: ‘I call it revenge of the nerds because we’re in vogue, finally’;;"Marie Dzanis wrote her own eulogy when she was 34.The recently appointed head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Northern Trust Asset Management was prompted to reflect on her life not by serious illness or the death of a friend but by a Versace suit.“I envisioned success as being when I bought my Versace suit and I squeezed myself into this thing and I wore it to work, and I thought everybody’s going to notice that I’ve achieved success. They were like ‘Yes, you look nice’. I was like ‘Is this it?’”In a moment of epiphany, the young woman reassessed what she wanted to get out of her career, deciding expensive possessions and being known for being nice was not enough. Far more important, she decided, was “leaving a legacy”.Almost two decades later, Ms Dzanis is one of a small number of women who hold powerful positions in the fund industry. The announcement of her appointment in July to head up NTAM’s Emea business came just before Anne Richards was named chief executive of Fidelity International.During an interview at NTAM’s offices in Canary Wharf in London, Ms Dzanis talks excitedly about her plans for the business. She admits that the fund house is not well known in Europe, despite ranking as one of the world’s biggest asset managers with close to $1tn in assets. Instead, its parent company, custody bank Northern Trust, has taken much of the limelight. NTAM, which has more than $575bn in passive investments compared to $370bn in active, would not disclose the size of its Emea assets.Ms Dzanis, who relocated to London for her new role, has a big job lifting NTAM's profile in Europe. “That’s why I was brought in, to grow awareness of asset management,” she says. “People say we’re familiar with the name Northern Trust, but not necessarily asset management. It’s a surprise when they hear that we’re the fourth largest indexer in the world. It’s a surprise when they hear we have $85bn in [environmental, social and governance] assets and that we’ve been managing ESG for 25 years.”There is a “lot of work to do,” she says. The 51-year-old is in the midst of a strategic review, and will not be pushed to reveal much detail. She admits, however, there will be a string of new hires, including a chief investment strategist who will be based in the Netherlands. The company will also recruit for its Irish offices — she denies Brexit is the sole reason for this — as well as in the UK.“I personally don’t believe in over-hiring,” she says. “I’d rather have people stretch with opportunity and . . . make a good business case to add personnel.”There is a big question about how to grow in Europe at a time when many pension funds are demanding more from their asset managers. NTAM is best known, especially in Europe, for its work with big pension funds and other so-called institutional investors. “We do not have a retail focus in Emea presently,” Ms Dzanis says, referring to individual investors. Asked if that could change, she says she has been “brought in to evaluate everything”.The Pennsylvania native was first hired in 2011 by NTAM to help the fund house build its exchange traded fund business. She had previously worked at Barclays Global Investors, the asset manager that would later be bought by BlackRock and go on to become the world’s biggest ETF provider.“The misnomer was Northern Trust might be more conservative” than other asset managers, she says. But rather than being dull, NTAM is “highly risk aware”.“I call it, in today’s market, revenge of the nerds because we’re in vogue, finally. People appreciate the deliberate process,” Ms Dzanis says.In the past, she says, investors were looking for alpha — or market outperformance — “wherever they could get it”.“They were happy to get above average returns. Now, after seeing multiple market issues over time, they see that under market duress . . . assets are highly correlated.”This has helped drive growth in so-called factor investing or smart beta, which takes a basic passive investment strategy but tweaks it by favouring cheaper stocks, for example, in the hope of generating above-market returns. Northern Trust has been using factors since 1994. “We find investors are comfortable with taking risks if they understand what those risks are and there’s no unintended bets,” she says.If Northern Trust has a reputation as being a bit boring, Ms Dzanis is anything but. Quick to smile and gregarious, she reveals an adventurous streak as the conversation progresses. There are references to a time when she and her husband explored an unexcavated tomb in Egypt and to her travels in Latin America.Her bold nature helped her get her first job in finance. Fresh out of college, she picked up a phone book and began calling financial companies on Wall Street. “I got through to the president of the company and I said: ‘Hi, my name is Marie and I want a job’. And the guy said: ‘Who is this?’ So I told him, and he’s like ‘How did you get through to me? Can you be here tomorrow?’”During her early career, she says she learnt a valuable lesson about being herself from a female colleague. While her male colleagues “were walking around in [sock] suspenders with fluffed up hair, and [were] buy, sell, buy, sell”, the most successful salesperson in the office was a woman who “would sit in her chair and would curl up in a flouncy dress” and explain clearly to each investor why a particular bond might work for them.“It was a personal lesson that your own style can be incredibly powerful if you are tuned into that and leveraged it appropriately. Sometimes we’re inclined to fit in or sometimes we are inclined to put on a mask for work. I think you are at your best if you bring your full self to work.”The conversation comes back to the idea of legacy again. She is tasked with growing NTAM’s business in Europe, but she says she is also keen for her employees to do well. “I want people at their retirement party to say that they’ve gone on and done things greater than I have. It’s about leaving a legacy.”Born

5;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2018-04-12T02:43:18Z;Fed proposes cuts to capital requirements for largest banks;Tweak to controversial leverage ratio will benefit custody banks in particular;The Federal Reserve is proposing to reduce the amount of capital the US’s biggest banks are required to hold by modifying the way a key leverage ratio is calculated.The more relaxed regime would benefit all eight US banks branded as systemically important, but it would do most for the custody banks State Street, BNY Mellon and Northern Trust.On Wednesday the Fed and another bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, announced a plan to revise a metric known as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, which has long been a source of discontent at big banks.The Fed said: “The proposed changes seek to retain a meaningful calibration of the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards while not discouraging firms from participating in low-risk activities.”The central bank, which is now led by appointees of Donald Trump, announced the proposal with no fanfare.But Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, which wants tougher regulation of Wall Street, said: “This rule would be easily the most significant rollback of post-crisis risk controls for the largest banks since Trump took office.”The central bank said the changes would reduce the aggregate amount of tier one capital required by the US’s eight systemically important banks by a net $400m, or approximately 0.04 per cent, at the level of their holding companies.But that figure was described as “wildly misleading” by Mr Stanley. He said $400m was the amount of capital the banks could immediately return to their shareholders if the proposal were finalised today.“But this rule could lower capital requirements by many tens or even hundreds of billions in capital if the banks change their balance sheets to load up on assets that regulators assign a low risk weight — such as AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities before the crisis, or Greek debt today,” Mr Stanley said.The change would replace a static leverage ratio with a more “dynamic” metric that takes into account the different risk profiles of banks. The custody banks, which specialise in keeping financial assets safe, tend to engage in mostly low-risk activity.Work on the proposal began under the Fed’s former regulatory chief, Dan Tarullo, an appointee of Barack Obama. He has now been replaced by Trump pick Randal Quarles.Big banks are currently required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of more than 5 per cent — comprising a minimum 3 per cent plus a 2 per cent buffer. For lower-risk institutions the proposal would reduce the buffer to 1 per cent.The Fed did not release estimates of how the proposal would reduce the capital requirements of individual banks.Mr Stanley said: “During the 2008 crisis leverage capital was by far the best protection against bank failure . . . This action is short-sighted and irresponsible and shows that regulators are caving in to the agenda of too big to fail banks.” 
6;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2018-03-28T18:31:34Z;Regulator warns bank reforms threaten financial stability;Tom Hoenig says relaxation of post-crisis constraints could undermine US economy;A top US bank regulator has fired a parting shot at lawmakers by warning that a bank-deregulation bill that has passed the Senate could pose a threat to financial stability.Tom Hoenig, who is due to step down as vice-chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in coming weeks, said in a speech on Wednesday that relaxing constraints put in place since the financial crisis could “undermine the long-term resilience of not only the banking system, but the broader economy as well.” *In particular, he took aim at efforts to loosen capital rules for custody banks, which play a vital role in financial markets by keeping tens of trillions of dollars of financial assets safe and accounted for. Under a bill that passed the Senate this month and is now in the House of Representatives, custody-focused banks would be allowed to deduct cash held on behalf of clients from the calculation of a key metric known as the supplementary leverage ratio, which measures capital as a percentage of gross assets.Doing so would lower the amount of capital the banks need to meet the requirements of the SLR, allowing them to return more cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.Top executives at the three biggest custody banks — BNY Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust — have consistently argued that the rule unfairly penalises banks which absorbed a lot of client cash during the Lehman crisis as big asset-manager clients liquidated their holdings.Memories are short and, with an improving economy, these laws and regulations . . . are eventually recast as burdensome constraints. And here we are again.But Mr Hoenig told an audience in Washington: “These trusted custodians must remain pillars of strength and should be retaining capital, not reducing it.”He added: “How unfortunate that during the last crisis these custody banks were seriously undercapitalised and as confidence in them ebbed, the government found itself supporting them under emergency conditions at levels reaching $60bn to $90bn a day.”The banking bill moved smoothly through the Senate with the backing of a handful of moderate Democrats, but it has since been held up in the House of Representatives, where conservative lawmakers want to impose more radical reforms.Liberal Democrats led by Senator Elizabeth Warren have voiced criticisms of the bill that echo Mr Hoenig’s concerns.The three most powerful US bank regulators — the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC — imposed a 3 per cent SLR in 2013 as part of the Basel III capital accords, applying it to all banks with more than $250bn in total consolidated assets.For the eight banks deemed to be “global systemically important”, including BNY and State Street, the US regulators went a step further, requiring them to meet a 5 per cent SLR at the holding company level and a 6 per cent SLR at the bank level.Mr Hoenig is expected to stand down from the FDIC in April after six years, capping a 44-year career in bank supervision, largely at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.During his speech he noted that one common element of financial crises is the aftermath, in which new rules are enacted with the aim of preventing a recurrence.“But memories are short and with an improving economy, these laws and regulations — which early in the recovery are viewed as essential — are eventually recast as burdensome constraints that need to be eased or ended,” he said. “And here we are again.”
7;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2018-03-19T09:05:37Z;FTSE 100 group Micro Focus plummets 54% after fresh sales warning;Chief executive quits after problems integrating HP Enterprise business hit revenues;The acquisitive software group Micro Focus shed more than half of its market value on Monday after warning problems integrating the HP Enterprise business meant the pace of revenue decline would be even worse than it had previously thought. CEO Chris Hsu is also leaving after just months in the job.Shares in the FTSE 100 company were down 54 per cent at pixel time, following a 17 per cent decline after disappointing with interim results in January.In a timely move, Northern Trust Capital Markets ended its recommendation on Micro Focus last Wednesday, when it said the company was “not expensive, but we don’t know how it can grow profits beyond the current integration plan”.Investing in a roll-up company — which relies on snapping up businesses using cheap debt then cutting costs to drive growth — made sense when there was little global growth, Northern Trust said. But when growth was picking up and interest rates and debt costs were rising, that model was less attractive. On top of that, Micro Focus suffered from a lack of exposure to one of the biggest trends in the tech industry, artificial intelligence, according to Northern Trust:The problem we see is that being a technology or software business, with no clear growth exposure to what is probably the biggest theme in technology in our view, Micro Focus misses out on a major tailwind.Like so many service businesses, especially technology service businesses, AI presents not only opportunities but also threats.So when the HPE Software integration is finished, where will the next acquisition target come from and how will AI affect profit growth? We simply can’t say today with any conviction.Mr Hsu’s tenure as chief executive was one of the more shortlived for a FTSE 100 company: he took up the role only after the HPE deal completed in September, having previously held the roles of COO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and executive vice-president of HPE Software.
8;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2018-02-05T03:30:34Z;State Street chief takes aim at the cost of servicing;Bank’s chief executive-to-be says activities will move to front office;"Not long before Ron O’Hanley was named the next chief executive of State Street, the world’s second-biggest trust bank, a New York analyst set out his challenge in blunt terms. The business of keeping financial assets safe and accounted for, he said, is “the world’s worst oligopoly”.There are a handful of big players, high barriers to entry due to tight regulation and expensive technology — and unrelenting pressure on margins. Every cent an investor spends on the humdrum business of custody and record-keeping is a cent that doesn’t accrue, ultimately, to a nurse or a firefighter with a pension fund.The pressure to do everything for less results in “terrible, sometimes value-destroying pricing,” said the analyst, Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mr O’Hanley doesn’t see it that way. Appointed as president and chief operating officer in November, he is due to step up to be chief executive of the 226-year-old bank, the second oldest in the US, by the end of the year. He accepts that the core business of servicing assets can be tough, but says that is where the creativity is.He cites a recent example in which State Street worked with a quantitative hedge fund to develop a dynamic trading plan, so the fund could adapt the day’s scheduled orders according to the flow of news. In another case, the company helped a big public pension fund to shift from a defined-benefit to a defined-contribution scheme, “unitising” its pool of assets.In other words, the company is moving beyond the humdrum business of custody. Or as Mr O’Hanley puts it, from the middle office to the front office.He’s been in charge of 20% of the business; now it’s the rest he has to worry about“That’s what the industry needs to be able to do,” he says, during an interview in his office overlooking the trading floor at State Street’s art deco headquarters in Boston. A day later the bank reported fourth-quarter results showing a 7 per cent spike in servicing fees from a year earlier, on $33tn of assets.“It’s no longer enough to just say that we’re a great custodian or a great accountant,” he says, noting that servicing accounts for about four-fifths of State Street’s revenues, which came to $11.2bn last year. “Now it really is around information and information management and data; how do I make it available and useful to [clients] in their investment process.”Other big trust banks are in the grip of management changes. At Bank of New York Mellon, the biggest with $15.5bn in revenues, new chief executive Charlie Scharf, 52, is trying to fuse skills he learnt while running JPMorgan Chase’s retail bank with technology insights he picked up during a four-year spell on the west coast with Visa. At Northern Trust in Chicago, Michael O’Grady, 52, the former finance chief and head of the asset-servicing unit, has recently replaced Frederick “Rick” Waddell, 64.Mr O’Hanley — who joined State Street in 2015 following stints at Fidelity Investments, BNY Mellon and McKinsey — was previously chief executive of State Street Global Advisors, the bank’s investment arm which is the world’s third-biggest fund manager by assets.The key question is how much performance is alpha, or factor-based — and whether the client can get a similar result more cheaplyIt will be up to the 60-year-old asset-management veteran to show that he can get a grip on servicing, says Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. According to Wells Fargo figures, combined assets under custody at the top three independent trust banks, plus JPMorgan, rose from about $23tn in 2001 to $82tn last year but fees as a percentage of those assets dropped from 3.5 basis points to 2.3bps over that period, on a trailing 12-month basis.“He’s been in charge of 20 per cent of the business; now it’s the rest he has to worry about,” says Mr Kleinhanzl.By his side will be Cyrus Taraporevala, the new president and chief executive of State Street Global Advisors. He will have challenges of his own. The exchange-traded fund business, for example, lost ground last year to BlackRock and Vanguard. That’s tough to take for a company that launched the first US-listed ETF in 1993.Year founded: 1792Assets: $2.8 trillion, Dec 31 2017Employees: 37,000Headquarters: BostonOwnership: Publicly listedTicker: STTBetsy Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says Mr O’Hanley showed he was “a long-term thinker” during his spell at SSGA, pushing it into higher-margin products. Active strategies now account for less than 8 per cent of SSGA’s $2.8tn in AUM.The key question, says Mr Taraporevala, is how much performance is alpha, or factor-based — and whether the client can get a similar result more cheaply. “How much can we deliver in an index, what can we deliver in a factor-based way, what are the true active pieces that the client couldn’t get in a more cost-effective way?” he asks.Putting all that together “is the new active,” Mr Taraporevala says.Both men say they are generally pleased at the direction of financial-regulatory reform under the Donald Trump administration. As Mr Taraporevala says, there’s a recognition that the “pendulum” had swung too far after the financial crisis, penalising banks with overzealous rules.We’re actually helping investors get their job done at a lower costMr O’Hanley expects relief for the specialist custody banks on a metric known as the supplementary leverage ratio, for example, which calculates capital as a percentage of total assets. That was not a constraint during the crisis, he notes, when State Street’s balance sheet was swollen with cash as big asset-manager clients liquidated their holdings.“You really don’t want us in a time of crisis trying to push that stuff off,” he says. “It was very beneficial to regulators to kind of know where that cash was; it was a daily barometer on investment sentiment.”Meanwhile Mr O’Hanley will keep pushing on a decade-long technology upgrade.

9;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2018-01-10T15:42:45Z;Bond sell-off boosts bank stocks;;Bank stocks rose across Europe and North America on Wednesday, with UK banks hitting their strongest level in almost four years and US groups at their highest point since before the financial crisis, as investors grow increasingly confident that the era of ultra-low interest rates is approaching its end.Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Chartered and HSBC were the three largest risers on the FTSE 100 index, climbing 4.4 per cent, 4.1 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. That helped push the FTSE 350 Banks Index up 2.7 per cent to its highest level since May 2014.Investors were similarly optimistic about banks in the eurozone, with the Euro Stoxx Banks Index rising 2.5 per cent.US stocks made slightly slower gains, but a 1.1 per cent increase in the KBW Bank Index came in the face of a weak wider market. The index is now at its highest level since August 2007.Global bond yields have been rising this week amid speculation that the Bank of Japan will join its Eurozone and US peers in scaling back its stimulus programme this year.A move toward higher rates would be good news for banks, which have suffered over the last decade as historically low interest rates have weighed on their margins.Gary Paulin, head of global equities at Northern Trust, also pointed to reports that Chinese authorities increasingly viewed US government bonds as less attractive.Mr Paulin said:They have the largest foreign reserves in the world. And if they are pulling back along with pension funds …and Central banks continue to taper, one might logically conclude rates are likely to be going up. One might then ask …’got banks?’This week’s moves come after US tax reform efforts had already increased optimism about the banking sector, with a number of analysts upgrading their earnings forecasts for American banks in particular.Analysts at UBS noted today that “as we move into 2018, sentiment towards global banks has improved notably in developed markets …fundamentally, US tax reform has boosted expectations of stronger growth and higher rates in the US, with potential spill-over growth benefits elsewhere”.

11;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2017-12-05T05:15:25Z;Investors fail to back votes on greater climate change disclosure;Vanguard, BlackRock and BNY Mellon have weak record holding US utilities to account;The world’s largest asset managers have failed to back motions seeking greater climate change disclosure at America’s biggest utility groups, putting a question mark over the depth of their commitment to combating the issue.Vanguard, BlackRock, BNYMellon and Invesco all voted against resolutions aimed at forcing the companies to report on how efforts to keep a global temperature rise this century to below 2 degrees Celsius will affect them, according to Preventable Surprises, a campaign group.The 2 degree limit, above pre-industrial levels, was the benchmark agreed by global leaders in Paris in 2015.Nine of the 10 big investors examined by Preventable Surprises are signatories to the UN’s responsible investment initiative, the Principles for Responsible Investment, which includes a pledge that they will “seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest”.However an analysis of shareholder votes at this year’s annual meetings showed they have a mixed scorecard when it comes to holding US utilities to account.Nine of the ten biggest groups — including FirstEnergy, Dominion Energy and Southern — had resolutions for greater climate change disclosure in the spring of 2017, eight of which failed to pass.Vanguard, BlackRock and BNY Mellon voted against all nine resolutions.“Some investment firms’ proxy voting lacks the sense of urgency required for transitioning to a 2°C economy,” the report said. “Public support of shareholder resolutions at laggard companies is critical because behind-closed-doors engagement lacks transparency, accountability and meaningful metrics.”Northern Trust was the only investor to consistently support increased disclosure on climate risk according to Preventable Surprises.Utility groups accounted for 63 per cent of CO2 emissions reported to the US’s Environmental Protection Agency last year, compared to 15 per cent from the oil and gas sector.There is increasing pressure on energy companies to spell out their financial exposure to climate change.Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that investors face “potentially huge” losses due to tougher rules to curb climate change and a task force by the G20’s Financial Stability Board has recommended that listed companies disclose their exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities.Yet the voting record of big investors for utilities this year stands in contrast to that for energy groups.Rob Main, head of company engagement and voting for Vanguard, said the $4.7tn asset manager’s preferred approach was to press for change in face-to-face meetings with company executives. “It is important for us to see how companies are assessing this kind of risk,” he said. “We do believe we can have significant impact through engagement.”BlackRock also stressed its belief that engagement with companies can lead to positive changes.BNY Mellon Investment Management said each of its investment boutiques made “investment and proxy voting decisions that are in the best economic interest of the client, consistent with each particular client’s investment guidelines, rather than BNY Mellon’s,” but added that the group was “an advocate for climate change action”.Invesco declined to comment.BlackRock and Vanguard were among those earlier his year which stepped up pressure on US energy companies to address the risks associated with climate change. In votes at seven of the largest US energy companies, the 30 largest investors switched their votes to support disclosure on climate risk, having opposed similar resolutions a year earlier, according to a recent study.

13;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2017-11-27T05:00:57Z;BlackRock and Vanguard are smart beta’s biggest winners;Smaller groups grow fast, but are dwarfed in comparison;BlackRock’s smart beta assets have ballooned by almost 180 per cent to $288bn over the past five years, leaving rival asset managers scrambling to close the gap on the world’s largest fund house.The figures, collected by Morningstar, the data provider, show the New York-listed investment manager and its chief rival, Vanguard, have been the big winners when it comes to the growth of smart beta.These strategies, which act as a halfway house between active and passive fund management, have become popular in recent years as investors have sought out market-beating returns at a cheaper price. BlackRock and Vanguard are the only asset managers globally with more than $100bn in smart beta products.They have benefited from their position as the world’s largest exchange traded fund providers, drawing on their decades of experience in ETFs and factor investing to establish their hold on the smart beta market.Well known fund managers, such as Deutsche Bank, Amundi and UBS, however, do not even rank in the top 10.Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, thinks BlackRock and Vanguard will continue to dominate the leader board.“It will be exceedingly difficult for anyone to catch up,” he says. “The lead they have could shrink a bit, but I don’t think anyone can overtake them.”Smart beta strategies typically take a standard index fund but tweak it in an attempt to generate above-market returns, such as by investing based on how cheap stocks are, or on their fundamentals, rather than their market capitalisation.“There are a whole class of investors who are to some degree disillusioned with active management, but not so disillusioned that they are willing to simply own the market,” Mr Johnson adds. “They want something more.”Rob Nestor, head of iShares smart beta at BlackRock, says the manager decided this area was a “critical focus” about two and a half years ago, and started pouring in resources. This included hiring Andrew Ang, now head of factor investing strategies at BlackRock and one of the best-known names in the field.The rapid growth of smart beta in recent years “is sustainable for quite some time”, says Mr Nestor, adding: “We believe we are just in the early days of adoption.”Morningstar figures going back to 2012 show that ALPS has been the fastest growing of the 10 largest smart beta managers over that time. Its assets under management have increased by more than 4,000 per cent, though from a low base, to stand at $6bn.Invesco PowerShares and State Street Global Advisors have had the slowest growth in smart beta assets since 2012, at 87 per cent to nearly $50bn and 118 per cent to around $40bn respectively.Over that time, SSGA has lost its position as the fourth-largest smart beta manager to WisdomTree.Mr Johnson suggests State Street and PowerShares have not experienced the same rapid growth as their rivals because they have been slow to develop their ranges. “SSGA was much later to the game in bringing strategic beta to the market place,” he says.Rory Tobin, global co-head of SSGA’s SPDR exchange traded fund arm says that the asset manager only launches a product where it is “convinced of the investment case for it”.“Our experience is that uptake of a smart beta product varies according to investor appetite for more complex and esoteric approaches,” Mr Tobin adds.“Even the most vanilla smart beta strategy can seem opaque next to more intuitive market capitalisation-based investments.”Dan Draper, head of global exchange traded funds for Invesco, says the company recently bought a rival ETF provider, Source, and has announced plans to acquire Guggenheim Investments’ ETF business. He says the businesses offer a range of smart beta ETFs.Even the most vanilla smart beta strategy can seem opaqueAsset growth when it comes can happen fast. Charles Schwab’s smart beta business has expanded by more than 1,600 per cent to $26bn over five years. FlexShares — managed by investment firm Northern Trust — and First Trust have both experienced rapid growth of more than 400 per cent.Charles Schwab launched its first smart beta funds 10 years ago, but investors began piling in after the strategies developed a track record, says Jon­a­than de St Paer, head of product strategy and development at the US fund manager.Over the past few years there has been a rush to market. “We are seeing an explosion of products,” says Mr de St Paer. “I would be really surprised if some of these are around in the next few years.”However, Ryan Issakainen, ETF strategist at First Trust, which launched its first smart beta funds a decade ago, expects demand to “continue to grow and perhaps grow faster” than at its current rate.“Most investors may have heard a bit here or there, but they are just becoming familiar with how to use smart beta funds in portfolios,” he adds, “so there is plenty of room for growth.”
14;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2017-09-13T14:00:23Z;Will central banks ever return to ‘normal’? Northern Trust doubts it;;Are you sitting comfortably? Really comfortably? Because it looks like it’s going to be a long ride.Central banks may never return to “traditional” levels, meaning low interest rates will continue to drive up stock prices despite already-soaring valuations, according to the chief investment officer at Northern Trust.Bob Browne, Northern Trust chief investment officer, made the prediction on monetary policy as the investment group – which manages $1tn in assets – released its annual five-year market outlook. Northern Trust is expecting interest rates to rise even more slowly than is currently forecast, and Mr Browne said:We may never see the central banks return to traditional policies and don’t expect a return to pre-financial crisis levels over our forecast horizon. A successful unwinding of huge central bank balance sheets, which is likely to remain larger than historical levels, will be the focus.Growing optimism in the eurozone and recent policy tightening from institutions such as the Bank of Canada have fed hopes that monetary policies will soon return to normal after years of post-crisis stimulus. However, Northern Trust is not the only group trying to temper expectations about rising bond yields – Oxford Economics predicted in a report earlier this week that the ECB’s balance sheet will continue to weigh on yields long after the ECB begins tapering new bond purchases, at least until 2025.On the upside, according to Northern Trust, those low yields will help the World’s Most Hated Equities Market Rally™ to continue apace. With US stock indices once again hitting record highs this week, many observers have raised concern that companies are becoming increasingly overvalued, but Northern Trust says “while valuations appear elevated in an absolute sense, they are much more reasonable when compared to current bond yields”.That said, not every market is expected to benefit equally. For the first time in five years, Northern Trust is predicting higher returns from European stocks than the UK, while emerging markets stand to do particularly well as “valuations are too low for the stable economic environment we expect”.
15;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2017-09-04T03:08:28Z;Fund industry moves to paying for research itself;Northern Trust is latest asset manager to say it will not charge clients;"When JPMorgan Asset Management said in August that it would pay out of its own pocket for the external research it uses to make investment decisions, it caused upheaval in the fund industry.For months, investment houses in Europe had been weighing up whether to absorb the cost of research, which includes analyst notes and calls with experts, or pass it on to investors when new rules come into force in January 2018.The new European rules, which form part of the sprawling Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid, are expected to radically transform how banks, brokers and fund managers interact.Under the regulations, asset managers have to make clear to investors how much they are being charged for research, ending the opaque system of receiving research for free in return for placing trades with banks and brokers.Some fund houses, including Woodford Investment Management and Baillie Gifford, quickly decided it would be simpler and fairer to cover the cost of research themselves.But a split emerged in the industry after several big fund houses, including Schroders and Amundi, took the opposite approach, saying they would pass the cost on to clients.JPMorgan’s move to pay for research out of its own profit and loss account, which followed in the wake of a similar move by Vanguard, has changed the mood in the sector.JPMorgan’s decision has caused a lot of active managers to reconsider what they were planning to do“JPMorgan’s decision has caused a lot of active managers to reconsider what they were planning to do,” says Anthony Kirby, director of regulatory reform and risk management at EY, the consultancy.Chris Turnbull, co-founder of Electronic Research Interchange, a research platform, adds: “A lot of [asset managers] are reassessing their decision now.“The more the market gets used to [fund managers] paying for research from their own P&L, the more it gets harder for people not to do that.”According to research by FTfm, more than 70 per cent of asset managers that have made a decision on research payments have opted to cover the costs themselves. This includes several of the world’s biggest asset managers, such as Pimco, which manages $1.6tn, and Northern Trust, which manages $1tn, as well as NN Investment Partners, T Rowe Price and M&G Investments.That momentum is expected to have widespread implications for fund houses, investors and investment banks.Amundi

UBSFor investors, costs should, technically, come down. For fund houses, it will mean further pressure on profit margins, probably forcing portfolio managers to ensure they only consume research they need in order to keep costs down. Currently, many fund managers receive hundreds of pieces of research a day.Joshua Maxey, managing director of Third Bridge, a research provider, says that fund houses are in the process of “taking sharp cuts to their research budgets and doing an inventory of what they really need versus nice-to-have products”.Virtually all conversations we are having with managers right now are discussing how they can cut down the number of brokers their companies are using“Virtually all conversations we are having with managers right now are discussing how they can cut down the number of brokers their companies are using,” he says.As part of this process, fund houses and the world’s largest financial businesses are at loggerheads over the price of research, with some investment banks asking for more than $1m for annual access to research platforms.In response, some asset managers are taking action to reduce their reliance on external research. Union Investment, German’s third-largest asset manager, plans to cull the number of research providers it uses, while Deutsche Asset Management is building up its internal research arm.“Everyone is thinking far more carefully about research now and their expenditure on and valuation of research,” says Mr Turnbull.Mr Kirby estimates that research bills could come down by up to 30 per cent if the asset managers move towards paying for it themselves, putting big pressure on investment banks and brokers that provide research.But there is still a whole host of asset managers, including BlackRock, the world’s largest fund house, that have yet to decide how research will be paid for. Time is running out, however, and they will need to make a choice in the coming weeks in order to give clients sufficient notice. Under the Mifid rules, asset managers must inform and receive clients’ consent if they plan to charge them.Undecided asset managers are weighing up whether the cost of absorbing research is worth avoiding the complexity of figuring out which client to charge for which piece of research.One regulatory expert, who asked not to be named, said there are advantages for asset managers if they absorb the cost of research. Fund houses will not have to publish their research budget to clients and will not have to go “through the hassle of figuring out how to allocate research costs across various funds”, he says.“It removes any potential issues with research being shared across the organisation, which is of particular concern to global asset managers,” he says. “Additionally, let’s be honest, there is good PR in deciding not to pass on the cost to investors.”For Baillie Gifford, the decision was straightforward. Nick Thomas, a director at the Scottish fund house, says: “It was in clients’ interest and simpler for us.”But paying for research will be much more expensive than passing it on to investors. Some companies, including JO Hambro, have estimated their research budgets at under £5m. But other estimates suggest some asset managers could be paying up to $100m a year on research.Charging clients for research is not without its costs, but it is much cheaper than absorbing it. Fund houses that use an external company’s technology to run research payment accounts, the model used to pass costs along to investors, would spend tens of thousands, rather than hundreds of thousands or even millions, according to several industry figures.But James Alexander, a director at KPMG, the consultancy, warns that operating such a model is likely to be “very complicated”, especially for asset managers that operate in several countries and have a mix of retail and institutional clients such as pension funds.“The complexity of trying to work out [which clients to charge for which piece of research and how much] is massive,” he says. He adds that if asset managers want to charge clients, they are running out of time to build or implement systems.Regardless, the consensus seems to be that the industry is moving towards paying for research itself.Mr Maxey says the big asset managers have “fired the starting gun”.“It will now be hard for anyone to try to charge for research out of investor’s money if the large asset managers have decided not to.”"
16;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2017-08-10T18:51:11Z;Drahi stretches cable ambitions to limit with Charter interest;Billionaire’s Altice is lining up bid it may struggle to fund for US cable operator;Patrick Drahi was running a small French cable company in 1999 when his business came to the attention of John Malone, the world’s most famous cable industry investor, who was in the process of gobbling up European assets.Mr Malone acquired Mr Drahi’s business that year, bringing on the Franco-Israeli upstart as an executive at UPC — now part of Liberty Global — where the entrepreneur got a first-hand glimpse of the wrangling methods and manoeuvres that earned the American mogul the nickname of “cable cowboy”.Little could Mr Malone have known at the time that, less than two decades later, Mr Drahi would be constantly nipping at his mentor’s heels in his own backyard, to climb the ranks of the most influential cable owners in the US.Mr Drahi’s Altice, the sprawling global telecoms group that has turned him into a billionaire, is lining up a bid that would be worth more than $185bn, including $62.5bn in debt, to acquire Charter Communications, the second-biggest US cable provider, where Mr Malone is the largest shareholder with nearly 21 per cent.Altice’s desire to buy Charter is a response to technological and consumer changes that are forcing the leading US telecoms and media companies to consider consolidation, in order to stay ahead in the race to offer internet, television and online video.Altice, which had focused mainly on Europe, moved into the US by acquiring a pair of regional US cable companies over the past two years. The group remains a sub-scale rival to Comcast and Charter, having lost out to the latter in the $78.7bn battle for Time Warner Cable in 2015.Charter’s emergence as a provider that can reach 26m customers across 41 states has made it an attractive target for wireless companies Verizon and Sprint, which is controlled by Japan’s SoftBank and whose billionaire founder Masayoshi Son is eager to consolidate US telecoms.Missing out on the Charter deal is an opportunity that Altice cannot afford, according to bankers and analysts, leaving the company with little room to acquire new customers in the US, where there are few alternative prospects.“It would be a big mistake to underestimate Drahi’s determination to carry out a deal,” said one person who worked closely with Altice on its previous dealmaking. “He didn’t expect SoftBank to go after a Charter merger, but once that [news] came out Altice had to work on a counter proposal.”The Altice plan is not without serious complications, testing to what extent Mr Drahi has truly mastered the complex financing structures that Mr Malone has utilised to fuel his expansion.Charter is now valued at $122bn after its shares climbed nearly 20 per cent in the past month on speculation. Adding in net debt, the company has an enterprise value of about $185bn, which Altice would presumably need to top with any offer.In comparison, Altice’s Dutch-listed parent company is worth just €31bn, even though it holds controlling stakes in a number of subsidiaries, including two listed vehicles: Altice USA and France’s SFR Group. The Altice Group has around €50bn of debt overall, split across these already highly leveraged funding entities, or “silos” as the company dubs them.The strategy has worked so far, allowing the group to expand in places including France, Israel, Portugal and most recently the US. It is a model cribbed directly from Mr Malone’s Liberty Global, and Altice’s chief financial officer was even brought over from Liberty to mimic the model.Multiple bankers told the FT that they had questioned Mr Drahi’s ability to fund a bid for Charter. “The guys at Altice are brilliant financial engineers but this one would be a stretch to complete,” said one adviser not directly involved in the bid planning.Others expressed scepticism at the high-yield bond market’s capacity to fund such a large acquisition, given Charter’s size. “It seems very big,” said one senior corporate finance banker. “The Verizon deal was $50bn and that was investment grade,” referring to the largest corporate bond that was used to back a deal for Verizon to buy full control of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone.Even if Altice can find a structure to fund a bid, another obstacle will be winning over Mr Malone, who is known for a stark preference for tax-efficient proposals to gain his backing. Greg Maffei, one of Mr Malone’s lieutenants and chief executive of Liberty Media, seemingly poured cold water on hopes that Charter would be open to accepting a deal that included a large portion in shares.He said: “The idea that we would take equities that we don’t want is probably unlikely. A lot of it seems like levering up Charter, and if we want to lever up Charter, we have that opportunity, so any deal that would be appealing for us and other Charter shareholders I think would have to add real value and show real capabilities that are beyond what we think is a very well-positioned company.”Moreover, Charter chief executive Tom Rutledge has a large chunk of stock options that vest if the company’s stock reaches $564 a share, a steep premium to the $400 level where it currently sits.Track trends in tech, media and telecomsBut this would not be the first time Mr Drahi has defied the odds. When Altice first entered the US market with pricey deals for regional groups, incumbents saw him as an unknown quantity, whose plan to slash costs rapidly could disrupt the market by damaging service levels.“Drahi’s modus operandi is to go into a duopoly market and run lean,” said Paul Moran, head of research at Northern Trust Securities.“Their experience in the US has given them confidence. Larger cable companies face the same challenges and they can apply their formula to a bigger footprint, which ultimately would make more money. That’s what motivates billionaires after all.”By Arash Massoudi, James Fontanella-Khan, Robert Smith, Shannon Bond, Nic Fildes and Harriet AgnewCharter Communications’ rise from regional operator to the US’s second-largest provider of cable and broadband dates back to 1998, when Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen paid $4.5bn including debt for the company, which had been founded five years earlier in St Louis, writes Shannon Bond.At the time, Mr Allen was rolling up a number of cable and media assets in what he called his “Wired World” strategy. Charter quickly made 10 acquisitions of smaller cable companies and, in November 1999, listed on the Nasdaq. However, it took on heavy debt to fund its deals and was unable to turn a profit as a public company.Charter filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, eliminating $8bn of its $21bn debt load. In its reorganisation, private equity firms Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners took control by swapping debt for equity.John Malone entered the picture in 2013 when his Liberty Media bought out Apollo and most of the other private equity stakes to become the largest shareholder.Charter has since followed Mr Malone’s acquisition playbook, edging out Altice in the race to buy Time Warner Cable in 2015. The deal was a typically complex, tax-driven structure that saw Charter take over not only Time Warner Cable, but also Bright House, a smaller operator, and transforming Charter overnight into a legitimate rival to Comcast.Charter now serves about 26m subscribers in big markets including New York and Los Angeles, and has been eyeing a move into the wireless business as it looks to build new revenue streams to offset declining appetite for cable television.Analysts say that for companies looking to expand in cable in the US, there are few other promising deal partners with significant scale. The third-largest provider, Cox Communications, is privately held. Comcast, with a market cap near $200bn, is simply too large.Among the companies tipped to participate in the newest round of industry consolidation, “Charter has the brightest fundamentals and M&A prospects”, wrote Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Capital, this week.

28;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2016-05-08T09:05:23Z;Biggest backers of executive pay revealed;Excessive pay routinely supported at the biggest companies in the US;Goldman Sachs, Northern Trust and TIAA have been accused of routinely supporting pay awards at the biggest companies in the US, hindering other shareholders’ efforts to clamp down on excessive pay.The three fund companies voted in favour of US pay reports on 98 per cent of occasions in the 12 months to the end of June 2015, according to figures compiled exclusively for FTfm.BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and its smaller rival T Rowe Price, similarly backed US remuneration reports on 97 per cent and 96 per cent of occasions respectively.Proxy Insight, the company that provided the data, additionally found that TIAA, the retirement provider, backed UK companies on pay 100 per cent of the time over the same period, followed by Vanguard (99 per cent) and Northern Trust (99 per cent).Stefan Stern, director of the High Pay Centre, a think-tank that lobbies against excessive remuneration, said the findings showed big investors are far too “laid back” about executive compensation.He said: “There has been a lack of collective action [among institutional investors to combat excessive pay]. This is due to inertia, a reluctance to stand out from the crowd and herd mentality.”Luke Hildyard, policy lead on stewardship at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, an influential body that represents UK retirement funds, accused well-paid fund managers of being compromised when it comes to voting on remuneration at the companies they invest in.“The pay of asset managers is an obvious conflict with regard to their [duty] to scrutinise corporate behaviour,” he said.The findings come after BP, Anglo-American and Weir, the FTSE 100 companies, suffered big shareholder rebellions over their remuneration reports, putting executive pay firmly in the public spotlight.Earlier this month the Norwegian oil fund, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, also said it would launch a crackdown on executive pay, targeting high salaries at companies around the globe for the first time.Deborah Gilshan, head of sustainable ownership at Railpen Investments, which oversees the assets of retired UK railway workers, said: “The voting records show there is a lot of support for company management who are not making the best decisions for the long-term interests of their shareholders.“If companies don’t use common sense to control pay outcomes, [shareholders have to question] what else is going on at the organisation and the dynamic between the chief executive and the board.”Other investors — mostly pension funds — are taking a much more aggressive approach to executive pay. This includes PGGM and ABP, the Dutch retirement funds, which both voted against more than three-quarters of remuneration reports in the US over 2014-15.A spokesperson for ABP said the US votes were in response to the prevalence of “excessive termination packages”, which guarantee high payouts to departing executives, as well as frequent instances of “significant pay for very average performance”.BMO Global, the Canadian institution, and the Florida State Board of Administration, the US pension scheme, were the next most aggressive investors, voting against 68 per cent and 41 per cent of US remuneration reports respectively.BlackRock, Vanguard, TIAA and T Rowe all said they prefer to engage with companies privately on issues such as executive pay, rather than automatically voting against them at annual general meetings. Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while Northern Trust said it voted on a “case by case” basis.A TIAA spokesperson said: “We believe our approach to executive compensation — evaluating companies on a case-by-case basis and conducting direct engagement — is the most effective way to support practices that reward sustainable shareholder value.”A spokesperson for T Rowe added: “Our longstanding and persistent efforts to influence corporate leaders to become more shareholder friendly go largely unnoticed because of the confidential nature of these conversations.”Mr Stern rejected such defences as “flimsy”. He said: “People have told themselves that stewardship in private is effective. In fact, more public criticism is needed. Engagement clearly is not that effective. The flimsiness of these arguments is being exposed.”Ms Gilshan agreed the approval levels among many institutional investors on executive pay appeared high. She said: “There is a lot of quality engagement that does go on behind closed doors, but it is not mutually exclusive to have private dialogue and use your voting rights to show you are holding management to account.”

Mrs Clinton herself says families are “working harder and harder, but still not getting ahead”.The presidential campaign is kicking into high gear just as Wall Street analysts warn of a rising risk of a slowdown or even recession in the US — a view that, if vindicated, would radically alter the political calculus. As things stand, 72 per cent of the electorate feels the economy is in recession, according to the American Values Survey released in November — even though the Great Recession is widely viewed as having ended in mid-2009.Paula Winterton, a 62-year old grandmother in New Hampshire, said that people in the state were not feeling much benefit from the improvement in the economy. “They feel like it is not getting better,” she said. “There aren’t jobs and the wages are terrible.”Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, said that once Democratic strategists have moved past the primaries and into the general election they will need to portray a hopeful economic picture to voters — learning from the 2014 midterm elections in which he said the party had failed to capitalise on economic improvements under Obama.“The great issue in this campaign remains the great stagnation — the slow growth trends in this century,” he said. “But it is not for a semi-incumbent [like Mrs Clinton] to bemoan how terrible things are. You have to give people a sense of hope that the policies put in place in the last eight years have begun to put the country back on the path of full recovery.”It is not for a semi-incumbent [like Mrs Clinton] to bemoan how terrible things are. You have to give people a sense of hope that the policies put in place in the last eight years have begun to put the country back on the path of full recovery.Central to the case for optimism is the lowest unemployment in eight years and an acceleration in average hourly earnings which has driven them to their strongest annualised growth rate since the recession in the past six months, at 2.9 per cent.Earnings have been supported by increases in minimum wages in 14 states that kicked in at the beginning of 2016, affecting more than 4.6m people. The dominant factor, however, is the tightening of the overall labour market as the unemployment rate drops to 4.9 per cent.Further wage gains may lie ahead. The latest National Federation of Independent Business survey shows that the share of companies which plan to raise pay is at the highest since before the recession.72%Percentage of electorate that feels the US economy is in recession, according to American Values SurveyYet polling suggests that Democratic politicians will face an uphill battle in convincing the population that a genuine recovery is taking hold. Pew Research Center numbers released last week show that 49 per cent of voters feel they are failing to keep up with the cost of living, more than the 42 per cent who say they are staying even, and 7 per cent saying that income is rising faster.“You have a lot of people who feel like they have been left behind and are angry at the system,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust.Some senior investors such as Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, are warning that the US economy may have already seen the best of times and is starting to decelerate.“Several factors have begun to concern us regarding the ability of the economy to continue at its solid, albeit largely under-appreciated, rate of growth,” including capital flight from China and the risk of a currency devaluation, falling corporate appetite to invest, and a rising cost of debt for companies, he said on Friday.In this view, the pickup in wages may simply be a delayed impact of gains in the jobs market that are already petering out.William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings think-tank and former adviser to Bill Clinton, said that the data over the next six to nine months would be critical, but that as things stood Mrs Clinton could not afford to run a “victory lap” on the economy.The critical benchmark was not average wages but the experience at the median, where outcomes had been depressed by an unequal distribution of pay and growth, he said. Real median hourly wages fell an annual 0.3 per cent from 2007-14, according to the Economic Policy Institute.“The experience of wage stagnation is now longstanding and has shaped the public consciousness,” Mr Galston said. “It is going to take more than a modest spike of good news on the wage front to break through the attitudes that have taken a long time to crystallise.”
33;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Vanguard, Fidelity face proxy access row;Shareholders fight for right to propose board members at investee companies;Vanguard, JPMorgan and Fidelity Investments have repeatedly rejected attempts to give shareholders the right to propose board members at the companies they are invested in.Their stance has angered other large investors who believe shareholders should have the right to put forward board directors to improve how companies are run.JPMorgan and Fidelity, both ranked among the world’s 10 largest asset managers, rejected every shareholder proposal to gain this right, known as proxy access, last year.Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund house by assets, supported just under a fifth of such proposals, while Northern Trust Asset Management voted in favour of just 2 per cent, according to the Proxy Access Scorecard, which lists how asset managers vote at annual meetings in the US.Laura Campos, director of shareholder activities at the Nathan Cummings Foundation, a $450m US endowment fund, said: “We are concerned that these [companies] do not vote in support of proxy access proposals.“There is a growing consensus among institutional investors that proxy access is a key driver of enhanced shareholder value. Board accountability has important implications for long-term shareholder value as well as a host of environmental, social and governance issues.”Shareholders’ inability to nominate board directors came into the spotlight last year after the New York City comptroller and the New York City pension funds submitted proxy access proposals at 75 companies across the US.The schemes called for investors who held at least 3 per cent of a company’s shares for at least three years to be able to suggest a director.Most corporate management teams opposed the plans, but the proposals gained the support of at least half of shareholders in 41 cases, according to Proxy Insight, which collects data on how investors vote at company meetings.More than 100 of the largest companies in the US have since introduced measures to allow shareholders to nominate board members, including technology giants Apple and Microsoft.A spokesperson for BlackRock, which supported proxy access proposals 93 per cent of the time in 2015, said: “Boards should be focused on long-term shareholders’ interests, and proxy access provides long-term and substantial shareholders [with] a tool to address occasional failures in this regard.”T Rowe Price, BNY Mellon Investment Management and Legal and General all voted in favour of proxy access proposals at least 90 per cent of the time.Nick Dawson, managing director of Proxy Insight, said: “Rarely does a governance issue cause such differences of opinion as proxy access has.”Fidelity said it “will generally vote against management and shareholder proposals to adopt proxy access”, but did not say why it takes this approach.JPMorgan said it does support proxy access, but believes it should only apply to shareholders who hold at least 5 per cent of a company’s shares, while Northern Trust said it votes on this matter on a case-by-case basis.A spokesperson for Vanguard said: “We believe that long-term investors may benefit from proxy access and we have been supportive of specific proposals where we thought it was appropriate.”

35;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2016-01-19T10:46:42Z;Rick Waddell: faith, family, friends . . . then the company;Rick Waddell’s personal priorities are at the heart of the way he runs Northern Trust;"Rick Waddell never intended to be a banker. He wanted to be a lawyer, but as he neared graduation he realised that an extra three years of schooling to practise law was not for him. He wanted to strike out on his own.“In 1975 it wasn’t a great economy,” he says, but “banks were hiring”. Though he had no interest in the profession, he thought “banking would enable me to see different industries, so that if I wanted to pursue something in manufacturing or in retail or a service business [I could]”.The second of five children of an insurance agent and a homemaker in Pittsburgh, Waddell graduated from Dartmouth College and received two job offers. “I like to think that was more a function of the bad economy than my résumé or interviewing skills, but I had an offer from Northern Trust and I had an offer from a bank in Newark, New Jersey, which doesn’t exist anymore.”Waddell, now 62 years old, took the job at Northern Trust, the US financial services company, on graduation and never left. He followed the traditional route to his job as chief executive of the firm, which has $887bn in assets under management and $6tn under custody: he climbed the corporate ladder.“I’ve loved my entire 40-year career here — I’ve had 14 different jobs by my count at the bank, including the one I have now,” he says.But soon after he joined, the political science major realised he needed to round out his banking skills. “I really didn’t have any accounting, business or economics background.”He was tired of the academic calendar, so a full-time MBA was out of the question — and anyway “I couldn’t afford it”. But at the time the bank paid employees’ part-time MBA tuition, so he signed up for night classes at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in Evanston, near Chicago.1975 Political science degree, Dartmouth University1975 Joins Northern Trust in the commercial lending division1979 MBA, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University2003 Becomes head of corporate institutional services at Northern Trust2006 Named president and chief operating officer2008 Appointed chief executive2009 Named chairmanThe part-time course perfectly complemented his day job. “The things I was learning during the day, I could actually talk about and relate at night and the things I was learning at night, getting my MBA — around operations and finance and marketing — I could see in action during the day.”The MBA did not lead directly to a promotion, as is sometimes the case today. “I’m not even sure I got any more money,” Waddell says. “I think it matured me, that experience of meeting other people from different companies . . . I think it was helpful in me developing as a leader here.”Waddell’s biggest regret is that he did not forge a stronger network of fellow students during his Kellogg days. But, he says, “my focus was on my job”.He is, in fact, more involved in Kellogg today than he ever was as a student. He is a member of the school’s advisory board and worked on its $350m fundraising campaign for the 415,000 sq ft glass-and-steel lakefront building scheduled to be completed late next year.He also teaches a few classes each year, delivering lectures on his experience at Northern Trust. The students are “mostly interested in what it takes to be a leader”.But leadership has changed drastically over the course of Waddell’s career, he says. Companies used to have a “very strong focus on hierarchical leadership, meaning top-down, CEO, the boss knows all the answers . . . and knows basically everything about where the company is going.”When I came here it was like you never questioned somebody up above — now I want people questioning me . . . pushing backBut “the world is a much more complex place than it was 40 years ago; it’s much more global,” he says. “The technology, the regulatory [framework], the client market dynamics have changed significantly, and a guy like me doesn’t have all the answers, okay? So I think what leaders need today is to learn how to lead teams, to learn how to be a participant in a team.“When I came here it was like you never questioned somebody up above — now I want people questioning me. I want people pushing back. I want people to say, ‘Rick, have you thought about this?’”Being able to rely on the expertise of others was handy in his first year as chief executive, as the financial crisis reached its peak. “Seeing how quickly everything was unravelling, that was scary,” he says. “I’m eight, nine months into the job and I’m thinking oh my gosh, we just saw Bear Stearns go down, we saw Wachovia go down, we saw Merrill Lynch go down . . . the thing that was primary to me in facing that challenge was the management team that I inherited.“I remember a lot of consultants and investment bankers when I was named CEO . . . advising me to shake the organisation up and get rid of some people,” he says. “I didn’t do any of that and I’m glad I didn’t because . . . to face that challenge, having yourself surrounded by people who could advise you, give you perspective, it was very, very important.”As chair of the Financial Services Roundtable, a lobbying and advocacy organisation, Waddell knows that the industry’s reputation “has clearly been damaged, and to some extent rightly so, because there were some bad things that were done by the financial services industry leading up to the crisis”.The regulatory response, he says, “has been shock and awe, honestly”. “Some of it [is] much-needed and good regulatory reform, but other parts of it I think — my own personal opinion — the pendulum has swung too far and will have a dampening effect on the economy for many, many years.”Though rarely in the headlines, in 2009 Northern Trust became a symbol of the excesses of the financial services industry when it threw a series of lavish parties at its annual golf tournament in Los Angeles. Gossip website TMZ published videos of guests dancing to live shows by Sheryl Crow and the band Chicago, months after the bank accepted $1.58bn from the US government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).Then-senator John Kerry called it an “idiotic abuse of taxpayer money”. The bank paid back its Tarp money a few months later, along with a $133m return. Waddell commented later that year that the outrage “might have been a bit misplaced”, but conceded the bank “clearly misjudged the political environment”. He admitted that the scandal, “along with all the other incidents” had been detrimental to public perception of the banks.I’m a Christian. I believe in doing the right thing and that value that the bank stands on, which we call ‘integrity’, has really resonatedBut he says the industry’s reputation is now improving, despite the fact that rarely a week goes by without one of his peers reaching some sort of settlement with the Department of Justice or paying a penalty.“I’ve been a little surprised that with all these fines we haven’t seen even more backlash,” he says.While Northern Trust is “not perfect”, it tries to “do the right thing”, he says, and its values align with his own views.“I’m a Christian. I believe in doing the right thing and that value that the bank stands on, which we call ‘integrity’, has really resonated for me,” he says. “It’s hard for me . . . to imagine working for a company where you’re always in the news with a fine or a regulatory problem.”Waddell is no evangelist. He says he is not a weekly churchgoer and stresses that Northern Trust is an inclusive company even if he makes no bones about his faith guiding his work.In 2003, Waddell was tapped to lead Northern Trust’s corporate and institutional services unit. It was a “very, very big job” and the first major step towards his appointment as chief executive five years later.A colleague advised Waddell to use his first staff meeting to introduce himself to his new charges before he launched into his strategy for what is a bedrock unit of the 127-year-old financial institution.“I thought about that and I said, ‘Well, who am I?’” says Waddell. He stood before the crowd and said, “I just want you to know what my priorities are: number one is my faith, number two is my family, number three are my friends and number four is the Northern Trust. So that’s who I am.”Reflecting on this, he adds a fifth priority to the list: “Then golf . . . golf is very important to me.”"
36;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2015-12-06T03:44:02Z;Sovereign wealth funds desert asset managers;Asset managers have reluctantly revealed the effect redemptions are having on their business;"The majority of asset managers have been coy about their losses from sovereign wealth funds, but the chief financial officer of Northern Trust, the US financial services company, was very candid.Speaking during a call with analysts in October, Biff Bowman admitted the $887bn asset manager had suffered “significant outflows” from its sovereign wealth fund clients during the third quarter.His frankness about redemptions is exceptional at a time when most asset managers have attempted to sidestep questions about such outflows. Few will comment publicly.Either buried away in many third-quarter results or disclosed hesitantly during calls with analysts, asset managers have reluctantly revealed the effect redemptions from sovereign funds are having on their business.The government funds have pulled tens of billions of dollars from asset managers this year, linked at least in part to the collapse in the price of oil, which is an important source of funding for sovereigns. BlackRock, Franklin Resources, Invesco, Aberdeen Asset Management and the asset management arms of US banks State Street, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are all said to have suffered large outflows from sovereign funds.Few are expecting those redemptions to end any time soon. As Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen, the UK-listed fund house, warned last week: “We are going to see more redemptions from government institutions.”Robert Callagy, an analyst at Moody’s Investor Services, the rating agency, says: “I don’t think [the third-quarter redemptions from sovereign wealth funds] were a one-off.“Firms that have average performance and provide strategies that are not very differentiated from their peers are probably the ones most challenged [with outflows from government funds].”Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, predicts emerging market specialists such as Aberdeen, Ashmore and Franklin Resources, the $800bn US fund house, are most at risk of redemptions from sovereign funds.Revenues at BlackRock, the world’s largest manager, Old Mutual Asset Management and Invesco will also be under pressure if outflows from sovereign wealth funds continue, Morgan Stanley suggests.Sovereign wealth funds have been a growing source of revenue for investment managers over the past eight years. Globally they control around $7tn of assets, up from $3.3tn in 2007. More than a third of the $7tn is managed externally, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which tracks these vehicles.Many of these funds have negotiated lower fees compared with traditional institutional investors, according to analysts from Morgan Stanley. Nevertheless, large-scale redemptions will have a negative impact on revenues, experts say.The earnings per share of asset managers with the biggest exposure to sovereign fund redemptions could drop 7 per cent in the worst-case scenario. If redemptions continue at their current pace, earnings per share at Aberdeen would drop an estimated 4.1 per cent. At BlackRock this figure is 1.5 per cent; at Ashmore it is 1.4 per cent, Morgan Stanley says.Franklin, Aberdeen, BlackRock, Invesco and Ashmore declined to comment.Brett Perryman, head of investor relations at Old Mutual Asset Management, says: “OMAM is very comfortable with the level of our affiliates’ exposure to sovereign wealth funds around the world.“With just under $1.7bn of total [assets under management] from the Middle East, OMAM has minimal exposure to oil-sensitive funds, the source of most apparent concern in the industry.”More than two-thirds of non-US sovereign funds located in countries where oil plays a big part in their economy say they expect funding withdrawals due to sustained low prices for the commodity, according to research from Invesco, the $790bn asset manager. Saudi Arabia, whose deficit widened as oil prices slumped, has already pulled tens of billions of dollars from global asset managers.In contrast, only 13 per cent of non-US sovereigns located in countries with no oil exposure expect governments to withdraw funding, Invesco found.“This scenario where funds suffer withdrawals could continue, but it really depends on how long there is a sensitivity around oil prices and the need to provide finance to governments,” says Nick Tolchard, head of international development at Invesco.It is not just the oil price that is causing redemptions. Spooked by global volatility across different asset classes in recent months, sovereign wealth funds are also looking for more actively managed products, says Peter Laurelli, head of research at eVestment, which provides data on institutional investment.“Passive equity is most under pressure. Sovereign funds want to reduce exposure to long-only passive strategies in this period of heightened volatility,” he adds.The trend towards insourcing at sovereign wealth funds is hitting passive managers. Some government funds have decided to do more investment management internally.BlackRock said during its second-quarter results that “several large clients” had pulled $35bn from low-fee index equity products. These redemptions have been linked, in part, to sovereign wealth funds.But Morgan Stanley says both oil-rich and non-oil funds are still increasing their allocations to alternatives.Mr Callagy says: “The large alternative asset managers that offer a lot of different strategies — the likes of Blackstone, Oaktree and KKR — will continue to see capital come their way from sovereign wealth funds.”Morgan Stanley says alternative asset managers are benefiting from “longer-term lockups” that prevent redemptions until a specific time. “[Sovereign funds] will not be able to redeem quickly and will therefore most likely look to redeem from more liquid sources of capital,” the bank’s analysts say.Mr Tolchard says the recent panic around sovereign redemptions should be put into context. “Sovereign investors are long-term in nature. Their investment thesis remains broadly unchanged, even if there are calls on their funding [from governments].“One should view this current situation as some volatility but it is not something that is likely to change their long-term plans [to invest with asset managers].”As the price of oil dropped last year, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the world’s second-largest sovereign wealth fund, increased its efforts to manage more of its assets internally.In 2013, three-quarters of its estimated $770bn in assets were managed by external investment houses, but this dropped to 65 per cent by the end of 2014. The sovereign fund said the move was linked to its efforts in “recent years to strengthen the organisation’s in-house investment and analytical expertise”.The fund, which has 55 per cent of its asset’s invested in index-replicating strategies, hired several staff within its internal equities arm. It also tried to bring some active strategies in-house, creating a “high-conviction” mandate within the division.Although the ADIA’s 2014 review does not mention any withdrawal of assets by the Abu Dhabi government, it says it is required to make “the financial resources to secure and maintain the future welfare” available as needed by the state.The report adds: “Such withdrawals have occurred infrequently and usually during periods of extreme or prolonged weakness in commodity prices.”The price of oil — which along with gas accounts for about 40 per cent of Abu Dhabi’s gross domestic product — has plummeted since mid-2014, falling from around $110 to $44 a barrel."

38;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2015-09-01T15:25:52Z;Northern Trust flags surge in ESG funds;Growth spurred by generational shift towards more responsible investing;Northern Trust, one of the world’s largest investment managers, expects stronger growth in its environmental, social and governance integrated funds from a shift towards more responsible investing.Assets under management in ESG reached $60bn in June from $20bn four years earlier, said Mamadou-Abou Sarr, global head of ESG investments at the Chicago-based trust. Growth “will accelerate”, he said, without giving estimates for the rate of increase.Mr Sarr expects some growth to come from new money but emphasised that a good proportion would come from converting money in existing funds. Momentum for ESG, he said, was driven by regulatory change, a more environmentally conscious younger generation and the view that climate change poses financial as well as environmental risks.There was scope for product innovation, particularly in fixed income, which was still the biggest asset class for investors but where there were relatively few ESG funds.In the past two years, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, which started to track these issues in 2012, assets have grown by 61 per cent. In that period, the global sustainable investment market rose from $13.3tn at the outset of 2012 to $21.4tn at the start of 2014, and from 21.5 per cent to 30.2 per cent of professionally managed assets in the developed world.“Momentum is great,” Mr Sarr said, in reference to countries in Asia such as Japan and Malaysia, adding that the biggest ESG market was the US. “Innovation is important, not just on the equity side but on the fixed interest side.”Leading investors such as Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and large university endowments have been leaders in focusing on fossil fuels, abandoning shares of coal companies for example, while some pension funds refuse to invest in tobacco companies.The movement to divest from fossil fuels has some powerful friends.

Sales were hurt by a strong dollar and the company’s decision to divest some of its businesses.Profits slid 11 per cent to $5.5bn, or $5.54 per share.

44;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2014-03-30T07:09:17Z;The ‘Gray Lady’ harbours global aspirations;CEO Frederick Waddell says Northern Trust focuses on clients, not raising its profile;Frederick Waddell, chairman and chief executive of Northern Trust, projects serenity and politesse, but this belies his hectic schedule. His meeting with the FT is shoehorned into a 45-minute slot that coincides with a modest sandwich lunch in London ahead of meetings in Luxembourg in the afternoon.For a US senior executive visiting Europe, this kind of timetable is not unusual, but it seems this is typical of Mr Waddell’s diary even at home in Chicago.“There is an expectation from the board that I will visit more than 300 clients or prospective clients every year,” he says. Assuming most clients do not have meetings on weekends, that is more than one a day.But 300 is just the baseline – Mr Waddell says he actually racks up more than 400 meetings each year, and his senior managers are expected to spend similar amounts of time in front of clients.“We are very client focused,” he says. For all this contact with clients, it is hard to pin down a clear idea of what Northern Trust – which offers asset and wealth management among other financial services – considers its unique selling point. Its Chicago nickname of “The Gray Lady of La Salle Street” seems well earned.Although it is a significant player in all the markets where it has business, it is top in none and does not have the same high profile as some of its rivals.At the end of December 2013, Northern Trust had $884.5bn in assets under management and $5.6tn in assets under custody, putting it comfortably in the top 20 asset managers globally, and the top 10 custodians.It also has $103bn in banking assets, primarily in the US.Mr Waddell, who has been with the business since graduating from Dartmouth in 1975, will not be drawn on whether he regards asset services or wealth management as the core of Northern Trust, saying: “I love both my children equally.” Wealth management is based primarily in the US, where Northern Trust was set up 124 years ago, but Mr Waddell has “aspirational hopes of taking that business more global at the very, very high end. So think of family offices with $500m or $5bn in assets.”This is one reason for his presence in London, where Northern Trust has a large asset servicing capability. He hopes it will serve as a platform for growing the wealth management business.The other side of Northern Trust, better known outside the US, is institutional asset servicing and asset management. An attempt to get ahead of the trend 20 years ago by moving into the defined contribution investment management space was unsuccessful, and the DC business was sold to Hewett in 2003. Since then the company has focused on building up capability in custody, fund administration, and investment operations outsourcing. This is now paying off, says Mr Waddell.The trend he sees is for large institutions to keep money management in-house, but outsource middle and back-office functions. This trend has been in evidence for at least the past 10 years, but Mr Waddell sees no end to it. He thinks it is worth being a first mover in this area. Even though it might be expected that many mandates given in the early years would be up for retendering now, there is little turnover in practice.“It is a sticky business. Even in the custody part, it is very difficult to switch custodians, and to my mind it is even more difficult to change a middle-office service provider.”One of the biggest drivers of a new wave of outsourcing is the increasing amount of regulation asset managers have to deal with since the financial crisis. Northern Trust is ready, having set up an office of regulatory review in 2009.“I told them I wanted an in-depth analysis of every piece of regulation that was being talked about and reviewed and implemented, so that we knew how it might affect our business,” says Mr Waddell. “But I said I also want you to be aware of revenue opportunities.” Northern Trust’s asset services business originally got off the ground following the US 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa), shortly after Mr Waddell joined the company, so he is very aware of the advantages of regulation for Northern Trust.The US pensions market is still important for the company, as it is a solution provider for DC schemes, in particular those looking for support in offering target-date solutions to its members. Mr Waddell thinks this plays to Northern Trust’s strengths, largely its client focus. Schemes require a commitment to support a company’s human resources function in educating members, providing a product simple enough for members to understand, but appropriate for their risk profiles.Target-date funds usually involve using passive funds, an area that Mr Waddell sees as increasingly interesting. Apart from the standard passive funds replicating mainstream indices, he believes there is an appetite for “ engineered equity” – smart beta is another term often used. “We have the ability to construct passive indices that maybe favour a particular investment theme or outlook that our client has, so we are seeing that being very, very popular.”Other investment managers are coming up with smart-beta products based on investment insights such as fundamentally weighted or minimum volatility indices. True to its wealth management heritage, Northern Trust’s speciality is tax-optimised products, “for our wealth clients, where we have the ability to construct an index and then harvest losses in an individual’s stockholdings to offset against gains, so you get a higher after-tax return”.Whatever the product, Northern Trust clients can be sure Mr Waddell is not distracted by outside interests. When asked what he does in his spare time, he answers: “I have balance in my life, sure. I have a great team of people, obviously, that run the business during the day. It is just, you know, I would rather spend [time] with clients than regulators.”It appears his concept of life balance is balancing client time with management time.——————————————-Curriculum vitaeFrederick WaddellBorn 1954Education1975 BA, Dartmouth College1979 MBA, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern UniversityCareerNorthern Trust1975 Service representative in Northern Trust’s banking department2003 Head of corporate and institutional services business, Northern Trust2006 President and chief operating officer of Northern Trust2008 Chief executive2009 Chairman——————————————-Northern TrustFounded 1889Headquarters ChicagoAssets under management $884bnAssets under custody $5.6tnEmployees 14,800Ownership Nasdaq-listed company
45;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2014-02-21T20:44:19Z;Select Wall Street banks cleared to use own risk models;;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup are among the banks that have successfully completed trial runs using their own models to assess risk and capital requirements.However, Citi said in a statement that the Fed allowed it to use its own models only after insisting it changed its capital calculation. Under the new calculation agreed with the Fed, Citi’s assets increased by $56bn and its main capital ratio fell from 10.5 per cent to 10.1 per cent.The announcement by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday gives those banks clarity on what methods they can use to calculate their capital requirements.During the trial run, banks had to show they could comply with a more tailored approach to meeting capital requirements for four consecutive calendar quarters before they could officially rely on that method.The Fed announced that eight bank holding companies, eight national banks, and four state member banks had satisfactory trials, ending a more than five-year limbo period for the largest US banks that had been waiting to hear the results.Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, Northern Trust Corporation and US Bancorp were also among the banks that successfully completed the trial.Bank of America and Wells Fargo were among the largest banks that were not on the list, meaning they have not yet met the requirements. Bank of America started the trial run process later so the results announced on Friday were not surprising, a person familiar with the bank said. The tailored framework known as the advanced approach applies to banks with at least $250bn in total consolidated assets, or at least $10bn in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure.Under this approach, a bank’s operational risk for capital is determined based on a bank’s internal models, which take into account internal loss data, external data and other factors. The standardised approach for smaller banks is based on a more simplified model based on their gross income and other factors.The trial runs began after US regulators approved final Basel II rules in 2007, leading to questions as to whether there were problems with the banks because regulators had not announced clearance for those companies for several years.In the timeframe that the banks were in the trial run, the updated Basel III accord was approved and the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill was passed, and those standards had to be incorporated into the trial run. The US also had some of the most stringent requirements for the advanced capital approach, which took time for the banks to meet.The banks that have been cleared will use the advanced approach framework to calculate their risk-based capital starting with the second quarter of this year.The Fed gave bank holding companies another year to incorporate the advanced approach in capital planning and stress test exercises to October 2015, compared with the October 2014 date in earlier proposals.Once the capital rules are fully implemented, the banks must have a minimum ratio of 4.5 per cent of common equity tier one capital to risk-weighted assets, with an additional buffer of 2.5 per cent. Tier one capital is the best quality and includes equity and reserves.The minimum ratio of tier one capital to risk-weighted assets is 6 per cent while there is a minimum leverage ratio of 4 per cent, compared to the 3 per cent requirement in Basel III.

50;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2013-07-02T20:53:11Z;US custody banks face ratings downgrade;;Moody’s has placed the credit ratings of the three biggest US custody banks on review for a downgrade in a move that illustrates the continued pressure of record low interest rates on the businesses of some of the largest financial institutions.Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust and State Street would most likely see their ratings trimmed by one notch, Moody’s said in a statement on Tuesday.Historic low interest rates in the US have wreaked havoc on the business models of custody banks – which rely on eking out small amounts of money by managing and protecting trillions of dollars worth of securities on behalf of their customers.“Moody’s will focus on the long-term profitability challenges facing these very highly rated banks,” the rating agency said. “As interest rates rise, the banks’ earnings pressures will recede. However, the demonstrated vulnerability of their business models to protracted low interest rates constitutes a concentration risk.”BNYMellon is currently rated Aa3 – three notches below triple A, the highest credit rating available. State Street and Northern Trust are rated four notches below at A1.Moody’s also warned that the custody banks, which have big portfolios of bonds and other securities, could be hit by new rules governing the amount of regulatory capital they have to hold. Under proposed Basel III regulations banks will have to include interest rate-related securities losses in their capital calculations.“The declining value of fixed-rate securities in a rising rate environment, realised or as part of a stress test, would reduce regulatory capital,” Moody’s said. “This could influence the banks to alter their investment policies and result in an increase to their risk profiles.”The trust banks have already been trimming millions of dollars of expenses in recent years to offset the record low interest rates. Some have also been exploring new lines of business, including collateral transformation, to boost profits.While rising rates may affect banks which have built up very large securities portfolios, they could also provide a boost to the industry’s profit margins on other services.A 100 basis point increase in interest rates could lead to a $575m increase in annual pre-tax income at BNYMellon, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse. State Street could get a $165m boost in pre-tax income and Northern Trust a $110m increase.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
53;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2013-05-17T23:12:18Z;Gold comes under pressure as institutional investors flee;;Gold came under pressure this week, hitting a one-month low as financial investors turned to equities and continued to liquidate their holdings in the yellow metal.The weakness came as the latest filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that Northern Trust and BlackRock were leading sellers of the US SPDR GLD exchange traded fund in the first quarter of 2013.John Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager and the largest owner of shares in the GLD fund, maintained his position.ETF selling had continued into April, said Commerzbank. “The exit on the part of institutional investors is likely to have continued in the second quarter,” said the bank.Institutional investors have been consistent sellers of ETFs since late last year, and net outflows from the sector totalled 177 tonnes in the first quarter, according to the World Gold Council, the lobby group for gold miners. Gold demand totalled 963 tonnes, down 13 per cent in the first three months of the year, compared with the same time last year, said the council.The gold price fell 5.5 per cent on the week to $1,367.65, falling below a technical support level of $1,400 a troy ounce.Although buying of jewellery and coins has provided support for gold amid the consistent selling by institutional investors, analysts wonder how long the physical purchases can last.According to the World Gold Council, Chinese demand rose 20 per cent in the first quarter, boosted by a 19 per cent rise in jewellery demand and a 22 per cent rise in bar and coin investments. Indian purchases increased 27 per cent, with jewellery demand up 15 per cent.Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Barclays, said: “As we enter the period beyond seasonal demand, gold prices are likely to find reduced support from the physical market and are exposed to further downside risk in the near term.”One factor that could damp enthusiasm for gold in India, are the new import restrictions by the Reserve Bank of India that were announced on Monday.The RBI in a circular said: “To moderate the demand for gold for domestic use, it has been decided to restrict the import of gold on consignment basis by banks, only to meet the genuine needs of exporters of gold jewellery.”Barclays forecasts an average gold price of $1,350 a troy ounce in the second quarter of this year, while Credit Suisse predicted that with worries about inflation and a eurozone collapse easing, the yellow metal would fall to $1,100 in a year’s time.
54;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2013-03-04T18:59:26Z;Wall Street’s latest idea;Banks have high hopes for the collateral transformation business – but regulators are raising concerns;For centuries, scientists and philosophers attempted to turn cheap base metals into the precious gold and silver used as ancient coinage. Now, bankers are endeavouring to achieve a Wall Street equivalent.Known as “ collateral transformation”, this new business is emerging as a rare bright spot in the banking industry. On Wall Street, where new regulations and competitive pressures have hurt profits, there are hopes it will boost bank earnings.Yet collateral transformation – which involves turning relatively risky assets into ostensibly safer ones – is already capturing the attention of regulators.In essence, the banks have found a business opportunity inside the thicket of new rules designed to make the $640tn derivatives market – which was at the heart of the financial crisis – less risky. To some financial experts, it is eerily reminiscent of the slicing and dicing of subprime loans that helped fuel the financial boom and bust. They worry that the business could end up hiding risk rather than transforming it – potentially undermining the purpose of the rules that have helped spur its creation.Collateral transformation “is exactly the kind of activity where new regulation could create the potential for rapid growth and where we therefore need to be especially watchful,” Jeremy Stein, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, said last month, the US central bank’s first public warning about the nascent business.Yet in the financial industry, collateral transformation is viewed simply as a tool to comply with new rules. The process involves banks helping funds pledge their illiquid securities, in exchange for more liquid collateral which can then be used to back derivatives trades.“It’s a new cottage industry that’s emerging,” says Supurna VedBrat, co-head of electronic trading and market structure at BlackRock. She estimates that her company, the world’s largest asset manager, will need far more high-quality collateral to comply with the new rules on derivatives trades. And she is seeking help to meet the growing demand for good collateral.Wall Street banks, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are ready to assist. The banks plan to create the collateral that customers such as BlackRock need to back derivatives deals.At Bank of New York Mellon, Nadine Chakar has for several months been discussing with clients its new transformation service. The bank – which specialises in safeguarding trillions of dollars of assets – told its investors last year that it hopes to offset lower income from its older businesses with new demand for collateral transformation.So far, BNY Mellon’s clients – which range from boutique hedge funds to mega-insurers and asset managers – have been enthusiastic, says Ms Chakar, executive vice-president of the bank’s global collateral services.“As we talk to more buyside clients we see that collateral transformation activities are going to be needed by them,” she says.Beginning this year, those insurers and asset managers will be required by many global regulators to run their derivatives trades through so-called central counterparties (CCPs). This shift to central clearing is the culmination of almost five years of co-operation between international watchdogs to clamp down on the products once described as “financial weapons of mass destruction”.In September 2008 Matt King, a strategist at Citigroup, took note of a remote corner of financial markets. While investors in big banks had been fretting about losses on repackaged subprime losses, there was a bigger problem looming.“The major question facing all financials going forward is not one of writedowns, but one of funding and leverage,” Mr King wrote. “The very same features which are designed to make ‘repo’ safe for cash lenders do tend to create risks for those who depend on it for their borrowing.”To continue reading, click hereNew rules including Basel III, the Dodd-Frank law in the US, and the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) all mandate the use of central clearing. The idea, regulators say, is that CCPs stand between the two sides of a trade, providing a buffer by guaranteeing the derivatives transaction if one party defaults.To protect themselves from market turmoil, the CCPs collect collateral, or “margin”, from the long line of customers who still use derivatives. The collateral typically comes in the form of government bonds or cash – securities considered safe enough to protect the clearing house if a derivatives user were to default.How much extra collateral will be needed is a subject of hot debate. Estimates have ranged from $500bn to as much as $10tn. While banks and traders have been accused of using derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to bet on the fortunes of other financial entities, thousands of companies and funds depend on products such as interest rate or currency swaps.“We’re talking about new collateral requirements of several trillion but, in fact, nobody knows because it will depend on a lot of factors,” says Hélène Virello, head of collateral management at BNP Paribas, the French investment bank.For all its alchemic connotations, the process of transforming ineligible collateral into something accepted by the CCPs is simple, based on decades-old securities lending and repurchase, or “repo”, desks at the banks. These desks typically lend out securities – from government bonds to small-cap stocks – in exchange for cash.“It’s not a new idea, it’s a new way of packaging,” says Jamie Lake, a former Goldman Sachs collateral manager who now works at capital markets consultancy GreySpark. “The transformation business is just going to be like the repo business.”In a typical deal, an insurance company might come to a bank with a portfolio of lower-rated assets such as junk bonds. The bank would lend the bonds out in the repo market – typically to another big bank – in exchange for government bonds or cash. The government debt or cash can then be used as collateral to back the insurer’s centrally cleared derivatives trades.Like the CCPs, banks providing the service will charge fees and take a slice of security from their clients in exchange for the transformation. The collateral comes in the form of a “haircut”, or a clipped portion of the asset’s market value. “The haircut is basically what equalises otherwise unequal collateral,” says David Little of Calypso Technology, which provides clearing software for big banks.For riskier collateral, such as junk bonds, banks would be expected to hold back a bigger slice of the asset being transformed. If the value of the bonds were to fall, the bank would be able to resort to its own collateral to make the trade whole.“The haircut may be different from what the CCPs are calling for,” says Judson Baker at Northern Trust, another custody bank. “It’s going to be your own proprietary haircut to get you comfortable with the risk of that particular asset.”At present there are no reliable estimates of the potential profits for the banking industry. But Morgan Stanley and consultant Oliver Wyman wrote in a report last year that revenues from the collateral transformation “are likely to offset much of those lost” when new regulations kick in that may inhibit some of the banks’ old moneymaking practices.“Banks are all gearing up for it but they’re not yet sure whether it’s going to be a big elephant or a little mouse,” says Mr Little.But banks also say they are wary of assuming too much risk when providing the new service. If they load up on too many substandard assets, it could hurt their own business by consuming big portions of their balance sheets.Customers may find it easier and cheaper to shuffle their portfolios of assets to free up eligible collateral. JPMorgan told clients last week that “optimising” existing collateral would cost a tenth as much as transforming a three-month US corporate bond into an equivalent US Treasury.If banks are reluctant or unable to provide all of the transformation needed by their customers, then other financial entities might step in – including historically risk-averse lenders such as pension funds.“Don’t think of all of the transformation occurring on our balance sheet,” Gerald Hassell, BNY Mellon chief executive, said in response to a recent question about the risks posed to it by its new transformation business. “Some of our role is to be an intermediary between parties where we act as the agent.”Funds with large portfolios of low-yielding but high-quality securities may want to eke out extra profits from assets by lending them out. “We might see new liquidity providers like sovereign wealth funds or well-capitalised pension funds step in to earn additional yield and provide a portion of this needed liquidity,” says Mr Baker.The possibility of new providers of collateral has elicited an unusual response from some bankers: a warning about potential risks to the financial system.“As long as these guys know what they’re doing it won’t introduce more risk. It will increase the amount of financing activity but not the risk,” says one senior banker who declined to be named. “But if you get a shadow group who are providing financing, who don’t understand the risk, and who aren’t charging the right haircut, then this could introduce more systemic risk into the financial system.”The risk is that the new business could create longer and more complicated chains of collateral, which are more susceptible to vicious feedback loops when market values start to slide.Mr Stein, the Fed governor, warned that investors who transform collateral could end up facing “margin calls”. That means an insurance company that swapped junk bonds for US Treasuries, for instance, would either have to stump up more cash to make good on the collateral upgrade or start unwinding its derivative trade if the value of the bonds began to fall.Manmohan Singh, an economist at the International Monetary Fund who specialises in collateral issues, worries that banks may manipulate their regulatory capital requirements to undertake the activity profitably. That could mean they were not well insulated if markets crashed.“You just can’t transform a triple B-rated asset into triple-A without it costing you,” says Mr Singh. “If banks do this in large sums it will cost them their risk-weighted assets. That’s something I feel the regulators will need to be mindful of.”In the meantime, banks including Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and State Street are preparing to provide the service. A recent Fed survey shows more than two-thirds of big banks are talking to customers about collateral transformation. Pension funds also say they are discussing lending out their safer assets.Mr Lake adds: “You’re going to end up with this whole industry around the regulation that may unintentionally make where the risk actually lies less transparent.”With additional reporting by Shahien Nasiripour in Washington, Lisa Pollack in London and Cardiff Garcia in New York.
55;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2013-02-03T03:18:58Z;Bridgewater deal is tip of risk iceberg;Hedge fund manager’s move highlights operational threats;Bridgewater, the world’s largest hedge fund manager, surprised the investment world last month when it hired a second administrator, Northern Trust, to duplicate and back up the work of its existing provider BNY Mellon across its portfolios.The move is unprecedented and, most likely, highly expensive. It also illustrates the pressure on asset managers to provide total security for their operations, particularly as technology develops at a lightning pace and hackers, fraudsters and bugs threaten firms. Since the financial crisis, there has been plenty of discussion about investment and counterparty risk, but less about assessing operational exposure.Asset managers require technology to execute most of their core operations, including handling clients’ money and data, analysing and trading the markets, and settling, accounting for and reporting transactions. The risks to these operations can be micro in nature, as when a technology system or provider fails or its security is breached, or macro, as when the workings of an entire financial system or trading network are compromised.“Expansion of counterparty risk beyond financial transactions, looking at operational counterparties and representing and quantifying that risk is a focus for our clients,” says Ben Keeler, practice development director at investment management consultancy Citisoft. “The large global firms have been out ahead on this for quite a while, but it’s also coming back to small and medium-sized firms.”Although firms have tightened up security since the financial crisis, they have had to fend off numerous operational threats. In 2010, the US stock market suffered a “ flash crash” that briefly reduced the listed worth of huge companies to almost zero.In 2011, UBS uncovered a multibillion-dollar fraud involving trader Kweku Adoboli. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, it caused power cuts all over Wall Street. This year, rumours of hacking have continued to plague US banks following repeated website outages.On a micro level, the first step a firm can take to reduce these problems is to broaden the number of technology providers it uses in case one of them is hit. However, not many have adopted Bridgewater’s “doubling up” in any part of their business, let alone all of it.“Few have taken the step of employing multiple providers as a fail-safe. Some firms have adopted a strategy where they use different providers for different parts of their business,” says Mr Keeler.If a technology system fails, it can take a while to find an alternative provider, says Sam Auxier, principal at audit and consulting giant Deloitte. “At certain points in the value chain there are minimal plans for real back-up. Asset managers are very exposed to software vendors.”Storing back-up software and data in a remotely held cloud – effectively a physical off-site server – is becoming the industry’s solution to this problem, according to Lyn Marcrum, senior analyst at consultancy Aite Group.However, the security of the back-up is only as good as the server or location in which the server is housed. If the server is compromised, or the location experiences a fault or natural disaster, firms can find that their fallback disappears. “The back-up is crossed fingers in many cases,” says Ms Marcrum.And although remote computing solves a number of problems for the industry, such as backing up software and data, it is also creating them, according to Jim Petitto and Deborah Cicerone, managing directors at Beacon Consulting Group. They cite not only cloud computing as a threat to security, but also mobile computing. On top of this, companies have to handle systemic threats such as “flash crashes” or the failure of a globally significant operational service provider. Automatic trading systems must be programmed to stop trading when the market exhibits extreme behaviour, and asset managers must assess the trickle down impact of the bankruptcy of a giant outsourced service provider.Operational issues such as these are no longer simple “business risks” for asset managers. Despite widespread reform since the financial crisis, authorities are sensing systems are still flawed.In a letter to chief executives published in December last year, the UK’s Financial Services Authority warned: “Some firms appear to rely on the fact that the outsource service provider is a large financial institution which regulators might look to rescue using public funds. We are concerned that this approach lacks prudence.”As asset managers’ operations come under increasing strain, regulators are starting to apply their own pressure as well.This article also appears in Fundfire, a Financial Times service
56;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2013-01-13T04:43:38Z;Hedge fund buys extra help;Bridgewater brings in Northern Trust to back up BNY Mellon;Hedge fund company Bridgewater Associates has divided opinion with a “transformative” new approach to asset servicing, bringing in Northern Trust to duplicate and back up the work of its existing administrator BNY Mellon.The arrangement, which goes live in 2014 and has been hailed as unprecedented in the asset management industry, is a result of an “extensive two-year due diligence process to identify a firm with the financial stability, expertise, global scale, and technological infrastructure to support Bridgewater”, Northern Trust said in a statement.“In a role that will create approximately 100 jobs in Chicago and Stamford, Northern Trust will provide broad middle-office and back-office services including replicating various administrative processing, trade processing, valuation, real-time reporting, cash management, accounting and collateral management services,” the Chicago-based company said.The plan leaves Bridgewater, which has $130bn under management, with a back-up plan in case one of its administrators should make a critical error or fail. The deal will also force the administrators to compete on comparable – and, to Bridgewater, highly visible – metrics.Experts point out that hiring two service providers to perform the same task is not necessitated by regulation and is likely to be unusually costly for Bridgewater and/or its clients.“It sounds super-expensive. There’s got to be something else in it for them, and I’m racking my brains trying to think what it is,” said Lyn Marcrum, senior analyst at Aite Group.Bridgewater is tight-lipped about the deal, declining to comment beyond the information provided in a press release.Whatever the outcome for Bridgewater and its clients, the deal appears to be a coup for Northern Trust. The asset servicer acquired hedge fund administrator Omnium in July 2011 and transformed it into its hedge fund services department specifically to be able to bring in more alternatives investment business.This article also appears in Fundfire, a Financial Times service
57;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-10-17T11:51:51Z;Brokers urged to speed up US share trades;;Investors and brokers are being urged to cut the time it takes to settle US equity trades, a modernising move that could have its biggest impact on sleepy regional stockbrokers and on investors who prefer paper stock certificates.Two industry-run groups are trying to forge a consensus to reduce settlement times, for fear that the current three-day cycle is an unresolved source of risk to the financial system.The initiative could run into opposition from broker-dealers who wish to avoid investing in the required technology, particularly given the other changes already demanded of them by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms.But proponents of the change point to a recent study which found the industry would recoup its costs through operational efficiencies and because brokers would not have to post so much margin with clearing houses while their trades remain in limbo.Michael Bodson, chief executive of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which commissioned the study, said it was now more than a decade since the industry last examined – and rejected – the idea of shortening the settlement cycle. The DTCC is suggesting the change for three classes of investment beloved of retail investors: equities, corporate and municipal bonds, and unit investment trusts.“Post-2008, there has been a lot of emphasis across the industry on looking at sources of systemic risk and on how to control it, and on capital efficiency,” Mr Bodson said. “Risk can appear very, very quickly and shortening the settlement cycle is something we can do that will improve our risk management capabilities.”The EU is pushing towards harmonisation of its settlement cycle at two days.Russell Stamey, head of relationship management for the investment managers’ liaison group at the asset management firm Northern Trust, said that retail investors would see little disruption if the settlement cycle is reduced to two days, but could begin to see changes if it is reduced to one.“An example is the handling of physical cheques, which might not clear within a T+1 settlement timeframe today. We would also need dematerialisation of physical certificates.”Boston Consulting Group concluded earlier this month that the transition to T+2 would cost the US financial industry $550m upfront, but the cost would be recouped in three years through operational savings of $170m annually and a $25m cut in payments into the clearing fund.A more ambitious move to T+1 would cost $1.77bn, and take 10 years for payback.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which assisted the DTCC with the study, called it “an important first step” in the process. It put the issue of settlement times on the agenda of its asset managers’ forum last week and plans a webinar to educate members.

59;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-08-09T15:16:04Z;‘Financial plumbing’ faces new hurdle;;The order accusing Standard Chartered of hiding 60,000 secret transactions with Iranian companies highlights the intricacies of the world’s payment clearing system and creates new hurdles for the banks which provide such financial plumbing.Big custodian banks such as Bank of New York Mellon safeguard investors’ assets and provide basic services including clearing payments and settling transactions. While the custody business has been tricky for years, analysts say this week’s allegations against StanChart could lead to further headaches for the industry.StanChart, which is headquartered in London but has extensive international operations, is accused by the New York state’s Department of Financial Services, of concealing $250bn worth of payments cleared by the bank on behalf of a number of Iranian companies.“Global custodian banks act on behalf of their clients as users – rather than as providers – of post-trade processing services,” says Brad Hintz, banking analyst with AllianceBernstein. “It is the sub-custodians [such as StanChart] that actually perform the ‘operational plumbing’ of the global custody business.”Sub-custodians function as a network of payment processors, able to funnel money and trades from far-flung markets to larger custody banks headquartered in New York.Mr Hintz estimates that BNY Mellon may rely on StanChart for its businesses in Bangladesh and Taiwan. Northern Trust and State Street, the two other custodian banks, are exposed to StanChart in markets including Botswana, Ghana and Kenya. JPMorgan Chase, which has its own large custodian business, is exposed in countries including India, Pakistan, South Korea and Thailand.Big custody banks may now “fall under increased scrutiny” from their clients, says Mr Hintz. “Standard Chartered, despite its well-regarded capabilities in emerging markets back office operations, could quickly become a liability to the US custodial banks.”The order also highlights the importance of New York as a financial centre for such operational services. StanChart has a New York banking licence that allows it to clear US dollar payments through the Clearing House Interbank Payment System, a New York-based system known as “Chips.”Chips is one of two payment transfer systems for large transactions in the US, handling about $2tn worth of dollar payments a day. Fedwire, run and owned by the US central bank, is the other but it can be more expensive to use than Chips since banks must “prefund” their planned payments at the start of every day.“In the [unlikely] event that the NY DFS banned Standard Chartered from operating in New York it could instead use Fedwire to clear global US dollar trades provided that it is not banned from operating in the US by the Department of Justice or Federal Reserve,” says Cormac Leech, analyst at Liberum Capital.StanChart says it was one of the first non-US banks to join Chips and now clears about $195bn worth of dollar payments a day – making it the seventh biggest clearer of US dollar transactions in the world.The Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or Swift, is the equivalent system for international payments and transfers. The DFS says StanChart camouflaged Iranian payments by altering Swift codes on wires sent to the US.For many years the US allowed its local banks to process special transactions with Iranian financials and other companies. The transactions, known as “U-Turns”, effectively allowed non-US countries to trade with Iran using dollars, and route those transactions through the US, under certain strict conditions.However, according to the DFS order, StanChart disguised payments that would not have qualified as U-Turn transactions by removing and then replacing the Swift codes.StanChart “provided step by step ‘wire stripping’ instructions for any payment messages containing information that would identify Iranian clients”, the DFS says in its order. Later the bank set up an “automated process” that would electronically disguise New York-bound wire transfers for its Iranian clients, the DFS says.StanChart says that “well over 99.9 per cent” of its transactions with Iran complied with the U-Turn regulations. “The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-Turn was under $14m,” the bank said in a statement on Monday.The DFS was able to issue the order against StanChart because of the bank’s New York presence. The department regulates a number of other financials with New York state banking licences including Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon.Now the DFS is threatening to revoke StanChart’s New York licence, which would take away its ability to clear dollar payments through Chips.That could prove painful for a bank which specialises in international trade finance, as well as hit larger custody banks higher up in the financial system.“It’s definitely a leap to automatically implicate everybody in the food chain,” says Glenn Schorr, banking analyst at Nomura. “It’s a painful, annoying process to change your custodian or sub-custodian. But I think that based on the outcome of how badly Standard Chartered might have acted, certain companies might not have a choice.”

61;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-07-18T17:05:17Z;BNY Mellon profits hit by settlement charges;;Bank of New York Mellon, the world’s biggest custody bank, reported the third consecutive decline in quarterly profits due to low interest rates and a legal settlement.Second-quarter net profit fell by more than a third to $466m, or 39 cents a share, in the three months to June, BNY Mellon said. Profit was eroded by $212m, or 18 cents a share, because of a legal settlement related to Sigma Finance, the complex debt fund that collapsed during the financial crisis. Quarterly revenue also fell, down 6 per cent to $3.62 billion from $3.85 billion.The lower earnings are likely to increase analyst concerns over custodian banks’ business models in the face of low interest rates. The banks invest and manage money on behalf of clients but their profit margins have also been reduced by interest rates at record lows in the US and the European Central Bank’s recent rate cut.“I think we can hold these levels,” Tom Gibbons, chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. “We do have some headwinds here because we do tend to leave some money at the European central bank and in the past that would have received a little bit of an interest rate. We won’t see that going forward for the foreseeable future.”The three big trust banks – BNY Mellon, State Street and Northern Trust – have responded to the continued interest rate pressure by cutting costs and building new business. State Street earlier this week reported a 4 per cent drop in net profits to $480m, while Northern Trust reported an 18 per cent increase in net income to $179.6m, helped by lower expenses and new acquisitions.Record levels of assets under custody of $27.1tn were not enough to boost profit at BNY Mellon, however. The company’s net interest margin - a key measure of its profitability – fell to 1.25 per cent from 1.41 per cent in the second quarter of last year. The bank is already implementing a programme aimed at reducing expenses by $700m.There’s “not a whole lot” that the company can do to expand the margin, Mr Gibbons told analysts. The bank has already been investing some of its portfolio in higher-yielding assets, including securities backed by home mortgages.BNY Mellon has also started a global secured lending programme, which enables it to lend out clients’ assets in exchange for fees, and is building up more esoteric financial businesses such as collateral management and transformation.“We also see some opportunities, for example, in trade finance as you have had a number of folks exit,” Mr Gibbons said. “That’s another area that we would be looking to push.”The ECB earlier this month reduced its benchmark rate to a record low of 0.75 per cent from 1 per cent and cut its deposit rate from 0.25 per cent to zero, putting further pressure on money market funds, important clients for custody banks.BNY Mellon’s fees from investment services fell 5 per cent to $1.7bn after the company sold one of its business and waived more fees for money market funds.Shares in the company rose 1.3 per cent to $22.01 in early New York trading.Analysts had expected BNY Mellon to report adjusted profit of 52 cents a share. The reported results equate to adjusted earnings of about 57 cents a share, said Howard Chen, analyst at Credit Suisse, meaning BNY Mellon beat estimates by a modest five cents.
62;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Northern Trust profits rise on new business;;Northern Trust’s profits rose in the first quarter as the custody bank won business and stock markets rallied.The Chicago-based group said net income rose 7 per cent to $161.2m, on revenues up 8 per cent to $965.4m, in line with analysts’ expectations, according to Bloomberg.Northern Trust also raised its quarterly dividend to $0.30 per common share, up 7 per cent on the year before, and increased its stock repurchase programme following the conclusion of bank stress tests by the Federal Reserve. The company said that it was “one of only two major US banks that did not cut its quarterly dividend throughout the financial crisis”.Non-interest expenses at the bank were 9 per cent higher than the year before, partly because of a seasonal rise in staffing costs. Like larger peers State Street and Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust has begun to restructure, cutting 700 jobs in the first quarter.Frederick Waddell, chairman and chief executive, said “expenses, excluding charges, improved sequentially, evidencing our continued efforts to improve productivity and profitability”.Assets under custody rose 5.5 per cent to $4.6tn and assets under management were 8 per cent higher at $717bn. The company continues to waive fees in its money market business while short term interest rates remain near zero, at a cost of $14m in the first quarter, a figure which is up slightly on the year before.Shares in Northern Trust were flat at $46.26 in early New York trading.
63;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-04-08T03:11:16Z;Managers still see US shares as good value;Survey reveals bullish view despite 24% rally in the S&P 500;The majority of institutional asset managers believe US equities remain attractively valued, despite a 24 per cent rally in the S&P 500 index in the past six months, according to a quarterly survey of 100 managers conducted by Northern Trust.They are most bullish on the technology and energy sectors, as well as emerging markets in general. However, the bulk of respondents believe the outlook is bleak for the utilities and telecoms sectors, as well as for investment-grade fixed income securities.Some 43 per cent of the managers expect US growth to accelerate over the next six months, a jump from just 29 per cent when the survey was last conducted in December. For the first time in two years more managers think US house prices will rise in the next six months rather than fall.More than three-quarters expect US corporate earnings to rise or remain stable in 2012. Market volatility is broadly expected to decline in the coming six months, while correlations between stocks are seen falling from the record high levels of late 2011. However, concerns remain that the eurozone debt crisis could yet derail US equity markets.Chris Vella of Northern Trust said: “Despite continuing concern about the situation in Europe, institutional investment managers saw more positive signals in the first quarter this year than they did at the end of 2011.”

However, depositaries cannot be responsible for risks that are beyond their control as the measures currently suggest (for example, the risk of fraud by third parties).To make depositaries liable in this way would cause significant and undesirable disruption to financial markets, particularly around collateral management practices and the clearing of derivatives. It could also result in increased systemic risk. Such outcomes are markedly counter to the tenets of the Group of 20 commitments, and the regulatory response to the financial crisis.We believe that an appropriate balance can be achieved that protects investors, limits systemic risk and respects the original consensus reached on the AIFMD.Ranjit Chatterji, Chair, Association of Global CustodiansThe Association of Global Custodians includes as members the following banks participating in this letter: The Bank of New York Mellon, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, J P Morgan, Northern Trust, RBC Dexia Investor Services, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Standard Chartered Bank and State Street Bank and Trust Company
65;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-03-11T06:34:24Z;Low or no returns send investors chasing ‘smart beta’;Low level of market returns leads interest to turn to more sophisticated index-style approaches;Investing for market returns via index tracking strategies is standard for many investors. But given the current low level of market returns, or beta, interest is increasingly turning to more sophisticated index-style approaches often labelled “smart beta” by the investment industry.According to Northern Trust, 51 per cent of investors globally are interested in exploring these strategies to meet their objectives.Smart beta offers the opportunity to profit from alleged systemic anomalies, such as the superior efficiency of low-volatility stocks. It often takes the form of alternatively weighted indices, using factors like sales, earnings, book value, cashflow or dividends rather than market capitalisation.Smart beta is a kind of index, but because the anomalies can be exploited in various ways, it can also be categorised as an active strategy.So, for example, prospective clients of Paris-based Tobam can access its capabilities via segregated mandates, commingled funds or a series of indices devised in partnership with FTSE. Yves Choueifaty, Tobam’s founder, says there are only a few differences between the indices and funds, such as the frequency of rebalancing and an input of responsible investing in some of the funds.If the formula is little different between Tobam funds and FTSE/Tobam indices, this begs several questions: when is an index an index and when is it a strategy, and how do investors choose between FTSE’s smart betas licensed from quant houses and those it has developed itself?The conundrum is evident in the oxymoron “strategy indices”, used by many practitioners and agents as synonym for smart betas.“The key benefits of index investing are simplicity, transparency, low cost,” says Dimitris Melas, head of new product research at MSCI, an index provider. “Therefore, strategy indices should have a clear objective, a transparent methodology, simple portfolio construction rules, and relatively low turnover.”“Any strategy that does not have a clear objective or changes its objective over time, that has an opaque methodology, that relies on complicated portfolio construction rules, or that has high portfolio turnover making it difficult to replicate at a low cost, should be viewed as an active strategy.”Unfortunately, there are no universally agreed definitions of “simple”, “transparent” or “opaque”. Mr Choueifaty, for example, claims his group’s methodology is there for all to see in applications for the intellectual patents that protect the business. Mr Melas says even with a PhD in mathematics he struggles to understand the Tobam formulae.Meanwhile, MSCI’s Minimum Volatility index had a higher turnover in several years than Robeco’s minimum volatility funds, exactly the kind of strategy the MSCI index was designed to benchmark. Does this mean that MSCI Minimum Volatility, with a relatively high turnover, falls foul of Mr Melas’s own definition?Mr Melas admits that MSCI Minimum Volatility is an attempt to represent a strategy and as such includes criteria (such as caps on size and turnover) that are variable. Richard Hannam, European head of passive equity at State Street Global Advisors, reckons that as MSCI Minimum Volatility has fewer than 300 constituents versus 1600 for MSCI World Equity, it ought to be considered a strategy.The oldest smart beta house, London-based GWA, has 22 indices licensed via FTSE. GWA founder David Morris says: “We can index anything in the world but my bugbear is when folk claim these new indices are passive. [An index weighted by] market cap represents the full opportunity set and anything else is active.”Indicative pricing confirms that smart beta sits between passive and active. Strategy indices managed under licence cost between 10 and 15 basis points for a €100m mandate. Direct from the quant house itself, the strategy would be 30-35 basis points. Providers such as Edhec-Risk Indices & Benchmarks do the former only. Businesses such as Acadian, Analytic Investors, Robeco and WisdomTree only tread the second, traditional route. GWA, Research Affiliates, Tobam and Westpeak do both. The big passive managers such as SSgA and Northern Trust will customise any smart beta a client wishes for as well as manage licensed strategies. US-based WisdomTree packages its strategies exclusively as exchange traded funds.Pimco, the world’s largest commercial bond investor, has taken a singular route, bypassing index providers altogether for a new series of indices against which it actively manages assets. The new indices cover a fraction of Pimco’s total client assets but Mr Melas makes the point that if asset managers follow the same route as investment banks, which create proprietorial indices for every new business opportunity, the fear of conflicts of interests arise.Clients – at least those with billions to manage themselves – do not seem bothered for the moment. Mr Choueifaty recalls that the origin of his group’s series with FTSE was the desire of a huge institutional investor to access Tobam’s intellectual property but in a customised manner and run by the client’s in-house team. Historically, the largest clients got segregated mandates with a direct line to the portfolio manager and the most attentive client liaison. The nature of smart beta means sovereign wealth funds can devise their own bespoke index without any expectation of sharing it.Few, however, predict the end of market-cap weighted indices. Smart beta specialists such as Pim van Vliet, portfolio manager of Robeco’s Conservative Equity declare them the only representative benchmarks based on sound financial theory.Licensing strategies via index providers might be the evolution of the business of asset management (equivalent to the move by IBM out of manufacturing computers into consultancy) but it does not follow that smart beta will persist.The history of active asset management suggests that bright ideas, from the Nifty Fifty to tactical asset allocation to 130/30 funds, dim in time.

68;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-02-12T20:42:54Z;Activists challenge Osaka bourse;;Investors in the Osaka Securities Exchange are challenging management to push for better merger terms from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in a rare outbreak of shareholder activism in Japan.The move threatens to derail a tie-up that would create the world’s third-biggest exchange group by market capitalisation of listed companies, after NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.Japan has come under pressure to consolidate its 11 stock, derivatives and commodity exchanges as other large economies have built up big, “multi-asset” bourses with global reach. In addition Japan, long the undisputed largest and most liquid capital market in Asia, faces a long-term threat from China and its maturing exchanges.Under the two sides’ agreed merger, announced last November and due to proceed this summer, the unlisted TSE is valued at about 1.7 times the listed OSE. A number of shareholders in the Osaka-based group, predominantly non-Japanese institutions, are now urging chief executive Michio Yoneda to improve terms in the OSE’s favour, according to people familiar with the situation.If the terms are not revised, investors say they may vote against the re-election of OSE directors at the annual shareholders’ meeting in June – a move that would most likely scuttle the deal.The OSE’s top shareholders include Fidelity, JO Hambro Capital Management, Northern Trust and State Street, according to Bloomberg data.Neither the OSE nor the TSE were available to comment.Forced renegotiations are unusual in Japan. Ten years ago shareholders in Chugai, a drugmaker, succeeded in forcing Rocheof Switzerland to raise its initial agreed offer by almost a third. In 2007 Citigroup improved an agreed offer for brokerage Nikko Cordial by a quarter after investors balked.In the most recent example of investor activism, Japan Tobacco raised its dividend and is poised to buy back shares after a challenge from UK-based activist hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund over inefficient use of capital.The merger is due to complete in two stages. First, the TSE will make a tender offer for two-thirds of the OSE’s outstanding shares at Y480,000 ($6,182) a share, a 14 per cent premium to the last traded price before the announcement. Then the TSE will effectively inject itself into the listed company by swapping one new share in the OSE for every five shares held in the TSE. OSE, the surviving entity, will be renamed Japan Exchange Group.A 20 per cent increase in the tender offer price would push the TSE’s implied valuation closer to 1.4 times the OSE and the share-swap ratio to 1:6. Investors say that would be a fairer reflection of the combination of Tokyo’s scale with Osaka’s consistent profitability, thanks largely to OSE’s derivatives business, including its flagship Nikkei 225 index futures contract.But people on both sides say the deal is unlikely to unravel, given the political momentum for exchange convergence.www.ft.com/tradingroom
69;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-01-29T02:37:09Z;Concerns over inbuilt biases in indices;Fixed income indices are a focus of concern;Investors are worried that traditional indices are flawed, but spend little time on index selection, according to a survey by Northern Trust.Fixed income indices in particular are a focus of concern, as the traditional capitalisation-weighted versions are inevitably heavily skewed towards the most indebted issuers.More than 70 per cent of institutional investors have concerns about the inbuilt biases in traditional cap-weighted indices, the survey found, but two-thirds of them spend less than 10 per cent of their time on selecting benchmarks either for active or passive investments.“It’s the traditional way portfolio decisions have been made,” said John Krieg, Northern Trust’s managing director of asset management in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Historically, investors have devoted more time to manager selection than to index selection, he added. “We think that will change.”Change will be partly driven by the greater availability of alternative index methodologies, such as fundamental- or risk-weightings. However, Northern Trust thinks customised indices, ranging from simple ethical screens to methodologies designed to eliminate traditional biases or gain exposure to new markets, have a role to play.Just over half of those surveyed said they were interested in the idea of customised indices.
70;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-01-19T00:56:44Z;US custodian banks hit by shift into cash;;Global custodian banks have adopted a defensive position as fund managers and large institutions shift into cash and ultra-safe assets, putting pressure on the banks’ ability to generate income.Bank of New York Mellon earnings in the fourth quarter dropped from $679m last year to $505m. The quarter’s results included a $107m restructuring charge, primarily a result of lay-offs.“As the year-end approached last year, [we saw a] complete risk-off mode: a decline in volumes, movement to cash,” said Gerald Hassell, chief executive. That “doesn’t allow for fee activity either in investment services or investment management area”.Low interest rates have put tremendous pressure on custodian banks that manage funds for large institutions and retail brokerages, with the Federal Reserve’s commitment to near-zero rates through 2013 make it difficult to invest customer funds in safe investments that generate return.Coming at the same time that fees generated by trading and investment activity are falling sharply, such groups have been forced to rely on cost-cutting and lay-offs to generate consistent earnings growth.Northern Trust profits dropped 17 per cent for the fourth quarter to $130m, down from $157m in the same period in 2010 and also hit by restructuring charges of $61m.State Street’s quarterly net income jumped from $81m to $383m, though the favourable comparison was due to a large charge taken in the fourth quarter of last year.Shares of BNY Mellon were down 4.4 per cent by mid-afternoon, at $20.33, giving up all of its gains so far for the year. State Street dropped 6.8 per cent to $39.84, and Northern Trust was down 2.2 per cent to $41.02.The firms reported a doubling in waivers on fees charged on money-market funds that offer low returns but promise immediate liquidity, with some $90m in fees waived this year. Low rates have forced the banks to forgo fees that would push money-market funds into the negative.“Money market fund managers, including our own, have been particularly conservative. They shortened durations and reduced European exposure, which resulted in lower yields and even higher money market feed fund waivers,” Mr Hassell said.As of January 11, US money market mutual fund assets totalled $2.7tn, according to the Investment Company Institute. That is up from $2.64tn at the end of the third quarter, but down from the $2.8tn held in such funds a year ago. Industry assets peaked in January 2009 at $3.92tn.The groups are responding with aggressive cost-cutting. Northern Trust is cutting 700 jobs. State Street said it would likely continue to cut staff, having closed a fixed-income trading unit in the fourth quarter.“The most recent market action looks good, but we still worry about Europe, and we’re trying to be realistic and …straightforward in our disclosure that we keep trying to adjust the expense base to generate earnings,” said Jay Hooley, State Street chief executive.
71;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2012-01-18T14:35:19Z;N Trust profits hit by restructuring costs;;Northern Trust profits dropped by 17 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the year before as higher revenues from acquisitions were offset by the cost of integration and restructuring charges.The third-largest US custody bank by assets also said that it would cut a further 700 jobs as a cost-saving measure, as near-zero interest rates continue to erode profitability.Net income in the quarter was $130m, down from $157m in the same period in 2010, hit by restructuring charges of $61m.Assets under custody rose 4 per cent to to $4.3tn in the fourth quarter, following the purchase of Bank of Ireland’s securities servicing unit in June for €60m ($77m), and hedge fund asset servicer Omnium from Citadel for $100m the following month.Revenues were up 7 per cent to $956m, largely as a result of the acquisitions.Northern was forced to waive fees worth $33.6m on its money market mutual funds, more than double the $13.9m waived in the fourth quarter last year, as historically low short-term interest rates would otherwise make the funds’ returns negative.The bank said that in addition to the 700 job losses, further jobs would be cut by attrition. Restructuring and productivity improvements are forecast to benefit annual pre-tax income by approximately $250m by the end of 2013. Pre-tax profit last year was $884m.

73;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-11-24T17:39:49Z;Heed the ‘transparent’ lessons from MF Global;Investors are more savvy about risk;"What exactly sparked the dramatic demise of MF Global? That question has sparked feverish speculation, with the words “hubris”, “funding crisis”, “poor risk controls” or “bad sovereign debt bets” being tossed around.But as the debate heats up, there is another word which can be tossed into the mix: “transparency”. Right now, it might seem bizarre to say “transparency” in the same sentence as MF Global. After all, this is a brokerage which may have “lost” $1.2bn of customer money in opaque circumstances.Nevertheless, if you leave aside the micro-mysteries surrounding the broker’s back office, in a macro, market sense, the issue of “transparency” is important. In particular, this debacle shows that investors are becoming savvier about some of the macro risks stalking financial institutions – and willing to react. Call it a new form of market discipline; one that is, crucially, speeded up.To understand this, think back for a moment to how Wall Street operated in the halcyon – complacent – era before 2007. Back then, most investors were willing to leave money with hedge funds, brokers and banks without bothering to read the fine print of custody rules. Hedge funds, too, deposited assets with banks on the basis of trust; there was a belief that banks’ audited accounts and hedge fund reports provided a good guide to their “strength”.But the last four years have punctured this innocence and trust. During the collapse of Bear Stearns, for example, hedge funds suddenly discovered, to their cost, how much power the brokers can wield when they hold customer assets, particularly when there are margin calls. Then, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, hedge funds realised the hard way that British bankruptcy law does not ring-fence customer assets during liquidation.Investors have also made the painful discovery that credit risk and asset price swings are not the only thing which can damage portfolios; counterparty and liquidity risks matter too. And they have realised that published, audited accounts do not reveal those subtle, secondary counterparty and liquidity risks; nor do the reports that hedge funds have traditionally given their clients.These lessons are having tangible consequences. One is that the audit profession is now, belatedly, engaging in new soul searching. In the coming months, for example, American auditors will hold a series of round-tables to discuss whether their time-honoured system for auditing banks, say, needs to be updated for the new internet, Twitter age.A second consequence is that hedge funds face growing pressure from their own clients to get better custody services in place, with improved forms of transparency too. No longer are investors content with just monthly reports. They want spreadsheets with detailed, up-to-date information on funds’ assets, strategies and exposures, including counterparty, liquidity and other risks that used to be obscured.Entrepreneurs are scrambling to respond. Take the case of Northern Trust, the Chicago-based group. In recent months, it has found a niche selling new custodial services that offer higher forms of oversight and transparency. These are being bought by funds. Investors are responding: Northern Trust executives say that one big sovereign wealth fund recently acquired this monitoring system – to keep detailed, real-time tabs on hedge funds and brokers.Now, I would not pretend that this shift towards more transparency is complete, far less perfect; there is more to be done. It is hard for investors to work out where the collateral backing deals is “really” sitting, or what “really” lies inside any structured asset deal. The back offices remain dangerously opaque, as that $1.2bn stain shows.But nobody should ignore the impact of the changes that have already occurred, as Northern Trust, and others, flog quietly their monitoring services. Take MF Global. The chain of events that sparked the broker’s demise appears to have started when it published its last set of quarterly accounts. As financial players perused that statement, using their flashy new monitoring systems, they spotted the brokers’ sovereign exposure – and started to worry about counterparty and liquidity risk. Five years ago, it might have taken weeks – or months – for anybody to react; however, this time, lines were cut extraordinarily fast. Hence that “out of the blue” crunch-cum-run that killed MF Global.Now, MF Global executives might argue that this shows that too much transparency can be dangerous; or at least it can, when it sparks a self-fulfilling panic. MF Global investors would no doubt disagree. Either way the key point is this: even before regulators impose new rules, the rhythm of financial markets has changed. Investors are getting savvier; reactions are speeding up. In that sense, then, the tale of MF Global might almost be cheering; were it not, of course, for that $1.2bn hole that highlights how much change is still needed in brokers’ back offices too.gillian.tett@ft.com"
74;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-11-18T13:20:14Z;Indices – who uses them and why;Index construction needs to be transparent and have a robust methodology;"The FTSE 100; the Dow Jones Industrial Average; the S&P 500. These are terms familiar to everyone who listens to the general news, but most listeners have only the haziest idea of what they represent. Of those who are aware that they are stock indices, many do not really know how they are calculated, or what they are used for apart from the last line of the news before the sports results.“You use indices to measure the performance of the market, and then you can use an index to measure the performance of a manager against the market,” says Alain Cubeles, a senior index strategist at Northern Trust. “They can also be used to gain investment exposure to a market.”The granddaddy of them all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was first put together in the 19th century as a shorthand for reporting on the market. Because its establishment predates computers (let alone Excel spreadsheets or more sophisticated software), it is price-weighted. That is, each constituent stock makes up a fraction of the index proportional to its price. So a share priced at £10 will be 10 times as important in the index as a £1 share, even if the underlying company is smaller than the £1-a-share company.This is easy to calculate, but not precisely representative of the market. It will also need to be rebalanced regularly as the prices move.Dominating the index scene is the market capitalisation weighted index, such as the FTSE 100, which takes the largest 100 stocks on the London Stock Exchange and weights them by the total traded value of each company.This reflects the fact that most cap-weighted indices are float-adjusted. That is, only the portion of the company that is likely to be traded on the market counts for the index, so if a company is 40 per cent held by the founding family, its weight in the index will represent just 60 per cent of its total value.The two big advantages of the cap-weighted index are that it is truly representative of the market – the largest companies have the most impact – and that it is self-rebalancing. As the prices change, the proportions of stocks in the index basket automatically change in the same ratio.Although indices were originally conceived to serve the first of Mr Cubeles’ purposes, they are now most frequently used for the other two, either as a benchmark against which the performance of a manager is measured or as a way of investing in the market. The latter is achieved by using a tracker fund, in which a manager attempts to replicate the index in her own portfolio, an exchange traded fund, or futures.For these to work, the index must be investable; it must be possible to “buy all the components of the index in the proportions of the index without incurring very high transaction costs or having market impact”, explains Mr Cubeles.These issues are most likely to arise in a large, broadly diversified index, where some constituents are so small that it would be impossible for a large index-tracking fund to buy enough of their shares without sending the price soaring. Where such problems are likely to arise, index providers will carefully sift their indices to exclude such stocks.ETF providers scrutinise indices and their providers carefully before choosing which one to track. “You would be considering the regulatory framework, and any diversity requirements first of all,” says Feargal Dempsey, head of product strategy at BlackRock, Emea. “We would tend to focus on liquidity and capacity constraints. The index has to be liquid enough to have a secondary market.”The need for liquidity is why frontier markets, which tend to see a lower trading volume, are likely to have fewer ETFs tracking them, he explains.The regulatory framework for a product can also necessitate modifications to an index. The European Ucits framework, for example, says that for index replicators, each individual stock should not make up more than 20 per cent of an index, although in exceptional cases, it is possible for a single stock to form as much as 35 per cent.Equity indices are relatively straightforward for providers to compile, once a methodology (cap-weighted, fundamentally-weighted; quarterly rebalancing, annual rebalancing; diversification rules in place) is decided upon. Other asset classes, such as fixed income or real estate, can require more input from the index provider.Problems raised by the assets must be considered in advance and the approach laid out transparently to satisfy customers. “The methodology has to be very robust and transparent,” says Mr Dempsey. “For that reason, we tend to deal with partners we have a long established relationship with, where we understand their methodology and can rely on their quality of service.”"

77;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;BNY Mellon earnings rise amid turbulence;;Bank of New York Mellon reported a 4.7 per cent rise in profits to $651m amid a quarter in which the world’s largest custody bank replaced its chief executive and battled fresh lawsuits alleging fraud from multiple US state attorneys-general and the Department of Justice.Assets under custody rose 6 per cent from the same period last year to $25,900bn, the bank said, suggesting clients are not fleeing the company after state and federal allegations that the bank regularly defrauded customers including pension funds on foreign exchange trades. Assets under management also increased, rising 5 per cent to $1,200bn. The company said new business accounted for the growth.Shares of the bank fell 1.2 per cent to $19.54 in New York trading on WednesdayNon-interest expenses increased 6 per cent, and its share as a percentage of revenues also rose, from 72.7 per cent in the third quarter of last year to 75 per cent the same period of this year.The company has come under increased pressure from investors and Wall Street analysts to rein in costs as BNY fights to maintain profit levels despite the continuing squeeze on net interest margins. It announced job cuts earlier this year and has pledged to cut expenses.Analysts have questioned the bank’s strategy in dealing with a multiple of issues, from legal risks – like the lawsuits from the justice department, New York, Florida and Virginia – to more structural challenges like BNY’s ability to weather the current low interest rate environment and its effect on profit margins.Net interest margins fell year-on-year from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent, reflecting the bank’s difficulties at finding higher-yielding investments for its growing pile of deposits. The flattening from the preceding quarter was mostly due to an influx of “pretty hot money” into customers’ deposit accounts. For example, non-interest-bearing deposits surged 71 per cent quarter-on-quarter to $73.4bn.“If the balance sheet had been stable, we estimate the margin probably would have been up slightly,” said Thomas Gibbons, BNY’s chief financial officer.Two weeks ago, the state of New York and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan filed separate lawsuits against BNY, claiming that the company defrauded and misled pension funds, US banks and millions of investors nationwide on currency transactions for 10 years. New York is seeking to recover more than $2bn.The lawsuits claim that the bank bought and sold foreign currencies at the worst rate at which the currency traded on the day of the trade, as opposed to the market price at the time of the trade. The suits alleges that the bank kept the difference. The states of Virginia and Florida filed similar suits earlier this year.The bank has rejected the accusations and vowed to fight the claims, describing the claims as “flat out wrong, both on the law and on the facts”. It also said on Wednesday that clients had not left as a result of the claims.“We have not seen any attrition over the FX matter,” said chairman and chief executive Gerald Hassell, who took over from Robert Kelly on August 31.BNY’s revenues off foreign exchange jumped 38 per cent year-on-year to $221m, due largely to increased volatility and higher volumes, the bank said.Separately, in August New York attorney-general Eric Schneiderman accused the bank of “repeated fraud and illegality” in asking a state judge to reject a proposed $8.5bn settlement agreement over soured loans between Bank of America and a group of investors which BNY served as trustee. Mr Schneiderman claimed BNY “knowingly, repeatedly and consistently” misled investors into thinking that the mortgage bonds they purchased were created properly.The bank has denied Mr Schneiderman’s mortgage bond allegations.On Tuesday, rival custody bank State Street reported an 11 per cent rise in earnings. BNY’s share price has fared worse than peers State Street and Northern Trust, plummeting nearly 35 per cent year-to-date through Tuesday’s close. State Street has fallen 19 per cent while Northern Trust has dropped 30 per cent.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

Investment banking net revenues fell 33 per cent year-on-year to $781m as underwriting revenues seized up with the initial public offering market stalling over the summer.Bank of America surged 10.1 per cent to $6.64 after posting earnings per share of 56 cents on net profit of $6.2bn, its first profit since the first quarter of 2011.But stripping out $3.6bn from the sale of a stake in China Construction Bank and a $4.5bn boost from an accounting adjustment widely used by banks this earnings season to bolster the value of their own debt, BofA was lossmaking.“It’s a relief just to get through most of the major bank announcements and not hear anything too terrible,” said Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service.Mr Warren initiated a position in BofA in August when the stock sunk to $7 and he was impressed by the bank’s work to boost its capital position.BofA’s tier 1 common equity ratio reached 8.65 per cent, well on course to meet Basel III requirements by 2019.Trust bank State Street jumped 10.7 per cent to $37.49 after posting earnings per share of 96 cents, handily beating the average forecast in a Bloomberg poll of analysts of 88 cents.That gave a boost to its rivals Bank of New York Mellon, up 7.6 per cent to $19.77, and Northern Trust, up 4.4 per cent to $38.78, but analysts warned State Street’s performance might not be mirrored at other trust institutions.“State Street is less banklike than the other two, which means it faces less regulatory risk and is less vulnerable to losses on outstanding loans,” said Jeff Hopson at Stifel Nicolaus.Financials in the S&P 500 were up 5 per cent, significantly outperforming every other sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.6 per cent to 11,577.05 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 1.6 per cent to 2,657.43, into positive territory for the year.In a frantic last hour of trading the S&P 500 had jumped as high as 1,233 on reports Germany and France have agreed the outlines of a $2trn European bail-out package, but sellers forced the market back down towards 1,220, where all previous rallies this summer have ended.Homebuilders, which had been sold heavily on Monday as bank earnings figures suggested mortgage delinquencies may be on the rise again, rebounded strongly.Lennar was up 9.3 per cent to $15.92, DR Horton jumped 11 per cent to $10.59 and PulteGroup was up 11.2 per cent to $4.46 after a better than expected sentiment report from the National Association of Homebuilders.Pharmaceutical company Hospira plunged 21 per cent to $29.51, after it cut its earnings per share guidance for the year to between $2.95 and $3.05, less than the analyst consensus estimate of $3.91, because of production problems at its largest manufacturing plant.IBM fell 4.1 per cent to $178.90 after the computer giant’s quarterly earnings, out after the close of markets on Monday, showed flat performance in major European markets.Coca-Cola was down 0.4 per cent to $66.74 despite reporting increased profit of $2.22bn, as margins shrank.Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson fell 7.8 per cent to $34.31. Quarterly results appeared strong with retail sales up 5.4 per cent year-on-year, much better than expected. But margin was hit by the strong dollar and restructuring costs at its main manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania.
80;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-10-06T03:16:45Z;Yahoo surges on Microsoft takeover reports;;Shares in US internet portal Yahoo rose 9 per cent in the last two hours of trading on reports that Microsoft is considering a bid.An existing tie-up means Yahoo’s website is powered by Microsoft’s Bing search engine, leaving some analysts sceptical of the value of a bid.“Why buy the cow when you already get the milk for free?” said Herman Leung, senior internet analyst at Susquehanna Financial.“Its not clear what’s in it for Microsoft, but if anyone has the cash, it’s them, so you can’t rule it out.”Buyers pushed Yahoo up to $15.77, a rise of 20 per cent on the week, on hopes of a bidding war between Microsoft and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce site, which confirmed its interest in buying out the California-based group last Friday.Microsoft closed up 2.2 per cent to $25.89.The broad S&P 500 was up 1.8 per cent to 1,144.04 as the International Monetary Fund pushed for a speedy recapitalisation of European banks, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said she was inclined to act soon. That followed a 4 per cent surge in the last 40 minutes of trading on Tuesday, after the Financial Times broke news of European government talks about co-ordinated bank recapitalisations.Wednesday’s gains left the benchmark up 1 per cent for the week and 50 points clear of the bear market territory it had traded in for much of Tuesday.Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, warned: “It’s still difficult for retail and institutional investors to commit to this market. With volatility still elevated, it’s a day trader’s market.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 per cent to 10,939.95 and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 2.3 per cent to 2,460.51.Bank of New York Mellon fell 2.9 per cent to $18.28 after the bank was hit by government lawsuits for allegedly systematically mispricing forex transactions for clients over 10 years. That briefly pushed down shares in all the major US trust banks as investors absorbed further reputational damage to the industry.But State Street, which is subject to a separate $54m civil lawsuit for forex mispricing, closed up 1.3 per cent to $32.47, and Northern Trust, which is not subject to litigation, was also up 1 per cent to $36.37.Brad Hintz, trust bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said the financial implications of the lawsuits facing State Street and BNY Mellon were manageable.“Fraud is hard to prove. And although this will encourage more civil lawsuits, the dollar amounts involved aren’t large,” he said.Residential real estate investment trusts suffered in the morning session.Equity Residential fell 1 per cent to $51.70 and AvalonBay Communities was off 1.2 per cent to $111.55.Reits have attracted flows from yield-seeking investors because they are required to pay out any profits in dividends. They have been able to take advantage of a recovery in the rental market faster than commercial reits, because tenancies come up for renewal more frequently. But their dependence on short-term funding from the repo market is worrying some investors.Sectoral movements in the S&P 500 hinted at positive sentiment.Cyclical materials and energy stocks were up 4.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively.Alpha Natural Resources, the Appalachian metallurgical coal miner, whose share price has been hit by concerns over Chinese demand, jumped 12 per cent to $19.70. Refiner Tesoro was up 13.8 per cent to $21.95.Apple inched up 1.5 per cent to $378.25. Investors were underwhelmed by the launch of the latest iPhone model. The stock is down 2.1 per cent for the week.Jefferies analyst Peter Misek predicted a quick turnround once investors tune into the upgrades “under the hood” of the iPhone.Costco fell 1.7 per cent to $80.25, despite reporting fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $27.58bn, a 17 per cent increase on the same quarter last year. Some analysts had expected even better results from the wholesale club, while investors were cautious about the company’s decision to increase membership fees to offset rising commodity costs.Seed company Monsanto rose 5.2 per cent to $66.25, after reporting better than expected fiscal fourth quarter results. The company also promised to restate its financial results for the past three fiscal years as a result of a federal investigation into incentives paid to distributors of its herbicide.

AMR ended the day down 33 per cent at $1.98 on speculation that the company may file for bankruptcy.A sell-off in big bank stocks followed almost immediately afterwards. Citigroup led fallers down 9.8 per cent to $23.11, Bank of America fell 9.6 per cent to $5.53, a full 47 cents below its previous year low. Goldman Sachs was down 4.7 per cent to $90.08. All three stocks were at levels not seen since March or April 2009.Morgan Stanley fell to a level not seen since December 2008. The stock was down 7.7 per cent to $12.47, amid heavy trading in options.In just three hours of trading, open interest in $5 October puts on Morgan Stanley – giving buyers the right to sell 100 Morgan Stanley shares for $5 in October – increased by a factor of five to 24,000. The cost of $5 October puts doubled from 12 to 25 cents during the day.The cost of default protection on Morgan Stanley’s debt rose to 558 basis points at the close of the New York Session, up 72bp. That equates to $558,000 a year to insure $10m of Morgan Stanley debt for five years.Bank of America CDS rose 30bp to an all-time wide spread of 446bp, while Citigroup rose 33bp to 348bp.Shell-shocked banking analysts were at a loss to explain the falls.“I left for lunch at midday and things were quiet, I came back and the bottom had fallen out of banks,” Christopher Mustacio at Stifel Nicolaus said.Tentative explanations ranged from the reports about American Airlines, although the company’s $11bn is unlikely to sink a bank, to exposures to Europe, where Franco-Belgian bank Dexia had been downgraded, before markets opened.But all analysts agreed the falls did not reflect the fundamentals. “Investors are afraid of 2008, there’s a sell first, ask questions later attitude,” said Mr Mustacio.Dan Greenhouse, chief investment strategist BTIG, said investors might be “derisking in case the S&P 500 breaks through 1,100, because a lot of people think it will fall a lot more if it does”.And therein lies the importance of the 1,100 figure. Although the S&P 500 has suffered heavy selling during August and July, the 1,100 had served as a signal for bargain hunters to pour back in to the market. When the benchmark index touched its previous year intraday low of 1,101.54 on August 9, it rebounded immediately, closing the day at 1,172.88.On Monday, the barrier was broken in the last minutes of trading, holding out hopes for a quick bounce on Tuesday.But Monday’s losses leaves the S&P 500 perilously close to bear market territory, signalled by a fall of 20 per cent from a previous cyclical high. The benchmark index is down 19.4 per cent since its April 29 peak.Shares in trust banks also fell sharply, after Sanford Bernstein Research evaluated the revenue impact of a flatter yield curve on lending margins, and revenue from reinvested earnings.Bank of New York Mellon fell 4.7 per cent to $17.72, State Street lost 5.5 per cent to $30.40 and Northern Trust Corporation retreated 2.8 per cent to $34.01.Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said earnings per share at all three institutions could suffer a 3-4 per cent hit.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 per cent to 10,665.08 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 3.3 per cent to 2335.83.Yahoo jumped 2.7 per cent to $13.53 as Wall Street had its first chance to react to news of a potential bid that broke after the markets closed Friday.Jack Ma, chairman of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, which is 40 per cent owned by Yahoo and controls Yahoo China, told an audience at Stanford university that he was “very, very interested” in buying Yahoo.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar fell 8.4 per cent to $57.90 as analysts weighed the company’s sales of the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch I and 550MW Desert Sunlight plants, immediately after securing government loan guarantees on Friday.Micron Technology, a volatile semiconductor stock that suffered heavy selling last week after poor quarterly results, was down a further 14.1 per cent to $4.33, the first time the stock has broken through the $5 level since 2009. Fellow semi stock Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.8 per cent to $4.53 as fallout from weak quarterly results last week continued.Frontier Communications fell 7.4 per cent to $5.66 after Macquarie recommended that clients sell the stock due to the telecommunications group’s dependence on high-yield debt funding.Pharmaceutical Product Development jumped some 25.8 per cent to $32.28 after confirming that it would be acquired by Carlyle Group and Hellman & Friedman in a $3.9bn cash deal.Energy and industrial stocks linked to global economic growth, however, sold off heavily.Wynn Resorts fell 0.7 per cent to $114.32. The company is down by a third in just two weeks, on fears of a decline in junket tourism to the Chinese gaming island of Macau, which accounts for up to a third of the company’s revenue.
82;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:41:16Z;Winners & losers: Bigger providers increase domination;Marginal players will exit, but choice will increase as the value chain unbundles;The identification of winners and losers is as long-running a story as any in the asset services world. This latest instalment unfurls around several themes: domination, competition, evolution, cost-cutting and globalisation.The dominance of the big four providers (Bank of New York Mellon, JP Morgan Chase, State Street and Citi) is unquestioned.So far ahead of the field are they in terms of assets under custody alone that it is apparently the height of futility to aspire to join their ranks by any means other than by being consolidated into one of them. It should be noted that few in the industry are prepared to rule out further consolidation, and there is little sign of complacency even at the top of the tree.“It is as competitive a market as I have ever seen,” says Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNYM Asset Servicing.“Clients want a better deal even if providers face rising costs, and they have zero tolerance of error. Those who want to stay in the business face levels of investment in technology the likes of which they have never seen before.”Despite the intensity of competition in the industry, some players predict that the dominance of the big players will continue to grow as clients and potential clients increasingly focus on the strength of their preferred supplier’s balance sheet. “You need a strong balance sheet to give clients comfort,” says Wilson Leech, chief executive of Northern Trust, EMEA region. “This has always been the case, but it’s probably truer now than it has ever been, given the new capital requirements being mandated by the Basel III regime [covering banks].”There is talk in some quarters of an evolutionary change that is taking place in the nature of niche providers, including new entrants to the market. Chandresh Iyer, head of global custody and investment services at Citi in New York, argues that the basic driving forces in the industry have changed in recent years.Before the credit crisis the industry was fundamentally driven by growth in assets, asset classes, geographies and client segments. Today, the asset servicing business model is driven by globalisation, regulation and risk management. Continual rejuvenation is taking place as custody redefines itself. Bigger providers continue to gain scale, whether by cannibalising one another, or by acquiring new product capabilities and clients.But opportunities also exist for new entrants and niche players, whether in fund administration or the provision of analytical tools. Marginal players are likely to exit, but choice will increase as the value chain unbundles.Steve Smit, head of global services, UK MEA and global markets EMEA, at State Street in Boston, also expects to see further consolidation in asset services – not least in continental Europe where there remain too many players servicing only a local or a regional market.He sees sales taking place in cases where a parent institution of such an entity decides the business has no strategic importance because it does not have the necessary scale, and has no appetite to make the investment necessary to achieve that scale. A further and increasingly familiar impetus for sales could be the simple imperative of raising new funds to support tougher capital requirements relating to their core banking business.“We expect State Street to participate in that consolidation,” he says. The ultimate winners in this evolving marketplace will be those players that have an unwavering focus on asset services and can devote to their development the capital and management time they demand, combined with global scale and balance sheet strength, he adds. Whoever might he be thinking of?Charley Cock, head of client development and a member of the executive committee at BNP Paribas Securities Services in Paris, says much the same. The future belongs to those who can do everything everywhere in every asset class, to those who have all the abilities and the critical mass and the cash flow to finance continuous investment as new assets and services are defined.“Market by market, incumbents are slowly getting out,” he says. The buyers are, by definition, international players keen to expand, who appreciate the stream of revenues and healthy return on capital that the business offers.However, the world will continue to need the services of non-global custodians, says Goran Fors, global head of custody at SEB in Stockholm, defiantly.Some observers may feel that SEB looks vulnerable to expansion in that region by the likes of JP Morgan, Northern Trust and Citi, but not Mr Fors. He also thinks it unlikely that new entrants of any note will appear in the industry any time soon. On the other hand, he does envisage further consolidation at the central securities depository level, which will make life harder for smaller players. Size, as always, does matter.So do costs, which remain a perennial topic, along with how to squeeze them still further out of the system by pushing for ever greater efficiency and automation.One new theme beginning to excite debate is the potential emergence of Chinese competitors. There is speculation that one or more Chinese banks, perhaps ICBC or Agricultural Bank of China, could look to move beyond their domestic market and emerge as serious contenders in cross-border asset services over the next decade.This would be a logical development, but it currently requires a leap of faith to imagine a high-profile US investor deciding to switch from one of the big four in favour of a Chinese supplier.However, if a company such as Apple can rely on China as a commercial provider, perhaps banks looking to cut costs and increase efficiences will take a similar view in time.

The new rules regarding the introduction of the key investor information document (Kiid) are expected to be especially fruitful.The Kiid, which forms part of the Ucits IV directive, will require all Ucits funds to be distributed with an easy-to-understand two-page descriptive brochure that will be provided to investors at the point of sale.“The initial effort required to set up and publish the first version is significant and should not be underestimated, especially when translation services need to be included and considered,” says Karen Hamilton, senior product manager for fund administration at Northern Trust, who hopes fund managers will lean on Northern Trust as a result.BNY Mellon’s Mr North adds: “The need to produce Kiids is an added cost for fund managers.“The next deadline is July 1 2012 by which time all funds must have their Kiids in place and, although fund administrators are not required to produce these for their clients, many are offering services in this space and all will have to contribute some information such as fund charges, 10-year performance data or synthetic risk indicators.”It seems he is right. In the past few months State Street, Northern Trust, Kneip, Société Générale Securities Services, Caceis, BNP Paribas Securities Services, RBC Dexia, SEI and Citi have all entered the race to try and win business from asset managers looking to prepare their Kiids.Returning to the subject of consolidation, Mr North adds: “Yes, Ucits IV will make it harder for smaller firms to compete, but these changes themselves will not lead to greater consolidation in the market because they are limited in scope and include an easier regime for selling funds across Europe.“We should not forget that one of the drivers behind Ucits IV is the objective to create a single market for funds in Europe. I believe it contains positive changes that should help both small and large players reach new markets.”RBC Dexia’s Mr Weiland says in closing: “The competitive landscape between the main service providers with capability in multiple geographies should largely remain unaffected – but those with only a local presence in one or two geographies may suffer the most.”
84;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:37:34Z;Risk management: regulatory scrutiny pushes risk centre stage;Risk monitoring and compliance are driving innovation;The practice of risk management has been transformed in recent times from one that used to look mainly backwards to one in which foresight and prediction are the keys to the game.Risk monitoring and compliance have moved centre stage since the global financial crisis, driving the need for ever more advanced systems that attempt to capture the many and varied risks involved in the markets of today.Ian Castledine, global head of investment risk and compliance product at Northern Trust, points out that five to 10 years ago, for the majority of pension funds, most risk measures were largely backward looking whereas now predictive models are much more the norm.“Since the credit crunch the focus has been on counterparty risk, liquidity risk, transparency – in terms of the ability to understand what is going on in your portfolio at a security and derivatives trade level – and credit.”He adds that with all of these factors efforts are made to integrate implied metrics into asset owner models. “For example, we are launching a credit dashboard that ties together the credit rating with a host of different metrics and paints a rich tapestry as a result. We also focus on how pension schemes use the analytics we provide. We have made efforts to break down and simplify the ‘technical talk’ into more easily understandable data and analytics,” he says.Underlying much of the explosion of interest in risk management and compliance is heightened regulatory scrutiny. This has led many market participants to outsource to specialist risk managers the task of introducing the checks and balances necessary to satisfy regulators that their business is being conducted in the most prudent and transparent way.Mr Castledine says regulatory change has created an immense area of opportunity across a number of industries, highlighting the examples of servicing Nordic banks for Solvency II or the pressure on Dutch pension funds to be fully transparent.Companies are investing heavily in risk management tools against the backdrop of frequent regulatory change and the new climate of caution in the wake of the crisis.As a result, providers of analytical tools have recently become sought-after acquisition targets. Evidence of this came earlier this month as IBM made its second analytics-related acquisition in a week, seeking to expand its offerings for risk management for financial services and related companies.The company is buying Algorithmics, a Toronto-based provider of risk analytics and services to bank and other investment companies, for $387m. That follows its planned purchase of UK-based fraud prevention analytics provider i2 Group. It also bought OpenPages late last year to address operational risk. Indeed IBM has spent over $14bn on 26 analytics-related purchases in the past five years, expecting the market for analytics to be over $200bn by 2015.IBM’s buying spree is further evidence that companies are increasingly recognising that their risk management monitoring must cover a vast array of potential factors.One head of risk described what he was seeing as a new generation of client and risk monitoring characterised by the global trend of moving towards dynamic indicators, and away from a reliance on any one analytical measure.New risks are continuing to be factored in to risk models. These include so-called frontier risks such as environmental and carbon, which were previously not quantified. Broadly, clients want their risk management providers to be able to capture, quantify and predict as broad an array of measures as possible.Existing risk management providers are upgrading their services in the face of heightened competition. For example, Algorithmics, a provider of integrated collateral management and liquidity, regulatory and reporting solutions for the financial services industry, this month unveiled a new version of its regulatory reporting platform.Within the asset management business itself, acquisitions have also been taking place.For example, Natixis Global Asset Management announced earlier this month it had acquired a controlling interest in Darius Capital Partners, an investment advisory and research firm that provides customised hedge fund solutions to address institutional investors’ growing needs for transparency, liquidity and risk management. Such acquisitions are likely to be increasingly common as asset managers attempt to upgrade the risk management capabilities they can bring to the table.
85;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Regulation: A crucial part of the service;Custodian banks are having to support their clients with a regulatory onslaught;AIFMD, Fatca, Ucits IV, Ucits V, Dodd-Frank. The asset management industry is drowning in a morass of alphabet soup made up of regulations and directives from national and international bodies.“The whole industry has been challenged in the last 18 months because of the sheer volume of regulations that has come to a head,” says Clive Bellow, recently appointed Ireland country head for Northern Trust.“There’s a tsunami of regulation about to break over the industry,” agrees Steve Smit, head of global services, UKMEA, and global markets, Emea, at State Street.In Europe, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and its counterpart for mainstream investors, Ucits IV (plus its pending iteration Ucits V), are tightening the requirements for asset managers to monitor risk, provide transparency and communicate with their clients, as well as increasing the liability of custodians themselves.From Washington, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act means that any investment manager with US clients has to have disclosure compliance agreements with the US Treasury, while the Dodd-Frank legislation is likely to see the use of over-the-counter derivatives become much more onerous in terms of compliance.Mr Smit, along with most of his peers and competitors, sees supporting clients in negotiating all these new regulations as an inevitable part of the role of custodian banks that serve the asset management industry.“It really has to be a key element of what any asset servicing organisation is doing right now,” he says.Nadine Chakar, head of the global financial institutions group at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, identifies four ways in which the custodian is responding to the flood of regulations.The first is education: because new regulations often develop over a series of iterations and may not be very clear in the detail of how they should be implemented, custodians can add value by helping clients interpret the text and understand its impact.Their understanding may be particularly insightful as custodians play an active role in developing the regulation, in Ms Chakar’s second category, client advocacy. BNY Mellon is currently represented at between 25 to 30 organisations involved in drawing up industry regulations, compared with a handful five years ago, according to Ms Chakar.State Street is also active in this area, according to Mr Smit: “As we interact with regulators in Washington and Brussels, we ensure our clients’ voices are heard.”Having puzzled out what the regulations mean, Ms Chakar says the next step is working out what tools clients will need to comply with them. Risk monitoring compliance is a major area of concern for clients who are facing requirements to measure and manage risk in all sorts of unfamiliar ways.Finally the custodian has to invest in its own infrastructure to make sure it can support its clients’ new requirements. These may not be smoothly uniform, of course, as regulations emanate from different authorities around the world, so each asset manager is likely to have a different set of requirements, depending on where they are active.All this activity is fundamentally altering the business model of the custodian, as the emphasis changes from the traditional mechanical functions of settling trades and safe-keeping of securities to more value-added services around compliance and risk monitoring.“The core services remain fundamental but the type of skills you need to make the connections are very different. It’s changing in a big way,” says Ms Chakar.These developments are all likely to have an impact on prices charged by the service providers, who will face higher costs as they move up the value chain, allowing the investment managers to focus more and more on pure investment issues.Some of the European legislation increasing the custodian’s liability will also put pressure on prices.“It will increase the level of risk we have to assume and the amount of capital we have to hold,” explains Mr Smit. “Those costs will be passed on to clients.”Ms Chakar is already having that conversation with clients and, although she warns it is early days to talk about higher pricing being accepted, she is sanguine that clients will recognise they are being asked to pay more for a higher standard of service.Mr Bellow of Northern Trust does not see prices being pushed up quite so directly. “Fees are definitely not going up as a direct result of this. Rather, other things you might be doing to improve efficiency have gone on the backburner.” So in effect the client pays the same for a service that is not updated as quickly as it might otherwise be.This increase in the value-added services a custodian can offer has given a turbo-thrust to the long-standing trend for outsourcing, all commentators agree. Mr Smit also points out that investment managers are under pressure to work more efficiently than before, which can lead to their considering outsourcing more non-core functions.“Levels of assets under management have returned to pre-crisis levels, costs have returned to pre-crisis levels but revenue has only returned to, say, 85 per cent of pre-crisis levels,” he says. “Asset managers are facing a significant need to reduce expense.”This time around, however, outsourcing is more complex than the straightforward lift-out of the back-office that did not always work out so well in previous rounds.Mr Bellow talks of “a move towards componentising outsourcing”, while Ms Chakar says: “In this round of outsourcing, the platform has matured and expectations are more realistic.” It is now understood to be a partnership requiring significant management by the outsourcing partner, not just the wholesale banishment of an entire business function.All of this offers significant business opportunities for custodians and other asset services, but the levels of investment required to make the most of the opportunities may be too much for some smaller players.“We’re not predicting the demise of the smaller custodian,” says Ms Chakar, “but there’s not a week that goes by without an approach from someone asking if we are interested [in making an acquisition].”
86;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:37:21Z;Strong forces pressure custodians to change;Custodians are being squeezed by increased regulation and dwindling margins;There is a view that custodians stand at an inflection point. Numerous forces are conspiring to suggest custodians need to reinvent their business model to take account of increasing regulation, dwindling margins, a demanding client base and a technology arms race to keep up with.“To do custody alone is a challenge,” says Drew Douglas, co-head of securities services at HSBC. “The service itself has not changed, it is still about STP [straight-through processing] and operational efficiency but there are lots of regulatory changes that are focusing on the depositary role. So it is becoming a much tighter equation.”In Europe, these regulatory changes include the alternative investment fund managers directive and the European Central Bank’s Target2-Securities initiative, both of which will require custodians to provide more intra-day and overnight liquidity at a time when so little of it exists, thus increasing the day-to-day costs of running a custody business.Normally when a provider’s costs go up they simply increase their fees but this is not so easy in the custody market, says Etienne Deniau, head of custody trustee services at Société Générale Securities Services.“There is no direct relationship between income and costs as there is in other businesses. There is an almost systematic imbalance between cost of producing services and fees billed for these services.”Fortunately for custodians there are other services they can offer that promise to be more lucrative. Today’s custody providers now generally refer to themselves as asset servicing companies and offer a range of fund-related products, data services and investment consultancy.According to Penelope Biggs, head of the institutional investor group at Northern Trust, these new services have been developed mainly to meet client demand rather than just to generate new revenue streams. “Clients are placing more emphasis on governance, transparency and information,” says Ms Biggs. “Whereas it used to be mainly about custody, it is now more about providing data.”In continental Europe, regulation is forcing pension plans to demonstrate they are well run, while elsewhere global pension funds and investment managers are looking for more intuitive data and investment services in order to offer more sophisticated strategies to their investors. In both cases, custodians believe they can meet these demands.In providing such services, custodians are also looking to move further up the value chain, moving away from the back and middle office services and more towards front office services, says Rob Wright, global head, product and client segments at RBC Dexia. “We have been providing them with better data to manage their portfolios via risk dashboards and also developing a distribution support service helping them to identify new distribution opportunities, especially with Ucits funds.”One consequence of aligning their services closer to the front office is that custodians are no longer dealing with their clients’ operational staff, who tend to be more sympathetic to the systemic inefficiencies in the market and how these impact on the services that custodians provide. Portfolio managers may not be so forgiving. “The portfolio managers are different personalities with different requirements and different expectations,” says Mr Wright. “There is perhaps less patience than with the back and middle office managers so this puts us under more pressure to perform.”Custodians may then face continuing cost pressure that threatens not just core custody services but also the lucrative new services. For example, will the provision of risk dashboards and distribution support services and investment consultancy remain lucrative new revenue streams or simply become a complementary service provided to keep clients on board and, therefore, a cost of doing business? Not for now, says Mr Wright. “For us these are additional revenue streams. The prices are compressed in the custody market but we also have a more efficient supply chain so it does not necessarily affect our margins.”Another challenge custodians face when developing new front office services is that they find themselves competing with other service providers, many of whom are specialists in their field and more independent than the bank-based custodians. This independence could prove to be an advantage for the competitors, says Vernon Barback, chief operating officer of GlobeOp, an independent fund administrator that also offers valuation services to investors: “To have a custodian holding your assets is good but to have someone else providing independent valuations and risk reporting gives investors extra comfort.”There are also very specific technology challenges involved in providing these services, says Mr Barback, especially for the valuation of complex over-the-counter instruments or structured products.“Custodians have built engines that can process huge volumes of simple instruments but there are firms that specialise in valuation and risk analytics for complex instruments and have seamless, cost-effective technology dedicated to these specific instruments. Being scalable but constrained to simple instruments is not going to cut it.”Investment in technology is going to be a crucial factor in deciding the future fortunes of custodians, believes Tim Keaney, chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. “We spend more than $700m a year on technology. I cannot imagine how anyone else without similar scale can commit the same level of resources. Even if you have only niche commitments in either a single region or single client type, you still face the same demands. Underlying clients are increasingly global due to consolidation. It is the biggest challenge I have seen in 25 years. We can afford to continue to invest but I am not sure how many others can do so.”Of course size and scale are not necessarily the same thing, as Northern Trust’s Ms Biggs points out. “You don’t have to be the biggest firm to have scale, you just have to have the right operating model.”Similarly it is still possible to be a mid-tier custodian that focuses on one area and strives to be the best at it. As SGSS’s Mr Deniau states, it is less about scale and more about profitability.But Mr Keaney has a warning for those firms that may decide to retreat from the high-volume, processing-based, global custody business and focus more on high value, consultative-style services: it is very difficult to separate the two.“One brings the other. If you don’t have a global capability, you don’t get the flow. And if you don’t get the flow, then it is difficult to have any insight on trends.”
87;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:37:08Z;OTC derivatives: Big challenges from central clearing;Central clearing for OTC derivatives comes closer;Is this the most challenging time ever for custodians and their clients? For some big players, making particular reference to the proposed new central clearing requirements for over-the-counter derivatives as a means of increasing transparency and reducing risk, the answer is a clear yes. Central clearing will have a series of implications, and challenges, for clients and custodians.Zohar Hod, a vice-president at pricing and market analytics data provider SuperDerivatives, says custodians will need to increase their relatively unsophisticated internal capacity by hiring more people who understand the derivatives business. He points out, too, the simple operational difficulties of transferring the large volumes of the settlement price data needed to calculate daily net asset values and revised collateral requirements in a correct and timely manner.However, change also presents opportunities, especially in the collateral management arena where much of the action will eventually be taking place. “Collateral management will become more complex,” says John Southgate, product manager, derivatives servicing, at Northern Trust. The upgrading of collateral will become an increasingly important aspect of the collateral management process, generating additional costs.However, those costs may be offset by lower costs resulting from the standardisation of trades, according to John Van Verre, head of global custody at HSBC Securities Services.Significant change is on its way and the sooner asset managers realise what it means operationally, the better for them and their clients, according to Bikram Singh, Citi’s head of OTC derivatives services. A recent paper Mr Singh co-authored on the subject and highlighted in an earlier FTfm supplement, identifies five areas where the buyside could begin making preparations for the big day. These include determining the regulatory classification of their organisation, appointing a clearing member firm for clearance of eligible trades and establishing trade connectivity.Other areas clients could be working on in the interim period include ensuring that internal operations and technology staff can meet the new reporting and reconciliation guidelines. Internal staff – or an outsourced middle-office provider – must also be able to split portfolios into clearing-eligible and clearing-ineligible buckets and to track and administer the increased margin requirements. Finally, clients should be assessing the impact of central clearing on margin and collateral levels and eligibility and consider the potential impact of margin and collateral increases on portfolio management.Although risk reduction is one of the principal driving forces behind central clearing, it is clear that it will not be a panacea. It will not eliminate risk, only restructure it while increasing costs for end-clients, according to Martin Higgs, a senior vice president at State Street, who says the more sophisticated clients have either already appointed their clearing members or are conducting the relevant interviews.The nature of collateral management will change with daily resetting, marking to market and posting of variable capital pushing out current less demanding practices. This is good news for custodians, says Rob Hegarty, global head of market structure for the Enterprise Solutions business at Thomson Reuters, as it will increase the need for top quality collateral management. But they will have to move fast, he warns. If the custodians do not invest in the technology required to improve existing collateral management capabilities, third-party players will.The bifurcation of capital that will take place in a market where some trades are cleared and some are struck bilaterally will almost inevitably complicate processes and push up costs. Despite the determination of clients to benefit from more services at less cost, it is they who will ultimately pay for the raft of initiatives facing the industry, introducing a new drag on investment performance.One point for custodians to address, in their own purely commercial interests, is the potential loss of income if significant volumes of pension fund assets that are currently in their custody are moved elsewhere as part of the new-look collateral management world, in which segregation of assets will be required at the clearing level. This is clearly not in a custodian’s best interests, but neither is it in the client’s best interests, argues Steve Ingle, derivatives product manager at Bank of New York Mellon. “The clearing houses have put custody arrangements in place according to their own criteria and clients will find themselves having to pay an extra set of fees.”Unsurprisingly, custodians argue the case for revisiting processes and systems so they do not lose custody of such assets. They suggest a clearing house could open an account with the custodian to enable quick, efficient and safe book transfers to take place. They claim this would make more efficient use of capital while reducing external instruction risk and financial cost.Helene Viretto, head of collateral management at BNP Paribas Securities Services, says: “We need clarification on certain points, including the extraterritoriality sought by the USA, and we need to be flexible in finding a tactical solution within the timeframe.”
88;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:36:46Z;The ETF effect: Funds industry growth boosts servicing;Asset service providers have developed consultancy services to help new ETF managers;Rapid growth in the exchange traded funds industry is good news for asset servicing providers.“ETFs are definitely a recognised area of new growth for asset service providers. The revenue potential is still in its infancy,” says Jeffrey McCarthy, global ETF product head at Citi Global Transaction Services.Liam Butler, managing director of Northern Trust Securities Services Ireland, adds: “The growth prospects for ETFs far outweigh those of many other sectors for asset service providers.”BlackRock estimates that 12 new ETF providers entered the industry in the first half of 2011 and a further 41 are currently planning to launch their first ETF. More than 1,000 new product launches are planned, which will take the total number of exchange traded products on offer above 5,000.But simply launching an ETF is no guarantee of success. Increasingly, funds are failing to gather enough assets to be profitable. McKinsey estimates that almost three-quarters of the ETFs launched in 2009 failed to attract $100m in assets within two years, compared with less than one in 10 in 2003.“Bringing out a new ETF remains a challenging process,” says Joseph Keenan, head of global exchange traded fund services at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing.Mr Keenan says the increasing sophistication of many newly created ETFs can pose operational and distribution challenges for asset managers.So asset service providers have developed consultancy services to help new ETF managers take their ideas from the drawing board to the market. They also provide advice on legal requirements, regulations, tax issues, prepare listings applications and other documentation for exchanges, and help with the actual launch process.In August, Citi set up a business to service the ETF market in Asia with a joint venture combining its expertise in transactions services and capital markets.Mr McCarthy says the bank plans to offer a one-stop shop that can combine all the services required by ETF issuers, from seed capital to market making, administration, custody and accounting. It aims to roll out its ETF services business globally.Asset service providers also play an important role as “match-makers” between an ETF manager and market makers. A key requirement is to provide details of the investable basket of assets that make up an ETF in time for the start of trading on the following day. Corporate actions, such as a share splits, involve recalculating the investable basket.Mr Keenan says there is “no place to hide” for an asset service provider if those calculations go wrong. The available window” to calculate the value of the ETF has tightened as many now settle on trade day whereas traditional funds settle on T plus 1 day.Robert Rushe, head of ETF servicing at State Street Global Services, says the quality of back office services can have a real impact on the products that large institutional clients, known as authorised participants (APs), decide to use.Settlement processes in Europe are particularly challenging as many ETFs are listed on multiple exchanges that require different settlement processes.Mr Butler of Northern Trust says managing the settlement process efficiently is an “absolute essential” to ensure APs have access to their ETFs as soon as possible.Mr Rushe adds that the cross-border ETF settlement process needs to be addressed at a European level and much more focus on these issues is expected from all interested parties.In Europe, “synthetic” products which use derivatives account for around 44 per cent of ETF assets whiile the vast majority of US listed ETFs employ “physical” replication and buy the constituents of the index they are tracking.Shawn McNinch, global head of ETF services for Brown Brothers Harriman, says these two approaches present different issues for asset service providers. Physical ETFs require timely settlement of both the ETF itself and the basket of underlying securities. This process is easier in the US where there is a central depository but more problematic in Europe where there are multiple depositories.Synthetic ETFs require asset service providers to play a vital role in ensuring their collateral management programmes are robust, according to Mr McNinch. That role requires performing mark to market checking and communicating with a swap counterparty to ask for more collateral if the derivative pricing has moved against them.
89;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:36:39Z;Distribution: Custodian banks clear all obstacles;Investment managers can expect a range of services when starting businesses abroad;Investment managers heap about as much praise on custodian banks as they do on clients, loudly applauding them for the help they provide when setting up shop overseas.An array of cultural and regulatory differences present themselves when investment houses market funds abroad or recruit foreign clients. And custodian banks are often asked to step into the breach and lessen the impact of such divisions.The collection of services custodian banks provide abroad ranges from run-of-the-mill core custody work such as settling trades, pricing securities positions, record-keeping and reporting, to executing foreign exchange transactions, repatriation of assets and processing tax claims. In some cases, custodians employ sub-custodians or agent banks in other countries to help them conduct business.The pick-up in the importance of fund platforms also throws up an opportunity for custodian banks who now bear more responsibility for seeing that they are serviced well and meet various regulatory and legal standards in other countries.“In whatever country it is you’re dealing with, there’s a tremendous amount of accounting and reconciliation and process that needs to get done before a trade settles in a client’s account and is documented,” says Nancy Wolcott, head of of US fund services at BNY Mellon. “It doesn’t matter if an asset manager wants to offer an offshore product that’s attractive to US investors or a product that foreign investors might want to buy, we can offer them a spectrum of services.”The roll-out of au-courant technology helps custodian banks to streamline their offerings as well. BNY Mellon, which has $26,300bn in assets under custody and operates in 36 countries, for example, has launched Workbench SM Mobile, a programme that allows investment managers to view their portfolio exposure across accounts and asset classes, as well as regulatory news and account valuation changes, via an iPad.Wade MacDonald, State Street’s head of sales and client management for the UK, Middle East and Africa, meanwhile, points out that the Ucits fund revolution has also widened demand for custodian banks’ services. “The institutions we’re working with today are navigating their future direction around the types of vehicles and structures they want to have. In many cases, these are multi-domiciled, multi-vehicle types of structures and they bring new regulatory obligations that need to be met.”Picking up on a similiar trend, Peter Cherecwich, head of global fund services at Northern Trust, notes that demand for the company’s services in Asia continues to rise thanks to the surge in the number of investment houses looking to offer Ucits funds in Asia, but lacking offices there. “If they have no bricks and mortar in Asia, but they are distributing, they need operational support,” he says.The quality and range of the infrastructure that custodian banks are able to provide to investment managers also continues to increase. If a UK fund manager, for example, wants to distribute investment products in the US, but does not want to go through the exercise of hiring a board of directors, Northern Trust will find the directors and officers required. “That way they can plug their portfolio in and start going ahead and distributing,” says Mr Cherecwich. “It’s a way for smaller organisations to get access to the US mutual fund market without having to pay all the money to set up their own infrastructure.”The needs of investment houses tend to vary by their size. The smaller a firm is, the more support it requires, according to Mr Cherecwich. Larger firms tend to handle more of their operational duties in-house. “Everyone has a different philosophy of what is core and what should be outsourced and what shouldn’t be,” says Mr Cherecwich.Mr MacDonald says he and his colleagues spend considerable time trying to map out which investors fund managers are trying to sell their products to and where they will sell them: “We also have to figure out the best legal and regulatory framework for those investments.”He argues that the role of the custodian is to free the investment manager to focus on its two most important tasks: running the money and building up their client base. The sophisticated platforms some custodians now use help them to provide the necessary operational support to investment houses that maintain an increasingly wide range of investment vehicles and fund structures. “Our work is to make sure we’re ahead of the fund management industry, so we can give fund houses the utmost flexibility,” says Mr MacDonald.
90;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-18T23:36:27Z;Default protection: Collateral management grows in strength;Institutions know they need to manage their risk of counterparty default;Unless you are talking about the 2004 crime thriller starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the word collateral is seldom one to set pulses racing.But as financial markets go through the process of post-crisis rebuilding, collateral management is emerging as an increasingly central area for a host of market participants.The real dangers of counterparty default and credit risk were exposed during the dog days of the financial crisis, most brutally through the collapse of Lehman Brothers in late 2008.As a result, institutions ranging from asset managers to corporates, hedge funds to superannuation funds have become more aware of the need to prudently manage their risk of counterparty default.Collateral has been used for hundreds of years to provide security against the possibility of default by the opposing party in a trade. Collateral management in its current and increasingly complex form traces its roots to the 1980s when Salomon Brothers and Bankers Trust began taking collateral against credit exposure.Collateral management involves monitoring, tracking and valuing collateral throughout the life of a trade as well as sending and receiving the collateral itself. Institutions such as fund managers tend to outsource this to third-party providers with the result that the business of collateral management is becoming a competitive one in its own right.John Southgate, product manager, derivatives servicing at Northern Trust, says: “Since the crisis more custody clients are looking at, and taking, collateral management as a standalone service. The clients range from corporate treasurers to fund managers, from pension and superannuation funds to hedge funds and many other groups. There is now keener scrutiny over counterparty credit risks and the buyside is increasingly pushing for collateral to be held by a third party.”Raj Shah, global head of collateral management at Citi, adds that in light of concerns about counterparty default, that were brought into such sharp focus during the crisis, clients are seeking more “industrial strength” collateral management solutions. “This encompasses a number of aspects of the business, including tightening legal agreements and segregating assets so that they do not potentially get tied up in a liquidation pot,” he says.He adds that this industrial strength service includes a robust automated system “which we combine with our expertise through our operational and client service staff at a cost that is commensurate with the volumes that the buyside is doing”.“Going forward we will be focusing on enhancing our offering. In the new world of central clearing there remains a fear of a collateral squeeze. Optimisation of collateral management is essentially about four different questions: what can I rehypothecate [pledge again as collateral against a loan], what can I upgrade, what can I relocate and how can I maximise the amount of netting I can do in this brave new world?”Drew Demko, head of broker dealer services for BNY Mellon in Europe, says that since the start of the crisis the firm has become even more embedded with its clients.“We listen to and participate in the market, offer solutions, and have an ongoing dialogue with regulators. The rapidly shifting market and regulatory environment means we are continuing to keep our ear to the ground globally. Against this backdrop of change, it is a challenge at times to translate what we are hearing into product. But that is where the competition in this space lies,” he says.Collateral management is heavily reliant on robust technology but with the accent on safety for many market participants, client relationship management can be an important part of the collateral business. “While technology is key to clients, the fact is that state of the art technology is almost taken as a given.“An old-fashioned personal touch – with clear and continuous communication – is imperative to our success,” says Mr Demko.Much development across financial markets today is being driven indirectly by the ever-shifting landscape of regulations. Regulators across the globe are trying to phase in a dizzying array of new checks and balances that have some market participants scratching their heads about what exactly they are required to do and how quickly.Mr Southgate says that with central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives coming in, there are several issues that make collateral management more complex for the buyside, such as increasing margin requirements and the need to perform collateral upgrades. “As a service provider, our role is to provide a lot more help around such areas as IT, consulting and operations,” he says.Mr Demko agrees that the financial crisis has led to regulators and the market as a whole focussing more sharply on issues surrounding counterparty risk.“The endgame is better funding costs, regulatory adherence, reduced counterparty risk and stability,“ he says. “Reducing funding costs is key, and as part of this we see that many clients are considering moving more and more of their unsecured funding to secured.”Mr Shah says that collateral management will only become more central as the new wave of global regulation continues to gathers momentum.“Collateral is very much front and centre and is going to become even more central as new regulations such as Basel 3 and EMIR [European Market Infrastructure Regulation] are implemented,” he says.
91;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-09-04T19:03:37Z;US money market blow for eurozone;;US money market funds say they cut their exposure to eurozone banks for a second consecutive month in August, reducing the availability of credit as the stress in the region’s banking system increasingly affects stronger countries such as France.Some money market funds, historically essential providers of short-term financing to European banks, have begun to avoid French institutions entirely, while other money market fund managers say they are “de-emphasising” the country’s banks.One head described the process as the “ongoing diversification out of core Europe into the Nordic, Canadian and Japanese banks”, adding that money market lending to banks in the peripheral countries, and to Spain and Italy, had in effect ceased.“Exposures have fallen dramatically, even from a month ago,” said Peter Yi, director of short-term fixed income at Northern Trust. Money market funds were not renewing all their short-term loans to the banks as they mature, or were lending only for very short periods, he said.In a presentation to debt investors last week, Société Générale reported that its short-term funding dropped €19bn ($27bn) to €53bn in the first half of August as money market funds pulled back. The bank also described its short-term funding sources as “well diversified”, with abundant forms of euro-based liquidity available.Meanwhile, the head of one large fund said he had cut his exposure European banks to about 30 per cent of assets, half the level of two years ago. Loans to French banks are now less than a 10th of his fund’s investments, from 16 per cent two months ago.Money market funds have continued to reduce European exposure even as the $2,700bn industry has attracted assets following the resolution of the battle to raise the US debt ceiling on August 2.Driving the funds’ behaviour is the fear of a run from nervous investors, who can withdraw money without notice.“Our money market team has significantly diminished its exposure to eurozone banks recently because of headline risk, not because of credit issues,” said Legg Mason, which has ceased money market lending to the French banks.However, French lending conditions have improved in the past week, with some funds again prepared to lend money for a month or more. Figures from the Federal Reserve also show a slight increase in short-term lending to foreign financials, with commercial paper outstanding rising $1.8bn in the last week of August.The European banking exposure of the 10 biggest US money market funds fell to 47 per cent of their $658bn assets at the end of July, down from 48.7 per cent of the funds’ $698bn of assets at the end of June, according to Fitch Ratings.Funds are waiting for a clear resolution of the sovereign debt issues facing the eurozone before they return to normal lending activities. “We all know that uncertainty has a corrosive effect on the market. If there is a market disruption we want to be prepared for it,” said Mr Yi.
92;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-08-31T23:40:47Z;BNY Mellon ousts chief executive Kelly;;Bank of New York Mellon has ousted Robert Kelly as chief executive, citing “differences in approach to managing the company”, and appointed Gerald Hassell, a 30-year veteran of the bank, as his successor.“We’ve got some management issues,” said a person close to the situation. “This is not a precipitous thing. It was over a period of time. We thought we had to make a change. We’ve got a good guy in Gerald.”People close to the situation said the bank’s strategy remained unchanged and that the departure was unrelated to a recently announced bout of job cuts and had nothing to do with “integrity” or “any pending litigation”.Mr Kelly could not be reached for comment. In a statement released by BNY Mellon, he said it had “been an honour to serve” the bank.“We have navigated tremendously difficult markets and built one of the world’s premier financial institutions,” he said. “I am confident that under Gerald’s leadership of the firm’s strong management team, BNY Mellon will continue to flourish going forward.”Mr Kelly had been touted as a potential future head of a bigger bank and linked to Bank of America, where Brian Moynihan, chief executive, is under pressure. A person close to the situation said Mr Kelly had not left for any such position.In the statement released after the market closed, Wesley von Schack, a long-time board member of the bank, said that Mr Hassell was “ideally positioned to guide BNY Mellon through the next phase of its growth and to bring it to its full potential” and commended Mr Kelly as “a person of the highest integrity”.BNY Mellon recently announced it would charge fees on some large deposits because it was swamped with cash from investors and could not make a good return on investing the money. It also announced this month that it would eliminate about 1,500 jobs, or 3 per cent of its employees, in a cost-cutting drive.Over the past year, the company has come under increasing pressure from investors, who have questioned the bank’s strategy in the current low interest rate environment, its ability to weather structural issues such as the squeeze on its higher-margin businesses and its ability to reduce costs, one analyst covering the company said.“Kelly was well liked and fairly visible,” the analyst said. “But a little bit of the Kelly magic was wearing off.”The states of Virginia and Florida sued the company this month, alleging that it overcharged state pension funds on foreign exchange transactions.Those lawsuits, along with the legal risks posed by the firm’s role as a trustee in ­mortgage securities, may have been the biggest driver behind investor anxiety, the analyst said.In the past 12 months, the bank’s share price has fared worse than State Street, one of its closest peers, but performed slightly better than Northern Trust, another peer, and better than bigger, more diversified competitors such as Citigroup and Bank of America.BNY Mellon’s shares on Wednesday closed down 0.7 per cent at $20.67.

94;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-06-10T23:47:00Z;Federal Reserve widens net for capital tests;;"The Federal Reserve will force more banks to submit to new annual capital tests, allowing US officials to veto dividends and share buy-backs at any group with more than $50bn in assets.In a proposal on Friday, the Fed said it planned to expand the existing pool of top-tier banks subject to the capital assessment scheme from 19 to 35, drawing in the likes of Northern Trust and M&T Bank.The plan is the latest development in so-called “macro-prudential” regulation: policing the financial system as a whole for risks rather than looking at just the safety and soundness of individual banks.Stress tests carried out in 2009 on 19 banks were the prototypes for the new examinations. Those succeeded in restoring faith in the financial system after the crisis when officials published results of a detailed examination of the banks’ capital positions.This year, the Fed conducted capital assessments of the same group of institutions, ranging from Bank of America to American Express, requesting data on how they would fare in a shock economic downturn and asking them to submit capital distribution plans for approval. JPMorgan Chase was able to increase its dividend after the tests; Bank of America was not.Expanding the set of companies to those with just $50bn in assets matches the definition of a “systemically important” institution under last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reforms. These banks will be subject to a capital surcharge, on top of the requirement to maintain a 7 per cent tier one capital ratio to assets, adjusted for risk, agreed by the international Basel committee.Fed officials have said that smaller banks, such as Zions Bancorporation of Salt Lake City, the smallest bank to exceed the revised threshold, will face only a minimal additional capital requirement.There is heated debate over the capital charge for the biggest institutions, led by BofA and JPMorgan. Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor, said last Friday that staff calculations showed the charge could be anywhere between 1.4 per cent and 7 per cent. The mention of a higher than expected top end of the range sparked a sell-off this week among bank stocks.But the US Treasury is pushing for a surcharge of 2-2.5 per cent, while Fed officials do not expect the surcharge to exceed 3 per cent.US officials are trying to agree a number with international counterparts at the Basel committee before a decision is ratified by government ministers in November."
95;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-05-22T11:06:11Z;Boutiques grab growing market share;;Small investment boutiques are breaking through the glass ceiling and taking significant market share from the industry’s heavyweights, according to new data. Minnows with fewer than 10 funds captured 26 per cent of net inflows into cross-border European funds in the first quarter of the year, according to Lipper FMI, up from 9 per cent in 2010 and just 3 per cent in 2009.The share of new money soaked up by the biggest players, with more than 60 funds in their roster, fell to just 64 per cent in the first quarter, the lowest figure since 2002, with the exception of 2007 when the figures were skewed by a wave of redemptions from the largest groups.“There is a very real trend towards the specialist boutiques,” said Diana Mackay, chief executive of Mackay Williams, an industry commentator.The “small is beautiful” trend is also evident in a number of domestic European markets. In Germany, Assenagon, a boutique with less than €2bn ($2.8bn) under management, beat off the likes of Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank to secure the largest net inflows in the first quarter, some €670m.Ruffer and Neptune, two relatively small houses, were in the top 10 in the UK, while the trend was particularly notable in France, where small fund houses Moneta, Métropole, Schelcher Prince Gestion and Rouvier attracted significant inflows.Ms Mackay attributed this to the “Carmignac factor”, with boutiques encouraged by the runaway success of the French house, which has broken out of its domestic market and seen its assets under management soar from €12.6bn in 2008 to €53bn.“All these people who worked in the big banks have come out and started their own boutiques. People have seen through Carmignac that dramatic things are possible. A new seed of life has sprung forth, very much fertilised by Carmignac,” said Ms Mackay.Daniel Enskat, head of global consulting at Strategic Insight, said the trend towards boutiques was global, pointing to the success of Hong Kong-based Value Partners, the “Asian Carmignac”, which attracted more than $1bn of net inflows last year.Mr Enskat attributed the trend to a degree of disenchantment with larger houses, especially the fund arms of banks, in the wake of the financial crisis, the clarity of investment strategy of many boutiques and some strong performance.Chris Vella, global director of research at Chicago-based Northern Trust said there was strong evidence that smaller houses outperform. The group has $5.7bn of its $43bn of assets invested in “emerging” managers and launched two more funds focused on this trend last week.Northern Trust’s own research suggests large-cap US equity funds run by houses with assets of less than $3.6bn have consistently outperformed those managed by bigger houses, with lower volatility, a trend Mr Vella believed was repeated globally.“Boutique organisations typically are focused on a single investment strategy. They tend to have a nimble investment process and the right alignment of interests with clients,” he said. “That does not guarantee outperformance but there is a lot of alpha that folks are leaving on the table. The largest managers tend to hug the index.”Ms Mackay argued the rise of boutiques was a secular trend likely to continue, but Mr Enskat feared some fund distributors were looking to work with fewer strategic partners, potentially cutting out many of the smaller players.
96;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-03-16T21:44:00Z;Fed opposes single surcharge for banks;;The US will not support a single capital surcharge for the world’s biggest financial groups, the Federal Reserve’s top bank supervisor said, in an apparent boost for some of the industry.Pat Parkinson, head of supervision at the Fed, said on Wednesday most of the Basel group of regulators, which is setting new restrictions on the most complex globally active institutions, agreed. “There may be one or two countries that want a single number but they are in the minority and we hope they stay that way,” he said.Instead, Mr Parkinson said, both in the US and internationally, the Fed was advocating a “gradated” approach with a “nominal” surcharge for a bank of $50bn in assets and a greater one for those at the top with more than $1,000bn.In the aftermath of the financial crisis, countries are divided on how tough new capital standards should be for the so-called systemically important financial institutions (Sifis).Switzerland, whose biggest banks represent a large portion of national wealth, has gone furthest in forcing its banks to hold more capital to guard against collapse.In the UK, Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said on Wednesday that the best way to prevent big banks from failing would be to impose a significant surcharge. While global efforts to make it easier to wind down a failing global bank and impose losses on bank bond holders are positive steps, he said, neither would be sufficient in a crisis because of the risk of “knock on systemic disruption”.“We need to reduce the probability and impact of Sifi failures. The best way to do that is with equity surcharges,” he said at a speech at Cass Business School.France and Germany have fought against the toughest suggestions for surcharges on top of the Basel standards, which were agreed last year and will phase in over several years.However, the US has pushed hard for other countries to adopt a surcharge. Financial reform passed by Congress last year forces regulators to impose a tougher capital regime for systemically important institutions such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase and US officials are worried about non-US banks gaining a competitive advantage.“Definitely we intend to gradate and the gradations will be significant,” Mr Parkinson said at an American Bankers Association conference in Washington. Banks that are large but not huge – such as Northern Trust or M&T – might benefit from that approach.The US reforms classify bank holding companies with more than $50bn in assets as systemically important and the US is working on which non-banks should join them. But Mr Parkinson emphasised that a bank that has “just crossed the $50bn barrier” would face only a “nominal charge” with “more significant charges” for bigger institutions.Underlining another thorny area of international regulatory talks, Lord Turner said that while he supported efforts to make it easier to wind down a failing global bank and impose losses on bond holders, in a crisis, both steps might prove impossible to carry out because of the risk of “knock on systemic disruption”.“We need to reduce the probability and impact of Sifi failures. The best way to do that is with equity surcharges,” he said at a speech at Cass Business School in London.While he favoured a capital ratio of 15-20 per cent in an ideal world, he added that such levels are unobtainable because of the economic costs of forcing all banks to build up that much additional equity.

He would avoid bonds and continue his long-held preference for commodities.“There has been inflation but the US and UK governments lie about it …Money all around the world is becoming more and more debased so you need to own real assets.”Markets have been pricing in higher inflation expectations since the summer. Break-even rates, which measure investors’ expectations for inflation, have risen steadily since August in the US, UK and Germany to 2.2 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively, but they are still reasonably subdued.UK mortgage brokers have reported a surge in demand from private clients for fixed-rate deals in the past week, spurred by the shock rise in inflation. “We’re getting more and more enquiries from clients wanting to fix their mortgage for five years,” said Simon Gammon of Knight Frank Finance.First Direct, Halifax, Yorkshire Building Society and Barclays Wealth became the latest lenders to pull their most competitive fixed-rate products and increased rates by as much as 0.5 percentage points.A survey by Northern Trust found 62 per cent of investors thought global inflation would rise in the next six months, while 53 per cent thought market interest rates would rise this quarter. But their concern was tempered by faith in strong economic growth.Inflation has been strongest in emerging markets such as China, where inflation was 4.6 per cent in December, just below a two-year high, and economists expect strong price increases early this year.However, other well-known investors are sanguine about the inflation outlook. Anthony Bolton, the Fidelity stock-picker who deferred his retirement to invest in China, said: “I don’t think inflation is going to be a major problem …In this two-speed world, I expect that, despite the higher inflation in emerging markets, the flow of money will still be from the developed world into the emerging one.”Bankers said there was increasing demand among investors for floating-rate debt, where interest payments increase as rates do.But borrowers such as companies are rushing to lock in cheap fixed-rate deals. “There is a big battle brewing here,” said one senior debt banker in London.

99;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2011-01-19T21:54:25Z;Financials lead US equities lower;;Financial stocks fell after disappointing results from Goldman Sachs weighed on the wider markets while strong performances by Apple and IBM failed to stem the losses.Goldman reported a 52 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profit, sending shares in the investment bank down 4.7 per cent to $166.49.This dragged on the financial sector, prompting fears that the earnings results of other major US banks would also fail to live up to expectations.Morgan Stanley, which will report fourth-quarter results on Thursday, was down 3.5 per cent to $27.75 while Bank of America Merrill Lynch, reporting on Friday, was down 4.2 per cent to $14.37. The S&P financials index dropped 2.2 per cent to 218.92.Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo also disappointed investors with fourth-quarter earnings. It reported profits slightly below expectations at 54 cents a share compared to the 57 cents per share expected by analysts, sending shares down 1.7 per cent to $31.58.Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest bank in the US, reported a profit of $3.41bn, up from $2.82bn a year earlier. This was broadly in line with analyst expectations but the stock still lost 2 per cent to $31.81 in line with the rest of the sector.Last week, JPMorgan posted strong results, raising expectations that other banks would follow suit. But Citigroup posted weak fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, sending financial stocks lower and adjusting market expectations.Many investors remain confident that upcoming results from the major US banks will still be strong.“Our view is there will be more surprises on the upside than the downside in coming weeks,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management.Losses for financials led the S&P 500 to close 1 per cent lower to 1,281.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.1 per cent to 11,825.29 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.5 per cent to 2,725.36.Strong results from Apple failed to protect the stock from another day of losses after news on Monday that Steve Jobs, chief executive officer, was taking a medical leave of absence.Apple was lifted to all-time highs after it posted bumper first-quarter earnings figures.Apple reported earnings of $6.43 a share, beating the $5.39 a share consensus forecasts. The results were a sharp increase on the $3.67 a share earned in the first quarter last year.But later in the day the stock turned into negative territory as traders booked profits and turned their attention once again to the imminent absence of Mr Jobs. Apple closed down 0.5 per cent to $338.84.This weighed on the S&P technology index, which fell 1.2 per cent to 456.23.IBM was one of the few major technology stocks to gain in the session after posting strong fourth-quarter results after the market closed on Tuesday, which exceeded analysts’ expectations.Shares in the world’s largest computer services provider were up 3.4 per cent to $155.69.Dell, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard are all due to report in the coming weeks. Data from the Commerce Department for December showed a sharp decline in the number of new houses being built, which also helped to weigh on investor sentiment.Figures showed that an annual rate of 529,000 new homes were started in December from the 555,000 in November, falling short of median forecasts.“This is consistent with reports that homebuilder confidence remains severely depressed, indicating financial distress on the part of many households,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.But the economic data were mixed as the number of new building permits rose 16.7 per cent to an annual rate of 635,000 in December compared with 544,000 the prior month.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Northern Trust, the Chicago-based bank, fell 5.7 per cent to $52.49 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of $157.1m, down from the $200.3m in the same period last year.Hudson City Bancorp, the New Jersey regional bank, saw the sharpest losses on the S&P index after reporting profit down 11 per cent to $121.2m. The stock lost 6.5 per cent to $12.04.American Express fell 2.4 per cent to $45.24 after the credit card company said it was cutting 550 jobs and that it expected fourth-quarter earnings to fall slightly short of Wall Street’s estimates.

101;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;Custodians confident AIFM will bring clarity;;Depositories are breathing a sigh of relief over the alternative investment fund managers (AIFM) directive.As negotiations draw to a close, the responsibilities of the future hedge fund asset safe-keepers have been watered down compared with early draft proposals.At the time of going to press, custodians are quite upbeat about the latest version of the directive, which aims to create a secure regime for professional investors in hedge funds.David Curtin, general counsel for Northern Trust in Europe, says: “There is an improvement on what we’ve seen in the past where we would have had responsibility on the loss of financial instruments. Now we won’t be liable if loss rises beyond reasonable control.”Initial proposals by the European Commission in the wake of the financial crisis stated that depositories would be liable for the loss of AIFM assets “no matter what”. After the publication of first drafts, depositories say they went on to lead a rather quiet but apparently productive lobbying exercise in the corridors of Brussels.According to depositories, unlimited liability would have led to “unintended consequences”, including the possibility of increased costs for investors and, most worryingly for regulators, the potential growth of systemic risks in the wake of sector consolidation.Paul Bodart, executive vice-president at BNY Mellon, says: “There have been a lot of discussions with Brussels. The text is better. Although there is still an obligation of results [where only the outcome counts], we are liable only for things that are under our control. I don’t think we will be able to change that for an obligation of means [where intention matters most]: it’s non-negotiable.”Also, although finer details of the AIFM directive could still change, custodians are confident the 11-page depository section will bring much-needed clarity to the industry’s role and functions.The legislation, for example, will provide a European definition on safe-keeping, whose loose interpretation recently led to very different legal outcomes in cases of asset loss.In France, a court ruled that RBC Dexia was liable to return all assets to three hedge funds that had lost assets held by Lehman Brothers, while investors in Luxembourg-based Ucits funds kept by US fraudster Bernard Madoff are still to receive any compensation.Mr Bodart says: “[AIFM] is a big progress. Previous depository regimes were loose and interpretations were very different. The definition of what a depository must do [under the AIFM regime] is a lot more accurate.”Crucially, the legislation says a sub-custodian will be able to take liability under contract, instead of the custodian.This, however, will come at the cost of tough due diligence conditions, and only if the custodian “can demonstrate there is an objective reason for the delegation”, according to a recent AIFM proposal from the Belgian presidency.Mr Curtin says: “It goes against how we’re structured, and also the thinking is unclear. A lot of things need to be clarified.”Even though depositories will avoid untenable levels of liability under the latest proposals, AIFM is likely to prove lengthy and costly when problems arise. The reverse of the “burden of proof”, for example, will mean depositories must prove they have no responsibility in case of lost assets. Before, investors had to prove there had been fault on the custodian side.Despite these issues, the AIFM directive is still considered as a good deal.More worrying perhaps is the fact the Commission plans to “reconcile” the hedge fund directive with the Ucits legislation, importing features such as on depositories.Ugo Bassi, head of unit for asset management at the Commission’s DG Internal Market and Services, recently warned that “we’ll certainly end up with a [depository] regime stricter in Ucits than in AIFM”. This position is shared by the French regulator, AMF, which criticised the Ucits regime for failing to protect retail investors from Bernard Madoff.Patrice Bergé-Vincent, head of asset management policy at the AMF, recently said: “Institutional investors don’t need protection from the regulator but [by doing]. . . their own due diligence. [However], Ucits are marketed to retail investors who are not capable of understanding custody arrangements. They need rules to protect them.”The Commission is waiting for an agreement over the AIFM directive before starting to draft “clarifications” on Ucits rules. Although it is at an early stage, a few ideas have already emerged.For example, regulators have explained that the future retail regime will establish the level of liability for each participant.Whereas contractual discharges will be possible between managers and custodians under AIFM, the overriding rule under Ucits will be that there should be an obligation for a depository to restitute assets to an investor “with very few exemptions”. Depositories could expect to have more “constructive explanations” to give to regulators.
102;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2010-10-17T07:51:12Z;Back office function comes to the fore;;The often overlooked and unloved function of transfer agency is currently undergoing something of an image makeover.Once considered the poor cousin of the back office, dealing mainly with unglamorous administrative functions such as investor record keeping and shareholder voting habits, managers that are eager to expand their footprint globally are viewing transfer agency in a new light.A majority of fund houses have already outsourced their transfer agency functions to third parties, as companies continue to grapple with rising costs and attempt to focus on their core competency of managing client assets. “Managers realise they are not creating a competitive advantage by doing this [transfer agency] in-house, and they don’t have the scale of the large transfer agents,” says Simon Hudson-Lund, chief executive at International Financial Data Services.Henderson Global Investors was one of the latest managers to outsource its investor record keeping and transfer agency to IFDS this year after its integration of New Star’s UK retail book.Henderson joins other UK managers, including Axa and Jupiter, that have ceased in-house administration and the upkeep of investor records, having outsourced such functions to third parties.However, some still perceive transfer agency as part of their core offering, says Mr Hudson-Lund, who points to Fidelity as an example of one fund house still continuing this function in-house. As European fund houses look to export the global brand of Ucits to new markets, asset service providers argue transfer agency is becoming more important in boosting distribution.“Transfer agency is part of a manager’s cost base they need to keep an eye on, but distribution is now a key word on everyone’s lips,” says Mr Hudson-Lund.“Asset managers are grappling with how they can keep a foot in the distribution camp, which ultimately means transfer agency. After all, we are the link with the distributors.”Richard Willis, global transfer agency product manager at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, acknowledges the increased role transfer agency is playing in a firm’s relationship with its distributors.He says: “We don’t talk about transfer agency on its own today. A lot of work is around servicing the global distribution of our clients.“The growth and emergence of distribution is driving demand and in some cases we interact more with distributors than our asset manager clients.”But while technology in other areas of investment management has succeeded in creating greater efficiencies, transfer agency is still plagued by countless faxes and manual processes that cloud any hopes of fully automating this function.Karen Hamilton, head of product development for fund administration at Northern Trust, argues automation of transfer agency is making progress.“Around 10 years ago fund managers would have had their own sales force speaking with IFAs, but as managers look to distribute funds from a global perspective, to communicate automatically is increasingly important.”Unlike the US market, which operates a single standard for automated messaging – known as NSCC – Europe has a series of different formats including Swift, EMXCo and FundSettle.While distributors have made moves to become more automated, the plethora of different messaging systems used means service providers often have to bear the brunt of improving systems to cope.Ms Hamilton says: “We recognise that we can’t just have one solution to fit everyone, so Northern Trust has spent the last three years enabling our systems to receive automated deals in as many formats as possible.”Four years ago the automation of deals – or straight through processing – at Northern Trust stood at 0.1 per cent. Now more than 70 per cent are fully automated, says Ms Hamilton.While there is little optimism that a 100 per cent automation rate will ever be achieved, the eventual aim for now at least is a wider adoption of the so-called ISO standard to further reduce reliance on manual processes.BNY’s Mr Willis says: “The problem with Europe is that each market is different. Italy is highly automated in terms of cross-border automation, while Germany is still relatively low. We have to deal with each independently.“In Asia, distributors in Taiwan are delivering thousands of faxes back into the asset servicing world, and asset service providers have to have systems in place to channel those into electronic messages.“It is down to the individual distributor to improve automation,” he adds.
103;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2010-08-08T12:42:21Z;Boutique start-ups on the rise again in the US;;"Like Tolstoy’s unhappy families, every portfolio team that is unhappy working for a large bank, broker or insurance company is unhappy in its own way. Higher-ups dictate that managers alter their cherished investment processes, pour assets into strategies beyond their capacities, starve teams of resources, or leave employees in fear of the next overhaul of long-term strategy.Small wonder, then, that many teams leave to establish their own firms. “I had to decide whether I would manage portfolios following my process that had been a success for 10 years, or become beholden to a big parent company,” says Paul Hechmer, formerly of Tradewinds Global Investors, who in mid-2009 co-founded del Rey Global Investors in Los Angeles.“For my own sanity, and the sake of my clients’ assets, striking out on my own was the right thing to do.”Janice Fritz-Snyder, director of US manager research with consultants Towers Watson, adds: “Over the last 20 or 30 years consultants have followed the portfolio managers and their teams who jump from large banks to their own firms. Many of the most talented people leave the [big] firms to do their own thing.”Investment industry lore, backed by quantitative studies, holds that boutique managers tend to create more alpha, or market-
beating returns, for investors than the investment teams ensconced in big banks or insurance companies. For example, data from Northern Trust (see chart) shows smaller managers earned higher returns with lower volatility during the five years ended 2008.As a result, consultants sometimes shorten the
customary three-year incubation period before hiring new managers.“Our due diligence process would still require multiple meetings with the manager, but for someone we’ve had good experience with in the past, and who’s in a capacity-constrained strategy, we could invest in a one-year track record,” says Ms Fritz-Snyder.“Historically, people were not fired for hiring a big name manager, whatever the performance record,” says John Zimmerman, managing director at Northern Lights Capital Group, a Seattle private equity firm specialising in money
management start-ups.“But in the recent financial crisis we saw all the big-name firms run into issues, and that exogenous factors, out of the investment teams’ control, had negative effects on the end clients. That has changed the career risk for any investment committee or CIO that selects managers.”Many start-ups in the US market are now great success stories. Turner Investment Partners, founded near Philadelphia in 1990, now has $19bn (£12bn, €14bn) of assets under management. LSV Asset Management of Chicago founded in 1994, is managing $58bn and Oaktree Capital Management of Los Angeles (1995) has $76bn.In the wake of the 2008-09 crisis, however, fewer managers have struck out on their own. According to the eVestment Alliance manager database, about 70 new houses appeared during 2007, but the number of new entrants fell to 32 in 2009 and to just seven in the first quarter of 2010.In part that is because manager search activity saw a big slowdown in 2008 and 2009, notes Tim Carver, also a managing director for Northern Lights Capital. Those managers who might have left thought twice when they saw the decrease in potential clients on the other side. “Over the last year or two, people who had an entrepreneurial bug found it hard to make an economic case to start their own firms,” Mr Carver says. “But today there is a coincidence of a comeback in the institutional search market, and a willingness to start new firms.”Getting an investment management company on an institutional track requires more than a clever strategy and solid track record.David Silvera, managing director at Rosemont Partners, also a private equity firm, estimates the upfront capital needed for data and compliance systems, offices, and two years’ worth of compensation for a team of eight at between $4m and $5m. He says: “That assumes a rapid ramp-up of assets. If things take off well, you’ll be overcapitalised; if not, you won’t be too short.”“We explored angel investors, bootstrapping the investment ourselves, and several private equity investors,” reports Brad Ball, one of four managing partners at Perimeter Capital Management, established in 2006 in Atlanta. In addition to the normal funding challenges, Perimeter also faced the prospect of a legal challenge from the team’s previous employer, SunTrust Bank.“We needed deep pockets on the legal fees, and what if we got into a catastrophic market and couldn’t raise assets?” Mr Ball wonders. Perimeter chose private equity funding via Rosemont and, as with many start-up managers, he was gratified by the reception for his new team from institutions and consultants.Mr Carver of Northern Lights reports receiving a new business plan nearly every day in 2010.At Rosemont, Mr Silvera says he looked at 100 opportunities in the year to April, up from 80 or 90 the year before. “Many of those 100 are good investors, although there are just a few who can run a business, and even fewer that have the proper respect for the non-investment aspects of a management firm and grant the right amounts of equity and compensation to those outside the investment team,” says Mr Silvera. Negotiations will start with 10 or so candidates, and in the end one or two will be funded.What happens to the rest? Some will go ahead regardless, Mr Silvera says, while “many will realise they aren’t that entrepreneurial after all, and take a job somewhere else.“On the spectrum of independence, there are a number of different options successful managers can find. Whatever they choose, they’ll probably feel better off than they did working at a big bank.”"
104;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2010-06-13T10:05:22Z;Crisis boots custodian business in Asia;Growth in demand for Northern Trust’s custodian bank services has been ‘phenomenal’;Asia’s $7,000bn (£4,900bn, €5,900bn) custodian banking sector is undergoing a “seismic shift” as fund managers seek to outsource portfolio risk management in the wake of the global financial crisis, according to a senior executive of Northern Trust.Rohan Singh, the US custodian bank’s Asia head of asset servicing sales, says the sector’s fast growing Asian business is being transformed as regulatory and cost pressures have combined with heightened risk awareness to push fund managers into seeking more help with risk management.“There’s been a quite phenomenal turn of interest in demand for portfolio oversight,” Mr Singh says in an interview in Singapore. “Asia is the fastest growing region for us globally. It’s a phenomenal rate of growth.”Mr Singh says the value of assets held in custody by Northern Trust in Asia had risen from $146bn in December 2008 to $263bn a year later – an increase of 80 per cent.“For about half of that $263bn we have seen an uptake of interest in risk monitoring,” he says.The rising interest is being driven by the challenge of managing a wider range of assets as funds diversify into alternative investments and other areas in an attempt to avoid the disastrous correlation of assets that caused many to suffer significant losses during the crisis.“We are seeing quite a bit of allocation interest towards that part, the hedge funds and private equity. What that means for our clients is they need increased technology capital to cope with this. It’s one thing to make a decision to invest in it, but how do you administer it?”Mr Singh says the crisis has also generated a heightened awareness of risk among the bank’s Asian clients, which include seven central banks and four sovereign wealth funds, as well as fund managers and big institutions such as Australia’s Future Fund and China’s National Council of Social Security Funds.Fund managers are also being pushed towards seeking outside help to monitor their assets by regulators seeking to ensure that funds are fully aware of the complex risks that may be lurking in portfolios, says Mr Singh.One example is the International Accounting Standards Board’s regulation IFRS7, which requires funds to demonstrate that they understand the risk elements of their portfolios, and to report annually on how they are managing them.“We are the data owner, so the industry looks to us to help them cope with this type of heightened regulatory oversight,” says Mr Singh.Many funds continue to do their own risk modelling, but the challenge of managing the data is pushing many to outsource the job to the custodians, who are investing heavily in computing power. Northern Trust is budgeting to spend $1.8bn on technology globally in the three years to 2012, compared with $1.1bn in the previous three years.“In the funds industry the activity we are seeing is in middle and back office outsourcing – everything other than portfolio managers and traders’ investment actions,” says Mr Singh.“We are in the middle of some large transactions – major institutions that are reviewing from a strategic perspective the whole issue of converting fixed costs to a variable perspective. For them, the attraction is that once it’s variable they pay as they go, so you don’t have office space and so forth when markets are down and under pressure.”In this respect, Asia is catching up with Europe and the US, where fund management institutions have been outsourcing for a long time.Outsourcing is more difficult in Asia, because of the wide legal and cultural differences in regulations, but is likely to spread fast as Asia’s rapid rates of economic growth propel institutions into a similar position to that of their counterparts in the west, says Mr Singh.“It’s only now that Asian institutions are starting to amass the type of assets that would warrant a major outsource,” he adds.
105;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2010-04-20T21:04:07Z;Wall St boosted by healthy bank earnings;;"US stock prices rallied for the second session on Tuesday, helped by gains in the highly weighted financials sector and some strong earnings announcements that boosted the bulls.“Today, it’s a welcome back, risk-recovery trade day around the globe supported by positive earnings surprises from global brand names in diverse sectors in Europe and the US – as well as an improvement in German investor sentiment for the first time in seven months,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities.He added: “This week belongs to earnings season with the economic data points back-end loaded for Friday and giving full focus on earnings as 135 companies in the S&P 500 report.”After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,207.17, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 11,117.06 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,500.31.Goldman Sachs, in the spotlight after regulators filed fraud charges against the bank on Friday, fell 2.1 per cent to $159.98 in spite of reporting significantly better-than-expected quarterly results, boosted by record fixed-income trading.Net profit increased 91 per cent to $3.46bn, or $5.59 per share, in the quarter, from $1.81bn, or $3.39 per share, a year earlier. The average analyst estimate was $4.14 per share.AIG, the troubled insurer that lost $2bn insuring collateralised debt obligations, including $6bn worth of Goldman’s, is considering pursuing Goldman to recoup some of those losses.The rest of the financials sector was higher as investors appeared to shrug off worries that the action against the bank would impact the wider sector.JPMorgan rose 1.1 per to $45.88 and Bank of America climbed 1.2 per cent to $18.61.Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $4.97 as the bank’s target price was raised at UBS to $5 from $3.75.IBM, the world’s largest technology services provider, lost 1.9 per cent to $129.69 in spite of the company raising its full-year earnings guidance and reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, boosted by an 18 per cent rise in consulting-
services signings.First-quarter profit was $1.97 per share from $1.70 per share a year earlier, compared with average analyst expectations of $1.93 per share.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, shed 0.1 per cent to $63.19 after it said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 9.5 per cent to 48.18 cents per share.Delta Air Lines dropped 0.2 per cent to $13.16 after the airline reported mixed first-quarter results with lower-than-expected revenues but a drop in losses from previous quarters.The largest carrier by passenger numbers lost $256m, or $0.31 per share, in the quarter to March, compared with a $794m, or $0.96, loss in the same period the previous year.Revenues climbed 2.5 per cent to $6.85bn, helped by rising fares, more bag-checking and fuller planes, but fell short of analyst forecasts of $7bn.Coca-Cola lost 1.5 per cent to $54.47 as the soft drinks company reported quarterly results that missed average analyst estimates, hurt by a decline in North American sales volumes. Revenues in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to $7.53bn, but fell short of the analysts’ average estimate of $7.72bn.Health insurer UnitedHealth Group lost 0.8 per cent to $30.98 even after the company posted first-quarter earnings that rose 21 per cent on the same period a year ago, beating analyst estimates. The company said rising Medicare enrolment offset losses in private-sector plans.Regional lenders were also in focus. US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon both beat earnings expectations. US Bancorp was up 2.2 per cent to $28.21, while BNY Mellon, was up slightly to $32.15.PNC Financial, which sold a unit earlier this year to BNY, was up 2.2 per cent to $64.92.But regional depository banks were some of the biggest fallers of the session after lacklustre earnings reports from two companies. State Street fell 4.2 per cent to $45.28 after it said earnings in the first quarter were in line with expectations but revenues disappointed.Smaller rival Northern Trust lost 5.1 per cent to $55.37. Earnings per share were 64 cents, compared to average analyst estimates of 71 cents per share.Motorbike maker Harley-Davidson was one of the top risers in the S&P 500 index as the company jumped 7.3 per cent to $35.17 after posting better-than-expected first-quarter results."

Investors were comforted by the lower-than-expected consumer price index figures. It was the first month-on-month decline in core CPI since 1982 and suggested that US inflation was under control.Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial, said: “This morning’s CPI figures were exactly the tonic the market needed. The markets were reassured that ‘the Fed is still my friend’.”The figures acted as a balance to Thursday’s unexpectedly high producer price index figures. Mr White said the divergence of the two inflation measures implied that producers were experiencing higher prices but were not currently able to pass them on to consumers.The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent to 1,109.17, marking a 3.1 per cent increase on the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to 10,402.35 and 2.9 per cent on the week. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent higher at 2,243.87 and rose 2.6 per cent on the week.Volumes, however, were lower than average due to Monday’s public holiday and school winter vacations.The financial sector was in focus late in the week due to its perceived sensitivity to a rate hike.Large US banks broadly improved, helped by a positive note on the sector from analysts at Morgan Stanley.Most banks mentioned in the note moved higher on Friday. Bank of New York Mellonimproved 3.5 per cent to $28.66, Northern Trust Corp rose 4.1 per cent to $54.60 and Morgan Stanley rose 0.6 per cent to $27.41. JPMorgan Chase bucked the trend, retreating 0.9 per cent to $40.03.“If this group trades down because investors assume that rising rates for the bank group is a negative, we strongly recommend investors buy,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.“The discount window rate hike signals rising confidence in the recovery,” they said. The broker is overweight large US banks “as we believe less bad is good for the stocks”.Citigroup strengthened 7.4 per cent during the week to $3.42, boosted by filings that revealed hedge funds run by prominent investors such as George Soros and John Paulson had increased their holdings in the bank in the last quarter.Also in the financial sector Charles Schwab, an independent broker, gained 5.2 per cent to $18.73 Friday as Goldman Sachs raised the stock to “neutral” from “sell” and increased the price target on the stock to $18.A dearth of significant mergers and acquisitions activity helped the $4.1bn acquisition of fertiliser maker Terra Industries by Norwegian rival Yara International stand out. The news sent Terra shares 24.5 per cent higher on the week to $41.30.A number of retail giants reported encouraging quarterly figures during the week. Department store operator JC Penneyyesterday rose 6.6 per cent to $27.66 on its fourth-quarter results. It reported better profits than many expected, and said same-store sales would be in the “low single digits” for the full fiscal year. The stock was up 11 per cent on the week.Whole Foods gained 13.1 per cent to $33.66 over the week following the release of its results on Tuesday.Walmart reported comparable-store sales that failed to match expectations, but still rose 1 per cent on the week to $53.49.Shares in Walgreens the largest US drugstore chain, gained 3.9 per cent during the week to $34.86 as it announced it was to buy rival Duane Reade for $1.1bn

The weakness in equities also put
pressure on the corporate bond prices of big financials.The 10-year bonds of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were quoted 15 basis points wider over Treasuries.Among the shares of big banks, Goldman Sachs dropped 4.1 per cent, Morgan Stanley fell 4.2 per cent, JPMorgan was lower by 6.6 per cent and Bank of America closed down 6.2 per cent.Shares in PNC Financial fell 5.3 per cent, while Northern Trust slipped 3.5 per cent.In contrast, regional banks, which do not rely on proprietary trading, held up and the S&P regional bank index rose 0.8 per cent.Shares in Fifth Third Bank gained 6.3 per cent, while KeyCorp rose 5.5 per cent, Suntrust Bank was 4.7 per cent higher, BB&T rallied 2 per cent and Comerica was up 6.7 per cent.“Most of the regionals don’t do prop trading and are being bought,” said Mr Conroy.The selling in financials follows a surge since last March, and after Thursday’s losses the S&P financials sector remains 140 per cent above last year’s nadir.The weakness in stocks boosted US government bonds, with yields falling, while the dollar surrendered early gains and was mixed in late New York trade."
108;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-12-30T22:36:16Z;Chicago lender avoids the rough;;An antique mid-iron golf club from Scotland sits in pride of place in the lounge next door to Rick Waddell’s office.The chairman and chief executive of Northern Trust is a keen golfer and the club is a gift from his wife. But it also brings to mind a more unhappy recent chapter in the history of the Chicago-based bank.In February, Northern Trust – a conservative institution unaccustomed to the media spotlight – unexpectedly became the focus of indignant outrage in Washington, when the bank went ahead with entertaining clients at a series of events around a professional golf tournament it sponsors at the Riviera Country Club in the Los Angeles suburbs.In normal circumstances, the client parties would have passed most people by. But a few months earlier, the bank had accepted $1.6bn from the US government’s troubled asset relief programme.The notion that a bank had received bail-out money and then thrown lavish parties sparked fury on Capitol Hill.Northern argued it was contractually obliged to sponsor the event, although other financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley and Wachovia removed their names from golf tournaments they funded.Mr Waddell now says the outrage unleashed on Capitol Hill “might have been a bit misplaced”.But he is scathing about the demand at the time by Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives’ financial services committee, that Northern hand back the Tarp funds. “He asked us to return the money immediately, but we weren’t allowed to under the rules, which some of his staff were not aware of,” he says.Northern Trust, which did not need bailing out, had been a reluctant Tarp participant in the first place. “The administration’s argument was: ‘It’s a healthy bank programme, Northern Trust is a healthy bank and we need you in it’,” Mr Waddell says. “It was very clear that if we didn’t participate, life was going to be very, very difficult.”He says the bank exited Tarp as soon as it could, repaying the funds in June along with a $133m return on the government’s money.This February, there will still be a Northern Trust Open, but client guests can expect a more sober event. There will be no live entertainment and clients will instead have more of an “on-course experience”. He adds: “We’ve had the experience of last year, but we’re also managing our expenses in a difficult year as a business.”Northern Trust, the US’s 10th biggest institutional money manager, was not among the banks that bore the brunt of the financial crisis. It was not involved in the subprime market, never securitised pools of mortgages and does not underwrite credit cards. But the bank has been affected by the wider economic downturn. For example, low interest rates, Mr Waddell says, are “probably the single largest revenue headwind” Northern is facing.In financial circles, the golfing brouhaha has done little to dent Northern’s solid reputation, either in the US or internationally. Mr Waddell says the bank is shortly to sign a deal to manage a Middle Eastern pension fund – adding to a portfolio that includes management of Australia’s Future Fund pension plan and China’s National Social Security Fund.Although he says some Wall Street business models will have to change as a result of the regulatory overhaul making its way through Congress, Mr Waddell defends the banking sector from the accusation that it is still not making enough credit available.“When we’re just coming out of recession, there’s just not a lot of very good demand in terms of credit quality, creditworthy borrowers,” he says. “I’m sure that at the margin there are some companies and people that can’t get credit, but they probably shouldn’t have credit. That was the problem in the first place. More bad loans are not going to solve the problem.”
109;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-12-30T22:36:16Z;Northern Trust says the party is over;;Northern Trust, the US bank that sparked outrage by throwing lavish parties at a professional golf tournament months after receiving government bail-out funds, plans to cut its entertainment budget drastically at the event next year.The move reflects how the chastened US banking sector is adjusting to life after the financial crisis, and widespread animosity towards Wall Street.The Chicago bank came under fire in February when it laid on a series of lavish soirees for guests at the Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles – featuring performances by musical guests such as Sheryl Crow and Earth, Wind and Fire – months after accepting $1.6bn from the US government’s troubled asset relief programme.John Kerry, the Democratic senator, said the parties were an “idiotic abuse of taxpayer’s money”, while Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives’ financial services committee, said the celebrations showed “extraordinary levels of irresponsibility and arrogance”.Rick Waddell, Northern Trust’s chairman and chief executive, admitted the scandal contributed to the general antipathy towards banks.“It was a part, along with all the other incidents,” he told the Financial Times.“There’s almost not one large institution that has been spared the focus of the media or Congress. In the financial system clearly there were excesses. There’s plenty of blame to go around.”Mr Waddell said the bank “clearly misjudged the political environment”. But he added: “The political environment in Washington was that they were looking for targets.”Northern Trust will continue to fulfil its sponsorship obligations next year, Mr Waddell said, but in a humbler manner. “We’re not having any live entertainment,” he said. “It’s going to be more of a traditional hospitality event.“We’ve pared our budget back. We’ve had the experience of last year, but we’re also managing our expenses in a difficult year as a business.”Mr Waddell weighed in to the debate over the UK government’s 50 per cent “super tax” on bank bonuses , warning it could prompt financial institutions to move staff from London.“We’ve already seen other countries reaching out – such as Switzerland – and saying: ‘Locate some of your employees with us’,” he said.“An unintended consequence could be that London loses its status as a financial centre.”Northern Trust repaid its Tarp money in June.

The S&P financials sub-index dropped 1.9 per cent.Analysts said the sudden turnround, after the S&P briefly breached 1,100, came as traders booked profits amid a generally upbeat earnings season. “It was buy on the rumour of good earnings and sell on the news,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia.Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest US bank by assets, closed down 5.1 per cent at $28.90 despite reporting record third-quarter profits. Analysts at Bernstein Research said the bank’s “near term credit trends continue to be challenging”.Morgan Stanley ended nine months of losses, with profits beating expectations in the third quarter. The investment bank’s shares gained 4.8 per cent to $34.08.“Morgan Stanley continues to work through its headwinds,” said Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, in a note. “We view this quarter’s rebound in institutional results as clear progress of franchise rebuilding.”US Bancorp also reported higher profits in the quarter, and its shares bounced up 2.7 per cent to $24.43.Marc Pado, US market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco, said: “Now we’re seeing a number of companies do better than nervous expectations.”At Northern Trust, however, profits trailed expectations, sending shares down 5.7 per cent to $54.16.SLM, the US student-loan company known as Sallie Mae, shot 20.7 per cent higher to $10.74 after announcing that earnings would rise in 2010, thanks to lower loan-loss provisions and stabilising credit markets.Energy stocks were relatively sturdy as oil hit a 2009 high above $80 a barrel due to a weaker dollar and declining US petrol stockpiles. Chevron fell 0.1 per cent to $76.97, while ExxonMobil climbed 0.4 per cent to $73.31.Nabors Industries, an oil and gas rig contractor, rose 2.9 per cent to $23.06 after reporting demand for North American onshore rigs was poised for a rebound.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 per cent to close at 2,150.73.Yahoo climbed 2.9 per cent to $17.66 after reporting quarterly earnings. Profit had more than tripled as cost cuts and asset sales offset a decline in sales. The internet company’s net income was $187.8m, or 13 cents a share, up from $54.3m, or 4 cents per share, the same time last year, and higher than expectations.Yahoo “will participate in [an] advertising recovery that is already showing real traction on the internet,” Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney said in a note.Apple shares shot to a new all-time high of $204.92, up 3.1 per cent, after turning record profits earlier this week. .The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 0.9 per cent at 9,949.36.Dow member Boeingwas down 2.4 per cent to $50.63 after reporting a net loss of $1.5bn in the most recent quarter.The aeroplane maker was hurt as development costs from its 787 and 747 aircraft programmes more than offset revenue growth at its commercial aeroplanes and defence systems divisions.Allegheny Technologies, a speciality metals producer that supplies titanium to Boeing, fell 8.4 per cent to $34.81 after third-quarter income and sales missed estimates.While earnings news was mostly buoyant, the Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book report was lukewarm on economic conditions, noting improvements are “either small or scattered”.Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St Louis, said: “We have been through the ‘less bad is good’ scenario and now we need to start seeing ‘good’.” The market maintains a positive bias, he said, and “any sort of pullback would be very modest at this point”.Meanwhile, the Vix volatility index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, gained late in the session after hitting its lowest level since the summer of 2008.

113;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-06-10T00:39:22Z;Ten US banks to repay Tarp funds;;"Ten financial groups including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were on Tuesday allowed to repay a combined $68bn to the US Treasury in a move that marks a turning point in the economic crisis but formalises the divide between healthy and fragile banks.The companies, which also include Morgan Stanley and American Express, can now shed the restrictions on pay and hiring that came with the troubled asset relief programme launched last year at the height of the turmoil in global markets.However, the move raises questions over the competitiveness of other big banks such as Citigroup and Bank of America, which have not yet been allowed to repay the combined $90bn in Tarp money they have received.The first batch of Tarp repayers includes eight banks that last month were found not to need additional capital after government stress tests. Others allowed to return the funds included Morgan Stanley, which was instructed to raise capital, and Northern Trust, a bank catering to wealthy individuals that was not among the 19 institutions subjected to stress tests.The repayment by the 10 institutions, which stepped up their campaign to be free of Tarp after Congress introduced constraints on bankers’ pay, is a sign of stability in the financial system. The S&P Financials index has more than doubled since March.President Barack Obama
said: “The financial crisis this administration inherited is still creating painful challenges for businesses and families alike. But it is a positive sign.”The amount due to be repaid far outstrips a previous “conservative” estimate from the Treasury that $25bn would be repaid this year. The authorities have said they could use the repaid funds to help other institutions such as smaller lenders.The government still owns warrants giving it the right to buy shares in the banks that received Tarp funds in October last year. The Treasury said banks would be allowed to buy back the warrants at “fair market value”, but the issue is controversial because the securities are difficult to value and banks are anxious not to overpay.Although the banks set to leave Tarp will escape the most strict rules on compensation, Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, told Congress that planned reforms – set to be announced in the next few days – would affect all institutions.“We need to help encourage substantial reforms in compensation reforms,” Mr Geithner said. “I think boards of directors did not do a good job [before the crisis]. I think shareholders did not do a good job.”The congressional oversight panel, set up to monitor Tarp spending, on Tuesday recommended a new round of stress tests on the banks because of worsening economic data, such as rising unemployment.The Treasury declined to identify the banks, but people familiar with the list said they were Goldman, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Amex, Northern Trust, BB&T, State Street, US Bancorp, Capital One Financial and Bank of New York Mellon.Additional reporting by Alan Rappeport"

115;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-06-01T14:51:54Z;Jain steps down at Kellogg;;Dipak Jain is to step down as dean of the Kellogg school at Northwestern University after eight years in the job. Prof Jain, a prolific marketing scholar, will quit the dean’s job in September and return to teaching after a year’s leave of absence.An interim dean will be appointed in the next few months while the search for a full-time replacement is conducted.Prof Jain says his decision is not related in any way to the current crisis facing the world of business schools, but because he wanted to spend more time with his family and to move back into teaching. Also, Northwestern University is getting a new president in September.“I have always believed that eight to 10 years is long long enough to do the job,” he says. “Now is the right time to step down. I have done my job. I hope I have done a good job.”Prof Jain moved to Kellogg in 1986 as an assistant professor and quickly rose to be the right-hand man of former dean, Don Jacobs. He was senior associate dean for five years before his appointment to the dean’s job in 1994. Prof Jain says that one of his achievements has been the alter the culture of the school, changing it from an individual-driven school, as it was when Prof Jacobs was dean, to an institution-driven school, with multiple associate deans and devolved responsibilities.At 51 years of age, Prof Jain is still one of the younger US business school deans and is widely connected in industry. He has served as a consultant to Microsoft, Novartis, American Express, Sony, Nissan, Motorola, Eli Lilly, Phillips and Hyatt International and is a board member of Hartmarx Corporation, Deere & Company and Northern Trust Corporation in the US and Reliance Industries in India. He says he will use the coming year to be more involved with the Indian School of Business, in Hyderabad, which he was instrumental in establishing.www.kellogg.northwestern.edu
116;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-05-18T17:47:26Z;State Street begins stock sale;;"State Street has begun selling $1.5bn in stock and will sell at least $500m in senior debt as part of the financial services group’s plan to repay money received under the US’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).It is the latest in the big round of capital-raising by financial institutions following the
Treasury-administered “stress tests”.Some are hoping repay to Tarp money and others are raising capital because they have been told they need to.State Street, which was one of 19 financial institutions to receive money under the Tarp, is among those that were told it did not need more capital. State Street had the ability to weather “more adverse economic conditions”, the Treasury said.However, Tarp repayment conditions require that the institution shows it is able to raise capital independently.Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust are among others that have raised capital in hope of gaining approval to begin paying back their Tarp money.Bank of America, one of those that needed to raise capital, is believed to have raised $3bn to $4bn over the past 10 days by selling more than 250m new shares through an ATM, or “at the market” operation, according to a report issued on Sunday by Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup analyst. Goldman Sachs upgraded BofA to “buy” on Monday, estimating that its capital raising was 50 per cent complete.State Street also said on Monday it had taken a loss of $3.7bn after marking down the value of assets held in investment vehicles called conduits. State Street would take the conduits, which were held off its balance sheet and are now valued at $16.6bn, on to its balance sheet, the company said. Under the Basel II banking accord, that move would have been necessary by January next year.State Street is the world’s third-biggest custody bank and the world’s largest asset manager. Custody banks hold stocks and bonds in safekeeping and arrange settlements.It said that as a result of its conduit writedown, it estimated that operating earnings for the current year would be between $4.25 and $4.50 a share – higher than expected, after a one-time writedown to be taken in the second quarter.The news pushed State Street shares 8 per cent higher to $41 by noon in New York on Monday. The shares have halved in value over the past year."

118;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;US custody banks hit by profits slump;;The fall in global markets during the past year has hit first-quarter profits at three large US custody banks and at BlackRock, the largest publicly traded fund manager.Custody banks hold stocks and bonds in safekeeping, and are responsible for settlement when they change hands.State Street, a custody bank but also the world’s largest asset manager after overtaking Barclays Global Investors following the sale of BGI’s iShares unit, saw profit fall 9 per cent to $476m.Assets under management fell 29 per cent to $2,000bn, while assets under custody fell 24 per cent to $11,300bn.Ron Logue, chief executive, warned that profits were likely to be down by at least 12 per cent in the coming year, indicating the worst was not over.Bank of New York Mellon cut its dividend to 9 cents a share, from 24 cents, saying that this would save $700m a year and help the bank quickly repay the $3bn it received under the government’s troubled asset relief programme (Tarp).BNY Mellon, which also has a large asset management division, said its profits fell 57 per cent to $322m.Rob Kelly, chief executive, said that “it feels like we’re at, or close to, the bottom” of the economic cycle, although he said loan losses could continue for some time.Northern Trust’s profits fell 58 per cent to $162m after its assets under management declined by 33 per cent – to $522bn – and assets under custody dropped by 29 per cent to $2,800bn.However, in the 2008 quarter it received $244m in proceeds from the initial public offering of Visa. Excluding that, its quarterly profit drop was 30 per cent. Northern Trust reiterated that it too wants to return its $1.6bn in Tarp money.Asset management firms almost never make a loss, because their revenue is derived from a fee on the money they manage. The 40 per cent drop in the Standard & Poor’s index compared with the same quarter last year has caused management fees to plunge.BlackRock’s profits fell 65 per cent to $84m. The drop was partly because of a loss of $153m from its co-investments and seed investments in its own funds.BlackRock attracted $138bn in new money in the 12 months to the end of March but its assets under management fell 6 per cent to $1,280bn, as a result of market falls. The drop was still much lower than other asset managers.
119;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-04-07T18:59:31Z;Investment losses hit public sector pensions;;The crisis facing pension plans for US state and municipal employees is deepening as investment losses deplete the resources of retirement funds for teachers, police officers, firefighters and other local government workers.The largest state and municipal pension plans lost 9 per cent of their value in the first two months of this year, according to data from Northern Trust. That followed a loss of 26 per cent in 2008. Smaller funds, which underperform the larger ones, lost more, experts say.The pension funds, which number 2,600 in total, hold more than $2,000bn after losses last year of close to $1,000bn.The losses have left retirement plans about 50 per cent funded – that is, they have only half the money needed to cover commitments to 22m current and former workers, experts say. State governments typically put the funding figures closer to 60-70 per cent, although most experts use different calculations.“There is a massive national underfunding problem,” said Orin Kramer, chairman of the New Jersey pension fund. ”Unlike company pension plans, state and municipal retirement funds have no federal guarantee fund. This has led to predictions of benefit cuts and possible federal intervention.“The federal government will get involved, without question,” said Phillip Silitschanu, analyst at Aite Group, a consultancy. “They could provide federal loans, or demand cutbacks as a condition of stimulus money, or there could be a federalisation of some of these pensions.”Without investment income, funds are liquidating assets at huge losses to pay pensions.Police pensions are in especially poor shape, in part because states have promised earlier retirement on full pensions, but seldom increased contributions.
120;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-04-05T08:03:04Z;Flight to safety hits planning;;The growing fashion for securities services contingency planning is a stark reflection of the times. Large financial institutions can and do go out of business, either by collapsing, or by making a strategic switch. Investors and fund managers must, therefore, plan accordingly, and take the measures that will ensure they have back-up provision in place should their existing provider(s) no longer be available.The flight to quality and safety has yet to impact the market fully, say several senior securities services providers, predicting a significant reshaping of the landscape. In that reshaping, financial solidity and embedded brand value will count greatly.“We don’t currently have concerns about our custodians, Fortis and Citi, but we take comfort from big names, which Citi still is,” says Tracy Wiltcher, director of Nedgroup Investments. “The most important considerations for us would be the name, the ability of the custodian’s systems to interact with ours, the service levels, and the fees.”The financial soundness of custodians is very much in vogue, comments Biff Bowman, Emea regional executive at Northern Trust, which had to face up to its own specific challenges in the period following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. “It is very important to clients, and they are assessing financial strength very rigorously, asking questions whose answers had come to be taken for granted,” he says.John Donohue, chief executive officer of Carne Group, advisers to the asset management industry, agrees that, for a custodian, financial strength is key. “A lot of hedge funds have cash balances which will be swept into a vehicle often run by a custodian. As the emphasis on counterparty risk intensifies, they need to be sure their assets are as safe as possible. And if the custodian makes a mistake, can they compensate you?”He also identifies the quality, safety and stability of sub-custody networks as essential factors to be taken into consideration, but there are many more criteria listed by him and other service providers for fund managers to mull over. Who will value your business and do a good job for you? What revenue will they generate? Will they help with new product development? How automated are they? Will they dedicate the resources needed to make sure the job is done properly?Rajen Shah, head of global custody at JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services, adds reputation, track record and a willingness to continue to invest in securities services as a product as essential areas to focus on when considering a new appointment or reconsidering an existing relationship.Jacques-Philippe Marson, chief executive officer of BNP Paribas Securities Services, says contingency planning is not a new phenomenon, but is something a number of large institutions have turned their attention to in recent years. The distinguishing feature today is the air of panic that surrounds the process.“Over the past six months, instead of the standard requests for proposal that would-be clients issue to ensure they strike the best deal, we are being asked to open accounts immediately,” says Mr Marson.“We are seeing one-way traffic in, averaging four or five new clients a week defecting from weaker players who do not provide the full range of services that clients need today. Institutions that have had historical relationships with very large names have decided to forget the long-standing relationships and leave quickly to find safety elsewhere.”Independence and experience are vital too, adds Gavin Gray, managing director of Dublin-based investment fund administrator Phoenix Fund Services. And clients who might be thinking about changing custodian, or putting contingency arrangements in place, cannot rely on the old certainties.“What has changed is that the probability of having to move to a back-up plan has significantly increased, and people are going further in the development of contingency relationships than they might have in the past,” says Mr Gray.This involves opening an account and moving some assets to test the potential new custodial arrangements for efficacy and efficiency. Changing a custodian, however, is a complex and demanding process that requires clients to do much more due diligence for themselves than they might be accustomed to, he adds. “Can you trust ratings given what we have seen in recent times? You need to dig behind the ratings.”
121;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-03-26T00:09:38Z;BofA plans swift payback of Tarp funds;;Bank of America has added its name to the growing list of major US banks that are seeking to pay back as soon as possible the funds borrowed under the government’s bank recapitalisation scheme.Ken Lewis, BofA chief executive, said in an interview published on Wednesday that he hoped to start paying back $45bn in taxpayer funds in late April, after the results from the Treasury Department’s first round of “stress tests” are issued. The tests are designed to separate strong banks from the weak.If the capital markets continued to improve, he added, BofA wanted to repay the entire $45bn by the end of 2009.Mr Lewis’ pledge, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, to pay back the money from the troubled asset relief programme as soon as possible came on the same day as Goldman Sachs confirmed that it planned to pay its entire $10bn Tarp stake back, possibly by the end of April, following the disclosure of “stress test” results.While the major US Tarp recipients have said they plan to pay back the funds as soon as possible, populist outrage in Washington against bankers – which manifested itself last week in a proposal to tax bonuses of Tarp recipients at 90 per cent – seems to have crystallised the notion among US bankers that the sooner they divest themselves of government funding the better.Northern Trust, a custody bank specialising in asset management for institutions and wealthy private clients, has also pledged to pay back its Tarp money as soon as possible. The bank attracted public ridicule last month for its sponsorship of a golf tournament in southern California, the Northern Trust Open, which featured VIP treatment of its guests.“Right now, there’s going to be a race to see who can pay back Tarp fastest,” said Carole Browner of Luna Analytics. “There are too many stipulations on what banks can and can’t do if they have received Tarp money”.But whether banks such as BofA can afford to pay their Tarp money back is another matter, says Richard Staite of Atlantic Equities. “It’s clear that regulators in the US and globally want banks to significantly strengthen their capital ratios at this point, and paying back Tarp at the end of April would be contrary to efforts to stabilise the financial system”, he says.Given that BofA is still trying to digest two major acquisitions that saddled the group with bad assets – Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch – Mr Staite doesn’t think BofA should be in any rush to get out of the Tarp programme.Separately, Moody’s Investors Service cut the credit ratings of Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Wednesday, including slashing ratings on their preferred stock to junk, citing concerns the banks’ capital ratios would remain under pressure, increasing the likelihood that further government support would be needed.BofA’s pledge to pay back Tarp funds comes as a group of US and European pension funds sought to consolidate 11 shareholder lawsuits into one class action against BofA for not warning investors about the depths of Merrill Lynch’s problems prior to the December 5 shareholder vote.
122;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-03-03T22:59:18Z;Lawmakers criticise Northern Trust revels;;Northern Trust, a low-key and profitable US bank that makes money mostly from providing private banking services for rich people, signed a five-year PGA golf sponsorship in 2007, hoping to get its name more widely recognised and to provide a salubrious environment in which to woo clients.Its name recognition has certainly improved, but probably not in the way it hoped.After news broke that its clients were enjoying dinners and live performances by the likes of Sheryl Crow and Earth, Wind and Fire at the club where the Northern Trust Open golf tournament was held, the bank last week found itself swept up in an unaccustomed firestorm of bad publicity.The problem? It had taken $1.6bn from the US government’s Toxic Asset Relief Program (Tarp).Legislators are up in arms over Northern Trust’s spending on client entertainment, as are several media columnists.Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat, and 17 other congressmen demanded that Northern Trust return the money. Senator John Kerry proposed legislation that would bar firms that get government aid from hosting certain types of events.The incident highlights the challenges faced by companies trying to carry out upscale marketing during a recession. It also raises the question of how much the federal government should micro-manage the banks it has given money to.Northern Trust held three seminars, with entertainment, for institutional clients and financial planners at the February event at the Riviera Country Club.Its clients include 80 from Forbes’ list of the 400 richest people in the US, and the financial planners were mostly specialists in advising the very wealthy.One person familiar with the situation said that Northern Trust had considered cancelling its entertainment, but the performances were booked months before, and cancelling would not have saved any money.Northern Trust’s total marketing budget last year was $77m, which is somewhat lower than comparably sized banks. It does not advertise heavily but focuses its marketing on a small number of sponsored events.The person said: “Three days after the Northern Trust Open, Earth, Wind and Fire performed at the White House for the Governors’ Dinner.“How is it that the federal government, which has a huge deficit, can have Earth, Wind and Fire play, and a bank which makes a profit cannot have them play as part of their marketing spend?”However, Marian Salzman, chief marketing officer at Porter Novelli, a public relations and marketing firm, said: “This event highlights the broad discrepancy between the old normal and the new normal.“There will not be business as usual in wealth management. There will be less marketing. Luxury marketing in the traditional sense will be dead.“There will be no wining and dining, no golf sponsorship, no theatre or arts sponsoring. You can’t do those things as a marketer now, and you can’t give clients the budget version either, because that is not acceptable to them.”Chicago-based Northern Trust, which took the government money under a certain amount of pressure from the Treasury, said at the weekend it would return it. Several other small banks are returning Tarp money.Even larger banks, such as Bank of America, as the Financial Times reported this week, have expressed regret that they used so much of the facility.Rick Waddell, Northern Trust’s chief executive, said in a letter to legislators that the bank did not use government money for operating expenses.Other banks are backing away from the golf course.Since the furore over Northern Trust, Morgan Stanley has said it would cancel events it had planned around its sponsored golf tournament in June.Wells Fargo said last week it would remove the name of Wachovia – which it bought in December – from Wachovia’s sponsored golf tournament in April, and cancel any planned entertainment around the events.
123;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Banks repaying Tarp money;;"Form an orderly queue. After waiting in line to receive funds from the Treasury, US banks are now offering to pay it back. Northern Trust, TCF Financial and Iberiabank have all declared their wish to return taxpayer funds. Others have made quiet inquiries. Political sabre-rattling and presumed right of public veto over spending decisions means being in hock to the government is more trouble than it is worth.Under the original Tarp, banks had to raise private equity capital to replace official funds. A provision in this year’s stimulus act changed that. Shaking off the government yoke entirely is impossible: all banks rely on certain federal support, including deposit insurance, in good times and bad. But banks argue that generally available assistance sold as helping healthy banks to boost lending is now branded as “bail-out” – putting them at a disadvantage in the public’s eyes.Hysteria surrounding, say, the cost of sports sponsorships, adds to their discomfort. Bank of America – which would also like to reduce its government bill – has pre-emptively cancelled jollies in sunny locations. (Not that colder climes are safer. TCF was lambasted over a ski trip.)The return of taxpayer money is welcome, all things being equal. It is quite right that banks’ conduct be properly monitored while they are reliant on the public purse. But it will be counterproductive if crude or populist oversight and fear of micro-management by Washington prompt banks to repay prematurely. Leaching capital from the banking system helps no one.Meanwhile, banks that raise private capital to redeem Treasury stock are likely to incur higher overall funding costs. That, at the margin, runs counter to the incessant demands that the banks lend more freely. Politicians playing to the crowd should tread carefully. Travel agents, hoteliers, entertainers and conference organisers would doubtless also prefer that they give it a rest.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

125;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2009-01-21T21:43:30Z;Banking stocks lead Wall Street recovery;;Banking stocks led a strong recovery on Wall Street on Wednesday after a raft of earnings, some not as dire as feared, attracted bargain hunters back to the battered sector.Financial institutions that have endured epic falls in recent sessions made a comeback during the market’s best performance in more than a month, which recovered much of the heavy inauguration-day losses.Custodian banks did well after coming under particularly heavy selling pressure in the previous session in the wake of bleak earnings and unrealised losses from State Street. The sector received a boost from better-than-expected fourth-quarter from Northern Trust, which leapt 30.9 per cent to $57.51.“To think all the banks are in the same abyss…that’s not necessarily the case,” said Christopher Colarik, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment. “But whether this is a bounce that’s going to have legs in really the question.”State Street, whose shares more than halved in the previous session, recovered 14.6 per cent to $17.07.PNC Financial Services jumped 37.1 per cent to $30.16 as investors were relieved that it was not seeking yet more capital.Even US Bancorp, whose 65 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profit was even worse than expected, found positive territory.The shares closed up 4.9 per cent to $16.09 even though the figures prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade its view to ‘sell’ and warned the group would need to cut its dividend.Financials, up 14.6 per cent overall, dominated the leaderboard. Citigroup, which sank 40 per cent last week and 20 per cent in the previous session, bounced 31.1 per cent to $3.67. JPMorgan climbed 25.1 per cent to $22.63 and Bank of America31 per cent to $6.68.Trading in the wider market was volatile and the benchmark S&P 500 index briefly entered negative territory during the morning.But the S&P 500 closed up 4.4 per cent at 840.25 after a strong rally into the close. That was back above a nadir reached last month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 3.5 per cent higher at 8,228.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index was 4.6 per cent stronger at 1,507.07.Still, some observers questioned the view that the new administration would help the equity market maintain momentum.Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management, wrote in a report: “While high expectations have, historically, mostly been associated with poor equity performance in the post-election year, low expectations [for example, for Clinton and the two Bush presidencies] have mostly been associated with good performance.”Technology was the best-performing sector outside financials, up 5.4 per cent overall on unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter results from IBM. The stock advanced 11.5 per cent to $91.42, helped by a full-year outlook that topped expectations.Other earnings were due for release after the market closed, including Apple, up 5.9 per cent to $82.83.Meanwhile, the energy sector received a boost as oil prices rallied.Retailers and homebuilders came under pressure throughout the day, but although the two sectors underperformed the market, they nevertheless finished higher overall in the broad based rally.Homebuilders ended 2.1 per cent stronger in spite of more gloomy data for the sector. A preliminary reading of the National Association of Home Builders’s index, which measures industry sentiment, fell in January to the lowest level since the gauge was created 24 years ago.Bucking the upward trend in retail, Coach lost 7.3 per cent to $14.72 after the handbag maker disclosed a fall in second-quarter profit.Wal-Mart fell 2.8 percent to $49.14 after Credit Suisse cut its view of the world’s largest retailer from “outperform” to “neutral”.“Even Wal-Mart is not immune to the economic slowdown,” wrote Michael Exstein, analyst. “The incremental benefit it realized from consumer trade down in 2008 might not repeat itself in 2009.”Airlines also ignored the positive momentum as the volatile oil price hurt earnings.AMR and UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, both disclosed a fourth quarter loss and the shares dropped 23.7 per cent to $7.98 and 6.1 per cent to $10.91, respectively.
126;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-12-21T18:02:28Z;Managers prepare for rough ride in year ahead;;The asset management industry took a beating this year amid the fallout from the credit crunch. Nervous investors ran for cover from volatile markets leaving fund managers facing floods of redemptions, declining assets under management and shrinking share prices. (PDF)Many asset managers expect the year ahead to be a struggle to survive in an ongoing bear market and a deepening recession.“The fund management industry has quite a few firms that haven’t seen anything like this in their history. I think this year is going to be a year of survival for many of the mid and smaller size firms,” says Steve Potter, president of Northern Trust Global Investments.He also believes there will be fewer larger institutional players as banks continue to merge and sell off their asset management arms to focus on core business and raise capital. The shape of the asset management landscape is already changing. BNP Paribas recently took over Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial group, and this month saw a management buy-out of Lehman Brothers’ investment management operations, including Neuberger Berman.Consolidators will be those with the firepower to make acquisitions. Northern Trust will be one of these, although not in the next six months, says Mr Potter. Several houses, including Neptune Asset Management, have been circling around New Star, one of the most recent casualties, which fell into the hands of its banks this month after agreeing a debt for equity swap.State Street, which has taken $2bn (£1.3bn, €1.4bn) of public money as part of the US Treasury’s recapitalisation of the nation’s battered banking system, is also ready to snap up operations of European rivals weakened by the credit crunch.Further tough times ahead call for fresh thinking from asset managers and investors. The current bear market has shown some investment approaches have not worked as well as expected.In a recent roundtable of fund managers looking back on the past year, the consensus was that diversification had not delivered the promised returns in 2008 but the strategy was not dead.Before the credit crunch, investors were encouraged to diversify from traditional investments in favour of alternative assets including commodities, hedge funds and real estate, but many got their fingers burned as returns plunged.“Diversification has not worked but it is not as bad as the alternative, which is focusing on equities. In future investors will have to make sure it is the right sort of diversification,” says Andrew Dyson, managing director and head of institutional business for Europe, Middle East and Africa at BlackRock.A move to diversify from domestic holdings in portfolios to a wider international approach may be of benefit in the coming year, says Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors.The bear market has also shown a number of complex products, including some hedge funds, have performed badly, driving risk-averse investors towards simpler more transparent products. The key question many investors are asking is “will I get my money back?”.Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, agrees investors will put simplicity and transparency at the top of the check-list in the year ahead. “Simplicity is the new smart. It is not only simplicity in products but also in an organisational sense, through using a straightforward business model,” she says.“So much of our industry has been focused on business as usual but it is necessary to make new checks such as exposure to counterparty risk, banking covenants, reading the small print and asking the right questions.” A more lateral approach to thinking about risk is called for, she adds.Concern about lack of transparency, counterparty risk, liquidity and the use of derivatives and structured products has triggered growing investor interest in exchange traded funds.In the first 11 months of the year average global daily ETF trading volumes hit $117bn, a rise of 94 per cent from the same period in 2007, according to Barclays Global Investors. BGI expects assets under management will exceed $1,000bn in 2009, up from $633bn now.Fund fees are also expected to come under further pressure next year as investors measure performance against charges and negotiate reductions. Annual management fees have risen steadily from 1.3 per cent in 1994 to 1.6 per cent now for European cross-border equity funds, says Ed Moisson, director of fiduciary operations at Lipper.Paul Trickett, head of European investment consulting at Watson Wyatt, says hedge fund fees could fall as much as 20 per cent, while traditional asset management fees could drop between 10 and 20 per cent.Another issue for the industry will be to show adequate risk management procedures are in place, particularly following the alleged $50bn fraud by financier Bernard Madoff that took in money from some of the biggest names in the industry.The fallout is expected to erode investor trust in the asset management community, as well as among hedge fund managers. However, mutual funds could potentially benefit from a perception they are relatively immune from fraud. Given the financial climate and such a breakdown of trust, investors are likely to head for asset managers they perceive will be best at managing risk in all its forms.Covenant risk will also come under greater scrutiny by pension fund trustees as pension assets plunge and deficits rise. The collapse of Lehman Brothers did much to shatter the notion of a safe sponsoring employer. “Trustees must get employers to come to the table to discuss deficit funding in the year ahead and discuss what the liability risk is,” says Richard Owen, head of business development for UK and Ireland at State Street Global Advisors. Despite the gloomy outlook asset managers have survived earlier downturns. “The industry tends to act like an accordion at times and new firms will be cropping up,” says Northern Trust’s Mr Potter. But that may not happen just yet.Additional reporting by Steve Johnson
127;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-12-15T13:31:53Z;Northern Trust cuts 4% of staff;;Northern Trust, the Chicago-based bank, said on Monday that it would cut 450 jobs, or 4 per cent of its workforce, to reduce costs and improve efficiency amid worsening economic conditions.The layoffs will begin in January and Northern Trust expects to take a charge of $20m to $25m to cover severance and benefits costs related to the cuts. The move is expected to generate between $50m and $60m in savings.“Our decisions, while difficult, will further enhance Northern Trust’s position amid challenging conditions,” Rick Waddell, Northern Trust’s chief executive, said in a statement.The bank said that it would use attrition where possible to reduce its workforce and that client services would not be affected.Northern Trust is a 119-year-old institution known for having some of the richest clients in the US. Its businesses include a private bank, an asset management arm and a custody business. In the decade before 2008 its earnings and assets grew at 20 per cent a year.In October the group announced its first quarterly loss in 21 years. It is now defending itself against investors’ complaints and lawsuits in the fallout from the financial crisis.At the end of October Northern Trust became the 14th US bank to receive a direct investment from the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Programme, accepting a $1.5 bn infusion.“We recognise that what the Treasury and Fed are trying to do is create more confidence in the banking system through working with healthy banks, and Northern is very well capitalised,” Mr Waddell told the FT in a video interview last week.Mr Waddell said he would likely forgo his bonus this year, noting that it would be very difficult to accept in this environment.

129;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-12-14T19:22:13Z;US bank chiefs pressured to waive bonuses;;Top bank executives are facing growing pressure to forgo bonuses this year after dismal earnings and infusions of capital from the US Treasury have made such payments increasingly controversial.The majority of banks that have accepted government money under the Treasury’s capital purchase programme will decide in the coming weeks on executive bonuses for 2008. But many executives admit that bonuses would be regarded as inappropriate at banks that have suffered losses, particularly if they have also accepted government capital infusions.Rick Waddell, chief executive of Northern Trust, said: “I have to say, it will be very difficult for me to accept a bonus in this environment,” although he added the year was not yet over and the final quarter still had to be taken into consideration.Northern Trust, which recently reported its first quarterly loss in 21 years, applied for and received a preferred stock capital infusion from the US Treasury although the bank is well capitalised.Mr Waddell said: “Compensation is an area that needs to be looked at in the light of the government money.”Executives at several large banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, have said they will give up their bonuses amid calls for highly paid executives to share the pain of the financial crisis.At Citigroup, executives and Robert Rubin, a director and senior adviser, have told the board they are ready to give up their bonuses.Executives at other banks are under pressure to follow suit. The biggest name still to announce whether he would receive a year-end payment is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, which has outperformed most rivals and clinched two acquisitions since the beginning of the crisis.In a television interview last week, Mr Dimon said he had informed the board of his intentions but declined to spell them out. He said he trusted the company’s directors “to do the right thing” – an apparent suggestion he is unlikely to receive a bonus.Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank that has fared better than most during the turmoil and bought its regional rival, Wachovia, this year, is also yet to reveal whether John Stumpf, chief executive, and Dick Kovacevich, chairman, will get a bonus this year.Several banks said compensation would continue to be determined in light of business performance and would be unrelated to government funding. But for most bank executives, poor 2008 performance will nevertheless preclude any bonus.Jeri Grier, of Huntington Bancshares in Ohio, said chief executive Tom Hoaglin did not expect to receive a bonus in 2008. She said this was based on the bank’s performance rather than because the bank accepted government money, but acknowledged the decision would be “appropriate and consistent with expectations around Tarp funding”.Close to 90 financial institutions have been granted government capital under the $250bn capital purchase programme announced in October. Hank Paulson, the Treasury secretary, said at the time that institutions receiving the capital infusions would need to abide by certain restrictions on executive compensation.
130;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-10-26T22:32:40Z;US public pension funds face big losses;;Public pension funds in US states are facing their worst year of losses in history, exacerbating existing funding shortfalls and putting pressure on state governments to shore them up.In the nine months to the end of September, the average state pension fund lost 14.8 per cent, according to Northern Trust, a fund company. The loss has grown since, as financial markets slumped further in October. The previous highest loss for state funds was 7.9 per cent for the full year in 2002.California’s Calpers, the US’s biggest pension fund, last week reported a loss of 20 per cent of its assets, or more than $40bn, between July 1 and October 20 this year.State and local pension funds comprise a patchwork of 2,700 funds that manage $1,400bn on behalf of 21m employees, including teachers, firefighters and other municipal workers.About 40 per cent are underfunded, meaning that they would not be able to pay the future pensions that employees have been promised. State governments have lifted pension benefits – a move that is politically popular – but have often failed to put in more money to pay for them.Richard Daley, mayor of Chicago, this year convened a taskforce to address the shortfalls in Illinois funds. For example, funding for the Police Fund has fallen to less than 50 per cent.A Chicago police officer told the Financial Times: “We are risking our lives here every day, but we have no idea if the pension we have been guaranteed will be there when we retire.” The officer called on the city to start contributing more to the fund.Susan Uhran, managing director of the Pew Center on the states, said: “They [the states] will have to increase their annual contributions, and they may also ask employees to lift their contributions too.”“This is going to be a vicious cycle of pressure on pension funds,” said Greg Pai, managing director of Paradigm, a money manager. “They have previously looked to state and corporate subsidies, but . . . [state governments] have lower tax revenue and are under pressure to cut costs.”Many states face their own budget crunches, and members of Congress are pushing for a second fiscal stimulus package, in part to alleviate some of the pressures on state funding. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, cited money lost from pension funds in her push this month for the $150bn second stimulus.But the funds themselves have limited options, said Mr Pai. Many are under pressure to move away from shares into less risky investments, but that would mean reducing returns.Critics say the underfunding is worse than official data show. The calculation is based on an assumption of annual returns of 8 per cent, but few funds will reach that in the next few years.
131;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-10-05T09:16:24Z;Cross-border vehicles not going anywhere fast;;All talk, no action. That might best describe the progress of the pan-European pension scheme.After Unilever very publicly seeded its fully tax transparent cross-border pensions vehicle with €2.3bn (£1.8bn, $3.2bn) at the beginning of 2006, the hope was many other multinationals would follow suit.Some did – albeit a little more discreetly. Both IBM and Nestlé brought Dublin-based schemes to market shortly after Unilever housed its vehicle in Luxembourg, but the floodgates did not open.Indeed, according to the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (Ceiops), there were fewer than 50 cross-border schemes, based in just five European countries, as of the end of January 2007.Of these, only one, domiciled in Luxembourg, could be hailed a truly pan-European scheme. Most were functional in only their home country plus one other host nation.For providers, such slow progress has been an irritation. Bringing Unilever’s pension asset-pooling vehicle to market owed much to the hard work of three parties: Goldman Sachs, Mercer Investment Consulting and Northern Trust.At some point these parties – as well as others – will want that hard work to bear fruit.But setting up a cross-border fund takes time.Philip Lambert, Unilever’s former head of corporate pensions, said at the time of the Luxembourg launch: “It’s taken nearly four years to get this vehicle up and running.“First there were the long discussions with our advisers – Northern Trust, Goldman Sachs and Mercer – about the pros and cons of the vehicle, and then there was the question of where the fund should be based.”Watson Wyatt’s Mark Dawsey puts it in simple terms. “Cross-border pensions simply haven’t been the money-spinner many in the industry thought they would be.“But that’s not to say they won’t. It’s just full integration is not cheap and to set up an all-singing, all-dancing pan European pension scheme requires deep pockets.”And right now, he adds, “it would take a very brave organisation – given the current economic climate – to push ahead with this.”Tony Osborn-Barker, BNP Paribas’ global head of pensions, agrees. But he does not believe the market downturn is the problem.“The current climate is irrelevant,” he says. “You need to be a large multinational with a centralised attitude to management to make a truly cross border scheme work for you and that probably means you’ll have a significant amount of your business in the US, not only Europe.“But that’s the sticking point – currently a US and a European-wide scheme just don’t go easily together.”But the benefits of a fully tax transparent European cross-border scheme have been well documented.Firms stand to profit from gains in efficiency, economies of scale, improved access to specialised managers, more consistent asset allocation, optimised risk management, and a reduction in transaction, custody, administration and investment management costs – cost-savings that are said to equate to as much as 20 basis points.But with the price of attaining such savings proving insurmountable, the solution might be part rather than full integration.“A fully integrated pan-European fund does not have to be the answer,” says Mr Dawsey at Watson Wyatt.“Smaller steps can be taken, such as the implementation of a single governance or accounting structure or the pooling of assets and risks. “These are all valid moves towards the nirvana of a pan-European fund,” he says.Barry Mack who heads up Mercer’s Task Force on Pan-European pensions agrees. “Even in the face of such uncertainty, multinationals can begin to separate the possible from the impossible, ignoring clear non-starters and leaving more complex solutions for later.”He points to the virtual pooling of assets, the centralisation and standardisation of administration, and effective use of intranet sites as starting points.But that is not to say both Mr Mack and Mr Dawsey believe a truly pan-European scheme is unattainable – far from it. “In the next 10 years cross border pensions are something every multinational sponsor will look at,” says Mr Dawsey.“The dam is cracking,” agrees Mr Mack.
132;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Change from equities to alternatives in search of shelter;;Recent turmoil in world financial markets appears to be prompting US pension funds to accelerate a move away from equities and into alternative investments.The main question on the minds of those running funds is when to implement the shift with the markets so turbulent. But the desire to reduce some risk through diversification appears to be holding firm.Over the past fiscal year, public funds have lost an average 4.3 per cent of their overall assets while corporate fund assets have dropped 5.1 per cent, according to Northern Trust. While the losses may not come as a shock, the reallocation out of equity investments for other investment classes is noticeable.Pension funds, which have been holding a steady 62-65 per cent equity allocation since 2004, have been diversifying to other asset classes. Public funds this year now have a 57 per cent average equity allocation compared with 62.4 per cent in the prior year.Corporate funds show even more of a drop-off, with a 7 per cent reduction in equities. These institutions previously invested 63.6 per cent in equities and now allocate 56.7 per cent. Much of this capital is being placed in alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity.The reason for the change in asset allocations is mainly increased efforts to diversify portfolio assets. One big state pension that looks at its asset allocation annually recently chose to reduce investments in public equity and fixed income in favour of private equity and real returns.Mansco Perry, chief investment officer of the $36bn Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, says the plan raised its private equity allocation to 15 per cent from 5 per cent and real returns to 10 per cent from 5 per cent, partially for diversification purposes. The fund, which also eliminated home-country bias from its investment guidelines, takes a long-term approach to its investment policy and aims to avoid the daily “roller-coaster” rides of the public equity and fixed income markets.While these funds attempt to look long term and past today’s credit crunch, there is increased tension in the short term being caused by counterparty risk. It is standard operating procedure by pension funds to use interest rate and currency swaps to hedge themselves against unexpected movements in these markets as fund managers seek to limit their exposure to being on the wrong side of a rise in interest rates or currency exchange rates. However, recent events in the financial industry have caused fund managers to wonder if their swap counterparties will be around for the life of the swap.With big financial institutions faltering, such as Lehman, AIG and Merrill, pension funds that assumed these institutions to be safe can no longer do so.“Derivatives are still being heavily used by institutions but there is a lot more scrutiny on setting up swaps because of the counterparty risk,” says Milton Ezrati, senior economist and market strategist at money manager Lord Abbett. “This issue will remain while we are in this environment and the viability of major financial firms [is] being called into question.”Another issue that is coming into play during these uncertain times is whether pensions should be throwing caution to the wind and investing in beaten down assets or reeling in risk and investing more conservatively.With the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 3,500 points from its high this year, pension fund managers are wondering if this is the perfect time to invest in the domestic equity market or whether this is the continuation of a bear market.Lord Abbett’s view is that long-term investors will be rewarded handsomely by investing in the domestic market now. But that does not mean pension fund executives are ready to pull the trigger in favour of domestic equities at this time.Mr Ezrati says these investment professionals are being pulled in two different directions. “Most pension plans have to answer to a board or a political body and right now it is a riskier time to take on risk,” he says.“This could be a job security risk [for people that take additional risks at this time],” notes Mr Ezrati. “But at the same time it is difficult as now could be the right time to invest.”David Chittim, a senior vice-president with BNY Mellon’s product solutions group, says the credit crisis has pushed liabilities to the forefront of investors’ minds.“Every pot of money in the world exists to be spent on something, either now or in generations,” he says.There has been a “tremendous” rise in the number of asset liability and allocation studies that have taken place over the past few years, he adds.Paul O’Dowd is a reporter with FundFire, a Financial Times publication
133;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-09-18T20:47:46Z;US stocks surge in late trade;;The prospect of the creation of a Resolution Trust Corporation-style plan to deal with the turmoil in financial markets led stocks to their biggest rally in nearly six years late in the session.A violent swing in financials reversed the rout of the previous day as investors responded positively to the prospect of a Treasury plan similar to that which helped bring an end to the savings-and-loans crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s.Earlier in the session, the market fell as much as 2 per cent, as concerns lingered over the short-term funding of financial institutions even after a liquidity boost from central banks.Yet stocks later rebounded on the possibility that US authorities might follow their British counterparts by banning the short-selling of financial stocks. A second wave of buying came towards the end of the day.Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the move could help liquidity, without which several “firms are dead in the water”. He added “shorts would be really hung out to dry” ahead of quadruple witching tomorrow, the day on which contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures expire.Wild fluctuations in Cit Group illustrated that of the wider market. At one point down 36.1 per cent, the stock closed up 49.7 per cent at $10.70.It emerged that Morgan Stanley was in preliminary merger talks with Wachovia, the troubled regional lender, which soared 59 per cent to $14.50. Yet some analysts questioned the logic of such a deal.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the two independent US investment banks still standing, remained in focus.They rose 3.7 per cent at $22.55 and fell 5.7 per cent at $108.00, respectively, as bid talk surrounded the former.In the previous session, they lost 24.2 per cent and 13.9 per cent, respectively, as the cost to insure against default of their debt rose.HSBC, China’s Citic Group and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp were among names that various reports said were also interested in acquiring some or all of Morgan Stanley.Washington Mutual was among the biggest gainers, up 48.8 per cent to $2.99, amid reports that the fourth largest US bank was looking to be sold. The previous day WaMu said it would prop up its money market funds to prevent losses on a Lehman Brothers-issued debt.By the close, markets had rebounded. The S&P 500 was up 4.3 per cent at 1,206.51 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 3.9 per cent at 11,019.69. The Nasdaq Composite rose 4.8 per cent at 2199.10.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, fell 8 per cent to 33.10 after rising as much as 16.4 per cent.General Electric rebounded to 7.4 per cent at $24.79 paring its loss for the week to 7.3 per cent. That came even after Deutsche Bank cut its target price on the world’s third largest company, whose financial arm accounts for about half its business, from $33 to $28.It said: “While it may be easy to attack speculators and short-sellers for these movements, the reality is that unless CDS [credit default swap] spreads quickly normalise, then the cost of financing GE capital . . . could rise sharply.”Custodian banks, which garner revenue from lending stock on behalf of their clients to cover short trades, suffered in the wake of SEC regulations. The new rules are designed to crack down on so-called “naked” short-sellers who do not even borrow shares before selling them.In spite of the positive momentum, State Street endured one of the biggest declines on the S&P 500, down 8.9 per cent to $59. Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon fell 6.7 per cent and4.6 per cent, respectively.In the previous session, the market once again slumped amid what has emerged as one of the most extraordinary series of developments in financial history.“How many more disasters and how much more bad news can the world’s economy take in a week?” asked David Buik of BGC Partners.Tobias Levkovich, equity strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients: “Investors are stunned and seem resigned to further losses . . . Fear seems to be overtaking any rational discourse with the credit crunch slipping into crisis proportions.”.
134;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-09-18T20:31:46Z;Putnam closes $12bn fund;;"Putnam Investments, one of the oldest US money managers, on Thursday closed its $12bn prime money market fund because of a spike in redemption requests from clients as the crisis sweeping the world’s financial markets spread to traditional money managers and custodian banks.Putnam took the action as shares of several of the world’s largest custodian banks, including State Street and Chicago-based Northern Trust, plunged on concerns about the impact of new short-selling rules and the stress in money market funds on their business models. State Street fell as much as 55 per cent in New York trading.The custodian banks house trillions of dollars in assets; State Street has $15,300bn in assets under custody on behalf of mutual funds, pension funds and other clients. The banks also operate the world’s largest ­securities lending programmes, which facilitate short-selling.The board of Putnam Funds said it had voted to close the Putnam Prime Money Market Fund and distribute all fund assets. The fund is aimed at institutional clients and has a minimum investment of $10m.The company said the action was not related to the portfolio’s credit quality but was instead a reaction to market-wide liquidity issues and pointed out that it had no exposure to the securities of Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual or AIG at the parent-company level.The fund’s net asset value calculated on Tuesday was $1 per share. Money market mutual fund companies are scrambling to calm fears among clients after the Reserve Fund, the first-ever money market fund, “broke the buck”, falling below par value of $1 per share on Tuesday.The fund experienced redemption pressure on Wednesday. The serious constraints on liquidity in money market instruments created the risk that in order to process redemptions, the fund would realise losses in selling its portfolio securities.Custodian banks feed the borrowing needs of hedge funds. The US Securities and Exchange Commission may require hedge funds to disclose their short-sale positions and plans to subpoena the funds’ records in an effort to stem market turmoil. The impact of these rules on the securities lending programmes of custodian banks remains unclear, but investors sold heavily yesterday.Shares in State Street were down 16.8 per cent at $53.90 in late trading. Northern Trust shares rallied after being down most of the day to finish up 5.5 per cent, while shares in Bank of New York Mellon fell 6 per cent."

The second is: “What is the damage to our end-client, and to their client if we get it wrong?”This considered approach helps explain why innovation in the asset servicing industry happens at glacial speed since the numbers involved and the responsibility are huge and the consequences of getting it wrong could be dire.Nevertheless, innovation does occur, largely in response to changes and demand from the asset managers and asset owners. An example is pooling, the development of structures that allow multi-national companies running pension funds in a number of countries to pool the assets of these funds in order to achieve economies of scale and implement more complex and more efficient investment strategies.Northern Trust has built a reputation for leading the field in pension pooling. It offers its clients facilities based on legal structures in Luxembourg and Dublin, traditional centres of such innovation, and now in the Netherlands.“We’ve been leading the way in terms of different fund structures,” says Peter Cherecwich, head of institutional strategy and product development at Northern Trust.Next the asset service provider will look to provide structures allowing clients to include US-based pension assets in their pooled pension funds – as recently declared acceptable by the US Department of Labor.“We make it available in different structures and then we make it available in different markets,” he says. “That’s how our innovation happens.”There are some murmurs of dissent from Northern Trust’s competitors at the concept that it was the first to offer pooling structures: given that the industry has been discussing the possibility for more than a decade and the co-
operation of various regulators was indispensable, it is impossible to pin down a single innovation and say: “This is the very first step to pooling and one particular company was responsible.”In asset servicing, innovation is driven by conversations with clients, the asset owners and managers. “Ideas percolate through discussions with clients,” says Mr Cherecwich. “It’s rare that we sit in a room on our own and come up with an idea that no one’s heard of.”Tim Caverley, head of State Street’s investment services business in Europe, agrees. “We’re tied at the hip [to our client], so it’s important to understand where they’re going.”New investment strategies and instruments allowed under the European fund structure, Ucits III, have required significant investment from the asset service providers to keep up with both complexity and volume, says Mr Caverly. Over-the-counter derivatives, bespoke financial contracts, are now used by almost all asset managers and owners, so service providers need to offer support for these complex products.State Street has recently built up a specialist centre of expertise for dealing with OTC derivatives.OTC derivatives are generally seen as one of the major drivers of change and innovation in the industry. “The level of complexity has increased sharply because of the use of OTC derivatives,” agrees Fréderic Pérard, head of global fund services at BNP Paribas Securities Services. “Accurate and transparent reporting of the underlying assets is getting very difficult.”Particularly after recent events in global financial markets, the demand for independent pricing of these instruments has been growing. This is traditionally an area of expertise for boutique hedge fund administrators that have the experience and the intellectual capital to manage this highly complex business but maybe lack the scale to handle large amounts of assets, as has now become necessary.“Most of the big players have acquired alternative companies,” says Mr Pérard. “Everybody is investing in platforms to support OTC derivatives.” He sees the need for the buy-side’s technology to become more sophisticated, more nimble; more like the sell-side, in fact. “Now platforms are required that are very close to the sell-side. Now we are looking at using investment banks’ platforms,” says Mr Pérard. “The first one to do that will definitely be the winner.”As well as keeping up with the new investment types used by fund managers (commodities and property funds are also mentioned, not fondly, by asset service providers as offering significant challenges), the back office has to find ways to use what it already has better to support its clients.“We’ve got oodles and oodles of data,” says Ms Chakar. “The question is, how do you give it to a pension trustee in a form that reassures them they have full control and oversight?” Managing the form of reporting, how to slice and dice the vast amount of data a fund administrator or global custodian has, can be a key differentiator for an asset service provider.The other key challenge, all players are agreed, is supporting clients globally. Northern Trust’s Mr Cherecwich puts it like this: “We have a global model. Production needs to happen on a continuous basis; we have centres in different time zones so they can hand the book over to each other. But client service needs to be local.”“All of a sudden, this is really a global market,” says Mr Caverly of State Street, which has opened a service centre in Hong Kong to build capacity in both another time zone and another, important, language. “We want to offer local service with global scale.”For the moment, keeping up with the exploding demands of clients is sufficient innovation for the asset service providers."
136;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-07-20T22:12:56Z;Tough year for US public pension funds;;US public pension funds have had their worst returns in six years, losing an average of more than 4 per cent in the year to June 30, that puts them under even greater pressure to meet their growing liabilities.The average plan’s funded status has declined by close to 5 per cent during the year, taking it well below 100 per cent to be only 96 per cent funded, according to BNY Mellon.Until now funding had been improving, after five years of positive returns.The 40 largest public pension plans had a median loss of 4.3 per cent during the fiscal year, according to data from Northern Trust, which will be released this week.That compares with a return of more than 17 per cent last year. This year’s loss is close to the loss of 4.8 per cent in 2001, which was the worst for pension funds in the 11 years from 1997.Smaller pension funds usually post lower returns than large ones, so the total national average is probably lower.The typical public pension fund has 60 per cent of its money in equities and almost every stock market index in the world fell during the 12 months to June.Some, such as Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Europe’s Stoxx 50, fell by more than 20 per cent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 fell by 13 per cent.Fixed income, which typically accounts for a quarter of a pension fund, remained largely flat.Those funds that had big investments in commodities did slightly better, as their commodities paid off. However, federal lawmakers are holding hearings into whether pension funds should be restricted in their commodities investments, in case this adds to speculative fever in the asset class.Calpers, the biggest state fund, invested more than $1bn into oil and commodities last year – its first such investment – and has seen returns of close to 70 per cent on the portfolio.However, that represents only a sliver of the fund’s $240bn in assets. Calpers estimated it lost 2.4 per cent during the year to June 30, it said on Friday.The poor returns come as the US Governmental Accounting Standards board met two weeks ago to begin changing accounting rules to make the pensions more accurately report returns and liabilities.Under the current system, the funds paint an overly optimistic picture of their finances, say critics of the system.Even as pension fund returns shrink and liabilities widen, some state governments are giving their state employees higher pension benefits, further increasing the pressure on the funds and ensuring even greater liabilities. Most public pension funds have a fiscal year that ends in June.
137;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-07-20T21:02:28Z;Imitation is flattering for the innovator;;"Skandia reckons it invented the multi-manager model, and perhaps it did. It has certainly prospered on the back of it and now claims to be one of the world’s biggest multi-manager specialists.Jamie Macleod, chief executive of Skandia Investment Group, cites Russell Investments, Northern Trust and SEI as competitors he admires. “In scale terms, that is who I would compare us with,” he says.Chatting in parent company Old Mutual’s offices opposite London’s Tate Modern, Mr Macleod sketches the operation he heads: it has $130bn (£65bn, €81bn) under management and 180 employees, covers 45 legal entities, sells in more than 20 countries and transacts $150-$200m daily.It was formed a year ago to bring together Skandia’s money management activities, and is positioned, says Mr Macleod, to take advantage of a “strategic shift” he believes is underway. Investors no longer want funds; they want “fund solutions”, he maintains. And they are no longer focused on growth but want something more – income perhaps, or strategic asset allocation. “Investors have become more savvy and interested in their investments,” according to Mr Macleod. He is talking about investors with £80,000-£100,000 of assets, who are SIG’s target market. “They want more money back than they invest through a market cycle, regardless of market conditions.” They are no longer content to make money only when markets are going up.Mr Macleod points to several innovative products Skandia has come up with, the latest being the Alternative Investments fund launched in June. This puts together investments in such diverse asset classes as timber, water, infrastructure, precious metals, currency, commodities and volatility, and also holds Fulcrum Alternative Beta Plus, a hedge fund replication fund, and JPM Highbridge Statistical Market Neutral Fund.Skandia publicised it as “the UK’s first multi-asset alternative investment fund”, which is probably fair for a fund available to investors with £50 a month to put away.Mr Macleod is resigned to the idea being copied. “It has happened with other things.” But he is determined to keep the ideas coming. “The strategic shift in the fortunes of the business were when we launched things that were new and innovative,” he says, referring to the growth of Skandia Investment Management Limited – the UK multi-manager investment group that he joined Skandia in 2002 to set up and that is now part of SIG.“We were the first to launch a Reits fund, to do asset allocation funds, and to do retail and segregated accounts together.”Yet another new idea, the Spectrum range of risk-rated funds unveiled in April, came from “putting the consumer at the forefront of design”. The funds each have a strategic asset allocation to fit risk profiles in the range three to eight, on a scale where one is cash and 10 is geared exposure, use 15-18 managers to implement the strategy, and rebalance as necessary.They were conceived as a result of “listening to what distributors wanted, and them acknowledging that Skandia has the models and resources to make asset allocation decisions”, says Mr Macleod.Talking to distributors and consumers to find out what they want is an ingrained habit. “We know we don’t know so we take counsel from people who do. Listening to investors and distributors was the catalyst for much of what we have done.” Failing to communicate can lead to big mistakes, he adds. Products get launched that do the industry no favours.When it comes to industry issues, Mr Macleod’s main focus is on the machinations over the legislative package Ucits IV, which aims to make the European cross-border fund industry more efficient. It is going forward without the so-called passport that would allow managers to sell funds in a European Union member state without first setting up a management company there.“We hoped in 1986 that the passport would happen and it still hasn’t in full,” he says. Ucits have done well, he acknowledges, “but you still can’t set up funds in France and sell them in Belgium”. The problem comes down to “a group of people who work in the same industry but view the same information very differently”.SIG operates in all the main European markets and is making “steady progress” in all, says Mr Macleod, mentioning a “thriving business” in Poland.Despite his concern at lack of progress on the passport, he says the 14 European markets Skandia covers are all different, and some things “don’t transport”.The UK remains an important market, being the source of more than half SIG’s business, but in addition to Europe, it also has a presence in the Nordic region and Latin America.“We are looking to build the business but not necessarily extending our geographic positioning,” says Mr Macleod. “We are in enough countries and also have the interface with Old Mutual. There are areas where we have head room to grow and others where there is less.”The business is well-placed, he adds, to capitalise on the greying of the boundaries between retail and institutional business that Ucits III has brought in its wake. The flexibility that Ucits III regulations give fund managers has seen the same offering being made to both sets of investors, via different share classes.Skandia is at the forefront of this merger between retail and institutional business, says Mr Macleod. “Our business construction is on an institutional basis, because most of what we do is on an institutional purchasing basis. The ingredients are sourced on an institutional basis, then [packaged for retail investors] and distributed in a business to business environment.”This approach means every type of fund is grist to Skandia’s mill. “When constructing solutions, we think about hedge funds in the same way we do about ETFs [exchange traded funds] or other funds,” says Mr Macleod, adding it is also a means of keeping costs low.The growth of the multi-manager industry means Skandia can expect more competition, but Mr Macleod says: “There is room [for new entrants] but building credibility, scale and experience takes a while.”"
138;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-07-20T21:00:58Z;No smooth route to the European pension;;"Five years after it came into effect, the European pensions directive is under review. While this is standard practice for the European Commission, which likes to keep an eye on how its directives are working out, this particular directive seems to be struggling, in one area at least. (PDF)The institutions for occupational retirement provisions (IORP) directive had several goals, one of which was to provide a framework for pan-European pension schemes. A number of jurisdictions have set up legal vehicles for such schemes, or made sure existing vehicles are suitable, but few actual pension schemes have been established.A survey by the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (Ceiops) found fewer than 50 cross-border European pensions schemes, based in just five home countries, at the end of January 2007. Of these, only the one domiciled in Luxembourg had any pretensions to being close to pan-European. Most of the schemes are functional in their home country plus one “host” country; a few have up to four host countries. The Luxembourg fund can be used in 10 other countries.“We don’t see there ever being a solution that would work across all 27 states [of the European Union],” says Barry Mack, a principal at Mercer, “but it might work for groups.” He suggests it would be feasible for a pension scheme to pool cross-border liabilities and assets for geographically or culturally close neighbours, such as Ireland and the UK or Belgium and the Netherlands. Pooling could also work where it included only countries with similar pension structures, such as defined contribution with capital guarantees.Mr Mack was presenting a report on the activities of Mercer’s pan-European taskforce, which has recently conducted a survey on the topic. It discovered that out of 25 respondents, mainly investment managers, just six offer some kind of pan-European product, with a further 13 claiming to have something in the pipeline.“Providers are talking about pan-European provision, but they’re taking it step by step, rather than the big bang approach,” he said.In addition to the vagueness of the country-specific implementation of the directive in many cases, the current review has left many providers unwilling to commit themselves in such a shifting landscape, according to Mr Mack.Nevertheless, some providers are making preparations in response to demand from clients. “The pan-European conversation has been going on for a long time,” says Aaron Overy, vice-president for business development, pooling, at Northern Trust. “In the last 12 months, we’ve seen much more interest from multinationals.”Mr Overy paints a charming view of an industry where participants are working together to overcome the difficulties of establishing a pan-European pension fund. “There are lots of stakeholders in this and only rarely do they compete with each other,” he says.“The difficulties are being knocked on the head by the stakeholders. Administrators [such as Northern Trust] have sorted out a lot of things, while consultants are working as project
managers.”Despite all this co-operation, he admits the dream of a pan-European offering is still some way away, particularly since it is not what clients are demanding. “People aren’t talking about pan-European, they’re talking
about cross-border,” he says.Corporate pension sponsors have become interested in cross-border pensions for a number of reasons. Fidelity International says its multinational clients want a clear global employee benefits policy, asset and risk pooling to manage pension assets most efficiently for the company, cost-efficient and simple retirement savings arrangements for globe-trotting senior employees, and cost-savings where a company has a small number of employees in several different jurisdictions.However, Fidelity is not waiting for the IORP directive to take effect and make pan-European pension schemes workable. “Because of the lack of tax harmonisation, it’s impossible,” says Julian Webb, head of DC business development. In any case, “multinational companies are looking for solutions with a global perspective”.In response to this demand, Fidelity has for the last six years offered an offshore retirement savings plan that functions as a pension plan except that it carries no tax advantages and suffers no restrictions on paying benefits. It currently holds nearly £500m of assets for companies employing individuals in around 120 countries.“Even within Europe, clients are saying, ‘We see this as a sensible solution’, as often it’s not cost-effective to set up individual pension schemes,” says Mr Webb.Multinationals prefer to develop relationships with single vendors, such as
pension providers, across their geographical range where possible, he adds. Although there may be disadvantages to having an offshore savings account instead of a true pension scheme, Mr Webb is not holding his breath in anticipation of promising developments from the IORP review. Fidelity is planning to
consolidate its presence
in the multinational
pensions market but has no plans to establish European cross-border pension schemes. “As and when there is tax harmonisation, we will look at it,” says Mr Webb."
139;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-07-07T01:12:40Z;MUTB looks to form alliances;;Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Bank, Japan’s largest trust bank with Y117,000bn ($1,100bn) in assets under management, is seeking to enter more alliances with foreign financial institutions to enhance its global services to domestic clients.Kinya Okauchi, newly appointed president of MUTB, said the bank was keen to form alliances to gain expertise, particularly in asset management in Asia and other emerging markets.Mr Okauchi said mergers and acquisitions could follow such alliances if there were operational benefits and agreement with the potential partner.“Domestic customers, both corporate and retail, are increasingly demanding global services,” Mr Okauchi said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We are making efforts to respond to that need. There is a limit to what we can do on our own, so …we are forming business alliances with foreign specialists.”Japanese trust banks, in common with the country’s mega-banks, have dealt with the non-performing loans that weighed down their businesses throughout the 1990s but now face a need to differentiate their services amid intense competition in a sluggish home market.In the past few years MUTB, which is part of Japan’s largest banking group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, has been actively forming alliances with foreign financial institutions to differentiate its services.Following the establishment of a joint venture in 2005 with ComputerShare – Japan Shareholder Services, which offers shareholder services to corporations – it has formed at least seven business alliances with foreign financial institutions.These include a global custody service alliance with Brown Brothers Harriman, global estate planning services with Northern Trust Company of the US, Union Bank of California and First Hawaiian Bank and a real estate asset management alliance with Morley Fund Management, part of Aviva, the UK insurance group.MUTB wants to build alliances in asset management, because this is one of the most promising areas in which banks can differentiate themselves by diversifying their investment strategies, said Mr Okauchi.“If they are looking to broaden the range of services and investment styles that they offer then this is presumably going to be for active management of assets, for which they can charge higher fees than simply being custodians of assets,” said Brett Hemsley, banking analyst at HSBC in Tokyo.“The question is whether [such alliances] will actually provide the solutions that its domestic clients want,” he said.
140;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-06-17T14:56:31Z;Business models: A question for the wealthy;;"Many large financial institutions have in recent years sought to exploit the links between their private banking and investment banking arms. The idea was that a new generation of wealthy clients – entrepreneurs who had built their fortunes in business – wanted sophisticated products and access to expertise in corporate finance and investment banking.It was a win-win situation – until the big writedowns at the investment banks showed this structure could expose private banks to significant reputational risk.Now that the credit crisis has shone an unwanted spotlight on many banks, some private banking clients may be wondering: “Am I better off with a small, independent wealth manager or a private bank attached to a global investment bank?”The answer has less to do with the size of the institution than its culture and capabilities. While the large banks tout the advantages of being global, having big balance sheets, and being able to create sophisticated products, the independent firms – whether small or large – argue that not having an investment banking division allows them to focus on what matters most: wealth management.Rob Elliott, senior managing director at Bessemer Trust, an independent wealth manager in New York, says his firm is able to offer clients the same products that the big investment banks make available to their private clients, as well as the same services – be it investment management, philanthropy, tax and estate planning or family company advisory services.“We’re a client of those [investment banking] firms,” he says. “Their products are available to anybody who wants to invest in them, whether it’s structured products, or private equity, or hedge funds or credit. Our clients benefit from our ability to objectively compare the best offerings from Wall Street, without being limited to any one firm’s products.”Sherry Barrat, president of personal financial services at Northern Trust, an independent financial services firm that focuses on institutional and family wealth, agrees. She believes that while investment banks produce “some great products and take companies public”, there are distinct advantages to not having an investment banking division.“The flipside when you are not attached to an investment bank is that while we still have access to their products, we don’t have the conflicts that some view as inherent to that model,” she says. “Our clients do not have to worry about us pushing product …there is that ‘no-conflict objectivity’ that goes with not being an investment bank. That is one of the main reasons we have not gone into that business in our 119 years.”At Northern Trust, which manages about $780bn, private clients comprise 42 per cent of revenues, while institutional clients generate the rest. This, Ms Barrat says, underscores that the firm’s focus is on wealth management.While developing sophisticated products is one part of an investment bank’s business, another is helping owners of private businesses float or find buyers.Mr Elliott brushes aside the notion that private banks attached to investment banks have a built-in advantage in this area.“We don’t execute a transaction, but on a very objective, unbiased …basis, sit down with a family business owner and say: ‘You’ve done a great job, you’ve built this business to $50m – do you want to keep it going? …If an exit is the right thing for the family, or a partnering agreement that takes some money off the table, we’ll help you get it done’.” Bessemer will then help the family identify a suitable investment bank for the work.By contrast, a large financial services company such as Citi has in-house expertise. Sallie Krawcheck, chairman and chief executive of Citi global wealth management, calls this the “one-stop shopping aspect” of having both divisions under the same roof. “We can help a client look across not just their company needs but their personal needs as well,” she says.But being associated with an investment bank can have its downsides – as the credit market turmoil has shown.“Some days it doesn’t feel as great to be part of a large financial services company as it did a year ago, or two years ago or 10 years ago because, of course, the large banks, ourselves included, have had significant write-offs from the subprime issue and have, as a result, taken a reputation hit,” Ms Krawcheck says.“What doesn’t change are the capabilities that we, in a large banking organisation, bring to our clients – be it the global footprint, which clients find to be very, very helpful, or the access to the broad range of products and services that are difficult to replicate in a smaller organisation.”Unlike Citi, JPMorgan Chase was never a significant creator of collateralised debt obligations backed by residential mortgages – a decision that is now paying off for the bank.“Our clients know us very well as a private bank and a firm, and have confidence in our people and process to vet managers,” says Catherine Keating, chief executive of JPMorgan’s US private bank. “We have had record inflows for the past five quarters.”She says a big advantage of having an investment banking division is that many of the private bank’s clients are the size of institutions and “are every bit as complicated and sometimes more complicated than institutional investors”. Having the divisions under the same umbrella allows the wealth management teams to leverage the institutional knowledge honed by the investment banking arm.“Managing wealth in this decade is much harder than in the previous two,” she adds. “You need to be more global; more conscious of volatility and dislocation in the market; and need to move more quickly and tactically. Being part of a large financial services firm gives us insight and access that benefits clients.”"
141;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-06-01T21:01:41Z;Potter offers Windy City an English education;;"After a seven-year stint in London, Steve Potter, the newly inaugurated president of Northern Trust Global Investments, has a host of insights to offer on his return to his employer’s home city of Chicago.Having witnessed the preparations for London 2012 first hand, Mr Potter has already been approached by Pat Ryan, the founder of Aon and chairman of Chicago’s bid to host the Olympics in 2016.But his day job will involve incorporating the knowledge he has built up in Europe into Northern Trust’s US operations.Since 2001 Mr Potter has headed up Northern Trust’s non-US operations, both in asset management and asset servicing. In his new role he assumes global supremacy for the bank’s $778bn (£393bn, €499bn) asset management operation, succeeding Frederick Waddell, the new chief executive of the wider company.And although the asset management arm is dwarfed by Northern Trust’s $3,980bn global custody business, Mr Potter seems quite pleased by the move. “I love the asset management business, markets are much more interesting than asset servicing,” he says.“Asset management is still only 15 per cent of our global revenues so that is a huge opportunity and my education in the City will help me hugely with my new job. I have picked up a much bigger appreciation for emerging markets and alternatives. Emerging markets really start and end here in London.”The links forged in London will grow in importance as open architecture models assume ever greater importance across the industry. “A good number of the people I have been working with will be on our platforms and hopefully we will be on their platforms as well.”The bad news is that Mr Potter returns to a pure asset management beat at a difficult juncture, with markets still reverberating from the repercussions of the credit crunch.Even Northern Trust, an institution so conservative it is known in Chicago as the “Grey Lady of LaSalle Street”, has set aside $229m to cover potential losses in two of its structured investment vehicles. And like its more risk-hungry rivals it will have to adjust to a much changed landscape when the dust settles.“Mortgage companies became aggressive sales companies and there is this period of cleansing and fortification,” says Mr Potter. “But markets do correct. Business models will evolve towards more transparency and regulation and capital will flow again. I’m optimistic that it will flow in a more normalised way, but ‘normal’ was five years ago, not one year ago.”He believes the expected stricter regulation of US
broker-dealers, such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, will have knock-on effects across the industry. “The whole way broker-dealers are regulated will change. The unintended consequence is that there will be less leverage and therefore less innovation.”Northern Trust has fared better than most of its rivals amid the credit squeeze, extending its record of posting positive earnings in every quarter since 1987 when it reported a 3 per cent rise in assets under management in the first three months of this year from the prior quarter, although assets under custody dipped 3.7 per cent.Mr Potter says inflows were particularly strong from the Middle East, where the bank recently opened an office in Abu Dhabi, its first in the region. He also reports “huge flows to cash”, with holdings of cash or near cash instruments having risen 10 per cent to $380bn since December. “People are being more cautious in the current environment,” he explains. Yet, at the other extreme, Mr Potter sees continuing robust demand for alternatives and other less liquid assets. He says demand for Northern Trust’s multi-manager hedge fund platform has “stood up well” in spite of the operation suffering an unusually bad two down months in 2007.Similarly the long-term nature of private equity investing means customers should stay on board, in spite of a dearth of deals that means “there are firms that are basically letting their staff have an extended summer holiday”.In spite of rising borrowing costs, he backs private equity managers to survive in the current economic downturn, arguing they will be willing to make “tough”, rather than “emotional”, decisions about the companies they own.Like many of its peers, Northern Trust has also expanded into the world of 130/30 funds, primarily as a means of leveraging its expertise in quantitative investing, where just $15bn of its $281bn book of assets is invested in “enhanced” strategies. And, like many of its peers, it has thus far failed to shoot the lights out with this constrained long/short approach.Mr Potter accepts 130/30 is still a work in progress, saying of his own funds: “they have had positive returns but they have probably not done what we hoped they would do. In this market Northern Trust is selling safety and security, so it is taking a backseat.“I still think 130/30 is a good product but we have been operating in an absolutely unbelievable market. We are not marketing it but we will stick with it and I would expect that in the next several years performance will improve.” One thing the bank is marketing is its Investment Program Solutions product, similar to the Dutch concept
of fiduciary management, which entails asset allocation, manager selection and corporate governance all being outsourced to Northern Trust.Pension funds and endowments with assets of up to $1bn are the primary target for this fast-growing service – its IPS division has doubled in size to $20bn this year – in which the bank is competing with the likes of Frank Russell and SEI.IPS sits inside Northern Trust’s multi-manager platform, which has $41bn of assets. But Mr Potter sees this figure growing rapidly, particularly as just $7bn of the $140bn held by its wealth management operation is invested in an open architecture, multi-manager manner.“We are the market leader for the super rich and family offices. About 20-25 per cent of the Forbes 400 [list of wealthiest Americans] uses Northern Trust,” he says. “We would expect [multi-manager assets] to grow at double-digit rates. I can see us with $50bn in assets in the wealth management space in that multi-manager format in the next five years.”Mr Potter thanks his “lucky stars” he had the opportunity to spend seven years living and working in London. He is buying an apartment in the city for family trips back from Chicago. All he asks is that we judge his investment skills on the Olympian strides he hopes to make in the Windy City, and not his timing in the property market."
142;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-06-01T07:20:06Z;Northern Trust waves the flag for ETFs;;Although some exchange traded fund products have recently failed to attract seed capital – causing some to say the market is saturated – new companies continue to try their luck.Are these new entrants simply jumping on the bandwagon, and if not, how do they hope to differentiate themselves from their established peers?“We did not want to introduce a me-too product,” explains Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of Northern Trust’s global quantitative management group, which launched the Northern Exchange Traded Shares, or Nets, product this month.“We took a careful look at the state of the market and our belief in its future potential in determining both the decision to enter, initially in the US, and the product set. And one of the things that we’re confident of is that our initial product set . . . is absolutely additive.”Northern Trust’s ETF offerings, which will number 15 by the end of May, are based around headline indices from the world’s major stock exchanges. “It’s long been my belief that American investors who want access to foreign markets would be interested in ETFs on the indexes that everyone in the market knows, so the FTSE 100, the CAC 40, the Topix, the Hang Seng,” Mr Schoenfeld explains. “Our goal here is to bring those flagship indexes and, thus these foreign markets, closer to the US, and in a way, also extend the trading day for local players.”Mr Schoenfeld believes this approach is distinct from many of the other players in the market. The US ETF space in particular has at times appeared saturated, with several hundred products tracking the major indices. This has led some groups to move into niche products, based on indices of exotic commodities or sectors.While he is reluctant to rule out such things, Mr Schoenfeld says Northern Trust is likely to stick to its core strategy for the foreseeable future.“The initial strategy that we’ve articulated is quite clear, and our first wave is these flagship local indices. The logical focus for us in the next several months is to make this set as complete as possible,” he says. “We want to fill out and have the most significant developed markets, other key developed markets and the most significant emerging markets. It’s clear that this initial product set could easily be 30 or more ETFs.”For now, those products will be available to US investors. In spite of Northern Trust’s global reach, there would be little point, Mr Schoenfeld says, in leveraging that to supply, for example, another FTSE 100 ETF to the UK market. But the company has clear intentions to globalise its ETFs. “There are opportunities in the long term to introduce these products where they fill the need, whether it’s taking European indexes to Asia or Asian indexes to Europe. It’s something that we absolutely will explore, but we will do so in co-operation with our licensing partner.“We’re going to focus on where we think there’s strong demand and this initial set is intriguing for us, not just from a commercial standpoint but it also philosophically fits our role. We’re a large custodian, we operate in over 50 global markets and connecting these markets together fits our brand and our goals very well.”It is clear that Northern Trust, with its infrastructure and its existing relationships with major global organisations and exchanges, has the potential to be a major player in the ETF space.But for organisations that lack Northern Trust’s scale and branding, there is an alternative. The Spa ETF approach is simply not to compete with the major ETF players at all. Spa launched its products in the UK, US and Italy late last year. The funds track the US market and aim to beat the major US indices, but they take an active indexing approach, rather than the more common passive one. As such, Spa believes it is playing for the space occupied by active managers, rather than ETFs.“We’re attempting to capture market share from active mutual funds,” says Neil Michael, head of quantitative strategies at Spa. “And the beauty of active indexation and the ETFs thereon is that compared to active mutual funds, they’re so much more flexible, ­convenient, transparent, cheaper – crucially they’re very much cheaper – and in our experience and the research we’ve done, the performance is better as well.” Spa bases its products on indices from the Miami-based research house Market Grader and its fundamental approach addresses the frailty of traditional ETF models, Mr Michael says.“Traditional ETFs are based on cap weighted indices,” he says. “There is an inherent weakness associated with cap weighted indices, which is that they tend to be momentum plays. They tend to overweight the overvalued stocks and underweight the undervalued stocks, and we think that’s a serious drawback.” In Market Grader’s approach, companies are selected not on market capitalisation but on fundamentals, such as growth, cashflow and profitability. “We think that more closely approximates a company’s fair value, rather than market capitalisation,” says Mr Michael. The result is a more volatile index, but Spa believes investors are “more than getting paid for taking that risk,” by the indices’ outperformance.
143;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-04-27T21:04:55Z;Bright spark leading the way on ETF innovation;;"Lee Kranefuss may be an electrical engineer by training, but that has not stopped him powering his way to the core of the global asset management industry.The bright spark is chief executive of Barclays Global Investors’ market-leading iShares exchange traded funds division, a key component of BGI’s surge to become the largest fund manager in the world by assets, with some $2,079bn (£1,048bn, €1.304bn) as of December 2007.And despite his background he feels at home in his current role. “There is more calculus on the blackboards of BGI than in most technology companies these days,” he enthuses.However, Mr Kranefuss is equally energised about the flood of new entrants to the ETF market, many of which he fears are destined to burn out. According to Morgan Stanley, 14 companies launched their first ETFs in 2007, including Deutsche Bank, XShares and Spa ETF, taking the total number of providers to 75.Northern Trust has joined the gold rush this year, with more than 20 others set to jump on the bandwagon, according to Morgan Stanley, including Merrill Lynch, Alpha Bank of Greece and Tata, the Indian conglomerate.But Mr Kranefuss believes many of the new entrants will bite the dust. “Many [of the newcomers] are small companies with venture capital backing,” he says. “It is becoming sufficiently crowded that people that who have launched funds do not have enough money to support them. I would expect a great many to disappear.”Even if an ETF provider is charging a relatively high 75 basis points a year for its product and can raise $100m, Mr Kranefuss argues that the resultant $750,000 revenue “is probably not going to cover your legal fees for the year, let alone run your fund’s marketing, portfolio management, sales, research and technology”. In such a low margin, high volume business, Mr Kranefuss believes free-standing companies need to raise at least $2bn to cover their costs and provide a “reasonable living” for two or three founders, a sum only a third of the existing 75 ETF providers had amassed as of December, according to Morgan Stanley.“People are trying to strike a home run, that’s the venture capital model. If two in 10 pay off and the rest go bankrupt, that’s the model. But I would be very worried about operational risk. I would stick to the large providers who have the skill and track record and staying power.“It’s amazing how many people are out there whose market share rounds down to 0 per cent.” Some 38 companies, according to Morgan Stanley, each measuring to up to one decimal place market share. That said, even the mighty BGI has scrapped some ETFs over the years, including six families of pan-European sector funds that raised only $1bn after their launch in 2000 and US-registered funds targeting the chemicals industry and the Canadian stock market.These were minor setbacks for BGI’s iShares operation which, as of December, had amassed $403bn of assets, thanks to a range encompassing almost everything from plain vanilla equity funds to innovative products tracking listed private equity, infrastructure, clean energy, water and timber and forestry.Yet even the BGI behemoth saw its global market share slip from 54.1 per cent to 50.5 per cent in 2007 as the likes of State Street Global Advisors, Vanguard and Invesco PowerShares nibbled away at its dominance.Mr Kranefuss remains upbeat, pointing out that the iShares platform attracted record net inflows of $60bn in 2007, propelling its assets under management $96bn higher. “That is the impact of new entrants,” he concedes. “There have been years when iShares has accounted for $7-$8 of every $10, but I wouldn’t say that is natural. Frankly I think it’s good there is some real choice. It validates the market, it makes it clear that it’s not just us and some small players trying to get into this game.”Mr Kranefuss, in his role of chief executive of BGI’s intermediary products and index & markets group, overseas institutional indexing and securities lending as well as the ETF operation, but his enthusiasm for the latter appears absolute.He even finds positives in the ongoing market shake-out, which has eroded iShares’ assets under management, arguing it demonstrates the advantage of having the sort of well diversified portfolio that can be constructed relatively simply out of ETFs.He endorses a Morgan Stanley forecast that the ETF industry will grow from just under $800bn at the end of 2007 to $2,000bn by 2011.His priorities include expanding BGI’s range of fixed income and commodity products, which have lagged behind the rapid roll-out of equity-linked ETFs.“Around 80-90 per cent [of iShares] are equities. That is not because our customers want 80-90 per cent equities, it’s because of the engineering challenges [of fixed income and commodity ETFs]. In the US we have three commodity funds. That is not because we think three is enough.”But the ETF world is rapidly moving on from offering products that merely endeavour to track the performance of an underlying index or basket of assets.Companies such as WisdomTree, Lyxor and PowerShares have launched ETFs based on fundamental indices, which weight companies according to metrics such as revenues, earnings and dividends rather than market capitalisation.Mr Kranefuss dismisses these approaches as “an attempt to outperform in a primitive way” and, in essence, “a very slow moving active strategy”.This leads into the other main area of innovation; actively managed ETFs. Earlier this month PowerShares became the first company to launch active ETFs when four products based on quantitative strategies or stock screening processes listed in New York, beating BGI to the punch.Mr Kranefuss has some concerns that these innovations could create some confusion, clouding the message that ETFs can provide cheap market beta for those pursuing an alpha-beta separation model. Nevertheless, he feels the development of active ETFs could provide serious competition for actively managed mutual funds, which tend to be more expensive and less liquid.“I think [active ETFs] will have a huge impact because ETFs themselves are a better package.“You are getting the ability to buy and sell throughout the day in any brokerage account. They are available to anyone. They are incredibly democratising.”"
144;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-04-20T21:03:53Z;Pension pooling gets regulatory boost;;Northern Trust has received regulatory clearance to include US assets in its cross-border pensions pooling vehicle, potentially paving the way for pension pooling to become a global phenomenon.The US Department of Labor has issued an advisory opinion clearing the way for US retirement scheme assets to participate in cross-border pooling vehicles, according to Northern Trust.Multinational companies with pension plans in more than one European jurisdiction already have the option of pooling the assets with Luxembourg, Ireland, Netherlands and Belgium all offering structures.Bringing pension assets from multiple global locations under one roof potentially reduces costs and simplifies corporate governance. Despite these advantages, fewer than 10 companies are thought to have established such vehicles, although Northern Trust said it has more than 15 clients interested in the possibilities opened up by the US ruling. It supports $26bn (£13bn, €16bn) in pooled assets.
145;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2008-01-22T04:16:43Z;A wealth of experience to pass on;;"When Doug Regan’s clients imagine passing their wealth on to their heirs, they often experience two emotions: Fear and anxiety. “Fear and anxiety that the money will negatively impact, or not positively impact, [on] their children and grandchildren; fear that money will take away the human driver of achieving success through hard work,” says the Northern Trust executive.In an era when the proclivities of dilettantish young heiresses are laid bare on the internet, it is unsurprising that many of the ultra-wealthy are experiencing such emotions.But like the industrial and financial barons of a bygone era, who attempted to enshrine their munificence, however belatedly, in the philanthropic projects they left behind, today’s entrepreneurs are just as determined, if not more so, to encode their offspring with the values that engendered their own fortunes.Some family heads have resorted to ghost-written biographies describing their ascent from garage-based entrepreneur to conglomerate chairman. But such tomes risk becoming outdated documents of nothing but historical interest. Others have hired filmmakers to produce feature-length video biographies. Private banks, too, are trying novel approaches to help clients inculcate their values in succeeding generations.Mr Regan, president of Northern Trust’s wealth management group (where clients have a minimum net worth of $200m), says surveys and informal interaction revealed a growing unrest between the first and third generations.The biggest concern, he says, was the fear that without the need to work, the heirs wouldn’t do anything worthy.Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, alluded to this in a 1986 interview. Asked how much he would leave his children, he said: “Enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.”The wealth management group at Northern Trust has responded to client concerns with a number of strategies, including an intranet site where families will be able to share concerns securely. Already running is “Inspiring Human Capital”, a day-long course that addresses some of the more intangible, non-financial issues that accompany wealth, with an emphasis on values.The programme, says Mr Regan, aims “to help families focus less on being wealthy people and more on being people who happen to be wealthy. In many ways, money is simply a tool to do other things and this programme helps our families focus on what those other things could be.”Demand for these courses stems partly from a long period of wealth creation coupled with demographic trends, as many first generation entrepreneurs are now in their 50s or 60s. It is also a result of societal factors.“This generation is more introspective. A lot of [them] grew up with middle-class values. Now they have to figure out how to raise kids with middle-class values when they’re no longer middle class,” says Ellen Perry, a former family office head with training in psychology and founder of Wealthbridge Partners, a consulting firm. She is helping Northern Trust run the course.The need for such programmes isn’t lost on Mr Regan. In a 20-plus-year career in wealth management, he has seen it all: the multi-billion-dollar family whose warring factions haven’t spoken for three generations; brothers who brawled over assets; and the recurrent theme of “grandchildren who curry favour with Grandma”.Running in four cities – New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta – the “Inspiring Human Capital” programme usually hosts about 12 families, with two to four people from the first and second generation represented. It begins with what Mr Regan calls an “ice-breaking” dinner, where participants trade urbane conversation about trips taken, business ventures and their favourite aircraft.The next morning, the course proper begins with Ms Perry’s overview of the pressing issues facing families of wealth.Clients learn that all family dynamics are challenging, and that “when you throw a large sum of money on top of that dynamic, it becomes combustible”, says Mr Regan. Next, he says, “We talk about money as a magnifier.”Money, he adds, gives you the privilege or burden of living your values. It also tends to amplify character traits. If you’re inclined to generosity, you will become a philanthropist. If you’re a workaholic, money won’t sate your desire to work; you’ll probably work harder.Next, the programme uses a series of exercises to help clients identify important occasions and emotional touchstones of their lives. Either paired off or placed in small groups, the attendees begin telling three-minute stories about themselves.While hailing from different backgrounds, geographies and business lines, they share such common denominators as the anxiety and challenge that come with wealth. The participants become very candid, says Mr Regan, and the process of sharing reveals “some of the most intimate and scarifying details imaginable”.What it also does is begin to lay the bedrock for why they are here: to identify the values important to them and then build these into a story that can be passed down the generations.Part of Ms Perry’s role is to help clients separate values from preferences. Compassion, honesty and generosity are values, she says, while politics is a preference. She warns that passing on a narrow set of preferences is a slippery slope. “The less diversity in your family, the less flexibility.”After lunch, participants are introduced to a professional storyteller who tells a few tales of her own and then breaks down the rudiments of how a good story is told. “She uses passion and style, and people are drawn in,” says Mr Regan. “And it gives the client the elements for when the inevitable question – ‘Why are we so rich?’ – comes, and our clients can answer in a cogent and meaningful way.”A hundred years ago, it might have taken a trip to Newport, Rhode Island, for the Vanderbilt scion to gauge the family’s wealth. Today, says Mr Regan, “parents can’t say ‘that’s none of your business’ when their children ask how much they make. They can just open the Forbes 400 or Google their mother or father and find out exactly what they earn.”Mr Regan says client feedback has been positive, especially among those who didn’t grow up sharing values but for whom they were self-evident – the “You woke up, you went to work” types. And both he and Ms Perry hope that the course will also help Northern Trust clients realign their interests.“People spend a lot of time on estate planning,” Ms Perry says. “But the actions and the stories we tell our children and grandchildren are far more important.”"

147;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2007-11-20T05:06:53Z;How to hook prospective clients;;Once a year, the Cleveland office of private bank The Glenmede Trust invites clients and prospective clients fly-fishing at an exclusive club in north-western Ohio. The all-day outing and lunch comes with the imprimatur of the bank’s Philadelphia headquarters, which encourages its satellite offices to sponsor locally flavoured events.“It has become something that people want to attend,” says Chip Wilson, the bank’s client services director.He attributes the event’s effectiveness to the mix of current and potential clients. “If your existing clients are your best referral sources, it’s always good to have them mingling with prospective clients,” he says.But co-mingling existing and prospective clients is just part of the equation. “Whether aimed at clients or intermediaries, you have to find something that is somewhat different,” Mr Wilson says. “And inviting them to another lecture on the current state of the economy doesn’t light their fire.”He offers another clue as to why events such as the fly-fishing day are small yet essential elements in Glenmede’s marketing effort: “Our differentiation is very hard to articulate in a print advertisement.”For private banks, courting customers can be an arduous process, one that may last several years. Complicating this is the desire for anonymity that many of the wealthy seek. Brand building may cultivate awareness, but when it comes to wooing prospective clients and getting them to sign on the dotted line, most banks rely on three tools: intermediaries, entertaining and referrals.Known in industry jargon as “centres of influence”, intermediaries are often viewed by clients as impartial advisers. “At the high end of the private banking model,” says Carol Pepper, an industry veteran and family office head, “getting a name through an accountant or a lawyer is an effective way to reach potential clients.”Not only do private banks develop these relationships through one-on-one information sessions, but some also create targeted advertising for intermediaries.“We do have specific adverts for capability awareness aimed at lawyers and CPAs,” says Doug Regan, group president of wealth management at Northern Trust. “The advertising goes to centres of influence such as trade journals, or to where we could highlight our expertise in an area like estate planning.”Glenmede’s Mr Wilson says his bank hosts a variety of engagements for intermediaries. Events range from a breakfast forum with the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel to less industry-specific talks with outside speakers such as Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian and author of several books.The process can be very segmented, allowing banks to “speak” directly to certain existing and potential clients. UBS in particular has attracted new business because of its long-standing sponsorship of various art-related events.“Our clients have different interests – art, philanthropy, music – and you have to communicate in a language that they understand,” says UBS’s John Strauss, head of private wealth management and chairman of the private bank. To that end, the bank invites some of its most important existing (and prospective) clients to Art Basel and Art Basel Miami.In New York, the bank holds dinners or lectures where the guest numbers range from 15 to 40. The topic is not always art. Fouad Ajami, the Johns Hopkins University Middle East expert, spoke at one such event, a dinner followed by a Q&A. At these events says Mr Strauss, “the bank isn’t talking about UBS. What we are hopefully conveying is that we are thinking on multiple levels.”When it comes to the ultra-high-net worth sector, Northern Trust’s Mr Regan believes that referrals are the gold standard. “While a brand-building campaign can help foster an image of solidity, giving your life savings to an organisation is a very intimate and personal process,” he says. “The more the bank emphasises new services for its existing clients and keeps its attention on them, the more likely the bank is to benefit from referrals.”Northern Trust’s wealth management group handles clients with minimum assets of $100m. Mr Regan says the unit recently launched a series of new initiatives for these wealthy individuals. One such programme, titled “Inspiring Human Capital”, aims to help families communicate their values to the next generation. Offerings like these, he says, “create a new kind of appreciation for the organisation”, one that clients pass on to other wealthy individuals outside the Northern Trust fold.Within its wealthy group, three quarters of Northern Trust’s clients are referred through existing clients, says Mr Regan. Other banks claim referral rates that are equally high. So why do so many spend considerable sums on brand advertising? In fact, not all do.JPMorgan Private Bank does not advertise, says a spokesman, adding that its existing customers are its best selling tool. That doesn’t surprise Lucian Camp, chairman of the London-based financial advertising agency CCHM: Ping. “At the top, there may be some banks that will tarnish their image if they advertise,” says Mr Camp.However, he believes what holds for most advertisers also holds for most private banks. “Familiarity breeds favourability,” he says, “and that’s just as true of luxury brands as it is of other brands. We scarcely encounter these institutions unless they advertise. Given their invisibility and intangibility, they need to advertise.”One private bank heeding that kind of advice is the former US Trust. Now part of Bank of America, the renamed US Trust, Bank of America Wealth Management recently launched a $25m national advertising campaign. Following the dissonance caused by its sale to Charles Schwab and then to Bank of America, the brand needed to be burnished.In their print form, the adverts are a refreshing change. Eschewed are the wood panelled boardrooms and impeccably dressed bankers standing before oil paintings of their fiduciary ancestors. Absent, too, are the Bauhaus-like contemporary office settings also common to much of the industry’s advertising.Instead, the backdrops to US Trust’s “New Face of Wealth” campaign, with its then-and-now undertones, include one advert featuring an everyday diner. To one side is a smaller image of a man and his extensive wine collection. The implication is that while the entrepreneur boasts a 2,000-bottle cellar, his values are solidly meatloaf.The campaign is in part a response to several rounds of research. US Trust learned that both old and, primarily, new wealthy clients “have a core set of values that go back to their roots. And they want to deploy these values across all dimensions of their success – philanthropy, investing and their family,” says Raj Seshadri, executive vice-president for strategy and marketing at the bank.It remains to be seen if US Trust’s focus on values succeeds. But its intent is to build not only brand but also consideration, says Ms Seshadri.One way to build that consideration is through the constant “noise” of advertising. It’s especially important, say some bankers, when the sell cycle can be anything from three months to four years. And unlike smaller banks and wealth providers that may face budgetary pressures to produce content-heavy advertising, the big ones have the resources to run more subliminal campaigns.“It takes an average of 18 months to develop a new relationship, so that means it sometimes takes three to four years for a client to understand the conviction we have to serve them,” says Mr Strauss of UBS. “Many people were very concentrated in an activity that created a large pool of assets. At that point they are experts in making widgets but not choosing a wealth provider.”But perhaps most important is a message that connects with the audience, such as UBS’s “You and Us” campaign.“The way we portray the firm is by using two people – that the relationship is about two people and not about the thousands of people and the deep resources the firm can offer,” says Mr Strauss.That portrayal worked, he adds, because feedback from customers shows “we have created a certain expectation that we will listen to our clients. The brand is one of our most important vehicles for acquiring new relationships”.Over at the much smaller Glenmede, where the bulk of business comes from referrals, “there’s a tremendous debate about advertising”, says Mr Wilson.But he offers one reason why the bank will continue to advertise, and it is one that other bankers say applies to their institutions: “Our advertising should validate a client’s decision to work with Glenmede.”
148;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2020-04-25T21:12:53+0000;Brics: acronym or coherent strategy?;;It is nearly six years since “Brics”, encompassing the might of the fast-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, entered the financial lexicon. Today the catchy acronym has a second home – in the portfolios of investors attracted by so-called Bric funds.The term – coined by Jim O’Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs – spawned a popular investment trend. EPFR Global, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based research firm, estimates that about $13.38bn is invested in the 18 Bric funds it tracks.Fans of the Bric concept say the four emerging market powerhouse economies account for about a third of global growth and represent a virtuous cycle: China and India are big consumers of commodities and building materials, while Russia is a leading oil producer and Brazil is rich in natural resources.“Brics are the engine room of growth in the global economy,” says Allan Conway, head of global emerging market equities at Schroders. These countries “are on a journey from early emergence to full emergence. That journey will take 10-15 years and investors are likely to see returns measured in 100s of per cent – but it won’t be a straight line and investors need to look through the volatility”.Schroders takes an active approach to risk in emerging markets and its investment strategy focuses on country and stock selection.Country allocation is driven by a quantitative model, while fundamental research forms the basis of the stock-selection process. Schroders manages $5.8bn in Bric assets and launched its first fund in late 2005.Goldman Sachs Asset Management also takes an active approach with its two Bric funds. The first, domiciled in Luxembourg, was launched in January 2006 and has $278m of assets under management. Its US counterpart debuted a little over a year ago and has $346.5m in assets under management. Both are still open to new investors and are run the same way.“It is very much a bottom-up fund and is relatively concentrated with 20 to 40 names in the portfolio,” says Richard Flax, co-portfolio manager of the Goldman Sachs Bric fund. “We are aiming to generate most of our return from stock selection.”He emphasises that Brics are a long-term investment. “There is a place for this sort of exposure in the asset allocation of high net worth individuals, but this can be a volatile asset class and investors need to size their exposure accordingly and have a long-term time horizon,” he says.Christian Deseglise, global head of emerging markets business for HSBC Investments, says one compelling reason to consider the Brics is that they have become less dependent on exports, the global economic cycle and the US growth rate.“There has been a re-balancing of the engines of growth to more domestic sectors ... They are better able to self-sustain economic growth,” he says.In December 2004, HSBC Investments became the first big institution to launch a Bric fund. Its flagship HSBC GIF Bric Freestyle Fund has $2.8bn under management and recently re-opened to non-US investors.European investors can also consider the $428m HSBC GIF Bric Markets Equity Fund, which follows an active quantitative investment process.So far this year, returns for Bric funds have been impressive. The Morgan Stanley Capital Index Bric index was up 23.6 per cent in the period to September 6, compared with a 19.86 per cent advance in the broader MSCI emerging market index.Still, not everyone is a fan of the Bric story. “We love emerging markets but Bric is not a great idea,” says Andreas Hoefert, chief global economist at UBS’s Wealth Management Research unit. “It’s a cool acronym but what it contains is four emerging markets that are large but don’t all have the same prospects. Why is Bric ignoring Mexico, Turkey and Indonesia? It’s a selection based on the fact that it is a cool acronym.”He says investors should rather consider exposure to emerging markets through a broad diversified fund – and then add single country funds if they like – rather than focus solely on a Bric fund.Steven Schoenfeld, chief investment officer of global quantitative management for Northern Trust, agrees.“While Brics is a catchy acronym – and the success of the emerging markets is exemplified by growth in those four countries – those markets are just one segment of that story and investors shouldn’t allocate to such a narrow group of markets when there are efficient vehicles that give you exposure to the overall category of emerging markets,” he says.“To subdivide emerging markets into a verbally compelling – but not necessarily economically logical – category does a disservice to the overall growth opportunity within emerging markets.”He says that if the point of investing in emerging markets is to gain exposure to world class companies, then choosing just Brics will omit some.Brics, he adds, should be viewed as a supplement to an emerging markets portfolio rather than as a proxy.
149;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2007-04-02T21:58:25Z;Preparing for life after cash out;;"Ever wondered what you would do with $100m?When that private equity firm or strategic buyer comes knocking, it pays to have a plan: cashing out raises complex issues ranging from family wealth preservation and philanthropy to how best to invest the windfall, be it tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.The knock could come sooner than expected. Flush with cash and access to cheap debt, private equity firms are on the hunt for buy-out targets, be they closely held or public companies. Last year, for instance, private equity firms bought 576 private US companies for a record $67bn, according to Thomson Financial. The market has also been receptive to initial public offerings – 198 were completed in the US in 2006.Jim Raaf, managing director at Harris myCFO, part of BMO Financial Group, says one of the most important decisions faced by entrepreneurs is how to convert part or all of their investment in a business into a more liquid asset, whether the liquidity event is in the form of an initial public offering, a recapitalisation or the sale of the business to a financial or strategic buyer.“Business owners should begin to plan for the implications of their shift from operators to investors,” he says. “The different events [that] occur before a transaction takes place can have a significant impact on the after-tax proceeds available to the selling owners.”One of the main reasons for planning as early as possible – ideally at least 18 months before a transaction – is because a liquidity event is likely to trigger a big tax bill. The advantage of propitious planning is that it can enable the seller to take advantage of opportunities for discounting assets, which may not be available after the transaction.Jeff Kauffman, president and chief executive of Northern Trust’s personal financial services group for the north east region, says a liquidity event may be the “definition of a good problem”.”With the sale of a business or a large concentrated asset holding, there is the creation of liquid wealth. I’ve seen it work out exceptionally well and not so well,” he says. “The difference is the level of planning and how the proceeds are invested at the point of liquidity and beyond. It’s a good problem, but it’s still a problem and you need to optimise the solutions.”There are several pre-liquidity strategies that can help lower federal transfer taxes, which include the gift tax, the estate tax and the generation-skipping transfer (or “GST”) tax. They range from basic steps such as taking advantage of the annual gift tax exclusion – you can make annual gifts of up to $12,000 tax-free to any number of people, with a lifetime exclusion of $1m per donor – to setting up a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) and making an instalment sale to a Grantor Trust.Jenny Jordan McCall, a partner at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP and head of its Estates, Trusts and Tax Planning Group, says GRATs are a “very good idea” for assets that are likely to appreciate. The idea is that because the stock of a private company is illiquid, it is often not valued as highly as shares in similar public companies and can be discounted. Moreover, the value of the shares of the formerly private company often appreciates substantially after the liquidity event.This is how a GRAT works: the business owner makes a gift of stock to an irrevocable trust and in exchange receives an annuity for the term of the trust, usually two or three years. The value of the gift for tax purposes is the difference between the amount contributed to the trust and the present value of the annuity payments the grantor will receive.With a bit of financial engineering, an adviser can select a combination of annuity payments and trust term that will result in the present value of all future payments being equal to the amount contributed to the trust. By IRS calculations, the GRAT will have zero assets by the time the trust expires, so no gift tax is owed.The tax efficiency of the strategy can be improved by first recapitalising the company, or retitling assets in a limited partnership and then transferring non-voting stock or the limited partnership units to the GRAT. Using non-voting stock or limited partner units may enable the grantor to receive a discount for lack of control and marketability on the value of the contributed assets of 25-45 per cent.Another popular tax­efficient strategy is a sale to an Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust.With an IDGT, a grantor sells assets – say, stock in a closely held or family business, marketable securities, limited partnership interests or property – to an irrevocable trust in exchange for an instalment note with interest. This trust works best if the assets are subject to discounts in determining their fair market value and are expected to appreciate in value at a rate greater than the interest payable on the note.When the grantor dies, only the fair market value of the note is included in the estate. This technique “freezes” the value of the assets in the estate.Another benefit of the IDGT is that the grantor pays the income tax on any income generated by the trust. “That effectively allows the trust assets to compound tax free and the payment of the trust’s tax by the grantor is not treated as a taxable gift,” says Mr Raaf, of Harris myCFO. Also, an IDGT can be used for very effective “GST” planning as the grantor can allocate his/her “GST” exemption to the trust.Mr Raaf says an instalment sale to a grantor trust “works exceptionally well” for closely held businesses that are taxed as partnerships and S corporations where both have high cash flows.When it comes to mitigating potential income taxes from the sale of a business, Daniel Lindley, president of The Northern Trust Company of Delaware, says one of the most popular strategies he sees is the Delaware Incomplete Non-Grantor Trust (DING).“The idea is that if you have clients who have an interest in a closely held business and foresee a liquidity event somewhere down the road, not just around the bend, they can establish a DING trust to receive some or all of their interest in their closely held business in anticipation of a sale,” says Mr Lindley. “This is a strategy for residents of high income tax states; it is not a transfer tax strategy, but one for avoiding a state income tax on a capital gain that might be realised through the sale of a business.”Devising a sound tax strategy is only one element of pre-transaction planning. It is equally important to formulate an investment strategy for putting the millions, or billions, to work.“When a liquidity event involves payment in cash, a highly illiquid asset – such as shares in a closely held business – is transformed overnight into the most liquid of assets,” says Amy Braden, head of the Family Wealth Center at JPMorgan Private Bank. “In investment terms, this is a massive portfolio rebalancing from a high risk/high return asset to a very low risk/low return asset.”John Hoffman, a managing director at Northern Trust and head of its wealth advisory practice, says business owners contemplating a sale need to be educated on diversifying into a broader portfolio.It is important to set up a “receptacle to catch the wealth”, such as a cash managed account, he says. The purpose is twofold: it allows the money immediately to begin earning interest and then acts as the funding entity for the business owner’s – or family’s – investment and philanthropic strategies.Another consideration before a liquidity event is the human dimension. Ms Braden says the sale of a family business “opens a Pandora’s box of emotions”.“The transition from being a powerful CEO to being a private investor is a change in identity and self-image that can take considerable adjustment,” she says. “As business owners struggle with redeploying their assets, they are also struggling with the deeper question of what’s next in their lives.”One often overlooked issue is personal safety. The publicity that often accompanies a big liquidity transaction can expose the family or entrepreneur to new risks.When straddling complex financial and personal matters, it is important to enlist the help of skilled professionals. “Make sure you have a strong adviser team surrounding you,” says Teri Lyders, executive director of private planning at UBS Wealth Management. “You don’t want someone to be practising on you.”Ms Lyders encourages clients who face a potential sale to think about a host of issues, including what he/she needs for financial independence, and how the sale, with its sudden influx of cash and change of lifestyle, will affect any children or other relatives.The success of a liquidity event – and thus the business owner’s next phase – rests on tackling these questions and devising solutions well in advance of a trans­action. As Mark Twain once said, “Plan for the future, because that is where you are going to spend the rest of your life.”"
150;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-12-04T21:29:41Z;BoNY in $17bn takeover of Mellon;;Bank of New York on Monday announced an agreed takeover of Mellon Financial for about $17bn, eight years after it made an abortive $24bn hostile bid for the Pittsburgh-based asset management and custody group.The deal between two of the oldest financial institutions in the US will create the world’s leading securities services company and could trigger further consolidation in the global custody industry.Tom Renyi, BoNY’s chief executive, said: “Other management teams will be coming together today and saying ‘what is our response?’ ”The combined group will have $16,600bn of assets under custody, overtaking JPMorgan Chase, which has $12,900bn. Other leading asset servicing companies include State Street, Citigroup, BNP Paribas and Northern Trust.“This transaction dramatically reduces the options for other players,” said one adviser to the deal. Scale is increasingly important in a fast-growing business in which technology spending is rising rapidly.Bob Kelly, recently appointed chief executive of Mellon, said: “There has been tremendous consolidation in the US market but Europe is just starting that and will go on for five years. Then we have Asia.”About 25 per cent of the combined group’s revenues will be outside the US and Mr Renyi said this would continue to grow faster than its domestic business.The deal is presented as a merger but BoNY will have the upper hand. It gets 10 board members against Mellon’s eight and BoNY shareholders will own 63 per cent of the new company. Mr Renyi will be executive chairman for 18 months after the deal closes and will then be replaced by Mr Kelly who will be chief executive until then.Shareholders in the two companies get stock in a new combined group in a ratio determined by the average share prices over the past year. Because Mellon’s shares have performed better, this ironically means they get a smaller effective premium over Friday’s close. BoNY shares were up 11.8 per cent at $39.67 in late New York trading while Mellon’s were 6.5 per cent higher at $42.66. Mellon has had a stock split since BoNY bid eight years ago, which was worth the equivalent of about $45 per share.Mr Renyi said the deal was “unbelievably” attractive financially with the companies forecasting $700m of cost savings, about 8.5 per cent of the expense base, with about 3,900 jobs to go out of 40,000. No revenue synergies have been assumed in the forecasts.Mergers in custody tend to result in some client losses and, while Mr Renyi said the aim was not to lose any, some attrition was built into financial projections. It was too soon to say what impact the merger would have on Mellon’s joint ventures with ABN Amro and CIBC, he said.Mr Renyi said the companies were highly complementary with BoNY stronger in securities servicing and Mellon bigger in asset management. Together they will be the 10th biggest asset manager globally with $1,011bn under management. Within asset servicing, Mellon is stronger with pension funds and endowments while BoNY has done better with mutual funds.David Hilder, analyst at Bear Stearns, said the merger was “very positive for both banks because it solves problems for both banks and creates a strong, more competitive player in asset servicing and asset management.”
151;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-10-12T17:14:38Z;Derivatives: Over-counter demand not yet matched by systems;;"The increasing use of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives has become the most noticeable trend in fund management of late and has not gone unnoticed by custodians. Any custodian with serious ambitions of being a success in the asset servicing business now has to consider having a viable and competitive derivatives capability to offer potential
clients.The post-trade environment of these complex trades is still dominated by manual processes but such is the volume of trades being performed by fund managers that some level of automation is needed.The situation is exacerbated by the fact that there is a paucity of skilled staff in this area so no firm can really afford to populate their dealing rooms with enough highly paid derivatives specialists.So clearly the demand is there; the only problem is that the solutions are not. “We are looking for systems that can offer us full, front-to-back straight-through-processing for credit derivatives. But it is difficult to find the solution because the vendors and the custodians are not ready,” says Jean-Louis Faucheux, head of Derivatives Operations Services at Luxembourg-based fund manager Fortis Investments.“We have to have an order management system and we have to have a portfolio management system – both of these we have had to develop in-house, which is very expensive, or else using Excel spreadsheets. Due to the complexity of the products, there is no real solution available for us.”There are some systems out there for the post-trade processes, most notably the multibank-owned Depository of Trust and Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) DerivServ, a matching and confirmations service for credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and equity derivatives.Originally developed for the sell-side, the DTCC is increasingly trying to cater for fund managers by enabling them to access relevant market data on a centrally held platform that can be accessed via the internet and also enabling fund managers to upload spreadsheets onto the platform.However, the technology is not the main barrier to entry says DerivServ general manager Janet Winn. “It is less about commoditisation or technology barriers and more about standardising the legal agreements.” Fortunately there has been some progress in that legal teams are now involving the operations teams earlier in the process so that when the legal terms of a derivative class are agreed on they can be quickly automated.But the likes of DerivSev only solve part of the problem and there is still a dearth of products available for independent valuations, collateral management, fund administration, portfolio management systems and risk management. Consequently fund managers have been left wondering where they can go for all of these services.As Stephen Andress, head of derivatives at Northern Trust, says: “There is a gap in the asset servicing space for a comprehensive OTC derivatives processing platform or outsourcing service. There is room for one provider to be a leader.”Custodians have been busy buying up derivatives expertise where possible in order to fill this gap and round off their service offerings and as the competition heats up among the asset servicing providers, those custodians that are part of a full-service banking group may feel they have an advantage over their competitors.“Our advantage is that we have a lot of derivatives capability in-house through the investment banking division,” says Jervis Smith, managing director, Citigroup Securities Services. And while he says that many of the systems originally developed within or for the investment banks are adaptable for the buy-side, he is also aware that such a process takes time and money and until there is a clear and sizeable demand for these services, no-one is going to develop products specifically for fund managers.Ian Dando, consultant at Investit, a consultancy for the investment management industry, agrees that it is not simply a case of transposing the sell-side platforms for the buy-side. “For a start, there is a different fund accounting process where fund managers require constant revaluations and there are fundamental differences in the front office as well.”Mr Dando says that the likes of Citigroup will have to understand that there are different requirements for fund managers and there will have to be more of a link between the investment banking and asset servicing arms of these organisations if they are to be successful providers in this space.“The lack of understanding of derivatives from the asset services providers and the lack of understanding of fund administration from the investment banks has created a frustration for fund managers, says Mr Dando. “They feel it has taken too long for these services to be set up.”Ultimately patience will play a part in the future development of the OTC derivatives market.As Mr Andress of Northern Trust points out, it was only a few years ago that credit default swaps were considered exotic and now they are far more commonplace and automated as a result.This natural lifecycle will inevitably apply to other instruments and while both custodians and asset services wait for nature to take its course, those that choose to expedite matters through an outsourcing arrangement will have to ensure that they retain the level of realism and discipline that the industry is purported to have picked up from past experience."
152;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-10-12T17:14:37Z;Administrative process: More asset managers see wisdom of letting providers take the strain;;"The good news for providers of asset services is that interest in outsourcing at least some of their non-core activities is increasing amongst asset managers.According to Martyn Hart, chairman of the UK’s National Outsourcing Association, instititutions that have already experimented with outsourcing are increasing the extent of their outsourcing, while those who previously turned their backs on it have come to realise that their insistence on doing it all themselves has put them at something of a competitive disadvantage. “Their back office costs will be significantly higher, especially for smaller funds,” says Mr Hart.Cost is only one of a number of primary driving forces behind any decision to outsource. The transference of operational risk is one benefit noted by Sebastien Danloy, global head of sales for investor services at Société Générale Securities Services. Simply being able to do business is higher up the list of priorities.“Outsourcing will continue to increase because of the diversification of trading strategies by fund managers. With hedge funds, private equity, real estate, OTC products, swaps and more complex derivatives moving into the mainstream, it is becoming more and more difficult for the back office to cope with what’s happening in the front office,” says Mr Danloy.Transformational events are likely to be the main driver in the future, adds Peter Holman, global head of investment outsourcing operations at Northern Trust.At its purest, everything that is not a core competence is a candidate for outsourcing, say fans of the concept.Charlie Helmstetter, head of product specialists at Mellon, offers a tip or two to fund managers thinking of taking the plunge. “You need to identify what it is that is your unique
selling point as a fund manager, hang on to that, but outsource the purely administrative processes.”There is no single right answer, however, he adds. “Different fund managers will want different identities. Some will want to retain strong direct contact with clients to define themselves by their high-touch levels and unique approaches, others will want to differentiate themselves by performance and delivery.”The trend towards outsourcing operations further up the investment chain than has traditionally been the case is illustrated by the recent agreement between Citigroup and Aegon, to outsource Aegon’s middle and back office operations in the Netherlands, says Tom Abraham, managing director at Citigroup Global Transaction Services.The two are working together to build an investment platform designed to give asset managers and institutional investors more flexibility, enabling them to respond quickly to market developments.“They are looking to move into areas like portable alpha; we are providing the basic tools, technology and expertise to enable them to do that,” says Mr Abraham.The platform will also seek to give managers the tools to roll out similar strategies to a range of investor classes.“Historically there have been constraints on that, not just technical but also tax and regulatory ones,” says Mr Abraham. Managers would have to assemble the necessary expertise to address these issues themselves at present. “We give them a head start, and should make it cheaper,” he says.In a paper published earlier this year, PwC identified six stages in the outsourcing process in the fund management world. Stage one concerns strategy. Outsourcing is not an end in itself, it is a means of supporting a firm’s strategic plan. Stage two involves a feasibility study. Stage three is about the transaction, finding the right partner and setting the right price. Stage four is the transition, in which new roles must be assumed as the fund manager needs to start behaving as a customer and manage and channel communications accordingly. Stage five brings optimisation and transformation. Stage six is about termination or renegotiation. In a separate paper, based on a survey of 81 investment management organisations around the world, representing aggregate assets under management of $9,000bn, PwC states that outsourcing and offshoring is on the increase in spite of mixed experiences in the quality of service offered by suppliers.What happens when theory is translated into practice? Ron Carlson, chief operating officer at NewSmith Capital Partners, says: “As a young and growing asset management firm, we have to deliver high-quality institutional services to clients. When you’re relatively small, it’s more efficient to select third party service providers, and buy in best practice so that you can operate in a robust, controlled way.”But while service providers are increasingly carving out new competitive niches, offering competitive, efficient high-quality services in narrower areas, key tasks such as reconciliation and fund accounting are also conducted in-house as a double check on the work done by the outsourced administrators, he adds.Richard Cardiff, co-founder and chief executive of Coupland Cardiff Asset Management, agrees that not to double-check and monitor would be irresponsible.“You can outsource functions, but not responsibility,” he says."
153;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-10-12T17:14:37Z;Niche banks: Being small is no handicap, say the specialist providers;;"While the term “second tier” is an unacceptable one to apply to a custody bank, carrying connotations of second rate, the smaller players in the industry are happy to be branded as niche or specialist providers.Size, isn’t everything, say the modestly sized institutions. In fact, gigantism brings its own problems, they argue, as the US-based monolithic leviathans built in the long 1990s bull market might have conceded when wrestling with the integration challenges presented by the bear market of the early 2000s and the acquisition-driven growth of the previous years.“It’s not necessarily a scale issue,” says Penelope Biggs, head of global business development at Northern Trust. “You could be the biggest bank in the world and still only service one or two niches. We don’t consider ourselves a niche player, but we do concentrate on high end asset servicing for specific client types in specific target markets (pension funds and fund managers). We prefer to be ‘focused’ in that way – rather than trying to be all things to all people.”The beauty of being small is often reflected in the industry’s favourite league tables, compiled variously by R&M, and by Global Investor and Global Custodian magazines. Niche providers always top the tables, and are clear about the
reason why.“These surveys are scored by clients, who are being serviced by a number of providers, and clearly feel they are being better looked after by the niche providers,” says Rob Wright, chief operating officer at RBC Dexia Investor Services. “If we were as big as the Goliaths, we may not score as well as we do.”The Goliaths might try to be all things to all men, but viewed through this prism the impression they give is being jacks of all trades, and masters of none.The secret, it seems, is focus. “We are focussed on being very good at what we do globally in our niche in fund administration,” says Mr Wright.“The bigger we grow, the harder it becomes to score well, and that holds true for all players,” says Tony Solway, head of BNP Paribas Securities Services in the UK. “There is no question that if, for instance, you only have two clients, you can be incredibly focused, whereas if you have 30 it is much more difficult, but clients do then enjoy the benefits of scale, as well as quality. To be perfectly honest, though, when it comes to surveys, everybody does their very best to be well positioned.”Or, as some objective, cynical observers might say, everybody cheats. For a niche provider it is much easier to contact clients and groom them, subtly or none-too-subtly, through the questionnaires. “Niche players do tend to at least give the impression that their client relationships are well-
handled and proactive,” observes one large, undisputed global provider. Consultants and clients should bear in mind the power of spin the next time a set of league tables appears, the comment implies.In the meantime, the challenge for consultants advising investors is to match providers and clients in the most appropriate way, argues Mr Solway. “We all have different characters, and a good marriage of client needs with provider capability and character is necessary to establish the right solution for each
client. Clients need to find the right partner to match their business profile, and a niche provider might be exactly what they want. There will always be clients who want small specialist providers, and larger players who want a global, industrial scale provider.”Stripped to fundamentals, it is a question of “right sizing”, Mr Solway says. “If you are a small local player, you don’t necessarily want to be in the arms of a huge global provider, where you account for a tiny percentage of its revenues and use only a tiny percentage of its services. You’d be better off with a partner for whom you’ll be a significant but not overwhelming client and a good match of service provision.“A hedge fund domiciled in Dublin would be well advised to team up with a specialist in hedge funds domiciled in Dublin! For a global investor it makes sense to have a single supplier, with a single contact point, to work with you globally.”"
154;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-10-09T21:18:39Z;Chasing high returns can be a taxing business;;Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the man who put index funds on the map, believes that investors who pay tax should not put any money into hedge funds.Mr Bogle says that the funds are probably the most tax-inefficient investment around – a fact that tends to be lost in the talk of their returns.Ken Stemme, the director of hedge fund investments at Northern Trust, says: “Most hedge funds are not tax friendly, and there’s no logical answer for why not.“It’s odd that high net worth investors were the foundation of the industry, and yet the managers never developed any sensitivity to taxes. Also, [the managers] have a lot of their own money in their funds, and they still don’t think about the taxes much.”Essentially, any return an investor makes through a hedge fund is subject to full ordinary income tax, or short-term capital gains tax (which is the same rate as income tax). That means a hefty 42 per cent tax for residents of New York and California.By contrast, equities held for a year or more are subject to long-term capital gains tax of only 15 per cent. Most investment options available do have some kind of tax break as part of the government plan to try to encourage savings.But hedge funds seem oblivious to the problems. A common complaint from investors is that the funds even tend to compound the problems, and further irritate their clients, by being extremely tardy in providing them with the very complicated documentation they need for tax returns.Michael Cembalest, chief investment officer at JPMorgan Private Bank, says: “The majority of money in hedge funds is now invested by people who don’t pay tax – endowments, foundations, pensions and individuals whose money is offshore. So over the past decade the people managing the money have not had to worry about tax.”He says an 8 per cent annual return from a hedge fund looks better than the 5 per cent return you get from an agency bond (such as Fannie Mae). But once you take tax into account, the picture changes radically.The 8 per cent hedge fund return is reduced to 4.65 per cent after tax – barely above the 4 per cent return that municipal bonds offer.“In the late 1990s the returns were so high that people didn’t care about the tax even if they had to pay it,” says Mr Cembalest, who recently completed a study on which hedge funds were most or least tax-efficient.“But since June 2003 there has been a resurgence in the stock markets, bonds and commodities, and hedge fund returns don’t look as good any more.”The returns published by hedge funds are pre-tax, and investors do not know what their after-tax returns will be until they get the statements from the hedge fund outlining their tax obligations.However, Mr Cembalest says not all hedge funds are equal for tax purposes. He recently trawled through their tax bills for the past two decades to see which strategies had the greatest tax benefits.“Not every penny that hedge funds earn is subject to capital gains,” he says. “Typically investors end up paying 30 to 32 per cent tax on their earnings, a lot less than the full rate.”For example, only about 40 per cent of returns from long/short funds are taxable at the top rate, he says. Distress funds had only about 60 per cent of their income taxed at the top rate.The least tax-efficient were macro funds, all of whose income was taxed either as ordinary income or short-term capital gains.As a general rule, Mr Cembalest recommends to his clients that, if they are taxed in the US, they invest 20 to 40 per cent less in hedge funds than if they were in an offshore (ie tax-free) domicile.“We recommend that clients have about 25 per cent of their money invested in alternatives, which includes private equity and real estate. So that means an offshore client would have about 8 to 11 per cent of their money in hedge funds, as opposed to an onshore client having 6 to 7 per cent,” Mr Cembalest says.Mr Stemme says the two most tax-friendly hedge fund strategies – long equity and distress investing – are also the two most strongly correlated to the equity markets.Since many investors choose to put money into hedge funds in order to get diversification from the equity markets, this is a disadvantage.But he points out that considerations other than tax play a part in portfolio planning. “You have to look at the positive impact of diversification.”Mr Cembalest says: “The whole point of hedge funds is to operate in fast-moving markets. They are supposed to be aggressively buying and selling. They can’t be worrying about tax efficiency all the time.”Asking the funds to change their investing strategies to take tax into acc­ount would defeat the purpose of the funds.He says taxable clients have to be willing to invest in slightly riskier funds and strategies to get the higher returns to offset the tax bill.“Diversified hedge funds make a lot less sense for taxable clients,” he says.
155;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-06-19T18:34:25Z;Inexorable rise of the EquiLend platform;;On a warm early summer evening in 2001, Goldman Sachs hosted a lavish party at the Villa Medici, set high in the hills above Rome.Some of the biggest participants in the $1,000bn global securities lending business were in attendance. Huddled on one of the villa’s many balconies, executives could be overheard speaking about something called Hubco.It has turned out that Hubco was the working name for a company now known as EquiLend, an industry-owned platform for electronic securities lending and borrowing. Since its 2002 launch, EquiLend has grown so explosively that it now facilitates $20bn of securities lending and borrowing trades in a single day.Though little understood, securities lending has become an important tool for large institutional money managers and pension funds to improve returns, and they have a willing borrowing market in the form of investment banks and hedge funds.A measure of the growth is that on a typical day during its first year in operation, EquiLend would process 3,600 transactions, representing securities valued at $2.2bn. Growth has not slackened.Brian Lamb, chief executive of EquiLend, says that since this time last year alone, the client base has increased 70 per cent.“That increase in clients has resulted in daily values of all trades executed through the platform growing 67 per cent since the same period last year,” he says. “In fixed income alone, the numbers have increased 80 per cent.”Talk at the three-day conference, the end of which was marked by the Goldman party, focused on the pressing need for automation of the securities lending and borrowing business (known collectively as securities financing), which had been a slower adopter of technology than many other areas.As a result, a range of software and so-called electronic solutions providers went to Rome in 2001 touting their wares and seeking to make quick money.Senior figures from some of the largest broker dealers and custodian banks in the business decided this was not to be tolerated. Rather than line the pockets of opportunists, they agreed, they needed to club together to form their own electronic platform, having agreed that automation was unavoidable in the long run.That turned into EquiLend, unveiled as an industry-owned platform soon after the conference.It was set up by 10 of the largest companies involved in the securities financing business, lenders and borrowers. They invested $4m for the pleasure of being at the top table.The founding companies were Barclays Global Investors, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Northern Trust, State Street and UBS.Credit Suisse and Nomura have since invested. Barclays Capital, ABN Amro, Mellon and Société Générale have come on board as new clients.“There are a number of reasons why a firm would want to use EquiLend,” said Eugene Picone, EquiLend’s chairman and also a senior vice-president at JPMorgan. “From our perspective, we see the value in the overall economies of scale that we have been able to extract from the system. In the past year we have increased balances by over 100 per cent and enjoyed a 20 per cent improvement in our cost-efficiency ratio.”Earlier this year the securities lending conference returned to Rome, with EquiLend’s place at the heart of the securities financing business looking assured.Securities financing plays a vital role. The basic securities lending transaction involves the temporary transfer of a security by its owner to another investor or intermediary. Once the securities have settled, the title and voting rights are transferred to the borrower, who can sell or re-lend the borrowed securities during the life of the loan. The borrower agrees to return the loaned securities, secure the loan with collateral of equal or greater value than the loaned securities, pay user fees, and remit to the lender dividends, coupon interest or other distributions that occur during the time the securities are on loan.Borrowers tend to be investment banks, broker-dealers, intermediaries and, increasingly, hedge funds.Lenders, with equities or fixed income securities available for loan, will commonly participate in one of two ways, either directly or indirectly through an agent.Large institutional investors such as pension plans, insurance and life companies are the most willing to lend. It is a simple and safe way to bolster returns they are generating from assets held for the long term.Many pension funds, particularly in Europe, had resisted securities lending, due primarily to a lack of understanding, but that seems to be changing. The big global custodian banks such as State Street and Northern Trust are now more proactive with their clients’ money and are persuading more to take part.
156;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2006-04-19T16:50:53Z;Market Insight: Making sense of the Fed;;The stock market’s relationship with the Federal Reserve is never simple. Events in the past month, however, suggest that traders are finding the Fed harder than ever to read.In March, the Federal Reserve’s open markets committee raised the Federal Funds rate from 4.50 per cent to 4.75 per cent, as widely expected, and left unchanged the language on monetary policy in its official statement.Stock traders had expected some softening of the language. The instant reaction was that the Fed had signalled a strong possibility that it would raise rates beyond 5 per cent, and a sell-off ensued. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9 per cent in the aftermath, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6 per cent.After the statutory three-week gap, the Fed published the minutes of that meeting on Tuesday. This included much evidence that the Fed governors had not intended to send such a signal. The key phrase, for many in the market, was: “Most members thought that the end of the tightening process was likely to be near.” The minutes revealed that some members had “expressed concern” that retaining the same language on future tightening “could be misconstrued as suggesting that the Committee thought that several further tightening steps were likely to be necessary”.The result was the strongest day of the year for stocks. The Dow gained 194 points on Tuesday, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which is highly sensitive to interest rates, gained 2.7 per cent, its best day in five years.Financial services had the strongest gains. Northern Trust, State Street and Merrill Lynch all gaining more than five per cent. Was this reaction justified?“Tuesday’s euphoria by the markets shows how much traders want to receive guidance,” said Axel Merk, manager of the Merk Hard Currency FundSome investors faulted the Fed for sending unclear signals. Others blamed the market.David Greenlaw, of Morgan Stanley, said: “The minutes from the March meeting reinforced our sense that the market has been misreading the Fed’s intentions since the release of the official statement.” The markets interpreted the unchanged wording of the statement issued after the meeting as “virtually guaranteeing further rate hikes”, he said.He added: “In our view, the FOMC felt that the language originally adopted in January provided a significant degree of flexibility and they were merely repeating the message in order to avoid a whip-saw. The minutes clarified that there was some debate about this issue at the meeting.”Both the Fed and the market face two problems. One is that the Fed has a new head in Ben Bernanke, who, through no fault of his own, does not yet have the accumulated credibility of his predecessor Alan Greenspan, who served for 18 years.Second, it would be a time of uncertainty regarding monetary policy even if Mr Greenspan were still in office. The current cycle of rising interest rates is nearing its close, but there is room for uncertainty about when it should end and also about how quickly rates should start coming down.Add to these factors the fact that the stock market is awaiting a catalyst from lower interest rates to move forward, after remaining flat last year, and the conditions are created for stocks to over-react to any new piece of information about the Fed’s intentions.Significantly, the bond market treated the minutes as a much less important event, with 10-year bond yields barely moving on Tuesday afternoon. However, after the release yesterday of core inflation numbers, 10-year yields rose more than 4 basis points – higher than the opening on Tuesday – while the stock markets were unaffected.This created concern that the stock market had swung too far towards optimism. “Equal weight should be given to the fact that ‘some’ participants were ‘particularly vigilant about upside risks to inflation’,” said Michelle Girard, analyst at RBS Greenwich Capital. “While we look for the Fed to pause in June, we expect continued above-trend growth and inflation concerns will lead to further tightening (to 5.5 per cent) in the second half of the year.”
157;NTRS;Northern Trust Corp;2004-11-17T03:37:39Z;Philadelphia exchange to boost product range;;"The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the oldest US stock market, will on Wednesday unveil plans to launch a new index that tracks the performance of all US exchange-listed companies involved in the global capital markets.The KBW Capital Markets Index, produced by Keefe, Bruyette Woods, a US investment bank specialising in financial services companies, is designed to replicate the stock performance of such companies.It reflects the continuing appetite among investors for indices that reflect sector performance and will include 24 companies, accounting for about half of the market capitalisation of all US-listed capital market-related companies.They include Bank of New York, Janus Capital, Morgan Stanley, Legg Mason, Merrill Lynch and Northern Trust.The Philadelphia exchange, which is also the fourth largest equity options market, also plans to launch options on the index.Tom Michaud, KBW chief operating officer, said: “These options will permit traders or institutional money managers to hedge their cash market exposure and anticipate and respond to fundamental shifts in the financial services industry.”The development comes as the Philadelphia exchange prepares to boost activity on its largely inactive futures operation after an agreement reached this summer with Susquehanna, a large US derivatives market-making firm.Dan Carrigan, the exchange’s vice president of new product development, said the new index would be “a valuable tool in an era when volatility has been declining”.The two sides were jointly developing around 200 new futures products, he said.“The main driver is on the Susquehanna side; we’re doing the fine-tuning. We have an endless list of ideas for futures contracts so we will be aggressive throughout next year announcing products that have not been seen in the industry before,” he told the Financial Times.The Philadelphia’s exchange’s effort to boost futures trading reflects the pressure that derivatives and securities exchanges face to provide large institutional traders, including hedge funds, with a range of equities, options and futures products under one roof.That reflects a blurring of the traditional distinctions between such assets, largely caused by electronic trading, which allows trading of such instruments to be done on computer screens simultaneously, more quickly and at less cost than “open outcry” trading in pits.Mr Carrigan said: “Products are converging on the screen so you can trade the same asset in three ways, whether as a future, option or cash instrument.”The Philadelphia exchange, which was founded in 1790, is also making the move because it is losing market share in its options business. The exchange trades 2,000 stocks, 1,500 equity options, 18 sector index options, currency options and futures.Yet while the volume of equity options for October rose by 30 per cent compared with September, its market share in all US options trading has fallen to about 10 per cent from 14 per cent in January.That is because the two US options exchanges offering all-electronic trading are stealing market share from Philadelphia which, like some of its rivals, offers both open outcry and electronic trading.However Mr Carrigan said Philadelphia plans to switch to electronic trading of futures in the second quarter of next year. “This [the initiatives] is a major undertaking by the exchange,” he said."
