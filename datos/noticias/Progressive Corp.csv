0;PGR;Progressive Corp;2020-01-25T02:34:53Z;Couple plead guilty to swindling Berkshire Hathaway;Victims of $1bn Ponzi scheme included veteran investor Warren Buffett’s company;A California couple pleaded guilty on Friday in connection with a Ponzi scheme that swindled almost $1bn from American blue-chip companies including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and the insurance provider Progressive.Jeff Carpoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in a California federal court, while his wife Paulette admitted to charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit an offence against the US.The couple owned DC Solar, a California-based manufacturer of mobile solar power generators that were used at outdoor concerts, sporting events and on construction sites. DC Solar sold those generators in packages to investment funds, which passed lucrative alternative energy tax credits on to outside investors including Berkshire, Progressive and the independent bank East West Bancorp.The investors collectively paid more than $912m to the funds and DC Solar for a stake in the generators.But the authorities allege that DC Solar only constructed a portion of the 17,000 generators — worth a purported $2.5bn — it claimed to have manufactured. DC Solar instead used the capital it raised to pay off earlier investors, US attorney McGregor Scott charged. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last year.“This billion-dollar Ponzi scheme hurt investors and took money from the United States Treasury,” Mr Scott said on Friday. “Today’s guilty pleas send a strong message that fraudsters will get caught and will pay for their crimes. You can run, but you cannot hide.”Berkshire disclosed last year that it had invested $340m in the vehicles, known as tax equity investment funds. Progressive last year wrote down its investment and increased its income tax provisions to reverse the tax credits it had previously claimed.Mr and Mrs Carpoff siphoned off at least $140m to purchase almost 150 luxury and sports cars, real estate in Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas, a Nascar race sponsorship and for a performance by the musician Pitbull at a DC Solar holiday party, according to court filings and US securities regulators.“Jeff Carpoff pled guilty today in an early attempt to resolve the case as expeditiously as possible and to continue his efforts to make amends by making restitution to the investors,” Malcolm Segal, an attorney for Mr Carpoff, told the Financial Times. “He is terribly sorry for what he did and hopes this is the beginning of a new start.”Mr Segal said that the couple had so far forfeited more than $100m and was working with the government to recover additional assets for the defrauded investors. An auction of the Carpoffs’ vehicles, which included a 1978 Pontiac Trans Am once owned by Burt Reynolds, raised more than $8m.Bill Portanova, an attorney for Mrs Carpoff, said: “Paulette Carpoff has undergone tremendous changes these last few years. The business that they thought was going to be good for everyone morphed into something that everyone knew was wrong and now she is dealing with the consequences.”Four other people have been charged and pleaded guilty for their roles in connection to the Ponzi scheme. Mr and Mrs Carpoff will be sentenced in May and face maximum prison terms of 30 and 15 years, respectively.Berkshire Hathaway, East West Bancorp and Progressive did not respond to requests for comment.
1;PGR;Progressive Corp;2011-07-11T21:00:00Z;US stocks drop ahead of earnings;;US stocks dropped sharply, hitting their lowest level since mid-June as investors looked to the kick-off of the corporate earnings season for direction amid forecasts of slim profit growth.Stocks slid as investors worried that Europe’s debt crisis was spilling over into the larger economies of Italy and Spain.But shares traded off session lows after Barack Obama, US president, promised he would meet with Congress until the debt debate is over, after a fruitless weekend meeting where Democrats repeated the need for a “balanced” approach, while Republicans insisted that tax increases would further damage an already hurting economy.“People need to get a clear picture of the earnings and the big picture with the debt and the European issues still hanging”, says Myke Boyle, Senior Vice President of Asset Management at AAM.News Corpwas among the top losers, amid the continuing phone-hacking furore. The media group’s shares fell 7.1 per cent to $16.10 as its takeover of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB has come into doubt. The stock is down more than 12 per cent since last week and has turned negative for the year, as Rupert Murdoch’s media empire faces one of the biggest threats of its 20-year life.The benchmark S&P 500 was down 1.81 per cent at 1,319.49 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.03 per cent lower at 2,801.72. All key S&P sectors were lower, with five main groups down 2 per cent or more. Financials led declines down 2.3 per cent, including Bank of Americafalling 3.08 per cent to $10.37. Energy and materials followed financials, both lower by 2 per cent, including Chevronthat fell 1.41 per cent at $104.4.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped above 19. Yet despite the downturn, all major averages are still trading higher for July.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.2 per cent to 12,501.98, with all 30 members in negative territory, led by Hewlett-Packard, down 3.2 per cent at $35.25. Ahead of upcoming earnings results this week, JPMorgan Chase was down 3.1 cent to $39.45, and Alcoa, the largest US aluminium producer, down 2.8 per cent to $15.93 following an almost 4 per cent drop on Friday.The Dow Jones Transportation average was down 2.1 per cent, and has dropped 3.3 per cent from its record closing high last week.NYSE Euronext shares fell 5 per cent to $34.44 as the the euro slipped sharply. NYSE Euronext investors voted last week to approve a merger with Deutsche Börse, whose own shareholders vote this week. The value of the all-share swap fluctuates with currency moves, since the Börse’s shares are denominated in euros.With much hope still riding on the second-quarter earnings season, Alcoa saw a jump in earnings, due partly to the high price of aluminum, becoming the first Dow member to release results after the closing bell.Analysts estimated that US companies will average 13 per cent earnings growth for the quarter, the lowest increase in two years.Eleven other companies on the S&P 500, including Google, will announce earnings this week.However, much of this week’s news will come from the financial sector, one of the market’s softest. JPMorgan Chase, Capital Oneand Progressive are due to release their reports on Thursday while Citigroup will do so on Friday.“Every time we get into earnings season there is always the feeling there will be a bad one. So some might now want to take a little bit of time take some money off the table”, adds Mr Boyle.The focus on earnings has grown, especially after highly disappointing employment numbers released on Friday crushed hopes that the “soft patch” in the US economy was coming to an end, reigniting fears of a slowdown.David Bianco, head of US equity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: “We continue to believe that the S&P 500 trades at a substantial discount to its fair intrinsic value owing to investors’ concern over tail risks.”But investors seem to be even more focused on this week’s expected reports on retail sales, jobless claims and inflation, as they attempt to gain a clear picture of the economy.“Thus, despite disappointing job gains in June, we believe the market’s near-term and full year performance will be primarily driven by either the eruption or fading of tail risks.”
2;PGR;Progressive Corp;2009-07-10T20:22:59Z;Earnings fears weigh on Wall Street;;US stocks looked closed the week at levels not seen since the beginning of May as a month of losses took its toll.Energy companies have dominated trade throughout the week as the price of oil crashed through the $60 mark, down 10 per cent since last week and more than 16 per cent from its recent highs.This proved a drag on energy stocks, which once again led the selling on Friday after Chevron said its second-quarter earnings might fall short of estimates. The company said a weak dollar counteracted the effect of the oil price rise during the quarter, and its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $61.40. Other energy producers were also hit. Exxon-Mobil dropped 1.3 per cent to $65.12 and ConocoPhillips lost 1.5 per cent to $39.72.The benchmark S&P 500 index finished the session down 0.4 per cent at 879.13, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 8,146.52. But the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.2 per cent on strength in technology stocks to 1,756.03.That left all three down between 1.6 and 2.3 per cent for the week, the fourth straight decline.Investors continued to worry about the state of the US consumer, with low domestic demand contributing to falling retail sales numbers on Wednesday and a narrower-than-expected trade gap on Friday. A lower consumer confidence number suggested that the trend was likely to continue at least for the near term.The lack of demand for US goods also spurred talk of a possible second stimulus plan during the week, as politicians and political advisers gave conflicting messages over whether one was likely to be passed.Investors were split between those who saw such talk as a bearish sign on the economy and those who believed its eventual implementation would provide a boost for equities.But even as earnings season kicked off with a better-than-expected number from Alcoa, caution reigned and the markets continued to slide. “It’s almost a case of earnings versus the economy,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.Banks enjoyed a positive session on Thursday, but lost ground on Friday morning as reports said several Wall Street firms are complaining the government is demanding too high a price for the warrants they hold as part of the financial bail-out earlier this year.The Wall Street Journal said JPMorgan has waived its right to buy back the warrants and will let them be sold on the open market instead.JPMorgan’s shares lost 3.8 per cent to $32.34, while Citigroup fell 3.7 per cent to $2.59 and Bank of America declined 0.8 per cent to $11.88. Elsewhere in the financial sector, shares in Progressive, the car insurer, fell 0.8 per cent to $14.32 as it reported a smaller quarterly profit than expected, even though revenues rose on stronger policy sales and better performing investments.Meanwhile CIT Group, the commercial lender, plunged 17.7 per cent to $1.53 after Bloomberg reported the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is unwilling to guarantee its debt.In the technology sector, Yahoo gained 2.6 per cent to $14.93 after an analyst at broker Thomas Weisel upgraded the search engine company’s shares on growing confidence in its new management structure.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs downgraded shares in IBM, saying the stock’s recent outperformance of the rest of the sector would not continue in spite of an upturn in demand. IBM lost 1.2 per cent to $100.83.
3;PGR;Progressive Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
